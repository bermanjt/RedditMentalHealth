4,"hello! i’ve been driving for around 4 years but i’m a rather anxious person. i’ve been on the highway quite a few times, but not for very long. occasionally i will make a mistake such as changing lanes too quickly or slowing down a bit too much, but have never been in any sort of accident. 

i’m driving around 50 miles on a highway i’ve never been on alone in a couple days. it’s causing a lot of anxiety, mostly because i get nervous merging and changing lanes; does anyone have advice on how i can chill out? i learned a while ago that when i’m calm, i’m a MUCH better driver. 

thanks so much!!",02Aug2020,1
5,"So I’ve been seeing this girl on and off for 4 years it’s always her flirting and doing stuff first. But why is it when I catch feelings for her and then we’re a thing  she tends to always be seeking to be with someone else? Then we break up , and she instantly starts seeing someone else argument words are exchanged. Now it’s been months apart and she shows up out of no where and does the same thing? Am I just a rebound to her ? She’s cried and told me everything there is about her and I’ll always love her for that but Am I the problem ? I never make situations with friends sketchy always honest. I never insult her even when were breaking up I just say why a lot and point out the whys. I dont know .... I really wish she knew how much this affects my life in all Categories not just dating . She’s done this maybe about 10 times over the passed 4 years and I won’t even count when we met and the second time. It’s not like I’m crying holding on guys I do move on but then out of no where she sends me messages and I don’t know I’m just so intrigued by this girl I always choose her over who I’m with /: we recently broke up away about 2 months ago and this time it’s eating me up.",02Aug2020,1

7,"I’m a dancer and I really want to start working out and stretching outside of dance because it really improves me, but I don’t know why I can’t. Or I feel like I can’t. For about 1-2 weeks I was working out every day and I felt amazing, and I liked the way that I looked and my dancing was better. But then I went away for the weekend and stopped as I hadn’t brung any of my equipment. 

Now, every single time I can’t. I try to wake up in the morning, and my body immediately goes back to bed. I try to workout but this is what happens:
1. My mind starts telling my to stop, every bone in my body is telling me to *stop*.
2. I try to continue, but I feel a lot worse.
3. I start to hurt, not in the “wow I’m using my muscles” way, but in a “I’m feeling a really sharp pain as if I pulled something” way.
4. I start to get discouraged and stop.
5. I cry and start to eat my feelings away.

I want to stop this cycle but I don’t know how. Every time I want to start again, I somehow hurt myself. Like first, in dance I pulled both of my hip muscles really badly, to the point where I had to stay in bed because it hurt so bad to walk. Once that healed, I was ready again. Then, two days ago I slipped and banged my knee on concrete, so once again I can barely walk because the pain is unbearable. I felt better yesterday so my family went to the beach and I got stung by a jellyfish. I just can’t win. I don’t know what to do. It feels like my body is trying to hurt me so that I don’t have to workout...but I don’t know. Please help.",02Aug2020,1

10,"In highschool I concepted a story that I, now in college, am still working on. At the time I also worked on it with my girlfriend (now ex), who contributed ideas/advice and two major characters. However, over the course of our relationship she abused me, and about a year ago I cut her off permanently. At the time she asked what would happen to the project, and I agreed that I would take what I made and she can take what she made.

I only recently found the will to start working on this project again, and making it my own has been a lot of fun! It's my baby, and I've really been developing it and maturing it, GENUINELY making it my own. I eliminated the two characters she contributed and am working on filling those gaps with my own personal ideas. However, I struggle with the ethics of taking what was once a collaborative project and making it my own. I can help but FEEL I'm stealing, even though I don't think I am. I don't believe I'm infringing on intellectual property, as the project has transformed a lot and I was careful to remove her ideas from the get-go, but I fear her coming back into my life and claiming she has a right to the story.

My current partner believes that she lost the right to the project when she traumatized me, which I do agree with, but I'm also a bit of a doormat. While I haven't talked to her in over a year, I've considered the idea of messaging her and saying 'by the way, this project is mine now' but it feels mean. I also think it would be really distressing to talk to her. Any advice or thoughts would be really really appreciated.",02Aug2020,1
11,"This is and will always be the most darkest moment in my entire life. Please don't comment if you have something hurtful to say because this took so much of me to post. It hurts to even speak on this but here it goes. I am currently 27 years old admittedly extremely depressed and feeling done completely wrong. Growing up as a teenager I was never really a confident person, I was always scared to talk to girls and I didn't really have an identity. To make things short I eventually found my identity and my self worth as I got to my late teens and I very much became full of myself. I was pretty popular during my high school years and I made a lot of friends and my name was very common around my town. Eventually I started dating girls and I had a few long term relationships but in between these relationship breakups admittedly I hooked up with more women then I'm proud of. As a more mature minded person now I can look back and admit I wasn't the best person I could have been, I was for the most part respectful to women but I had no issue sleeping with women several times knowing they had a crush on me and then basically I would shut them down and tell them I'm not interested. I particularly remember moments where girls were very hurt over me just not wanting to persue a relationship and a few asking if we could still just have sex. I never once in my life ever been told though that I was being pushy or in ANY way over the top. I always made sure that a women wanted to sleep with me. I didn't have an reason or motive to force a girl to do something sexual and that's not me trying to brag in any way.. I'm just trying to emphasize that I had no reason to try to force a girl into anything sexual. I enjoyed sex A LOT and I had some really shameful moments of too much casual sex. Looking back I really think I should have took my time and not thrown my body around to just any women. These are really big regrets in my life. Fast forward to when I'm 22 random people I knew in my life were randomly unfollowing me and just weird little red flags started happening. A few days later I get messages from my friends saying that a girl is posting on FB that I assaulted her and that I'm a transphobe(for no reason) and people should stay away from me. I was shocked.. I was sick to my stomach. I kept getting message after message saying that tons of people are talking about it on facebook and that people are dropping my house address and I should be careful. I was too scared to even look at the post because naturally I am very bad with confrontation and I was extremely embarrassed and just in a horrible head space. I basically went on with my life with my head down and kept hearing little things being spread about me that were not true at all. I wanted it to all go away without any effort on my part and I slowly started to reflect on the fact that I put myself in a lot of bad situations and I should have never slept around so much. Eventually she stopped talking about me on FB and then I was slightly relieved and I just continued to try to defend my name to my friends and they believed me and said I'd never do that. Fast forward I get a call from the police that a girl is claiming I assaulted her and I need to come down to the police station. That same week some girl I have never met posted a facebook post saying to stay away from me and I assaulted 12 girls. I couldn't even FATHOM how that could be true in ANY way. I was so confused and upset and I started to question every sexual interaction I EVER had. The only two moments in my life where I could EVER question myself is when I had drunk sex with 2 girls at parties. Those girls pursued ME just as much as I pursued them but I don't have a shadow of doubt in those moments. It was mutual fun and I even talked to both of them the next day and we flirted and everything felt very 50/50. I end up going through interrogation at the police station and I just remained silent. We end up going through the court process and lots of stressful moments with my family over lawyer money and sadness and confusion etc. Everyone was silent on social media during all of this. The accuser told the judge that I basically got her drunk and at one point choked her and that she was too drunk to be around me and I ended up groping her in a bed twice which just sounds so fucked and out of character and just not me what so ever. During the trial preparation the girl ended up befriending a bunch of girls who I slept with and 3 of them ended up providing their own assault stories about me that were all false and they weren't planning on charging me for anything. So out of the ""12"" girls I assaulted only 1 comes after me in court and the rest slander me online. One think to make note is she's coming after me 2 years later in court after this ""incident"" and there was a LOT of red flags on her statements including her friend saying ""go after him for money!"" I don't know why she would ever put that in her statement. She presented in court a ""PTSD"" booklet of all her past assaults that she dealt with and that 4 other people have assaulted her in her life.. one of them being A GIRL WHO IS SAYING I ASSAULTED HER. So the girl taking me to court says her friend who is also saying I assaulted her assaulted HER. I'm sorry if this is confusing but please try to follow along. My lawyer ended up saying that this girl was INSANE and that this was going to be an easy trial and basically trying to make me feel better about it all. Another addition to this trial is that one of my old friends who was with me the night the girl says I assaulted her was also testifying against me and saying I probably did this. In the girls statement... me and that guy friend were BOTH choking her. So we have a girl after me for assault but her witness(being my old friend) ALSO is being accused of joining in with me and choking her. Fast forward my lawyer starts to tell me that this isn't looking good for me because that ""old friend"" being a witness against me is going to make my chances of winning less likely. I eventually had a plea offer of taking 5 years of simple assault and just dropping the whole thing... or going to trial where I could be a registered sex offender. I took the plea because my anxiety is so bad.. I was TERRIFIED to go to trial and speak. Fast forward to 2020 most of my friends have parted from me and I still see people online talking shit about me.. including the girl who apparently tried to rape the girl who went after me in court. EVERY single day I make this giant speech in my head that I am going say on facebook for everyone to see  saying ""THIS GIRL ACCUSED MY ""FRIEND"" OF CHOKING HER AND ACCUSED THIS OTHER GIRL OF ASSAULTING HER TOO"" and I just know I cant.. I already plead guilty out of fear of a worse charge. I'm sorry if this whole this was confusing and I really appreciate anyone listening to this and or taking this seriously. I know I made so many mistakes in my past and being 27 years old now I know I could have been a MUCH better person.. but I feel like I'm the ONLY one who learned his lesson and now I'm very much a loner in my life and most my ""friends"" either avoid me or just straight up dropped me out of their life. I always wonder how much legal shit I would get in if I just leaked her statements online because she is straight up a FUCKING LIAR. She continues to slander me online and it bothers me every day and every night. These accusations STILL get brought up in my work life and in my future dating life. I swear on my families grave that this girl is lying about me and it sickens me that anyone would do this to a man...... sigh",02Aug2020,1

13,"About two and a half weeks ago my left side of my body went numb but not bad, I didn't notice it that much then and I lived with it for about a week until I got better. I was normal for about 2-3 days and then about 4-5 days ago my right leg went numb, worse then my left side ever got. Now both my legs are numb (right side is worse), my left arm is really numb, my finger tips hurt, and my back is numb (right side is worse). 

I don't know exactly how to explain the pain, but it's like the pain with your foot of hand goes to sleep. That weird static/pins and needles feeling. 

Here is a few examples of how numb everything is: 
1: I stubbed my pinky toe but I didn't feel any pain after a few seconds.
2: I got in a hot tub last night which was set at 100°f and I couldn't feel any heat, I could hardly notice I was sitting in water.
3: It's hard to walk/do anything because I can't feel. Like playing videogames for example, I have a hard time moving because I think I'm pushing the joystick but I'm actually not touching it at all or I push it too hard in a wrong direction.
4: The numb parts are very sensitive to cold.

16,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons. I’m a minor and I’ve been blackmailed by the same guy since I was 13 and he was 18. 



He never told me where he had gotten my number from but he kept pestering me and asking for nudes and I should’ve just blocked him when he first asked but I selfishly kept him because he would listen to my problems and let me talk and I liked having another friend and now I have no one. 


One day I was feeling shitty, I had fallen out with a few of my friends and I just wanted to make one person happy so I sent him a picture. He was happy and started feeding my bruised ego and I liked the feeling, I admit it. He wanted more and I sent more and the morning after realised I had done a shitty thing and was disgusted with myself. I messaged him and said I was never doing it again and he was pissed to say the least and threatened to post them if I didn’t send more. I did as he asked for months. 



One day I decided to stop and block him and a couple days later I received a message from an unknown number saying they loved my body and how much they wanted to fuck me and that they loved my pictures and videos and wanted to know when I would post more. 



I messaged the blackmailer asking what the fuck he had done and he replied with a picture of a site with every video and picture I had sent him all lined up for other people’s pleasure. I begged him to take them down. He was obviously going to ask for something, I thought maybe he would’ve changed but no. 


This time he wanted nudes and more. He said if I say a word to anyone or ever disobey him he’ll call the police on me and have me charged for distribution of CP and I can’t have that happen but it’s been more than a year and I can’t live like this anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore. I really fucking hate him and myself for getting in this situation. Please any advice helps.",02Aug2020,1
17,"Hello,

So I am a teenage girl and have facebook. I downloaded it only to use marketplace because I am building a pc and I am frequently looking for deals. But my account has absolutely no personal information. The only thing it has is the birthdate which is fake and is also set to private.

Since I am in facebook looking for deals and I often use the local buy and sell platforms, I decided to join this pc parts buy and sell group. And added a real profile pic so that the account doesn't seem fake because atleast in my country there are multiple fake accounts, and I needed something to not seem fake. Today I was browsing and liked a post of some guy selling something because it had a decent price. And a few minutes later I got a request from the guy who is obviously an adult (around his 30-40s).

At first I answered because he asked me something about pc's which is very common in this group, and I often help people with doubts about parts, etc. But now he is trying to continue the conversation and I know what he is trying to do, in my profile picture you can clearly see I'm young, I maybe pass a year or two older than I actually am but I don't look like an adult.

What do I do? Straight up block him? Or maybe try to get some evidence so I can report him? I'm not really sure, I do know what he is really trying to do, but is there anything I can do to prevent it from happening to another girl? Thank you in advance.",02Aug2020,1

19,"so my wife started with netflix videos and became a vegan.
she has made myself, my kids, my dog go vegan.
we then had to go organic, and if anything was out of line she would throw the food in the trash.  if anyone resisted it escalated quickly in a nasty fight that would usually get personal. 
Things seemed to get worse after she started meditating and getting into what she calls Quantum Physics. Quantum Physics brought her down the path of entitlement thinking, and believing in ""The Secret"", connecting the universe to her thoughts, and her thoughts would bring riches and fortunes.  My wife doesn't work, and for the past two years has been become a self taught personal life coach who is developing a retreat for the wealthiest groups of high net worth individuals.  She intends on acquiring an island where she will charge weekly fees of USD$50,000.  If I ask for details, or try to understand how she intends to pull it off, this also usually triggers a debate, and escalates to a fight about our current financial situation.
Today we got into another tussle because of $150 dollars of shampoo, conditioner and creme. Organic, nano-silver, real top of the line holistic products.  probably all great, but it makes no sense and is completely irrational considering our budget.  When I questioned these purchases, I am usually called a cheap-skate, or that I never complained in the past and we are probably not wealthy yet because I continue to think poor.  
It's frustrating being in a marriage like this.  one income, two kids, and no financial support or consideration to a budget and not willing to 
compromise.  There is no real intellectual stimulation or conversation if its not vegan, or talking about where we would be if we had a billion dollars... Yeah, a billion... She doesn't say "" a million' she say's she has to wish for a billion.. I keep telling her to help me get to 100, 000 first, that usually brings us back to a fight where I am the small thinking cheapstake who will never be rich because I only think like a poor man.  I just don’t see things her way, she doesn’t see them my way.... we have been married for 16 years and have two kids - my wife has never had a job and only has a highschool education -

my wife refuses to see  a counselor.",02Aug2020,1
20,"I'm a high school senior that's starting college applications. Since I was a child, my parents wanted me to go to a top school for CS---think Stanford, Caltech, and MIT. Last week we spoke to multiple college counselors, and he asked the same question to every counselor: ""Do you think she can go to MIT?"" The answer was the same every time: ""It's unlikely because MIT likes national-level awards and your daughter doesn't have any."" My dad realized that his daughter was a failure and resolved that his son, four years younger than his daughter, could not make the same mistake.

You need to first understand my dad. He's an immensely intelligent man who taught himself everything and believes that his children *have* to be as intelligent as himself. He's stubborn, refuses to listen to others, and believes his opinions to be facts. When I was in middle school, he locked me in the garage in order to force me to practice coding on the spare computer. He gave me exercises that a beginner would have no way of solving, and the only thing that I could do to satisfy him (as the punishment for being unable to solve the problems was not receiving dinner) was to find the answers on the Internet. He never bothered with teaching me anything, and he firmly believed that just by making me do problems, I would become as proficient in CS as he is. This method of teaching is what caused me to detest CS for the entirety of middle school as well as halfway into high school. 

After what happened last week, the first thing my dad did was criticize my mom for being too lenient on my brother and myself by calling her a ""horrible mother"" and having ""ruined his children."" The next thing he did was give my brother, who had never done CS before, a book that he studied *in college* and tell him to study from it so that he could compete in the US computing olympiad. 

Just an hour ago, my brother went to my mom for help since he couldn't understand anything. My mom tried explaining the concepts to him but became frustrated since he wasn't solving the problems correctly, so she called my dad upstairs (I was in the room next door so I heard everything that went down).

When my dad found out, he threw the book onto the floor and told my brother that if he couldn't understand such simple concepts, he should just leave the house. He told him that he was garbage, worthless, and a waste of space. My brother is *12 years old*, and no one should *ever* have to hear those words, especially not from one's own father. This isn't even the first time this has happened---it's already the second time this week, and my dad never apologizes or shows signs of remorse. 

I'm close with my brother so at least I can try to comfort him, but I can see him losing his self-esteem and sense of worth if this continues to happen in the future, especially once I'm out of the house for college and he doesn't have anyone else to help him. What can I do?",02Aug2020,1
21,"To preface, a few years ago, I randomly developed a few food aversions that grew into daily nausea, chronic constipation, insomnia, and migraines. After many, many lab tests, MRIs, etc, they didn’t find anything and eventually, it felt like my doctors stopped listening and looking for answers. I decided for myself that I was going to look into other methods of relief which led me to weed. It legitimately saved my life and I was pain free for a year. 

Well, I was laid off in March from a great job that didn’t care about what I did in my free time as long as I did good work, which I did. From March to May, my boyfriend wanted me to relax and start trying to heal my body. It was well intended but easier said than done. Anyway, I started hunting for jobs again and finally got a call back. I have an interview on Tuesday for another great job, but I’m afraid they will want to drug test so I’ve stopped smoking. 

For the past few days, I’ve been absolutely miserable. I can’t use the restroom, and when I do it’s extremely uncomfortable. I’ve had a migraine for three days. I haven’t eaten. 

I’ve smoked weed in the past and quit before but I’ve never had these side effects. I genuinely believe marijuana was doing great things for me and these past few days have been a tremendous set back. 

I no longer have insurance so going back to the doctor isn’t an option for me and it’s really not something I want to do.",02Aug2020,1

Hello everyone. I'm an active redditor but it's a throwaway account for the obvious reasons. I am a European resident but visit US very often because i have some work-connections in New York and New Jersey. I came to Miami with my sons(aged 11 and 13) for vacation and my husband couldn't join us due to his work-schedule. It's been two weeks since we got here. We are staying in a luxurious resort and had so much fun until i went through this situation.

It was around 11 a.m and after breakfast i wanted to take the advantage of the nearly empty pool.I was sunbathing topless and reading my book by the pool while my sons were swimming. By the way,i was informed by the reception staff it was totally okay to be topless in the poolyard. So i did nothing illegal. There were only a few couples and some teenagers by the pool but i was the only topless woman. About half an hour later, three guys each of whom i saw at the reception and in the dining hall came to the pool. I am totally sure about their nationality and where they are from but i don't want to indicate this because i don't want to sound like a racist. They are not from America and i'm sure of it. I think they had already recorded me and took a lot of photos before i realized i was being filmed. I immediately put my bikini top back on and asked what the hell they were doing.

They pretended as if they didn't even see me sunbathing but i could tell they were shocked and embarrassed on the inside. I wanted them to show me the video history in the phone but the guy refused,saying i can't check his phone. Then they got a little bit angry and told me that i could stop sunbathing topless if i don't want to be harrassed. I was really but really nervous and went upstairs with my sons immediately,so i could relax a bit and decide what to do. I am going to contact the staff at the resort but should i go to authorities as well? How is the law in Miami?",02Aug2020,1
23,"So I have this friend of mine and she is really sweet. But she has this habit of when I am talking to her on the phone or even in-front of her she stays on her phone and does not pay attention to me at all. 
A couple of weeks ago she started liking anime which was cool at first then I recommended her this app to read anime with. And due quarantine we can’t see each other but when I try to talk to her when we call she is just kind of on the app that I recommended her and when I talk to her it seems like I am talking to myself most of the times and then I lie that I have to go because what is the point of talking to someone if they are always on their phone not listening to you.

He was just too much of a coward to tell me that me being emotional about some stuff were bothering him.

How I found out? Well I am childhood friends with his girlfriend and she could not stand silent to him saying mean things behind my back anymore and wanted to tell me that I deserve much better and that he has been trying to break up the friendship for a while now because he never felt we were best friends he just went along with it because I was a source of entertainment for him. This hurts man, I also don’t feel anything it is kind of numb. What do I do? After 5 years of “friendship” he basically admitted it was one sided and he did not want to make me “uncomfortable”.

So what do you think? Should I wash the pink out for the sake of professionalism OR is it okay to have pink hair as a student?",02Aug2020,1
30,"For some background, I’m 16 and for most of my adolescent life I have despised traveling with my family in our RV. Something about RVs invoke my flight or fight reaction and every time I see it or a trip gets brung up I get incredibly upset. 

My parents call me snobby because there was one time when I was 10 and I stayed in my rich friends RV and their RV park and had fun. They say this forced my dad to buy a nicer and more expensive Fifth-Wheel Trailer. I don’t know what they were thinking but my feelings still haven’t changed about RVs. 

Fast forward to now, in the middle of pandemic filled United States. My mom and I take yearly trips back to her VERY small town in Montana, which had no cases at the time. We usually took the train there but decided against being in such a crowded space for over 24 hours and drove there. Driving along those windy two lane roads in the mountains terrifies me but not as much as my distracted driving mom does lol so I drove most of the way. We’ve been back from that 5 day road trip for a couple weeks now and my parents have decided that the whole family is going back again, with the RV, in less than a week. 

I argued against this for about a day before giving in and agreeing to taking CBD for my anxiety while driving. But now we’ve found out that not only is our family very sick, but they were in close contact with a couple who tested positive right after we left. Our family refuses to get tested (they think it’s a hoax, etc), and my parents are still thinking about going??!?? They also said that if we aren’t going back to see family we would be staying somewhere else in middle of nowhere montana for 8 days and I would just have to deal with it. 

Now, my mom claims to not want to go but is being “forced” by my dad, but in the same breath will scream at me about how tired she is of staying at home and of her family just wanting to stay home and “lie in bed all day” and how she wants to get out and go into nature with the RV.  

I have a car that I paid fully for, and I’m honestly thinking about taking it and running on the day they plan on leaving. Am I being crazy? Are my feelings valid?",02Aug2020,1

33,"So it’s kinda a long story but basically during quarantine I formed this group through mutual friends where we would play roblox. This was right before the lockdown so during quarantine we would pretty much go on discord and play roblox/talk e Rey night and have become good friends. Well now that quarantine is over and ppl have begun to hang out we planned trips to the beach and a trip to the quarry and everything was good. 

Recently, 4 ppl in this group have begun to hang out every weekend and not invite the rest of us. That group of 4 is made up of 2 best friend pairs who had no idea the other bff group existed until this group. I am not apart of this group. The reason being they are soon to be sophomores + juniors in high school and I was a senior when we met but am going to college soon. 

Even though it hurt the first time I wasn’t invited, I understand why being that they want to form a new friend group of similar ages and I am older then them and am going to college soon anyway. Ultimately it’s also some of them have stricter parents and would probably be hesitant to let an 18 year old guy that the parents don’t know that well have sleepovers with 15-16 year old girls (even though I am gay and we have similar personalities). So, even though it hurt, I have not said anything to them about it since I understand why.

However, tonight is their 3rd sleepover and did not invite me nor the rest of the group again. I just feel like we could always go to beach again or something but they always choose each other and it just hurts. I even invited them to a (6 foot) party last night (with lots of other ppl) but 2 didn’t respond, 1 said they wanted to but was babysitting, and the other was going to go but since no one else was going decided not to go.

Overall, it just hurts they can’t take a break from their hangouts and do something inclusive and bc they are only friends bc of me and now hang out with me it’s like I invented you???? I might add they didn’t invite me to the quarry and we had a little “thing” when I found out the night before but the one who planned it apologized and said it was just unofficially planned so she invited me to it and said she wanted me there. And then I was the one who made plans to the beach.",02Aug2020,1

36,"- [x] Okay, I am gonna be straight with this and tell my story. I would be so happy if you can help me with this. I am now in college, but I am gonna start my story from high school. I am from a culturally/politically divided country, between modernity&amp;tradition. My family is like that too. One side of my family is conservative and on the other side, I have modern family members(some of them international) that are more open minded but they still care about their traditions. I am closer to the latter one. I was a shy guy in high school so I was always hanging out with myself and reading books. I thought no one knew me in high school but I later found out even the people I didn’t know recognized me as the cool guy. I read from a vast fields of topics such as psychology, futurism, history so I have knowledge about a lot of things, and people know me as a wise person. Because I was shy, I was never good with relationships and didn’t have any girlfriend(till this day&amp;still don’t) or much friends. I had trust issues. Also I read from a lot of different sources from different point of views and when people see that, they get confused, even my family. I mix these different ideas and create my own point of view, so it’s hard for me to be a part of a “tribe”. In college, I started to change and became more outgoing. I started partying&amp;my taste in music changed, I became more outgoing and now I am friends with a lot of people from my classes. I still read a lot, have deep&amp;intellectual conversations with people and I write blog posts too. I am still shy with approaching girls but somehow I talk with a lot of them, but I cannot start a serious relationship with any of them. Because I post about music(mostly deep and ethnic house music) &amp;nightlife on my social media(I write about what I read and my thoughts too), most of the girls I talk to say I am not a “serious relationship” guy and say that I am a f***boy, even if I’m not. My friends say that too. This dilemma, people seeing only one side of my character &amp; being prejudiced bothers me a lot. I am trying to develop all sides of my character, I am trying to be modern but still value my traditions, I am trying to be outgoing but still enjoy my time alone more than anything etc. This dilemma makes it impossible for me to be in a group of people(“tribe”) and I feel alone&amp;misunderstood. And people seeing only one side of my character makes it harder for me to develop strong relationships. What can I do to make my relationships better? And most importantly, what can I do to become “complete”?(as C.G. Jung said: “One should never think that man can reach perfection, he can only aim at completion – not to be perfect but to be complete.)",02Aug2020,1

Never liked kids since young. They're cute and all but only when i don't have to clean their shit up everyday and spend my money on them. 

Yesterday, i told my mum about it, out of respect because she's my mother and she should at least know that i'm getting a procedure done. 

She went batshit nuts told my dad about it. They both proceeded to screamed in my face, saying i would never be able to give them grandkids anymore. Mum also screamed in chinese ""翅膀硬了不用我们了，可以自己做决定了是吗？” (""Now that your wings are hard enough to fly, don't need us already right?"" [It's sarcasm btw]) 

My parents are very religious, so its probably a huge thing for them, but they knew that i was going to get a vasectomy once i am legal as i told them a lot of times before. They've always tried to convince me otherwise and even brought me to church counselling when i was 16, but that made me even more sure that i DID NOT want kids. 

Now, they want to disown me over this. They said they always wanted grandkids, and if i proceed for a vasectomy i will not able to provide that anymore, and i will no longer be their daughter. 

What should i do? Advice please.",02Aug2020,1
38,"To make a long and tedious story short, my family lives in London (where I have no friends since I don’t live there most of the year) and I go to high school in NYC (where I don’t really get invited to parties and stuff like that). I’m normally quite jealous of the so-called “popular kids,” which I am aware is stupid and immature etc. 

When coronavirus started to heat up in nyc around March, my parents decided to bring me back to London. It has now been roughly 5ish months since then. I now cannot stand the idea that there are people I know who get to have fun and stuff while I haven’t spoken to someone my own age in person in 5 months. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even open social media without at least partially melting down over it and the intense envy I feel.

48,"I’ve been friends with my friend Samantha* for about 2 years. She’s been with her bf since about 3 years now. They live together and share a business. 

I used to like him a lot (platonically, I’m taken.) I loved the fact that I was friends with a couple who I feel I could enjoy being with separately one on one. 

Throughout our friendship she would tell me some pretty disturbing things about him without going too far into detail in fear she may expose him?

He distributes red flags that makes me concerned for our well being as well as hinder our friendship. One of them, being that he looks through her phone constantly. He refuses to get a phone plan/smartphone for himself because he’s too “good” for one and doesn’t want to be “distracted by the media”, so he’ll take her phone and use it. He used to text me harmless things from her phone, and sometimes it was a little cute, other times it bothered me because I shared private conversations with her that if I wanted him involved, I would have done so. I texted her less because of it. Also, on this subject, he looks through her messages and berates her on why she talks to xyz, and would check her phone every day. Because of that, I can never check up on her to see if she’s okay, and she wouldn’t share me her feelings because he would read. So, we barely text because I’m not cool with him looking through our convos and I don’t want them to fight if I am checking on her well being. 

On top of that, he doesn’t own a car or computer and relies on her to use hers, and makes her feel guilty when he doesn’t treat her property kindly. 

He always pushes devils advocate or say provoking things that are more so for arguments sake, and not conversation. 

He brings up her past of being a dancer a lot and shames her for it even tho she doesn’t live that lifestyle; and who cares! It was her life before you, shaming someone for dancing is extremely immature. He also brings other things up in her past and degrades her for it. 

The last straw was when they decided to take a psychedelic together, she admitted to him that she told a friend one of his secrets and felt extremely bad for it because it slipped in conversation. So what does he do? He wanted her to feel the same pain and made her destroy all of her art. Especially a piece she’s been working hard on and looked amazing. I actually wanted to buy it off of her when it was done. Instead of having a conversation on how he was hurt, he punished her by wanting her to feel the same pain, and she did literally destroy every single art she made, and this fucker threw it in a separate garbage bag, made her stay in their apartment, and he went traveling around their apartment complex of 26406393016 apartments it seems, and threw it in a random garbage bin so she couldn’t find it. 

I think. The fuck. NOT! I went dumpster diving the day after it happened and reeked of garbage to find it for her, but couldn’t do so. I don’t care if it was because he was tripping, he’s displayed problematic behavior already and this was the tipping point. 

She asked if they can come over tonight so he can see my new place when I specifically told her that I no longer support their relationship and my friendship is terminated with him almost 2 months ago. Why would she think I want him over? This is what I want to say:

“Hey Sam, 

I would love if you came over! Unfortunately you know how I feel about Chad* and I don’t feel comfortable with him coming over to my new place. I hope you understand. “

I don’t want to go further than that because I don’t want him reading, and I don’t want him to argue or do something to her. She’s unwilling at the moment to see that her relationship is toxic, and puts lot of blame on herself for their fights. 

What should I do? Is that okay to send? I want to have this friendship with her, but I don’t want to be involved with her boyfriend anymore and do not support their relationship.",02Aug2020,1

She insisted that it was just that we would be better off as friends and that she didn’t want to lose me from her life. Obviously we did no contact for a few weeks but she recently reached out to talk to me and I learned that she had recently started dating a female coworker that I had met a few times before.

We gave her food, she doesn't want it. We brought her a bucket just in case she needed to throw up.

my parents, mostly my mum, use swear words to describe me and my brother when they’re angry at us. it used to annoy me, but i just deal with it now. i can deal with my mum swearing at me, but i can’t deal with her calling me a whore. she doesn’t use it consistently, but she’s been calling me it about once a week since i was 11. 

i searched up this word, maybe 2 weeks ago, and found out what it meant. i told my mum that i don’t like the word and i don’t feel comfortable with her using it. she got so angry. she called me it again, she called me a b*tch, a slag, a gora (a white person in urdu, i don’t see why she used it as a insult) and so many other things. 

i tried to tell my older brother, but he didn’t seem to care and said that our parents probably don’t mean it in a bad way.

52,"I (M15) had a fight with my friend (F15), For context, we met in the eighth grade, and became fairly good friends, always hung out in our group of 8. All my friends and I have a sense of humor which is insulting each other/ourselves. It was never anything really offensive, and we never took anything each other said seriously, and if someone did we always made sure t apologize. Well, I had assumed we did at least. Anyway, I and my friend were arguing about a game competition we had in the eighth grade. I saw the whole situation as kind of silly as it was over a petty argument over who was better at said game. I don't think my friend saw it in the same light, as about 5 minutes after this argument about how I am a bad friend and I only make everyone feel bad. I think this is a good spot for another history break.

This friend has a history of getting irrationally mad at people for not very good reasons, going as far as to shun them for giving them a bad look. It was kind of ridiculous, and I tried to call her out on it as it was really toxic behavior, but she wouldn't listen. Anyways, In the argument we were having she brings up the fact that I think her shunning people is toxic, and is saying I'm a bad person for thinking that. She is going off on all of this and it's kind of insane to me. Little side tangent, I do not like to make people actually feel bad, so all of this makes me feel awful.

Eventually, she gets to a relationship I had had with one of our mutual friends that I had felt pressured into being in. I did not have any legitimate reason to feel pressured other than my own anxiety about people's reactions to the ending of the relationship. She was well aware of this, and I know she was, however, she tries to tell me that I said she forced me into the relationship. When I disagree with this I am told I am trying to blame her. I am quite irritated at this point, and then she says this ""What have we learned?"". This kinda set me off, and I responded with ""I learned that you misunderstand when people are joking and like to blame people for stuff they didn't say"". In retrospect, that was definitely not a good response, but at that moment I didn't care. I get told I am trying to blame her for all of everything, and that I should not contact her for a while.

It's been the entire summer with no further contact. I feel bad for the last thing I said to her because it was impulsive and a bad representation of how I felt. I never wanted to blame her completely for anything, I was trying to point out that multiple parties could be to blame. Looking back it's a bit ironic that she was rebuking me for doing what she had just done. I never reached out because I am fearful that she will still be mad, and/or get all of my other friends to not associate with me anymore. I am afraid of that last part most of all, as I do not have many friends, and don't know how to handle a situation like that. School is going to start up soon, ads I don't know what to do in any compacity. All advice or questions are welcome. Thank You for reading &lt;3.",02Aug2020,1
53,"My parents relationship has gone significantly downhill in the past few years and to put a long story short, they're talking about separation. 

Myself, being the eldest child is very clued in to the current situation, as one would expect and they vocalised to me initially that they would need my support through this rough time, which of course I'm more than happy to oblige.

However, in the past (roughly) 14 days, they've given me a new update on their marital status every fucking day without fail. I know this sounds harmless, BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY'VE GIVEN ME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY, or sometimes several different stories in the course of a few hours. Allow me to explain briefly what my past week has looked like:

Monday: they tell me they're having marital problems 
Tuesday: they don't love each other, marriage is over
Wednesday - Thursday: they maybe sort of might still love each other but probably not (?) 
Friday: Dad leaves the house, marriage is probably definitely over (again)
Saturday Morning: Dad is back in the house, they announce to me that their marriage is 100% officially over. 
Saturday Evening: I don't even fucking know, they've had sex (loudly 😐😐) multiple times in the span of a few hours where they know I can hear and are now acting as if nothing has transpired 
Sunday: who tf knows?

I'm sorry for venting but their behaviour is exhausting me, I'm mature for my age but I'm still just a teenager with my own severe mental health problems, yet they expect me to put that aside to exert my energy on a marriage I don't necessarily even care about at this point. I just wish they'd come back to me when they (and they ALONE) have a concrete decision made regarding their relationship. 

I know that's a lot to take in, but does anyone have any idea how I would vocalise this to them in the nicest manner possible?",02Aug2020,1

In my case, I've only really been interested games. Im in my early 20s and for as long as i can remember, my only escape was online games. I would pour hours over hours everyday into a game. I get addicted and cant escape the thrill of it. I play games now too but at times i get disgusted at myself for not realising how much time im wasting on them. Im calling it a waste bcz all this counter productive towards my career. I dont want a career in games.

Speaking of career, I've always been decent at math. So i decided to do Engineering and im almost done with my BEng. Ill talk about my university ethics abit. I made some friends in first year who were very hard working and honest. They would study all day and night for the exams and i would show up to the group study on the last day and pick up from them whatever i could in a few hours and end up with decent grades(alot of the times even Better than those who taught me). They always got baffled at how i was able to pull that off and they'd call me smart cuz im a ""quick learner"" . But in my head i would always call myself an idiot.. Becuase if im actually that smart, then why do i settle for the lowest? Why dont i apply myself more and achieve top grades on my own? Why do i not welcome competition in my life? Why do i always procrastinate? Why do i not have the passion towards doing anything meaningful?

Alot of my friends looked for internships and got it. But i never bothered looking. I always saw myself as someone who wont be able to accomplish it even if i tried so i might as well not bother with it. 

Now i need to be looking for a job bcz im pretty much done graduating but im not. Why am i not looking? What am i waiting for? Why am i so slow? Why am i wasting more time even after knowing ive wasted so much of it. I hate my attitude towards everything. I hate myself alot at times. 
I want to improve and get better. I need something. Something that would drive me to work hard. I know what i can achieve if i work hard. But why dont i do it? Whats stopping me? Why am i so lost about everything? Please tell me whats wrong with me? How do i improve myself? How do i take initiative towards meaningful tasks? Why do i see everyone infront of me do it but i fail to do it? Why am i so lazy? How do i quit this downhill path? 

Once again i apologize for writing so much. I felt like writing about wayyyy more but i stopped cuz i dont even know if anyone cares 😂.",02Aug2020,1

57,"Hi All. This is 25F from India. 
I come from a somewhat patriarchal family and I have a guy cousin who is my age and we grew up together. Been close and not so close over the years depending on our life stage. We are quite good friends now. We smoke pot, hang out, talk about work, love, life etc. how good friends would. Just fun sister brother relationship. 
Since india got into a lockdown, I have been hanging out with him alternate weeks as I moved back to my hometown and he's always lived there. We initially used to meet 4-5 times a year but we'd talk on call. Now, since I'm back, we always chill at his place and not mine because he has access to pot and his parents are cool about it, whereas mine are not. My parents question me about why he doesn't come, and do not approve of me going. In general, my family isn't a happy family with my dad being a regressive guy who is kinda controlling and toxic. I told them it's my life, I'm an adult, I can visit any blood relative I want if I feel happy hanging out with them. 
So this time my mom asked me if we slept in the same bed and if I slept with his mom and he with his dad. I said no..why? She said there have been cases of where first cousins get together in society. I was like WTF? I said I have a boyfriend and he's got a girlfriend.. how can you think about such a thing? She said my dad told her it might be possible. 
Later, when I left, I called her from his place and told her that what she said make me wanna puke and told her if dad did it with his sister that is why he thinks like that. Or if he thinks of raping his daughter. Cuz all of this happens in society too, right? 
Also my dad fought with my cousin's dad a lot the same time telling him that you make my daughter drink. I'm 25 lol. We have many full alcohol bottles on display at home, though no one drinks in front of anyone. I should also add that I generally have never felt happy with the idea of home. I never liked going home. 

Am I okay in feeling how I do? Do I stop going to his place? How do I confront my parents? What do I do!
I feel like I'm never going to forget what they just said. 

TL;DR: Regressive parents think I have something going on with cousin because I want to hang out with him alternate weekends.",02Aug2020,1
58,So I'm a full time college student and part time artist. My girlfriend is a full time accountant and part cosplayer. I make around 1k a month while going to college that money normally goes to my phone bill and car insurance since I'm still on my dads jobs health insurance till I'm 21. My girlfriend on the other hand makes 5k a month at her full time job and 1200 from being a cosplayer (which normally goes back into making more cosplays). we basically have a serious wage gap that sometimes makes me uncomfortable. I part time live with my girlfriend although all my mail and everything says I live with my parents during this summer break I'm at my girlfriends house 4 days a week normally. In those 4 days she normally pays for everything and it makes me uncomfortable I try to pay for things and she refuses saying I need to save my money. For example just last night we were driving in my car to go to a crafts store and she noticed I'm was under half a tank of gas she kept talking about that I need to get gas which when I pulled in she ran out of the car and put her hard in before I could and she filled my tank. She knows I want to pay for things one of the reasons I dont fully move in with my girlfriend is because I wont be able to pay any Bill's. I just dont know what to do.,02Aug2020,1
59,"I am having a lot of trouble accepting that a lot of my friends back in college have moved on, and our paths are probably not going to meet again.

Long Story short - I left my home country approx 5-6 years ago to come work abroad and always thought that whenever I'd go back home, things would be the same like they used to be ""back in the day"". Now, in my 30s, I realize:

1. Many of my friends have moved on. Only the circle of my closest friends (4 or so, from basically Grade 7-8) are the ones who showed any interest in meeting up.
2. The group of friends who are still close to me - they all have now gotten married, have kids so they have so much more responsibilities. We can really only meet for lunch / dinner, we can no longer spend hours and hours doing things together. 
3. I also feel that my best days in life are well behind me, and now its just the 9-6 grunt. The whole thing is a bit depressing (Insta influencers dont help).

I'm 23F and I've been talking to a guy for a few months now, we are just friends but I've come to find out that we have very different opinions on things. For example I'm pro-choice, and he's pro-life. We got into a civil debate about it. We still talk but he's recently asked me out on a date. I don't think he's a horrible person by any means. But I brought up how I'm worried about pursuing something with someone who has very different opinions about that kind of stuff. He stated that our different opinions wasn't a big deal to him and I'm open minded and that's rare. I told him sure, different opinions are okay, when it comes to music, food, actors. But this is a different opinion on basic human rights and that concerns me because in my mind I'm just thinking of what else in the future we will have different opinions on. Like I stated I don't hate him for his opinion. But I don't know if I'm being childish or if I'm making a valid point.

64,"hey y’all

(i’m new to Reddit so please do correct me if my etiquette needs to be adjusted!)

this has been one of the worst months of my life, tbh. we found out a few weeks ago my grandma has Stage 4 cancer (we don’t even know exactly what cancer it is—her body rejected the endoscopy and she got pneumonia—but believe it to be stomach cancer). to make a long story short, my grandma, who is one of the people i love and adore most in the world, is on her death bed. it hit us so quickly—i give it 1-2 days until she passes. i offer this information as background to my struggle and how i’ve been feeling so to offer context. 

my dad came to my grandmother’s house to visit my gma where my mom has been staying while my grandmother is on hospice. she has these mirrors in her living room that basically let you see what someone’s looking at on their phone. my dad was looking at pictures of women on his phone, which i saw but tried to convince myself it was probably nothing serious. but my mom could see him too, and we had other family members over so it’s just fucking embarassing. she said it looked like some sort of dating app. 

we’ve had suspicions about my dad over the years, but i just feel sick because how could he come to the house where my grandmother is dying and blatantly cheat in front of my mom? it’s just sad and pathetic and i feel like my dad’s dishonesty (and verbal abuse at home) has given me major trust issues and problems in my interactions with men, to an extent that i get debilitating anxiety attacks whenever i have to confront anything that mirrors his behavior in my day to day life.

my mom wants to file for divorce after my grandmother passes. it will be really hard for me to live without her. we sleep in the same bed every night. i feel so sad and frustrated because everything just seems like bullshit, i wish i could take every single drop of pain my mother and grandmother have to endure. any advice on how to move past this and be there for my mom?",02Aug2020,1

66,"So I only made friends with him a couple of days ago, and although getting drunk is definitely not a problem (especially in the uk), I can't help but feel a bit responsible. When I first met him he was so welcoming and really nice (and still is) but it's like he has another side to him. I had to leave him with another friend who he's known for a while and they said that they've never seen him that drunk before. But I'm not sure his friend (17) understands that he needs to get home safely. I'm not sure what I should have done as the last time I saw someone that drunk their parents came and picked them up but this guys parents said not to wake them up. His friend doesn't seem too bothered by it but I can't help feeling a bit guilty at leaving him to deal with it. Now I'm worried whether his parents will find out etc. But I'm more worried about him and i would like some advice. I'm just not experienced enough to know whether the alcoholism is a problem yet. He was making a big spectacle of himself and then he just kind of slumped lazily into a chair (still responsive). He kept trying to drink more vodka until I took it away.

68,"My m(40) sister f(38) used to be a skinny, happy-go-lucky, healthy person.  She got engaged and then married and gave up looking after herself.  

Her husband is my best friend - he’s a good guy and he’s stayed with her and tried to get her help but she has refused every step of the way.

We have discussed her weight privately but no one in our family has ever made fun of her for her weight or made her feel bad about it.  Her husband owns his own business and has loved her unconditionally for years even though his parents and siblings have told him on multiple occasions he should get a divorce.  He is, however, now her opposite.  He’s in great shape and works a lot - she’s fat and does nothing.  For the first time since I’ve known him he’s mentioned leaving her.

I work 80 hours a week myself and admittedly have stayed out of their relationship - I have at times attempted to help her by offering to pay for her to go on the same meal plan or diet and put a wager on loosing weight with her but nothing ever sticks.  She will do something for a day or so and stop.

I don’t know how to help her.  She doesn’t want to get therapy, she shows no interest in anything and I know that if they divorce she will likely be dead in a year or less.

And I’ll say “I don’t care if you want to while I’m here” but then they’re all, “I don’t wanna do it by myself” and stuff. Basically I just feel like to have friends where I’m from I have to smoke weed and enjoy it. 

And I know that if I actually was an avid weed smoker, I’d be invited to all of these parties and plans that people make because all they do there is smoke with each other. I just don’t get invited because everyone knows I don’t smoke. 

Again, I have NO problem with others smoking weed. I just PERSONALLY don’t like it because of the way it makes me feel.

77,"So I deeply care about my mom and have her mental health and mental well being as one of my top concerns. About a year ago my dad was caught in an emotional maybe physical affair. This of course created a rift between my parents that is their job to figure out not mine as I’m only 17 and it’s not my business. However, recently I was trying to find a video I had watched on her phone so went to the YouTube history list of viewed videos and was very shocked. Hours and hours I mean probably 300 hours worth of half hour to hour long video on “how to get a guy to like you” “top ten signs he’s interested in you” “how to attract a guy” “signs he adores you” etc. 
Now if this was the odd video sure why not he’ll even I’ve watched some of those but this isn’t the case. I scrolled down for atleast an hour while sitting on the couch and there are a shit ton an unhealthy amount. I’m a lazy teen during lockdown and even I don’t go on YouTube that much but she’s spent hours and months obsessing over this and the viewed videos didn’t slow down she watched them just as often as a year ago.
I’m very worried this is bad for her mental health as it can not be good to be obsessing over these stupid “alpha male persons” who just all repeat the same recycled sentences for gullible women to hear. I want to talk to her about it but am worried she’ll be mad at me for being “nosey” I hadn’t intended to go through her history for that however as I was scrolling down to find my video that’s when I was shocked to see all hers pulling up so got worried.

Does anyone have any advice on how to approach this or even if I should. As she’s still watching them daily I’m worried it’s become an unhealthy and obsessional routine that she need pointed out.

79,"(Im 16f). My mum and dad haven’t been close since I was around 10. My dad sleeps on the sofa and has for years, my mum took off her engagement ring (they were never married), they used to give a kiss when leaving/coming home but, again, that’s been years and years since.
My dad works away for most of the time and is home around a week a month- ish (more recently because of corona). My mum works from home and I’m homeschooled so it’s just her and I at home most of the days. 
They never fight necessarily, but they do bicker and my mum is irritated by every little thing my dad does. Small things like whistling or interrupting conversations will piss her off to the extreme and I’ll she’ll tell me later in the car something along the lines of “that man’s incompetent”, etc. To be fair, my dad can be somewhat irritating and irresponsible, but still, it’s constant.
It’s just constant small things that I notice. My mum always says how her and I could move somewhere we liked since my dads never here anyway. (That doesn’t sound like much- but it’s the way she says these things and how often she does).
What lead me to post this was something she said the other day. I have really sad spells so that particular day I was sat in bed crying and my mum walks in and starts talking to me and helping me feel better. Usually when this happens I just let her talk to me instead of me talking. So she’s talking about how sometimes people just aren’t happy with who they are and she says “I mean I’m not happy with who I am; my relationship; (insert other things)” 
This wouldn’t bother me that much if I didn’t feel like it was my fault. I feel like either they’re staying together to take the pressure of me, their child who’s depressed already, or, like I’m the one who made it that way because I wasn’t exactly an easy child.
There’s more little things that I can’t quite recall right now because they’re so many, but that’s just an idea I suppose.
Most of this might be overthinking, but I wouldn’t know how to ask? I really wouldn’t be that bothered if they wanted to split up because my dads not home most of the time so it wouldn’t be that different for me. I can tell my mum is really not happy with it all sometimes and I can’t help but feel they’re together to keep some sanity for me or something.

He’s really competitive to the point he will always check my papers and compare his scores to mine. Sometimes when he ask me for answer i give it but when i ask him he always said he don’t know. He always double check my paper and will literally see every mistakes he see. It’s really annoying but he’s my friend lol.

90,"**TL:DR - I’m not sure whether to be an officer in the Army/Air Force at ERAU, or go to UCI and become a Lawyer/Dermatologist**

So to start, I’m a high school senior who will be graduating this year. I got blasted with 5 different emails from different colleges today, all with the same core message: it’s time to apply to college.

For the longest time, I’ve always wanted to go into the Air Force and become an officer via AFROTC, at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) and major in Aerospace Engineering (if I get the AFROTC scholarship), or Global Securities and Intelligence Studies if I don’t. The reason being is that I get paid straight out of college, I get paid to have amazing experiences and make a lifetime of memories, and as I’ve been in JROTC for 4 years now, I have very much come to love and embrace the military, not to mention that JROTC has definitely sold me on going this route with all of the benefits.

However, I have mild eczema, and I take Dupixent (a medical injection) to treat it. Since then, my eczema has gone down substantially, but I’m unbelievably afraid that they might medically disqualify me based on that.

My back up plan was to go to University of California Irvine (UCI) and become either two things: a lawyer (which will take about 7 years) or a Dermatologist (probably like 12 years).

If I were to go the lawyer route, I would most likely major in Political Science and then apply to UCI’s law school. If I were to go the dermatologist route, I would probably major in biology or chemistry, and then attend UCI’s med school. 

My main issue with both of these routes is I’m exactly looking forward to going 7 or 12 years without getting paid, meanwhile my student loan debt continues to grow (I’m aware both paths, especially the Dermatology path, are extremely competitive and *extremely* expensive). I also understand that I will be making mucho dinero once I’m finished with either one of those paths. I’m in Mock Trial currently and enjoy it very much, but I also have firsthand experience with having eczema, as I’ve had it ever since I was a child (and it used to be *very* bad) so both options seem appealing to me, but they both have the same downside. The wait.

After doing some research, and a bit of thinking, I remember being told that the Army is much more lenient in terms of eczema than the Air Force is, and I thought about pursing an Army career via AROTC. I would get the same benefits and rewards in a sense, but for some reason I was never really drawn to the Army and always wanted to go to either the Navy or Air Force.

I’m literally stuck at the most important crossroads of my life so far. I have no clue as to what path I should take forward, nor honestly what paths are available to me. I enjoy the thought of me becoming really either of these 4, but worst comes to worst, I might not even get to any of them. I have a 4.3 cumulative GPA, and around a 3.8 unweighted, which I’m hoping is enough to get me into UCI. And since they’ve waived the SAT, they’re solely judging me based on that and my extracurriculars (which I feel fairly confident in).

Am I aiming/hoping for too much and should come up with a more realistic plan? I’m really not sure what to do.",02Aug2020,1

92," we  are in college and i have several nieces and nephews that i am close  to. my best friend is close with my family(like invited to thanksgiving  and christmas). obvs due to corona we haven't seen each other very much,  so ive sent lots of pics of the nieces and nephews to her bc she likes  to keep up to date w the family. the other day she mentioned that shes  passes these onto her bf. they've been dating for a few months. we've  had some boundary issues between the three of us (for example, every  time i called to chat in jan and feb of this year, she'd put me on  speaker and her bf was included. i dont mind talking to him, but i dont  like that we cant talk without him there. another example is he will  respond to my texts from her phone, like once i sent a text about my  thoughts on a show and he sent back from her phone that ""its a show, get  over it"" (i wasn't upset, just sharing my thoughts in a private  convo???). she also tells me about the issues he needs to see a  therapist for (alcoholic parent and other stuff). its weird because he  and i aren't really friends and weve never actually met. she also  mentioned recently that he is really intrigued by my siblings, thinks my  mom is cool, and wants to meet my dog and my nieces and nephews. he  follows me on instagram so maybe he's picked up stuff from there but i'm  a little weirded out by the interest in my life. i feel like i am too  involved in their relationship without me even knowing. i want to ask  her to not pass on pictures of my nieces and nephews(they are all under  2.5 years old) onto him since he's not close to my family, but i don't  want to be a jerk to him.

94,"Hi, thanks for looking. I just want some advice on how to make up with my dad.

Sorry this is kinda long.

So my dad has cooked dinner for everyone pretty much every night since I was born. We eat together every single night, no matter what, and we only get to eat out at restaurants or get fast food a few times a year. Just to give you an idea of how much my dad cooked before this happened.

Anyway, I think I’ve directly caused this problem, so here’s what happened. 

We have a huge vegetable garden, and we literally get pounds and pounds of vegetables everyday. The thing we get most of is squash, so we have had squash as a side dish at dinner every single night for about two months now. I hate squash. HATE IT. So, as a result, I have said occasionally that I wish we didn’t have squash so often. My dad has been nice and has been trying different flavors and ways of preparing it (which i do appreciate and love him for!) and I always say that I like it, but I just really don’t, and I think he can tell. (I’ll admit it, I’m pretty bad at lying, even when I’m just softening my words)

It’s not just me that’s been complaining. We also have green beans every night, and my brother hates them even more than I hate squash, and he’s more vocal about it, but I’ve been affecting him more because my dad has been surprisingly sensitive to the way I act recently. I’m home from university, and if I sleep in a late or anything like that he becomes furious and asks stuff like “Why do you hate me?” or “When you were little you were so confident and nice and I wish you would start acting that way again.” (This last statement is more in response to me not liking parties and not having many friends. He was very popular apparently in college and doesn’t really understand that I’m more introverted than he is.)

Anyway, the past few days my dad has declared that we should make our own dinners ( fine, we do that often enough). But today, the entire house has been silent, which always means something is wrong, and my mom called me and my brother into their room and told us that my dad has decided he will not cook dinner again, apparently for forever. It sounds dramatic, but knowing my dad, he’s dead serious. My mom says that he feels unappreciated and that he hates being told we don’t like something he made, so he has decided that we can make our own food. My mom told us because my dad is not talking to us today. He won’t even look at me. :(

My dad has always been this way, and growing up we learned to just say we liked everything he made us because even the slightest criticism would be met with screaming and intense anger. The “you can’t leave the table unless you eat everything you’ve been served” has always been heavily practiced in our house lol.

Anyways, I feel really bad because I made my dad sad, however, I also don’t want to apologize because I don’t think I did anything wrong. All I’ve said is that I don’t like squash, and I really just don’t understand why he’s taking it so personally. Of course, I do appreciate his effort to cook every night and make nice and interesting dishes for us, but I mean come on. Just because I wish we didn’t eat squash every single night? I think he’s overreacting a bit.

Whenever I didn’t like something growing up, my dad would always yell, “Well how would you feel if someone told you they didn’t like something you made?!” And I’ve always given him the answer he wants, that I would feel horrible and sad and whatever. But you know what? I wouldn’t! I’d feel a little disappointed, sure, but I’d get over it because I can understand that people have different tastes, and that I’m not a god that does everything perfectly all the time. I’m just not that sensitive!

Of course, I’ve always been very thick skinned, and my dad wears his heart on his sleeve to say the least, so maybe I just don’t understand how he feels, I don’t know.

Anyways, what do you think I should do? I am deathly afraid of pissing him off even more, so I need some advice at wording my response correctly. He is very quick to anger, and to be perfectly honest, when he gets like this, he can be a bit self absorbed and not think as to how me and my brother feel and react outrageously over the top. He once cancelled an entire family beach trip because I couldn’t give him a good enough reason as to why I preferred one price swim suits over bikinis. I was eight.) 

Anyways, thanks! Any advice is greatly appreciated!",02Aug2020,1

Context/Info: I'm a Roblox user, and there's two people I often identify joining my games.

Their usernames are: Toughblockninja, and Superslush57. I've done all the precautions to prevent people that aren't on my friends list from joining my games or interacting with me, but they may be using a ""hack"" of sorts to join me regardless of where I go. The only place I'm able to be ""safe"" is in my own games where I can use a plugin to ban them from joining.

The reason they're bothering me is something I don't remember, but it was something small like a comment about someone being bad at a game I was playing, I think.

I don't want to escalate it into a legal situation or anything 'too intense' for me. This has been going on for up to a month now and I've tolerated them bothering me for a while now. The accounts look partially expendable/disposable but I'm not too sure.

100,"19f. ive only ever really loved 3 people, one of them loved me back and two didnt. I felt dependent on them, and so I knew I loved them. they were all guys, they were all older than me by 9+ years. one when I was 14, one when I was 16 and one when I was 18. in a sense I felt like I couldnt be away from them, I was miserable if I weren't with or talking to them (which was often, because 2 of the three were not good to me by any stretch), and as soon as I talk to any of them to this day, I fall right back into being dependent on them and the whole show.

i met a girl. shes 17 (turning 18) and I think shes really sweet and kind. and shes really pretty. and I like talking to her. but it doesnt feel the same as it felt with the other two guys. and shes younger than me, which for some reason makes me feel very pressured to be a good role model (I know its dumb as shes only like 2 years younger but still), which I am definitely definitely not. but shes very kind to me, and she thinks I'm pretty and I think the same things of her. but I don't feel dependent on her. I dont necessarily feel like I need her. so does that mean I dont like her?

102,"Hello, this is my first time coming onto this sub for real advice. Let me explain some things first.

My best friend, V, has been pretty much in my life since 4th grade, we disconnected a bit since we went to different middle schools but when we entered like 7th grade we got back into contact and it's been awesome. We are going into our Junior year  of HS. V does NOT go to our school, and was introduced to my friend group by me.

My friend group started in around 8th grade, as we all got along and were able to bond during the after school activities that we did. I introduced V to them sometime around 9th grade, and he hit it off with them. I still had a few other friend groups, but I think people mostly associated me with them. They were somewhat referred to as the ""popular kids"" due to their outgoing attitude and the fact that most of us are pretty involved with the school, doing a lot of things. However, slowly I could notice that they were actually..pretty mean people. They were always so obnoxious in a lot of ways, snickering about people during class, even making fun of them in front of their face. It got to an all-time high in around sophomore year. I just couldn't take it any more. It rubbed off on me. I caught myself talking about people behind their back, making fun of people in our group chats, people who I would come face to face with while they thought I was a good person. I realized I needed to stop. I don't know if I could explain all the issues, but I'll try; the main issues resided with two people in the group, M and K. They together would make fun of tons of people throughout the time that I knew them, laugh in their faces, talk about them behind their back, and so much more. M is a very passive-aggressive person, who argues for the sake of arguing, rather than to see the opposing sides and acts in a very patronizing way. The last straw came towards the end of the school year when my friend told me that they would be arguing about who would sit where, and who would be forced to sit next to me, like it was some death sentence. they would joke about it before I came into class. I knew I had to distance myself from them, and I did. But what REALLY set me off was during quarantine. I had forgotten to do something and M was bickering, and bickering, and saying the rudest stuff to me in the chat. I just didn't bother giving him fuel, and just stayed quiet for most of it. I realized he didn't want to see the best for me. He just wanted to make me feel bad. To top it off, no one helped. They all sat there like sheep just watching it. I few weeks later, I left the chat (which didn't concern them at all) and slowly separated myself from them, making them unfollow my personal accounts, etc. I wanted to handle it in a mature way by not making a big deal about it, and still maintaining  a professional relationship with them, as they are still going to be my classmates. I'm going to be Vice President of my school this upcoming year.

Anyways, I realized V still is in their chat, (he witnessed what happened) I asked him why and he said that he doesn't really care about them, and I asked them if why doesn't he just leave if he doesn't care about them, but he said he was too lazy. I obviously didn't want to seem toxic or anything by forcing him to leave the chat and stop being their friends when the issue was not with him. But, I still feel betrayed. I saw him on a screenshot that he was still calling with them, and it just makes me annoyed knowing that he's still hanging out with people who hurt me. I want to bring it up with him, but how should I go about it? I want to make it clear that I can no longer be his friend if he wants to continue to be friends with them. is that too harsh? thank you all in advance.",02Aug2020,1

105,"Hi! So I (18F) have a large group of close friends (about 8 people), and all but one of us just graduated high school. That meant no prom, no ceremonies, no parties, etc. So we’ve all quarantined for 2 weeks, and we are going to take prom and graduation photos at my house and then have a sit down dinner (extra fancy), before moving to another friend’s house to have an after “prom” party and sleep over.

The point is, we’ve been planning this for a while, and one friend who used to be closer in sophomore year but now doesn’t hang out with us other than like the Christmas party (maybe), is *never* on the discord server, just texted me at 8 PM asking a question about the event.

I asked for RSVPs multiple times and have already bought and set up place settings and the menu, not to mention the fact that I don’t really want her in the pictures because she’s not really our close friend anymore.

I told her she couldn’t come to the dinner (politely) because I literally don’t have the place settings. I can’t seat her. My mom has already worked really hard on this dinner and we planned for 8 people. She replied: “ok that’s fine. my mom was thinking we’d head out after pics anyway since we have an event afterwards so dw it’s my fault for not checking discord &amp; replying. is it alright if i’m still there for the photos?”

So she doesn’t even want to spend time with us at the after party. She would only be there for photos. Am I being too harsh here? I haven’t said anything rude to her, but I am frustrated with her.

Do I let it go, or tell her she can’t come for photos?

TLDR: a no longer close friend rsvp’d the night before to a picture session/sit down dinner/after party that’s been planned for a couple months. I told her I couldn’t fit her at the dinner and she said ok. She asked if she could still come to pictures only, not the after party at all.

115," I (16m) am pretty introverted, and so when quarantine started i wasn't really bothered. I was fine with just calling or texting my friends every once few days or weeks, and i was fairly content with how things were going. After a couple months however, things changed pretty quickly; I started feeling like all my friends were drifting away and I suddenly felt really lonely. It felt exhausting just to call or even text someone, and so i would try to avoid calling people and so I felt more and more lonely. I thought that life would be better if only I had more friends.

 In the past month or two, things have been opening up again, and I can hang out with my friends again. I feel like I should be satisfied with how things are, but I haven't become any happier. Nothing excites me anymore. My default mood when I wake up every day is to feel sad. Over the course of the day, my mood improves a bit and I just feel dead. Not happy or even neutral, I just feel absolutely indifferent to everything.

I've been talking to this girl who is really nice and cute and seems interested in me, but now I've lost all my interest for her. It's really random but the only thing I can think about that seems like something I would want to do is ride a roller coaster.

I have trouble going after the things I want because I'm currently living with(And was raised from birth by) my grandparents and the only one out of us who will drive is my racist, sexist, grandpa who believes China is trying to steal all of my information through my phone. And no, moving out is not an option right now until I get a car. 

Not to mention, he complains about literally everything. Want to go to the store? 

""My shoulder hurts I can't drive! Reeee!""

Want to get some paint to do artsy stuff with?

""You'll put it down and never use it again! REeee!"" 

Want to go out and eat, because I wanna have a nice time for once?

""That costs too much money! Your grandma is sick! Reeeee!""

Want to get a car?

""Your going to run the streets like a hooligan if I help you get a car!""

""You want a cheap little junker that'll break down! I want a new car!"" 

Want to watch a movie?

""You do nothing! REEEEE! This family is crazy! REEEE! I HATE MY LIFE! REEEEEE!!!!!""

He made me so angry about two weeks ago while we were out because I had to BEG to get tested for Covid-19, because we all got sick, and I was showing symptoms of it. I caught whatever I had from them, and I was thinking we should get tested to be safe. But no, he called me crazy and brainwashed instead. As a result, I jumped out the car while it was moving because I just wanted to get away from him and was tired of hearing about it. I couldn't go anywhere because I was in the car, though, so jumping out solved it. Was it stupid? Yes. Do I regret it? Abso-fucking-lutely not. Funny thing, next day he threatened to kick me out if I did anything like that again. So, this is the type of person I am dealing with. 

I've essentially given up on talking too or having any sort of relationship with this man because of it. He's still living in fucking 1960. And he's a fucking child. He doesn't believe in going out and having a good relationship with family. He's an 80 year old man who works, comes home, and watches TV and yells at it while being unhappy about literally everything. It's hard to have any respect for him because he has done some extremely irrational things, like try to destroy my laptop with a hammer because he caught me up late one night when I was 16. And because they lease a car I'm not allowed to drive it, incase I go ""crazy"" one day and decide to crash it. His words. I'm not on the insurance either.  But I have my license. 

My grandma can't drive because she's too old and has diabetes which causes her feet to swell, and really just cause all sorts of aches and pains that make it too hard for her to drive anymore. 

And there's no such thing as public transport around here. I have no friends. I'm just starting a new job(That I somehow got all by myself like I""m not sure how I did that), but I have no idea how to talk to people really. I'd describe myself as being pretty level-headed, but I don't know how to have any fucking fun with other people and I'm so sick of it. I'm sensitive and get shot down so easily, which I'm trying to work on getting thicker skin but I'll never stop being sensitive really. I was the kind of kid who cried at school like literally all the time over the dumbest shit. You probably would've described me as being ""emo"" in high school minus all the stereotypical clothes and hairstyle.

And because of how my grandpa has been, my entire fucking life, I've turned into a fat fuckwit of a zombie who sits around watching netflix all day and I hate it. Like really, watching movies has become a hobby for me. If It were up to me, I'd be saving up some money to go on a vacation and learning how to ski or snowboard. I'd be painting, drawing, maybe planting some flowers. I'd be outside, playing with and taking care of a dog because goddamn a dog would do wonders for my fucking anxiety. And maybe if he hadn't complained my entire life, and made me feel like a problem as a kid, I would've had more confidence in myself and been able to make more friends. 

I've basically had most aspects of my life be 100% under my grandparents control though, for most of my life. Like it's too much to really explain in a reddit post, but it's been a very crippling experience. It's like they forgot they were my parents because they think I know how to do laundry, how to cook, ect. but don't seem to realize I can't leave the house without somebody taking me, they do all the laundry for me and have never taught me any different. It's like reality is alluding their minds. 

But I'm trying to be different. I don't want to be like this anymore, or live like this. I want to be independent, and on my own, because that's how I've always been despite being a cry-baby. I can't go to college yet, because I need reliable transportation and I'll be working the entire time. A car is what I'm trying to get right now, but until I can do that, how the fuck am I supposed to be living? All I'm doing is existing and I hate it. Even if I did make it to college, how am I supposed to enjoy my life? I don't care about money. Like, if I want something I'll work for it and I'll get it. But I am broke, just fyi. After a car I know I should save my money but I want a nice gaming laptop because I can't play any games on my computer anymore since it's too old. 

I want to fall in love, do stupid shit, y'know, LIVE. I'm sorry for rambling but I think I've gotten my point across and would just like some suggestions. Because I don't really know how to make friends like this, or how I'm supposed to explore hobbies like this. And I feel like utter trash.",02Aug2020,1

I've got quite close to a few girls lately, I don't really think there are any relationship prospects but we talk a lot. The problem is I can see that they're friends with a LOT of people, generally well-liked. I'm not a total loner, but not on the same level of popularity either lol, and I am absolutely awful at avoiding comparing myself to others. Because of this, sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me and thinks that I am disposable in their life, so our time together could end at any moment.

124,"My (15F) dad (51M) has always been abusive to me my entire life. I won’t go into detail, but there have been multiple times where my dad has put his hands on me and I’ve had to call the police. My dad has also abused my mom to the point where she had to leave because she feared her life. My parents have joint custody, but I prefer living with my dad despite the abuse due to personal reasons.

My dad is also extremely manipulative where he has pulled in my counselors and therapists and convinced them I was possibly bipolar and autistic. He’s also managed the drive the police away every time.

My dad keeps trying to convince me he has never put his hands on me and that I’m trying to cause drama. My dad’s family also has a history of beating their kids and wife.

No matter what I say, my dad is perfect and never put his hands on me or my mom. I called the police on him, as a 12 year old girl, because I was trying to start drama.

My dad is convinced my friends are brainwashing me into going against him. My friends come out and we chill in the basement and sometimes go to Walgreens to get some candy or a Monster. I don’t know why he thinks these things.

There’s nowhere I can really go, and I’ve contemplated doing drastic things that would make everyone around me suffer. Not sure if I can’t mention exactly in this sub, but I think you might get it. 

I don’t do drugs, I’m on the honor roll, I do all my chores, I keep my area clean, I don’t get it. Why would I try to start drama?

There’s really nowhere for me to move so please don’t ask if I can move somewhere. I’m stuck here until I’m 18. And CPS is full of crap, they have believed my dad over me and they will do it again.

130,"So without going into too much detail, I'm kind of lost in life right now. I was studying IT until I hit a dead end 1 year ago. I just could not get into it anymore and decided that I wanted to work a regular full-time job until I find a way out of this depressive mood. I wanted to try and find a job 3 months ago, but Corona fucked pretty much everything up. Couple that with the fact that I'm physically handicapped (though not enough to recieve any welfare money or anything like that) and my already diminished chances of getting a job got that much smaller. 3 months in and this whole thing is starting to feel hopeless for me. So I come here to ask you guys if you know a way out. Are there jobs that pay a living wage that don't need special training and aren't too physically taxing? Because I can't seem to find any that are willing to take me

131,"I dont even know what advice I'm looking for. I'm just so fed up and angry with the harassment. 

I live in NY and recently got a rental car with Pennsylvania license plates. For what ever reason, I have been getting heckled and harassed nonstop by people at gas stations and other parking lots. 

I recently went to get gas and the other car at the pump in front of me wasn't pulled up far enough. My boyfriend went to pay for gas at the pump we were at but the hose wouldn't reach so we had to wait for the guy in front of me to move forward. A guy in a truck pulled up behind me, and when the car in front of me left, my boyfriend started pumping the gas when I moved forward a little. The truck driver laid on his horn. My boyfriend waved and said, ""it's already been paid for, sorry!""

The truck driver screamed at us to, ""go back to the fucking city,"" while simultaneously calling us hicks. I had no clue why he was saying this until I remembered the license plates. 

There are other little things I noticed, like people riding my ass in traffic, throwing on brights behind me, etc.

The other day I parked in a lot for a local park and forgot to lock my car when I left. I rarely forget but I was having a rough day and my mind was elsewhere. When I came back, I noticed that there was what looked like spit all over the inside panel of the passenger side door. And an ash stain from a cigarette on the upholstery on my side. Someone had also dropped their debit card in my driver side door; maybe someone mistaking mine for theirs or something idk. But there's no way this card belongs to anyone I know and it wasn't there before I got out of the car.

The bank on the card leads back to a bank local to that area. 

Idk what to do about this but I really wish I could unleash all my frustration on this guy. It's a rental for christ's sake.

132,"My friend said that being a teenager is the best part of our lives. This is the point where you will know more about relationships with other people. But I don't feel like I am enjoying it.

134,"So I'm talking about a specific instance, for the future I'm looking into communication cards and better precautions.  But, on Thursday I was hanging out with my friends, FOLLOWING OUR LOCAL COVID GUIDELINES (we're safe children) at one of their houses (we're all teenagers, 17 on average, so my friend's parents' house if we wanna get technical, but I wanted to put that in here for context), it was going well, and we were having fun.  A while into it, I started to have a panic attack, I tried to do some stuff to stop it but it didn't work, and I didn't want people to get worried if I left for too long.  So essentially it turned into a full blown attack.  A bit more context, I very likely have yet to be diagnosed PTSD, which means that panic are a common occurrence in my life, and  probably will be for the foreseeable future.  My friends know that they happen, but don't really have an idea how deep/far it goes, and they have actually been in discord calls with me when they've happened, but they've never seen one in person.

To skip my rambling next paragraph, the tl;dr is that I had a panic attack in front of my friends for the first time, and I had some odd coping behaviors that they probably noticed.

So back to the day with my friend, at the beginning I just left a few times, but a majority of the time I was sitting with them playing the game and rocked back and forth while sort of pressing my palm to my heart.chest.  (I was told it looked sort of like an autistic person stimming).  I was able to talk, but part of me didn't want to so I sort of spoke in rushed bursts.  Two people asked if I was all good, but I sort of lied and said I was fine (which they probably saw through), but I didn't want to draw attention to myself. We decided to go to get ice cream shortly there after and I felt better, but I did keep swinging my arm in a sorta peculiar way.  Once we got to the place I think facing a choice might've been what put me back in a heavier panic.  So, knowing the area around me and that this would probably be the only time I could get away for an extended period of time, I left my bag with a friend who wasn't getting anything, and ran over to the park across the street.  I was down a hill and in a sort of woodsy area so I know that no one saw me while I was down there (I wasn't doing anything dangerous, just more stimming behaviors).  I came back 10-15 (?) minutes later and everyone was eating, I assume they were told that I had run off.  I was fine after that and we just didn't really address any of it.

So now what I actually need advice on: I'm sort of embarrassed about what happened, on their behalf and my own, but I'm also afraid of drawing my attention to myself or coming off as pity-seeking.  This really is just coming from a place of anxiety that they're worried or embarrassed because of what happened.  What should I do?  (Also I can clarify anything, I know that this is really rough).",02Aug2020,1

136,"Out of nowhere, I just started overthinking things and now I don't get what I want from life. Like I don't know where I want to end up or what I want out of life. I feel like I'm just doing things for the sake of doing them. I'm almost 24, earning 6 figures and living with my parents. Been in a solid relationship for 6 months. Recently talked about moving in together for 2 months, living in an Airbnb, before we have to be in a long distance relationship for 6 months. I'm struggling with moving out. Am I too cheap to move out? Is it a fear of leaving the nest and losing a safety net? If either of these reasons are the cause, will I ever get over them? Am I just going to be stuck living at home all my life? I don't get why I'm not willing to spend money to move away. I guess it is nice that I get to save so much money living at home. But it's not like my home life is all that great. My parents are super overbearing and controlling at times, but most days, it's not a big deal. What do I need to do to figure out where I want to live long term? What do I do to figure out what I want out of life? I mean I go to work that I don't hate, it's alright, but also don't love immensely. I have friends, family, financial stability. Yet I suddenly got this feeling of dread. Logically I feel like I should move out, so I can learn how to cook and be an adult. If I move out, I'll finally be able to get a dog. But I moved out in the past, for about 1 month and I moved back home after that 1 month because I was homesick I guess, or I felt isolated in the new state I had moved to. When I moved out previously, I didn't get a dog, even though I could have. I guess I was too cheap, so will things be any different this time? But will I ever get myself to move out if I don't do so now? Aren't I just letting myself get more dependent on my parents? I feel like I'm trapped and am not going to escape this environment until they pass. Did anyone else go through anything remotely similar? What did you do? What can I do to get myself to move out? How do I become okay with spending money on moving out? Should I even move out? One of the nice things about getting to save so much now is that I'm close to having saved enough for a downpayment. Living at home saves you soooo much money considering we are in a high cost of living area, where apartments at my standard levels are around 1500-2000k. That's a lot of money every yea that could have been saved and used to buy a house, when I figure out where I even want to live.",02Aug2020,1

144,"I posted this on r/dreams but I figure I’ll also ask here.

So the backstory: I'm a 17M, my best friend lost the fight to lung cancer 3 years ago. This crippled me my freshman year of High School but I've since recovered and I'm doing pretty well. It think about her from time to time and get a bit down, especially around the anniversary of the death, which is coming up soon. The other thing is well... I was in love with her, even if we were slightly retarded middle schoolers I was deeply in love with this girl. We were friends since childhood. I'm not quite sure if I was in the friendzone or not because I never told her but that's the backstory. 

Anyway, I was sleeping this afternoon after a lengthy road trip and I had this dream. I don't remember how it started but I was at the park walking a dog (which is weird considering I don't own a dog IRL) when I run into her. She looks 17 too, my age,  somehow, even though I've of course never seen her at that age before. First thing I do is drop everything and hug her. The dog at this point completely disappears from my dream. Anyway, I become sort of lucid and decide to walk with her. We have a sort of nostalgic talk recounting all the stupid and mischievous antics that we'd get up to such as pranking our poor 7th grade comp sci teacher. Anyway, the conversation eventually progresses to the point where I end up admitting to her that I was pretty deeply in love with her those last two years of her life and she responds saying that she knew it all along, and then we didn't really touch on the topic again. The rest of the walk was relatively silent but then we reached this bench along a lake which came seemingly out of nowhere and just sat. She puts her head on my shoulder and says that I'm going to wake up soon, like she's aware I was dreaming or something. The last thing I asked her was if I was a good enough friend in the end and whether there was anything I could have done to help her in the end, which had been a real worry on my mind the last few years. She says that there's nothing I could have done and that sticking it out with her till she died was more than enough, since it's more than her siblings and other friends did.

 I don't remember how the dream ended now but I woke up around 5 PM and I've had this feeling of emptiness for the last few hours. I went for a walk, ate dinner, but I still haven't been able to stop thinking about this dream.  I don't know if it's just my brain fantasizing a conversation with her because of her death date coming up, or whether this is some spiritual shit. Truth is, I'm a deist. I believe in a creator who made the universe but I don't believe it meddles with humanity in particular, I don't believe in angels or heaven or the afterlife in general, so I'm not quite sure what to make of this experience.

Its just really hard for me because even though I try being nice to her and politely ask her to help out she just straight up doesn’t do it and I’ve had enough at this point.",02Aug2020,1
158,"So this is probably gonna be a long post, so thanks in advance for reading - also exhausted so please excuse if this post bounces all over the place - how can I make my parents help me keep the house clean?

I'm 19, and for as long as I can remember, my families house has been absolutely disgusting - I think the last time we had a relatively clean house was when I was 11.

Because of this, I never really developed the habit of consistently cleaning things - I've been really working on that and I've made a ton of progress over the last year especially - but no matter how much I do, the house will always be disgusting.

A couple months ago, I rearranged my bedroom, promised myself I'd keep it spotless, and I've done that relatively easily. I've also completely cleaned the kitchen and living room and asked my parents to make an effort in helping me keep it clean - not an exact quote, but basically said ""I know I do most of the mess(untrue, but I'll get to that later) but can you guys really make an effort to try and keep table clean and keep the cooking stuff in the pantry instead of letting it sit on our countertops?""

Instead of saying something like ""yeah sure we'll make an effort with you"" it turns into a blame game where they blame me for all the mess - again, this is just untrue. I play a part, yes, but they act like everything is my fault when all I want is some help to keep the house consistently clean. Whenever, I don't make an effort outside of my room, I'm the bad guy because 'I cause all the mess' but when I do make an effort they do absolutely nothing to help me. Because of this issue I'm waiting for my credit to generate so I can buy a house and move out - should be December-ish.

This is the second time in the last two months I've completely cleaned the kitchen, every bathroom besides the master bathroom, and living room. I refuse to touch their bedroom, the 'guest room' (it's actually the put-all-your-random-shit-here room, but whatever) Last time, it was a mess again after 3 days. Last December was a similar story, except that time it was my girlfriend who was staying at my house who cleaned it with me.

Like I mentioned earlier, I've had my room completely cleaned - yesterday I come home from a 13 hour shift, to see my mom in my room putting a bunch of extra blankets, her art supplies, and a random assortment of board games all over my floor - and no, it wasn't organized, it was just a pile. I'm pissed, but I just store it all in my closet and close the doors, probably to never be opened again. After that, I go on a cleaning spree until 3am the next morning, and clean everything like I mentioned in the previous paragraph. I send them a text and ask them to clean up after themselves with me until  next Saturday, minimum. I go to work today and see my mom had made spaghetti(she didn't save any for me but that's besides the point) and she had left all of her stuff on the countertops. That part of the kitchen was just a total mess again. The 'coffee station' as they call it, was also a mess, and they had left Tropicana juice out on the counter as well.

At this point I'm really annoyed. I put in so much effort to clean the house and I just asked for them to pick up after themselves. Following this, my dad and I argue for 20 minutes until I literally have to force him to help me clean it back up. I'm so fucking sick and tired of feeling like I'm the parent in this relationship. I've literally looked into things like chore lists and resorted to leaving notes reminding them to please pickup after themselves.

Last year I spent ~4 months in rehab for depression/anxiety. The entire time, my parents were telling my therapist, because I mentioned the mess as a huge trigger for me, how much of a slob I am and how I'm I'm reason the house is never clean. When I get home, what do you think the house is like? Disgusting.

Unrelated to the house topic, my mom drove my car to the store last week. I get in it the next day, and what do I see in my passenger seat?

Just a half eaten McDonalds big mac in a bag with fries with a drink still in the cupholder.

Not only does she have the lack of capability to clean up after herself, she disrespects me and my property multiple times by a. Throwing her shit in my room b. Leaving food in my car.

I feel like I have to parent my parents, my mom especially. What can I do to help them contribute? I'm so tired of this. All I want is a normal fucking house, I'm to embarressed to have anyone even come within 30 feet of my house as even the front porch is a mess of my moms random art shit.

Is there anything I can do or do I just have to put up with this until I move out later this year/early next year?",02Aug2020,1

161,"I'm turning 17 in a few days. Long story short my family got evicted from our home back in December because of financial problems. We all lived in this one bedroom apartment for more than 6 months and I haven't had any personal space at all. My mom is unemployed and every time I plead to her to do something she just tells me to be patient and eventually ignores me. No one cares about my emotions or mental health.

All of this is taking a toll on my mind and it's made me very depressed, so I'm thinking about just walking out tonight because I've waited for far too long. I have no money or food at all but I just really want out and live a normal life.

But honestly I'm not sure if I want to run away, I don't know if I might get killed or seriously injured. I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown and I just really don't know what to do.",02Aug2020,1

165,"Recently, a friend of mine informed me that she had been drugged at a party and taken advantage of. I encouraged her to report it, but she was scared that her attackers would take some form of action against her because they have guns and (as she put it) ""really vicious."" I wasn't sure what to do, but she made me promise to not tell anyone, so I haven't told another soul. I've been really supportive, and I told her I believed her, said I would always have her back, all that jazz. I told her that if she felt like hurting herself that she needed to get help, and I've tried to message her every day since she told me so she can talk if she needs it. She reassured me that she wasn't going to hurt herself and that she's doing everything she can to work through it, but I remain the only person she's told.

&amp;#x200B;

However, that isn't what I'm worried about. I'm worried because I've been trying to get ahold of her for the past few days and she hasn't responded to my texts or calls. She has strict religious parents, so at first I thought they took away her phone or grounded her or something, but she usually messages me on a family-owned phone if something like that happens. I hope it's not anything out of the ordinary, but I have this terrible feeling that something's wrong, and my instincts are almost never wrong. What should I do?",02Aug2020,1
166,"I (f18) was walking my dog in down the other night  around 10:30pm, I made sure to stay in mostly lit places during the walk.
Part way down one of the streets two men started cat calling me and whistling, to which I didn’t really pay much attention to. They however didn’t stop, and instead started following me down the street while continuing to yell at me.
I panicked when the two split up on either sides of the road and so I took off down the street. They chased after me but I managed to find a group of people walking and they backed off.

After coming home I told my father and my brother straight away, to which they started laughing at me that I overreacted and shouldn’t have started running. They then proceeded to say that it was my fault that I went out walking that late anyways. 
 
What do I do? Do I just agree with them and say that it was my fault?

167,"This whole situation is just making me feel more and more depressed by the day. They only started dating this year, but the way they act, you’d think they were married. My main issue is really just the fact that I feel like since he’s started dating her, my friendship with him has gone to shit. He acts completely different now, he seems more stuck up and I just hate that I feel like I don’t even know him anymore.

He used to be really someone who I would tell everything to, but now, I just feel really distant from him. I also feel like he thinks he’s somewhat superior to me because I’ve never had a girlfriend. He’s had 1 relationship before this chick so I don’t know how much more superior that makes him, but i feel like she somewhat drives that because she acts very superior to everyone too. 

This girl isn’t my favourite person in the world, like I wouldn’t willingly hang out with her if we went to the same school, but like she’s not the worst thing to happen in my life. We don’t really talk too much as I think her and I just understand our personalities aren’t alike, but we keep it respectful. 

I think what I’m trying to say is I just don’t like who my brother has become, I miss who he used to be before her. I just miss my brother. He’s my only sibling and when we lost our dad (6 years ago), he basically took on that role with me. He never wants to spend time with me anymore and he’s starting to ignore my calls and texts more frequently.

169,"Hey I'm a college student looking to earn extra money and finish my degree. I'm thankful that i still live with my parents so I don't have to worry about rent and stuff like that but I do have a few bills and I'm trying to save up for a car and computer in the future.
I worked at a office job on campus that wasn't too bad and I actually enjoyed since I was basically being paid to sit there and the pay was alright. Since it was a school job I was only able to work a certain amount of hours so I didn't get paid that much but I didn't complain about it. Then the pandemic hit and I was stuck at home but the college still paid me up until about a week ago.
I decided to get another job since honestly I was putting on weight and needed to get out so I got a retail job. The retail job I can work alot more hours and I get paid twice as much as my college job. It is alot more labor but honestly I think I can handle it.
My problem is that when school starts back up (which is in a month) I have to go back to school and I have the opportunity to go back to my old office job but I also want to keep this new job because it pays more.

171,"Hello! When covid hit I was laid off of my job. Luckily I have an aunt who owns a fast food chicken restaurant who has been wanting me to work there for a while so I started in June.

Her son who has been by her side since she owned the restaurant is leaving and she wants me to take his place. The only problem is that I am doing terrible...I feel like I do not have the skills to work in a faced paced serving environment. I am an amazing supervisor and manager I have managed a hotel and my customer service skills are great which she does like. I have a lot of skills but they dont seem to be transferring to my new job. I am making mistakes left and right that I am not used to making. It is leaving me feeling defeated and upset everyday and Yesterday it effected her business. I gave the wrong order to a lady who had driven off and my aunt was extremely upset and said she cant afford to make these mistakes.

If this was any other company I wouldn't be so concerned and I would just keep trying my best and apologising for my mistakes but I know my aunt was looking for someone to depend on when she hired me. She needs someone who can work this job with their eyes closed and who she can trust to run the restaurant when she is not there but so far I feel like my time management skills and focus in a busy restaurant have been awful. I am forgetting the most simplistic things but everyday I go into work trying my best, I go home at night and try to figure out what I did wrong and how to correct it but I make the same mistake the next day. I really dont understand I am not the kind of person who makes the same mistakes over and over again, I go into every job always enthusiastic and try hard to be the best. She is training other people for other positions in the restaurant and they all seem to be picking things up in a snap.

I dont know what to do, I am so full of anxiety after my last shift I really felt so hopeless and down and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I want the best for my aunts business and at this point I dont think its me. Her son is leaving in September so I have put her and myself in a situation where she is loosing her best employee and I am not nearly good enough to even get the basics after 2 months and she would be so stressed trying to train someone completely new. I dont want anyone to get hurt and I feel like it was a mistake to take this job because everybody always says working with family is so complicated, I really thought I was capable of doing what she needed me to do.

178,"Honestly it seems a little bit drastic and I need a fresh opinion. My college program was pretty competitive to get into, and this school application year they changed it to be even more competitive than before.

However, there were/are a lot of things that the school/teachers/admin have done that didn’t quite sit well with me. For one, one very essential course in my first semester wasn’t quite taught at all. Most students had to find the material and teach themselves, it was brought up to the teachers/admin but nothing was really done.

The school also changed the teaching methods partway through the school year, with no prior warning until the next semester started. Before Covid started, almost 80% of students were behind on a particular lab class (lead lab teaching assistant uses an hour of the allotted 2 hours to lecture sometimes). Everything in that class must be done in a lab, and they apparently want us to come back early (mid-August) to finish that. 

They haven’t announced anything yet, but it seems rather likely that this will happen following their previous track record. However, more than half the students probably won’t make it back until the beginning of September due to work and etc. As much as I really like the course and the program itself, I’m starting to feel really stressed and disheartened and I kind of don’t want to continue in the program anymore.

It’s (personally) very sad because even with everything happening I’m seeing my friends and family still loving their chosen paths, and here I am questioning myself and being soured against the program with everything that’s happened thus far.

183,"Hey! I should probably start off by saying that I am a 13 girl, so I’d like that to be take into consideration for what advice can be given.

But let’s begin now. Background: My parents got divorced when I was about 4-5, and my brother and I are at my mom’s house most days normally, and with quarantine, only see my dad about once every month for about 3 days, which I’ll get into.

My mom isn’t the best, but she has been labeled as my “favorite” parent, since she doesn’t hide things from me, is nice, caring, and understands me yada yada yada. My dad, however, is not the best. He tends to yell at me a lot, up to the point of it being verbally abusive. I always cry at least once when I’m at his house, and he’s not even a parent when I’m there. I see him for a total of about 5 hours when I’m there.

Both of them have told me straight to my face that they hate each other. And I have to admit that I have swayed towards my mom, since we’re practically identical with our beliefs, opinions, and political sides (us being far-left and my dad being far-right).

I know this sounds a lot like I’m “quirky” or whatever it is teens and myself in the past have been self-labeled as, but I’m very mature for my age. I’ve been told that by (not exaggerating) almost every adult I’ve talked to. So I understand what’s going on, and I know generally who can and cannot be trusted between my parents.

But lately, my dad has gotten worse. He’s gotten scarier and angrier. It’s gotten to the point where I’m scared he might hurt me, even though I know he wouldn’t. I’ve tried bringing this up with him, but it just makes him angrier that I’m telling him how to parent.

I’ve tried getting advice from my mom, her friends, my friends parents, and basically any adult I trust, and the only advice that I can use that I haven’t used yet is to just avoid going to his house. 

I just really need a way to be able to go to his house without crying, being scared, and getting into fights. I’ve tried avoiding topics that would end up with fights, but it’s usually him that starts it. Tried staying in my room all day, but I have to eat at some point. Tried not talking, but he does the talking for me and forces me to respond or else he thinks I’m not listening and yells. We tried getting into counseling, but he keeps putting it off. And I can’t call CPS because 1. It’s not at the level yet. And 2. He’s my dad and no matter how much I disagree with him, I still love him.

Any advice on what to do? Any insight would be amazing. If you give advice that I’ve already tried, it’s fine, because I didn’t have enough time to put all of the advice I’ve gotten.

The title sounds awful, I know. 
I feel pretty awful, too. 

      A bit of background: Last year around June, I (16F) joined a group chat on messenger. I can’t remember all of the people who were in the original chat but after a few months it dwindled down to 3 other girls. We’ll call them Alexis (17F), Marie (17F), and Madison (14/15F). I had only met Alexis in person a few times, Madison is her cousin, and Marie is their mutual friend. 
      
The girls send selfies in the groupchat asking which is best, vent, fight, shit talk about other girls, and have even sent nudes (no warning). I have never once sent a selfie. I’ve vented one time and I regret it. Something always felt /off/ about the groupchat and I never really felt safe saying anything personal. Maybe I just didn’t feel like I belonged. Maybe my past experiences with friends not being genuine made me skittish of opening. 

I tried to distance myself from them (gradually talked less and less, and then moved the chat to ignore conversation for a few days) they blew up EVERYTHING I have. All of my boyfriend’s socials. Made new accounts. Even going as far to reach out to boyfriend’s mom saying Id gone missing, even though I had expressed during the one time I vented that I didn’t like her and we didn’t talk. Why not is a completely different story. When I came back I saw the screenshot and I got really upset. Bf was understandably upset as well since he doesn’t get along with mom either. I guess I felt like a boundary had been crossed and I felt even more uncomfortable. 

I stop distancing but I interact noticeably less. I don’t respond to texts often, I don’t give advice anymore, and the notifications start making me anxious. 

Fast forward some months and I’m becoming drained. The girls are always asking for advice that they don’t follow and are seriously ALWAYS in some sort of drama. Drugs, stds, boys, bullying girls, just way too much. They even trash talk about eachother sometimes. Madison is ranting about her boyfriend again and sends her messenger login info so we can all see what is going down. I wasn’t interested but I wanted to understand the argument so I looked. 

This is where I may start to be bad. If you frequently use Messenger, you know there is a Search Bar where you can type words and it searches the conversations for that keyword. Curiosity got the best of me and I typed my own name. I regret it. There were 4 pings. One with Alexis, one with Marie, and 2 with Madison’s boyfriend. Boy did my heart sink. 

Alexis and Madison had been talking about me when the groupchat started dwindling people. Madison says “is biggiegoon the ugly one?” and Alexis seems confused. Madison repeats “You said one of them was ugly and only hangs out with nerds. Is it biggiegoon?” She said yes and they both laugh. 

Madison and Marie has been talking about how crazy I was for being upset that they told boyfriends mom I was missing. They said if bf actually loved me, he would’ve told them i was taking a break and I was being a weirdo. 

This one was my breaking point, though. Madison had messaged me on snap one day and yet again asked for advice on her bf. I tried helping, using examples of my past, and listened to her vent. She came to me first. 

In the two pings I had found in her boyfriends chat, I saw that 
1.) she screenshotted all of my personal stuff from the advice and sent it to him. She was saying I talk about me to much and how he’s nothing like what i’ve experienced. They both laughed about me and my experiences. 
2.) she blamed me for something she did entirely on her own (posting relationship stuff in a group and letting people trash him. a member found the bf and showed him). she told him i suggested the group AND what she posted. I had no idea. it caused a huge fight between them. 

I felt so overwhelmed I just couldn’t take it anymore. I tried sucking it up but I ended up calling my bf and bawling my eyes out. I told him it was my fault anyway for looking and that ignorance is bliss. He told me real friends don’t talk behind eachothers back like that. They bicker, fight, and may even take a break, but don’t do that kind of stuff. All I could hear in my head is “I’m the ugly friend I’m the ugly friend I’m the ugly friend”. 

I texted the groupchat and said something along the lines of “i got in trouble and won’t have my phone for a few days”. That was my excuse to leave the snapchat and messenger groupchat. Over the next few days I slowly gained the courage to remove them off my social media. Then I get a text from Madison with just “biggiegoon.” and some from Alexis. I blocked them all. They all have a main account and a back up. It took me a half hour to find all the accounts on all platforms and block. 

Since then I’ve gotten several requests from more accounts i didn’t know about on all platforms. Boyfriends mom has tried cornering him (they don’t live together she visits) saying Alexis wants to know where I am. Marie found my brothers facebook somehow and is grilling him for info. I told him the situation and he was mad but stopped replying. Several of Madison’s friends (including bf) have tried friending me. 

I know that I should confront them and tell them why I left. But I found out in a bad way, I shouldn’t have looked. I feel guilty. I didn’t read anything past what had my name but it was still private. 

There’s still lots of extra info that may matter in my judging but I’m not sure if it’s okay to put in this post since lots of people hate “novels” of text. I will answer any questions. 

So, reddit, am i bad for looking at the texts and blocking my ‘friends’? and should I reach out to apologize.",02Aug2020,1

187,"I don't wanna be alive right now. If my mom hadn't taken my razors, I probably wouldn't be. But I'm not terribly depressed overall or anything, I'm capable of having fun and stuff, but in this moment, I'd rather be nothing than be here. I don't feel like this often, maybe once or twice a month, but this time is probably the most extreme. I can't kill myself, all the tools I could've used are locked in my moms room, and I'm too much of a coward to drown myself.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't wanna feel like this, I wish I could make it stop. But when I don't have a phone who do I call? When I'm not depressed who will believe me? When I know that in four or five days I'll feel better again, why would I go to a hospital that I know my parents can't afford and risk making it worse? But when I know I'll feel like this again next month, when I know it'll probably be worse, how can I not do anything? 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss my old mom, before my step dad came along, who'd be in here supporting me and hearing me out right now. I miss my real dad, who probably wouldn't support me in a normal way, but who could comfort me in his own way, with a nice movie night and my favorite dinner, where we wouldn't have to talk about it but where just being there would be enough to comfort me. I miss my friend, who would've let me vent to her for hours, and who would find just the right words to say to make me alright. But they're all gone.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? Where do I go? I know I can't die tonight no matter how much I want to, so who will make me feel better? I don't know what to do, I just want things to be like normal but when everyone around me just makes things worse and worse how can I keep on a happy face? Sometimes I doubt that I'm ever happy and that I just put on a mask believable enough to trick myself, If I act happy, like the airheaded stoner friend, like the perfect teenage brother, like nothings wrong, maybe I'll become like that. But its useless isn't it?  


I have no plans after highschool and I'm already going into jr year. There's nothing I'm passionate about and so many things I hate. I know for a fact that after 2022 I'll never be happy again and I don't know how to accept that. When I was younger I always said I wanted to be dead by fifty, ending my life at its peak seemed like a good idea, I didn't wanna grow old and frail.

My problem is I don't know what to do as a sixteen year old kid. I am interested in natural science, math and history. I want to do something about science and math and I guess I already know what to do but that's not my problem. 

My problem is that I am trying to study so much subject at home. These are German, Latin, Biology(anatomy included), Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, History of my country and also I am reading books. The reason I am trying to learn Latin is because I speak French.(I am not French.) And for German, I love the German history and I can understand some without any effort thanks to my old German courses. 

I believe this is the reason I got tinnitus(ear ringing) five months ago and it keeps going. Now, I use the tinnitus as an excuse and do not study anything or read. I am still reading sometimes and study these subjects but it's %1 percent of what I used to do. Since, I want to do something about science and math, I need to study(imo) but I do nothing and also there are flaws in my math. I need to be prepared for the next year math. I sit all day long and watch videos from Youtube(mostly politics or history of my country) or play games. I never played games in my life except a few times before the ear ringing. 

Am I stressing over it too much? What should I do? Which subjects should I drop? Please let me know since I hate how it is going for me. Thank you so much. 

Summary: I am studying so much subjects and maybe, it made me have tinnitus. Need advice on how to study.",02Aug2020,1

191,"Long story short the three of us have been a trio since we were little kids, but once we got into our early twenties things took a turn for the worst. 

For context, Emily is someone who commonly misreads people’s actions as them intentionally hurting/excluding her. For example, one year when I was her housemate, she would give me the cold shoulder or be rude to me if I did things with my boyfriend or another friend that day. Or she’d get upset and snarky if I watched a show in my room without her. That gave me a small taste of something I never fully understood about her: how she sees the people close to her. 

My other best friend, Pearl, never intended to hurt Emily. One day Emily got angry at Pearl for something petty, Pearl apologized (even though she wasn’t in the wrong), she moved on but Emily never let it go. Emily didn’t even talk about her feelings for a year. She let it sit and stew for so long and had this pent-up grudge against Pearl. 

I told Emily she needed to be honest and just talk to Pearl about what’s going on. What resulted was an absolutely nasty verbal lash-out from Emily, leaving Pearl crying and not eating for two days straight. Pearl tried to initiate another conversation with Emily to try to salvage their friendship, Emily ignored her and walked away, still scathing and angry at Pearl, refusing to be reasonable or to let go of her anger. I didn’t find out about how this went down until a year after it happened, if I had known, I would’ve said something.

All this to say, Emily has been a great friend to me lately and we have had a lot of fun together, but I can’t ignore her past cruelty towards Pearl, and I’m wondering if I should even be friends with someone like that. Again, Pearl is innocent, Emily misread things and never got outside of her own head. I’ve already told Emily what she should do, and she was verbally abusive in response, and she’ll forever be hateful towards Pearl, unrightfully so. 

Pearl’s moved on, should I walk away too?",02Aug2020,1
192,"Hi, I (32f) am new here. I joined because I’m at a parenting loss. My daughter (14f) just had a birthday a few days ago, just to let clarify how freshly 14 she is.

The other day she came out of her room with a large bandage on her upper thigh. When I asked her why, she told me the dog had gotten excited and scratched her. 
Tonight, she was coming over to play with our baby (m4months) and her shorts rode up. I saw where the bandage was that she had given herself a stick and poke tattoo of a flower with a face in it. 

I’m typically into passive parenting, but I did tell her I was mad, and how dangerous that was and sent her to her room.
I’m not sure where to go from here. Do I try not to make a big deal of it? Do what I can to make it fade?

She said she used henna ink (I’m doubtful of that).
She is currently seeing a therapist for other issues, but doesn’t open up to this one or the others she’s seen in the past.

It makes sense that they would think that since high school is the peak off falling in love for dumb reasons. They think it's an excuse I made up to save myself from embarrassment, but the truth is, I just really haven't. The second reaction is that they think I'm asexual. I'm definitely not asexual because well... I just know.

197,"My boyfriend is on the chubbier side, but I have no problems with it. I think he’s adorable and I love him the way he is. If he ever chose to try to lose weight, I would of course support him in that, but I care more about his health than his size. I’ve dated guys of all body shapes and heights and weights. It’s completely irrelevant to my attraction.

However, my mom would not understand/feel the same way. Weight and size are VERY important to my mom. But it’s deeper than just “I don’t like fat people”. My mom has her degree in Exercise Physiology and is a dance teacher. She also cares a lot about health and fitness, but not always for the right reasons. My brothers are both athletes and I think it makes her feel successful. Even when my dad started to put on a few pounds, she told him to get off his ass and do something for once (My Dad literally works out every day). 

I used to dance a lot, (about 15 hours a week) and was a complete bun-head (ballerina) in high school. I was pretty fit at the time, but I haven’t danced in years. In fact, I don’t exercise at all really, and I’m still the same size/weight, if not smaller than I was in HS. I feel like even though I obviously have a very high metabolism and my BF doesn’t, I’m not any healthier than he is. In fact, he probably eats better/less than I do. From what I can tell, it’s almost entirely genetic, because from looking at old pictures, there’s only been once in his life that he was seriously small, which was around his late teens/early 20s, which I’ve since discovered is because he was bulimic at the time. Neither of us are lazy or slobs, and our jobs require us to be on our feet all day and do lots of heavy lifting, but we’re also not like going to the gym together or jogging together every morning. So even though we look different, I don’t consider myself healthier than him, but my mom would not believe me if I told her this. She would say I was making excuses for him, or that I needed to focus on my health.

This is also personal for her. My family and heritage is from South Mississippi where the obesity rate is highest in the country, and my mom has always tried to distance herself from the negative stereotypes of our state. Her mother just died last year because of some of those same reasons; she wasn’t even that old, just super unhealthy. 

I understand why my mom cares a lot about health and why she feels some prejudice towards people who appear unhealthy, but sometimes her judgment is flat out unreasonable and even though she can be pretty self aware in some aspects, this is a huge blind spot for her. You see, when I was 11, I grew a lot in a short amount of time and was even bigger than all of my friends for a few years. I was eating a ton at the time and not exercising at all, so I got a bit chubby. One day I was getting into the shower and she shamed me for my stretch marks that I didn’t even notice I had. She started telling me I was chubby and needed to lose weight. She forced me to go walking with her almost every day for a couple years. Genetically though, I am actually really petite and have a really high metabolism. So after puberty, I lost the baby fat and now I’m 5’4 and 110 lbs with a 26” waste and she nags me that I “don’t eat enough”.  

I also have a personal history with this in specific regards to past relationships- My first boyfriend was not overweight at all, but he was diabetic and his dad was obese, so she was always concerned about his health and discouraged me from dating him for years because she was worried if we ended up married or with kids, he would “turn into his dad”. 

From what I can tell, my boyfriend is not insecure about his weight, and I don’t want to give him a reason to be. I’ve given him several (legitimate) excuses for why I can’t introduce him to my parents yet. But this is the main one, and I can’t bring myself to explain it to him and I don’t even know if I should. But I’m not sure how to avoid it forever, because he’ll have to meet her eventually, and I don’t know how to prepare for her inevitable reaction to seeing him for the first time. And if he does find out, I don’t want him to think I was keeping him from my parents because I was embarrassed by his weight. Plus, I have to prepare for it to be a regular point of discussion for as long as we stay together, and I don’t know how to deal with that, because this is frankly someone I can see myself spending the rest of my life with. 

Tl;dr: My mom is super judgmental of people who are overweight, and I don’t know how to introduce her to my chubby boyfriend or how to tell him this about my mom.",02Aug2020,1

I guess I'm writing this because I just feel so lost lately, without any motivation or vision for the future. Just to give a backstory, I am a 24 year old living in San Francisco. I graduated from a good university a year ago, and got my dream job as an investment banker. However, when quarantine hit, all my projects came to a halt and I lost my job 6 weeks ago, without a bonus pay out which made up 50% of my expected yearly compensation. It's probably not fair for me to blame everything on COVID - I was just absolutely miserable at work, working with people who only cared about money. I had a girlfriend that I was head over heels for that dumped me at a similar time. Because I worked 80 hours/week for the past year consistently &amp; due to quarantine, I don't have any friends in the city to hang out with. Rest of my family lives on the other side of the coast in New York. I've been living alone in an apartment by myself, without any physical interaction with another human being. I've been doing interviews everyday and just doing the bare minimum to survive. Even if I get a job soon, my previous work just burned me out and I lost all motivation to go at it. I don't know what's happening with my life, I don't know when COVID is going to end. It's a total nightmare. I feel really hopeless right now and I don't really see a good way out of this situation.

My brother just won't stop stealing from me no matter how many times I get mad at him. It's so obvious that I want him to stop stealing from me, but I don't know why he can't see it. He just pretends like he doesn't do anything wrong. Even if I point out he is wrong he just calls me a h** or a b**** for getting mad at him.

My brother has been stealing so much things from me. He even stole money from me(over $200) to the point where I have to get my mom and my sister to help me hide my money. I caught him stealing my money multiple times and once I do he lies, says he will pay me back, but never does. Till this day he hasn't paid me the money he stole from me.

Which honestly shocked me. The reason that I like them is because of the design and vintage look. 

At first I thought that she said no because of the money. Each shirt is around $30. So she originally asked to wait 2 weeks until she got paid. It’s been over two weeks and she’s been paid but is still pushing the hood rat thing on me and my dad jumped in on her side of the conversation. 

They said how their afraid of someone coming up to me in public and being like “You don’t know what it’s like being in the hood” and start a problem which is ridiculous because we live in the definition of a middle class suburbia.

206,"As all dangerous situations begin, I met a dude. We met at a time where my self-confidence was dangerously low, and my mental state wasn't great either. At the time, he was nice, considerate, and straightforward. He ended up grooming me into sending him nudes the first week we started talking. I thought it was okay; he doesn't know where I live and, as far as I'm concerned, nothing too personal for this to backlash. But I was terribly wrong, because even if he doesn't know anything personal, this man has seen a place no one else has (screenshots with face).

For months now, I've been sinking deeper into this pit of dread. He became more harsh and demanding. I suggested that I only wanted to be friends with him after awhile. He accepted this but demanded to know why, and I feel obligated to let him know everything. It's like he has me all under his control because he has pictures. I know he'll never delete them and our relationship just can't be the same. At the first meeting, all he saw was some piece of meat and, to this day, that's all that I can remember. 

So, I want to get out of this hole that I have put myself in. I don't want to feel obligated to a man who has never given anything more than anxiety. I thought that it would be better to ""ghost"" him, cut off all form of communication forever.

So what I need to discuss with her is how we may have to delay school. She’s got about $300. I have $25 set aside. The most I can see me putting aside is maybe 20. Even then we may get $500. No where near the $1010 we need in a month. 

What I need help with is how to being it up to her. I need ideas on how to say we need to delay and try for January and work hard at saving up money. I mentally can’t do my job 5 days a week. And she says mentally she can’t work (another issue we’ve argued over). I know once I tell her about this she’s going to go into a deep depression and just throw everything away school-wise. The reason I tried so hard to work this out. Because I just can’t be the cause of her depression but I just can’t get the money. I’ve sent myself into ruin trying. I’ve given myself panic attacks trying. 

I just need ideas on how to being up gently to her that we need to delay the start of school. I don’t want to tell her. I hate conflict and it seems all we’ve done lately. But I just can’t find the money. Half my stuff is broken or old. Even if I sold it all I wouldn’t get much money. 

I guess I need help on how to tell her school can’t happen unless she is able to help me out on the job front. Because the moment I being this up I know it will be: 
-but covid
-no one will hire me (yeah she usually doesn’t get interviews) 
-I know. I want to but I can’t 
-I have depression/anxiety and I can’t make myself fail

But right now she will fail it all. So, yeah I need help on how to tell her gently. Preferably without us screaming at each other. 

Thanks.",02Aug2020,1
210,"My sister and my grandma planned a trip without me knowing. The trip is to a resort out of state, close to where my sister lives. While we were having dinner, it was dropped on me that I would be driving my grandma to the resort and meeting my sister for a long weekend. I was excited at first, but as I have thought more about COVID and my grandmother’s age, I really don’t want to go.

My grandma (who is 87) doesn’t gaf about COVID. When I told my sister I didn’t want to be an accessory to her possibly getting sick (by driving her out of state), my sister said that my grandma is an adult and will do what she wants regardless. She also said that my grandma should not spend what could be the last years of her life cooped up if she doesn’t want to be. Now I’m in a position where I am meant to be driving her and I could not take the guilt if anything out of the ordinary happened. COVID scares me. I feel uneasy when I see people’s Instagram posts of weddings and vacations, now I’m going to be one of them. 

I might be overthinking all of this. I just want to know how other people would feel in my position and what they would decide to do in the end.",02Aug2020,1
211,"Hey guys,

I'll give a back story to my situation. My current roommate and I have known each other for 10 years. We went to the same highschool, college and now work nearby. Since toronto makes us pay out the dick for rent, and we trust each other enough to live together, we both took an apartment near work. My roommate is absolutely amazing, as he makes sure he cleans up after him self, cleans the house, never missed a payment on rent and checks off everything on the good roommate list. 

The issue is as follows. We have a mutual friend from college who had a rough relationship. She had a bad breakup with a long term boyfriend and had nowhere to go. So she came to our place and asked if she can stay for a few days till she figures out how to proceed with her own life. She was a good friend of ours and welcomed her. But then the lockdown hit, and she lost her job. Its been 3 months since and she just found a job and found a new place to move out to. What my issue is is that if she stayed for a week or two, it would have been fine, but my roommate and i took care of her for 3 months cost free. My roommate is a gentleman and says that he helped her as if he would help his younger sister and doesnt need the money. But I don't see it that way. I would definitely pay a third of the bills when I get my paycheck. What does a compromise look like in this situation and how would we approach our lady friend with this compromise?",02Aug2020,1

I don’t really have much skills besides working hard I guess, and I have t gotten anywhere in life. I work at a job I despise, and barely have free time anymore. I work almost 40ish hours and barely have time to do new things, don’t even have a car and bike, and live with my parents (which I feel guilty as I feel like I’m mooching off them, though I help with rent and stuff).

215,"Normally, when it comes to things that are ""wrong"" or unfair/unjust, I don't have the capacity for care since I am really busy working on myself.

But, when it comes to people I am close to, or people who have or have had an impact on my life, I can't help but be incredibly irked when they do unjust things.

Like when my mom admitted she cheated in Medical school and laughed about it. Or how my sister brags about her ""high college GPA"" from all online classes and she probably cheated on easily. Or how my friend is trying to claim unemployment when he's never worked a day in his life. 

The list goes on and on.

Like, literally everything about them comes into question. These are the types of things only deceitful, opportunistic (in the worst way), greedy, desperate/pathetic, shameless, individualistic, envious, etc. people would do.

It's one thing to consider, but to actually commit to these things, and without hesitation due to conscious, but rather hesitation due to fear of getting caught. It's fucking repulsive to me.

I feel like I can't trust these people anymore.

216,"TL;DR:
I believe my boss is using drugs again, and I don't know what to do. For the sake of the business, him, or myself.

I work at a cell phone repair shop in California that has been around for about 8 years. I've been here for almost 2, with another 7 years of experience fixing consumer electronics. I'm just a technician here, however I have manager-like duties without the pay and title. I have access to view the shops income, access to the safe, security cameras, social media accounts, business accounts, inventory orders, etc.. I'm currently in a situation where my boss is pretty much not involved in his shop whatsoever...

So throughout my first few months here, I involuntarily stumbled across MANY MANY private aspects of his life, as his personal accounts were linked to the shop. 
From pictures that got synced to the shops PoS system, to bookmarks on the computer, and a mistext from his dad... Even old reviews on the store itself... I found out that dude has been (possibly still) struggling with drug usage. Pills and heroin. The mistext was meant towards my boss, but got sent to me by accident regarding his (at the time) situation in rehab, in which I was asked to stay silent. My first few months here, my boss was in rehab. I seen him a total of TWO times.... Before he went MIA for months.
After said text from his dad, he sat with me in person and explained to me that my boss had been hit by a car a few years ago, and has been overcoming years of back surgeries. Then proceeded to cover up his text to me by saying my boss was sent out of town for a few months on surgery that would potentially be life changing for him. I asked no questions as it wasn't any of my business. 

In the meantime while my boss was (allegedly) out for ""surgery"", the store literally fell on my shoulders. I ran it every day of the week, while also training additional help for myself. I did everything I possibly could to care for this business as if it were my own. The shops reviews went from a consistent 1-3 stars to constant 5 stars. We saw a huge increase of customers once I got us active on social media. The gross sales went up from average $300 daily to about $700 average. 
After 4 or so months he came back from ""surgery"" and gave me much credit for turning the direction of this shop completely around. I got him to remove his personal accounts to keep business and personal separate. I did that for his sake, as I don't think it's a good idea for any employee (myself included) to stumble across their boss's drug addiction. I kept my mouth shut and never confronted him with what I know. Previous workers told me what they know about my boss, pretty much confirming all my suspicions.

After coming back, he had all these ambitions for his business to grow! Expanding, moving locations for a larger space, turning a spare room into a museum of some sort, taking in more than just cell phones (computers and game systems and such as I have many years of experience). I supported each and every idea and pushed him to pursue... something... None of which has ever been acted on.

At that time, he came in maybe twice a week for a few hours, but mostly excused his absence due to major back pains that he cannot come in. I supported that, as I'm sure what he's going through, pain wise, is something that I'll never be able to relate to. But then it became a pattern. 
When customers needed to meet with him, I was in charge to meet with them instead. When we needed to hire replacements, I was put in charge to interview them, while repairing devices and assisting other customers.. as well as train them and set up a schedule.

Over the course of 2020, his involvement in the shop dropped tremendously... And it's not due to the virus.
He came in maybe a handful of days a month for less than a couple hours each day. For the entire month of June, he came in to his own business for a total of 8 hrs. Last month, July, 1.5hrs total presence in the shop. Only because he was required to pick up and drop off documents for a new hire (because our last one left after suspicion of our boss's drug addiction), needed to do bank runs as well.
That's it.
Every time I see him or talk to him, he's very lethargic and gets confused very easily. Telltale signs of drug usage. He has stated (without any prompt) that his new back treatment leaves him very loopy. That's a pattern that happened around this same time last year, not too long after rehab.

Now, over the last couple months I've been pushing and pushing him to grow the business further by getting a laser machine to offer Rear Glass repairs on the newer iPhone models. I've made the argument that after about 20 or so repairs, it pays for itself.. not to mention, we'd be one of the only shops in town to offer that repair for customers. 
I've also been pushing him to allow us to take on other kinds of repairs, such as computers, so we can just simply grow as a business. I'm constantly met with pushback.. he says he's low on shop funds. Idk how... I've seen the Net Profit for the shop... 

Idk how much he pays himself, but July there was around $8.5k net profit. On top of that, he recently got some business loan that gave him $9k to help with the possibile financial struggle from COVID. Idk anything about it but he claims it doesn't have to be paid back. All I know is that the money that should be going into the business, isn't. We've basically just flat lined and unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about it..

Now, I've come to terms with his habits. I know nothing I do will change his view of his business. I'm just a tech with a ton of responsibilities, simple as that. What also concerns me is that he's volatile. Anything can change in a moment's notice. I'm concerned that he may instantly change his opinion of me and just drop me or reduce my pay out of nowhere. Back when we were classified as IC's, he lowered someone's pay by $2 five days after increasing their pay just because they weren't performing ""to standards"", when they were never even told to do anything more than what they were already doing. In the almost 2 years that I've been here, we've gone through 5 different techs.. each of them quite underpaid.

At one point while we were IC's, we were getting paid $11/hr.. which at the time was less than minimum wage. I've even heard someone starting at $10 before their $1 raise one month after. Me personally, I get paid $16/hr. I've proven to be a valuable asset to not only him, but his dad (who pretty much took over for 4 months while my boss was MIA). If not for him giving me a decent raise, and if not for him basically forcing his son to keeping me in a position where I essentially run the shop for him.. I'd most likely be getting paid less than what I'm worth. He's talked about reducing my pay to $15 at one point...

Anyways, I'm getting off topic.

I'm conflicted on what the fuck to do... Idk whether confronting my boss on his addiction in the most non-attacking way I can possibly think of is a direction I should go... Or if I should just talk to his dad directly and lay all of my knowledge on the table so we can get him the help he needs.. or if I should just simply keep my mouth shut and let whatever happens, happen.

What really set my confliction off was one of the days he was in before his involvement in the shop dropped, probably back in May I believe, he bought a tablet off a customer after taking them into the backroom for a minute with the door shut. That may not sound alarming by itself.. but.. the entire time I'm listening to the negotiation, my boss is expressing no interest in buying the tablet up until I heard the customer say ""I'll give you this and 4 shakes of heroin if you do this deal"".. (I swear on my 2 kids that's what I heard... but I was on the other side of the room and I don't know 100% if that's what the customer said..) he then brought the customer in the backroom for a minute, comes back out and move forward with the deal..

That was an extreme red flag to me.. in the moment I wanted to say something, but I didn't. Now, 3 months later, his absolute zero interest in showing up to his shop leads me to believe that my instincts were correct.. he's fallen down that rabbit hole again and I didn't intervene when I could have..",02Aug2020,1

I have spoken to my best friend and therapist about it, the concesous is I regret my actions and simply learned from the mistake.

225,"well, first some backstory:  I was an alone kid but i really needed a friend. i wanted to have a friend. during secondary school, i seemed to have some but I'm still not sure whether they are my friends or not(now i am 19M). during the same secondary school, i was severely both emotionally and physically bullied by my classmates and peers. during high school, i started to have friends who i really love but not many tho. now I'm studying my bachelor's and still, I do not have close friends.   
what it comes to the problem, i think in secondary school (early years), i figured out that sometimes i can tell small lies and it would help me to build a relationship with people or lies could make some situation better or generally help me. I could not even imagine that it would be a snowball and bring a butterfly effect. 

all the lies were small ones like i can drive cool, i dated \*person x\*, i did this i did that, i went to that place, to this place, i tried this, i like this and so on. here are some examples:

i like Mercedes; i like Chelsea; i can drive cool; i dated some people; i been earning money since I'm 13, i worked in multiple places, and some miserable lies during the conversation. 

so what's the problem which appeared now? some time ago i revised myself and i just found out that the person who i see in the mirror. i am not me. the person i developed through the lies does not match with me.  

now I do not have close people except my family, my gf and a couple of friends. i am trying to stop telling lies but I do not want and cannot tell these people that i had lied so much. my thoughts about that are going crazy these days, i do not know what to do. any advise is welcomed, Thank you",02Aug2020,1
226,"I’m having some roommate troubles and need some advice/reassurance.

Me and my two roommates have lived together since January. Over quarantine, we’ve gotten extremely close. We have spent the past few months together constantly. However, I planned a trip to Washington state to visit one of my close friends from college. While I do know traveling poses a major risk, I took all of the proper safety precautions recommended by the CDC during my trip.

Neither of them expressed any anxiety about me going. In fact, they seemed excited for me. During the trip however, they blew me up over text out of nowhere. They asked me if I could quarantine with my mom. When I asked her, she said no. She is in the process of moving houses and the timing could not be worse. I have no other family in the area and have nowhere else to go. Nonetheless, they gave me a lot of trouble and basically suggested that I was selfish and a bad friend. 

They chose to go home to their families’ houses in the meantime and were not too happy about it. I was very apologetic and accommodating. I went and got tested for COVID-19 and the results came out negative. Then, a week after I arrived home, my grandmother unexpectedly passed away. She lives out of state and the funeral was planned for two days later. My dad offered to fly me out for the funeral and the first thing I did was ask them if they were okay with me going. Without any other word, they asked me if I would quarantine elsewhere after I came home.

I was fed up at this point. I realize that my first trip was something I had total control of. It was planned months in advance, and I regret not making plans to quarantine elsewhere. But this time, I had no control
of the situation. I haven’t seen my grandparents in seven years, and I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye to my grandmother. 

To try to mend things, I called the state health department for professional advice. They told me that there was no mandate to quarantine in a different residence. In fact, they said it was much safer to quarantine at home as long as I stay in my room and use my own bathroom (as well as following CDC guidelines). These are resources I wouldn’t have if I stayed with a family member nearby and I tried explaining that to them. I even offered to hire a cleaning service. They still were not sympathetic and told me that they were angry and upset with me. No remorse or sympathy over my situation either. 

I know the risks that come with traveling. My first trip was a choice. And I should’ve done better as a friend and as a roommate. But going to my grandmother’s funeral was something completely out of my control. Everything was last minute. And I knew I had nowhere else to go after my trip. My roommates resent me now and I’ve had constant anxiety and stress since this all started. I don’t know how to handle this or what to do. It makes me sick and I’m disappointed that we can’t come to a reasonable compromise. What should I do? We are planning on discussing this when we’re all home, but I’m not sure whether I should be completely honest or just listen to them. I want to move on from this.",02Aug2020,1

228,"Two years ago, I moved away from my small hometown to a bigger city in a different  State. I lived there up until March and prused a dream I had ever since I was a child, and even though it didn't quite work out, I feel like I learned a lot doing it and grew a lot as a person, as well as made new friends for the first time probably in like a decade.   


After losing my civilian job because of covid, and because I wanted to spend more time with my grandparents before they pass away (all four are alive and I'm 26), I moved back to my small town and am staying with my parents.   


Now there's a lot of shit about this situation that sucks big time, but I've been trying to stay positive and have picked up some new hobbies and have been enjoying spending time with my family. When it comes to my friends, though, it's a different story. I haven't seen them much since I've been back, but the few times I have the vibes have been bad.  


 It was always kinda one guy who held the friend group together and honestly I still get along ok with him in a one on one situation, however, in a group he becomes unbearable and we are always at each other's throats. He's also a very manipulative person, bordering on sociopathic and I never know if anything he says is on the level or if he's just trying to fuck with me to some unknown end.   


Then there's the above guy's is his brother, who is a massive racist and has made his entire family considerably more racist in the years I was gone. He treated me like shit when we were in high school but he's nice to me now because I think he realizes that I'm one of the last people on earth outside his family who will associate with him. I can't hate the guy because he is pretty pathetic, but we argue about politics all the time, conversations which are always instigated by him because he has nothing else to talk about but the shit he sees on pol.  


The next guy is kind of a nothing. I feel bad talking about him like that because he is a genuinely nice dude, but he's a terrible conversationalist and just not too bright.   


The final component of the group is a guy who's kinda a druggie burnout (which is honestly cool with me cause so am I), but my main issue with him is that he's just a total flake that can't be counted on for anything and never wants to hang out one on one. He's probably the guy I'd most like to keep in contact with, but it's so much effort wrangling him to do anything I feel like it's not worth it. Also, he has a long term GF, who's friends he just refuses to introduce me to, which pisses me off.  I'm not a bad looking dude or socially impaired or anything, and I just can't figure out why he blows me off every time I bring it up.   


Sorry for all that bloviating, but I wanted to get across how I've been feeling about these people. Now, the thing is I don't have any other friends here, and without these guys, I'll be entirely socially isolated aside from my family. Do you think I should cut these people out of my life entirely and risk being a total loner? I just feel like in this age of covid it will be hard to make friends or meet new people.

230,"I’m (20m) currently stuck in this rut where I think I’m one ugly mf. Whenever I’m single, which I currently am, I can’t help but to think of my looks in the worst of ways. But I’ve had quite a few girlfriends before. And all of them were very attractive. I hate the numbers scale, but they were 6-8’s. Although none of them lasted long where relationships are concerned, I know they weren’t with me just out of pity or whatever. I must be a good looking guy to attract women like that. But I still can’t help but think I’m dog shit ugly. 

How do I get over my physical insecurities? Is my brain being realistic with myself, or is my brain poisoning my self esteem?",02Aug2020,1
231,"So, something I kind of noticed is that I have a lot of interests but sometimes I sort of feel like I don't do them enough. I like art and linguistics and video games or whatever, but I find myself sometimes lacking the drive to get better and do them more, and most notably, focus. I notice that I spend a lot of time not doing much and when I try to draw I just end up doodling random stuff with no clear idea of what I'm doing, I said that over the summer I would do a lot more art and focus on it, but now it's August. I blame this a little bit on the fact that I was excited for my city's art museum to reopen, but they plan to stay closed for now. When I study languages or work on conlangs I end up just clicking on different Wikipedia articles and looking at random stuff. When I play video games, I always want to play them and have fun in the game but I find myself getting bored halfway through and feeling like I don't really want to do anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's a kind of my main problem, when I try to do things I end up not being productive and I end up doing nothing, I want to do these things, my issue isn't motivation just that I feel like I can't focus on things. 

  
Plus, sometimes I get too many thoughts in my head about different things and feel kind of restless, I feel like I have a drive to do more things with art and such, but for some reason I have a hard time bringing myself to do them. I'm not depressed or anything, I still start to do them I just feel kind restless with life sometimes. How do I get rid of that feeling and just start doing things?  


Sorry if any of this sounded weird or whatever, not very good at using words as well lol. It's just that there's a lot of things a want to do or achive, like learning a ton of languages or getting good at art, but I almost feel like I can't push myself to do it. When I learned French, I was able to do it since I was thought by my mum and by school since I live sorta but not really close to French Canada.   
I hope this post wasn't too busy or hard to read, if it is and even if it's not I'll clarify anything.   
Thank you :)",02Aug2020,1
232,"Hello, this is a bit of a long story, but I feel like I am at a breaking point. So my wife and I have been fighting a lot more recently. Mainly about how she feels my family doesn't like her. She has given me a few examples and I have agreed with her that that shouldn't have happened, but from what my family has told me they love her and are happy I have her in my life. In the 10 years, we have been together she has only seen my life about 9 times. She feels they don't make her feel part of the family, and I've explained it's just cause we haven't seen them enough for them to get to know her. She states its more hate and that she can't love me cause she sees them in me.

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem we have not had sex in over 6 months. She states again it's causing my family and that she can not sleep with someone who reminds her of them. Also, I have some health problems and she has told me I need to take better care of myself (it's hard for me since food has become my only comfort).

She also has things that she could fix like the fact that she has always put her friends and work before me. \[Has told me straight up that her work was more important\]. I worked my entire time to put her through her Dr. Program and never got a real thanks. Whenever there is a fight regardless of whose fault it is, I am always apologizing. I'm always the one who has to fix it. 

We have signed up for couples therapy but we are only 4 sessions in and it looks like we might have to change therapist...since our current only made it worst. 

I'm 28 years old and I love her more than anything. I want us to work but I don't know what to do. I know I'm leaving a lot out but I don't have any friends to talk to so I was hoping anyone here can help. She has stated that maybe she should stop and just become roommates. 

Plus cause of her graduating and making more money we sign a lease on a new place and are financially stuck.",02Aug2020,1
233,"Fujoshi - a woman (often straight) that fetishizes (anime) gay men. Sometimes they ship real life straight men together non-jokingly.
Yaoi - basically just gay anime, most aimed at women. There's always adult scenes.
BL - short for boys love, romance between lgbt men. Most of the time there's no adult scenes.

So, I dislike fujoshis. They fetishize gay men and don't find anything wrong with it, sometimes they also find it ""quirky"" I'm ace but they make me extremely uncomfortable. I irk at the thought that some straight girls out there are relieving themselves with yaoi hentai... I got into the fandom for a short while till I found out that almost all the women had some sort of sick fantasy of having a d'ck and f'king gay men in the ass... Very few of them were actual gay/bisexual men. I don't kink-shame, but this was just straight up sick. I thought being a fujoshi meant enjoying BL, so I considered myself as one. I should've been more suspicious, since all the top yaoi stories were smut. In conclusion, I don't have a good impression of fujoshis.

Anyways, my friend recently just got into yaoi and now she's sending pictures of gay anime bottoms getting pegged. It makes me uncomfortable but at the same time I'm also worried because she probably doesn't know that what she's doing is kind of... weird. I'm not hating on her, I like her as a friend but whenever she sends stuff like that it makes me uncomfortable 😿 I've been trying to convince myself that she'll grow out of it, but to me it looks like it's only getting worse... I don't have the heart to tell her and she'd probably think I'm making fun of her. Does anyone have some advice on what to do? Or maybe even a method on how to brainwash myself into thinking that wanting to peg gay men as a straight woman is okay? I need help.",02Aug2020,1
234,"So last night, a little less than 24 hours ago, my neighbor was having a big house party and someone was shot to death. 2 other people were shot but their injuries were non lethal. I saw about 30 people running and screaming through my street. Me and my best friend/roommate heard the shots. I heard a lot of screaming he didn’t. Me and my friend then turned off all our lights and watched the panicked crowd run all over the streets and get in vehicles and speed off. I wasn’t bothered by it. I’ve spent a lot of time on reddit and live leak and seen way worse. But I usually watch them silently. Sounds really get to me. I’m a bit of a musician so my whole life is sound. And sounds really stick with me and scare me. They haunt me. Even back to the scary maze scream or the scary car video when I was a kid still scares me cause of the sound. Especially the music to the car video. Makes my heart race and my chest hurt just hearing the first 2 seconds. But back to the shooting. I can still hear the shots very clearly and the screaming. I wasn’t bothered at all last night. And was able to talk to the police and come back to my house and chill with my friend for a few hours unfazed. A little excited cause of all the commotion but not really concerned or scared. But now tonight, I just got off work, and something feels wrong. My stomach has a weird feeling and I keep replaying the sound of the shots in my head. Also I’m schizophrenic, so I keep hearing things outside my window. And I keep getting worried that someone else is going to get shot, or someone is going to shoot through my window. But I feel like it’s subconscious paranoia. Like I’m doing other things like playing Xbox and listening to Jontron videos but it’s just like a feeling in my stomach that’s “as subtle as a shotgun and heavy as a brick”. Like it’s there but it’s not. I keep thinking I hear screams. And some people might say “well you have schizophrenia” but usually it isn’t voices. Every once in a while it’s like I hear someone say “hey” but no ones there. It’s never actually loud or disrupting like these ones. My schizophrenia is usually like knocks or weird lights or shadows under doors or seeing people then doing a double take and realizing it’s a stack of donut boxes or something. But I don’t know what I should do. It sucks cause I was sitting in my room in my chair when I heard the shots and screams, just like I’m doing now. And we don’t have a tv in our living room and my friend is asleep. So I don’t know what to do. I don’t have many friends outside my roommate, and I don’t feel like talking about it to them. The air conditioning just kicked on and it scared the ever living fuck out of me because it’s a window unit. The same window I heard the shots and screams from. I’ve never been paranoid like this before. So any advice would be cool. Sorry for the long ass post.",02Aug2020,1

239,"I live with my best friend and my partner. My best friend likes to sleep in till 1PM in the afternoon so I have always asked my partner to not make any noise in the kitchen or to do his washing until after she wakes up. This has been our routine for the past 7 months. 

However, my partner and I have been laid off from work due to COVID and we’re home more often now. My best friend started her pracs this week, and she gets up at 5:30AM and that’s when she slams everything and it wakes us up. 

I have spoken to her and asked her to quiten it down, twice. The second time I asked, I told her I felt bad for bringing it up because I don’t want her to feel like I am attacking her, and asked if there was anything my partner and I could do differently. She stated no. The first time I asked her was when she asked me to pick her up from the shops, and I kindly asked her to please be mindful of the noise she makes and that there is no need to slam the front door. She stated, “I won’t be waking up that early anymore.” Which has been a lie because everyday for the week she’s been waking up at the same time and leaving at the same time. 

And not once has she changed her habits, and it’s really getting on our nerves. I really don’t know what to do. My partner wanted to slam the doors in the middle of the night but I told him to not be petty. He is also very blunt, and my friend is sensitive, so I don’t ever want it to reach that stage where my partner will end up bluntly telling her to “shut the f up”. I have lived with random people before who are as loud as anything, but have never heard them slam doors and drawers / cupboards like my best friend does. 

I felt it was easier to approach the random housemates compared to my best friend. And I would feel like an ass approaching her again because I believe twice she should have gotten it to her head. I am beginning to feel like she is deaf.",02Aug2020,1
240,"Hi everybody! I typically have conversations with my brother about a broad range of topics. Lately, I've noticed he has become very ignorant. When conversing about the coronavirus he stated that it is fake and proclaimed the ""New World Order"" started it to decrease population. Immediately, my mind went racing to conspiracy theories hole that he may have fallen in. I debunked multiple ""facts"" he pointed to and addressed every idea. He constantly jumps around different topics and fails to address any logical point. If I speak out certain ""facts"" or continue asking questions he starts to tell me that I have no idea, that I've been brainwashed and that there would be no point in reasoning with me.

He stated that one of his favorite Youtube channels was this dumb fuck - White Board Gematria - please give me your thoughts about his background.

How can I help my brother get out of this type of thinking? What can I do to set him up to where he can make logical decisions about such stories? What can he do to address the problem? Please, any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

242,"So my group of 2 other friends and I have been friends since the beginning of high school and now that we have all graduated we’re all starting to plan everything out and begin to take control of our lives except for one. She has always been a little childish and reliant on others but we had figured it would just be a phase and once she saw that things are completely different after high school that she would know what to do but unfortunately she is still in this “phase”. She continues to always rely on everyone else to tell/remind her when to do important things like apply for college or register for classes, she continues to worry about childish things like her boyfriend not posting her on his ig or not being liked by someone else, and the other friend and I have noticed that she is not really grasping the concept of a reality check because she continues to live as if we are in middle school with not a care in the world but boys and crying over her thinking that someone hates her because they haven’t texted her in a week. I grew up in a Hispanic household with hardworking and divorced where nothing was just handed to me so I suppose I can’t really understand anything other than work work work but we are both concerned for her wellbeing because we are all taking different paths in lives but want to make sure everyone makes it out okay. She is incredibly sensitive and defensive to anything she does not want to hear or accept and we are planning on have a sit down with her to talk to her about accepting the reality that we aren’t children anymore and not everything is going to come as easy. This is coming from a place of concern and love not a place of ridicule or embarrassment of her so we want to make sure that she is gonna be okay in case he and I aren’t there to help her with something because the reality is nobody ever knows what’s going to happen and if she doesn’t learn to grow up soon we’re worried she’ll never be able to.

244,"i had a small fight with my friend (her alias will be dove) over some anime. she went totally out of proportion and even my other friends say she was acting childish. 

dove is never really there for me. we have a group chat with my other two friends where we rant sometimes. when any of my other friends rant dove will write big paragraphs about how she's there for them and loves them. if i rant, she does one of three things. ignores me, changes the subject, or says something along the lines of ""that sucks"".

i recently told my friends i wanted to use he/him pronouns exclusively (im trans ftm). i understand it might take a while to get used to it but shes known for two years and i enforced my pronouns for about a month now. she still misgenders me and doesnt apologize even though i say over and over to please acknowledge and apologize whether in person or later over text. she never does. every time we hang out she will misgender me.

im not one to expect something in return when i give a gift but on my birthday i had to reschedule because she said she had plans (even thought she agreed to the day and time two days before that). she didnt say happy birthday the whole time and didnt give me a gift even though i gave her a really thought out present for her birthday. (might seem petty but i wanted to include it.)

before we became friends, she would talk shit about me a lot. an old mutual friend of ours even confirmed it. dove made a post on her instagram story saying ""im the type of bitch to become friends with people after talking shit about them.""

the whole reason we even fought was because of some anime and her gatekeeping me. i am always the one to apologize and reach out after fights so i decided to see if she'd do it first instead. she never gives effort so i just wanted to see if she would this time. (its a very one sided relationship) she hasnt messaged me at all in 5 days. 

im conflicted because if we stop being friends, itll pretty much break up our friend group. she only hangs out with them if im there so im sure she wont bother talking to them or hanging out with them if her and i dont talk anymore. we planned a secret santa and i dont want to mess anything up but i dont think i can keep dealing with someone who doesnt care about me.

We talked and talked until 9AM(whole night) and for every and each theme we touched we had a same opinion. We just clicked, amazingly but we did.

* Is possibility ruining a friendship worth a risk?
* Is it a good thing to talk with her ex?

254,"Im just looking for outside, 3rd party perspectives. You need a lot of backstory to really understand what im asking. This is VERY long, im telling you right now.

Im american, 23F. I am in the process of moving out with my boyfriend but the rest of my siblings still live at home. The youngest of us is 15.

In the mid 90s, my mom was engaged to a guy she met in college. After college, she joined the peace corps and went to a newly-ex-ussr eastern european country for 2 years. There, she met a guy, broke off her previous engagement, and got married to this new guy. He is my dad. They moved to the US after her volunteering was up.

Shortly after starting their life together, my mom discovered that a) my dad is an alcoholic (he denies this) and b) he is socially/emotionally stunted. My mom is very extroverted and loves to throw parties and socialize. My dad hates having to small talk with people he doesnt know. He comes off as rude without meaning to (sometimes he means to) and is more interested in things like science, engineering, tinkering/building things, etc. He is also an enormous atheist/antithiest and is unable to hold back when people express religious sentiments. He is incapable of lying. He will fully admit to doing whatever it is he has done, but he may misinterpret the situation and not see what he has done as wrong. My mom interprets all this as ""he doesnt care about me or my friends"" and has struggled with not having the partner she needs emotionally. He was never able to meet her where she was in times of crisis and eventually my mom ""diagnosed"" him (she is no type of medical professional) with aspergers. He rejects this label. I identify with it personally and share many traits with him that my mom finds abhorrent. But thats up to him to claim i guess.

After moving to the US, my dad begged my mom for kids. He wanted 1 or 2. She didnt. Eventually, she agreed to 1. She fell in love after having me, the eldest, and ""persuaded"" him to have 5 kids total. This is what my mom does best. She gets her way, no matter what. It can be a good thing, but obviously can be misused as well. I have heard from my younger siblings that she has bragged about getting my dad drunk to the point that he didnt know what was going on (which takes A LOT) whenever she decided she wanted another kid. Dont really know how to process that. 

My dad also had a daughter from a previous marriage before he met my mom. ""Carol"" was a few years older than me, but we were close enough to bond. She visited most summers on a greencard but was never treated like the 5 of us. He made it clear that she was different, lesser. I would say she was emotionally/mentally abused by him. He refused to send her christmas/birthday presents, he rarely visited her, generally made it clear that he hated her mom and did not prefer her. Compared her and my intelligence, our appearances, behavior, etc. By the time carol was 18, she was homeless, messing with drugs, and pregnant. My mom helped her move to the US permanently and my dad hated it. She eventually moved out with her kid and is doing better, but my dad continues to treat her badly and this treatment extends to her kid, his only grandchild. 

My mom loves to help people, even to the detriment of those already in her care. Since i can remember, we have always had people staying in our house- a random immigrant family who got a greencard, my dads mom, distant cousins who immigrated to the US, etc. We as kids thought this was super fun since we had the room in our house and it was like always having friends over. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this as long as all parties are in agreement. My dad, however, has always had issues with noise and people in his personal space. For as long as he lived with my mom, he felt his personal space violated constantly. He couldnt do anything about it because my mom would threaten divorce and he didnt want to lose access to his kids. If someone is around (like, in his general vicinity- at a party, in the house, etc) and he does not see them as a person who ""belongs"", he gets very stressed and this person will inevitably find out how he feels about it. Any discomfort leads him to drink and then he becomes belligerent, argumentative, and mean. He, to my knowledge, has never been physically violent. Mild example: we were having a party and my dad was in charge of making pizzas in the wood-fire brick oven he made in our backyard. My mom invited the art teacher from my school, who is vegetarian. He thinks this is stupid. She asked him for a vegetarian pizza and he ""jokingly"" insulted her and refused to make such a pizza. iirc, he put meat on it anyway that she had to pick off. 

Sidenote: Often, things that he says are jokes end up being very hurtful to the people on the receiving end. He genuinely doesnt seem to understand that his delivery doesnt come across as joking and also cant understand why someone would be offended by many of the things he says. Again, aspergers question mark?

So. About the time i entered middle school, a former friend of my moms, known to be irresponsible, a liar, and intensely mentally ill with no effort to get herself treatment, came to our house the week before christmas and basically dumped her kids on us. She had 5 at the time. 1 had passed away as an infant due to neglect. She continues to find partners and have children to this day. My mom took in 3 of these kids over the course of several years, ages 14, 12, and 5 at the time we got custody. The rest were scattered among other family/friends of this woman and some ended up in the foster system. Every so often, one would end up on my moms radar as needing a place to stay. My dad did not like any of this. Of course, he had to have signed the papers to grant my mom legal guardianship but only because my mom strong-armed him into it. She bragged to me that she asked his permission to keep the children in front of his coworkers so that he couldnt say no. 

Obviously, these kids were heavily traumatised. They had hardly gotten any formal schooling, they had been homeless most of the time (if they were living in a home, it was a relative's home), they experienced extreme neglect and abuse, etc. There was a huge amount of work to be done to catch them up to speed and get them integrated into our family and normal society. My dad wanted none of it. He was outwardly rude. If he cooked, he would only make enough for ""his kids"". If he got us treats from the store, we were instructed not to share with ""them."" He berated these children for being in his house and in his way. He called them ""intruders"" and ""invaders"". 

None of us excuse this behavior. We understood the many failings of the US foster system and if we could offer a place for these kids, why not? We all saw each other as siblings and had no issue with having a few more of us in the house. We did try to stand up to him. Some of us still do. Some have given up. Example: it was my younger brothers high school graduation. My dad attended because it was one of ""his kids"". Afterward, he wanted to take all of ""his kids"" out to lunch. It had already been a stressful day for me for other reasons and this was the last straw. I was furious. Why couldnt he suck it up for ONE GODDAMN DAY and just come to lunch with everyone? It was a family event, everyone was there, but of course we couldnt celebrate with everyone. We had to go and be separate. The choice is always everyone else or him. I started crying (yes, i was 20 or 21 crying in public). He asked me what was wrong and i explained. He was fully confused. He genuinely couldnt understand the problem. ""But theyre not mine. Why would i bring them to lunch?"" Truly no malice, just confusion. I stopped trying that day. It had been 10 years since all this started. He just didnt -couldnt- get it. 

However, though we of course did not condone our dads methods of expression, we understood where he was coming from. He worked in public education, my mom stayed home. we were not rich. We barely had enough for the 5 of us. My mom never kept our finances a secret. In fact, she would often throw it in our faces that she didnt have enough money or time to do anything for herself because she was spending everything we had on us kids. She would ""ask us for permission"" each time she brought another kid in. It was always ""just for a few months, just until we can find something more permanent for them."" We knew this to be a lie. We knew if we expressed any reservations about taking in more kids, there would be consequences. Guilt trips. She was good with those. If there was a news story about a kid being neglected or abused in foster care, we would hear something like ""well, we couldve helped a kid like that, but YOU didnt want to."" Setting the table for dinner: ""oh dont worry, you only need to set 5 plates. I'LL put plates down for the rest since YOU dont want them here."" Being excluded from family events or special treats to ""see how YOU like being excluded."" 

Inevitably, this led to a messy divorce. Probably the only people who experienced a net benefit from it were the adopted kids who didnt have to deal with my dad directly anymore. For the rest of us, it was a constant tug of war between our parents each trying to win us over and poison the other. We were sending messages between the two of them because they couldnt communicate without fighting. He wanted us for this holiday and so did she- didnt matter that there was a legal agreement, they were still gonna fight about it. My dad refused to pay for things that were clearly his responsibility, and my mom suddenly had to work, leaving her even more stressed and bitter that us kids were using up all her hard earned money and her now ex husband still wasnt pulling his weight. Eventually, things settled. Stuff still crops up from time to time, but in general, things are pretty peaceful. 

Now. Remember that guy my mom was engaged to before she met my dad? Well, my entire life, i knew his full name and his life story. I knew how thoughtful, emotional, and kind he was. I knew he grew up in abusive foster homes and was still so gentle. Every time one of my moms friends went on a trip, she would say ""find a hot [this man's ethnicity] and bring him back for me!"" We knew, from childhood, that my mom regretted ever meeting my father and would have preferred to spend her life with this guy she left in her 20s. One of my moms friends prides herself on her social media sleuthing skills. At my moms request, she found this man. 20 years after a broken engagement, they meet up again. My mom takes us all cross-country to meet him and on the trip back home, demands we call him ""some spanish word for dad, like papi, to make him feel like part of the family"". We dont. She is furious about it. A year after they meet up, they get married and he and his daughter and her son move into our house. After a bit of awkwardness and my mom trying to force relationships to form as quickly as she wanted them to, things worked out and we all get along. He is genuinely a great guy who accepts all the kids in our house. He couldnt be more chill if you gave him ketamine. The only thing that can and will INSTANTLY get him from 0 to 100 is if he feels that certain kids are being treated differently than others. You see where this is going. 

Up to this point, there has obviously been tension between my dad and stepdad but nothing has really blown up. My stepdad knows about how my dad treats the kids that arent ""his"" but hasnt witnessed anything particularly heinous. Because of the pandemic, my family has been babysitting my niece and (step)nephew pretty frequently since childcare isnt real safe and their parents need to work. Also, siblings that arent usually home have been home since colleges are closed. Depending on the way my dad has been acting, he is allowed to drop over to the house and visit ""his kids"". Sometimes, he will come in. This brings us to our main event. 

My dad was over visiting and determined that my youngest sister hadnt eaten enough yet. He decided to make some food for her. Basically, it panned out that my stepdad interpreted him as not making food for everyone and/or preventing some of the kids from taking part (one being my niece/my dads granddaughter). My dad did not interpret his own actions that way. My stepdad did not take it up with my dad but rather called my mom who was at work to say that he was about to go to jail for beating the shit out of my dad. My dad left the house without ever knowing there was a problem. My mom calls me in a panic because she doesnt know whats going on. Im not home, im at my boyfriend's house an hour away. She ends up mad at me that i wasnt home to help her deal with this. My stepdads rant essentially boils down to ""how dare these kids (my dads kids) go and protest injustices (we have been pretty active in the racial injustice protests around us) but not stand up for their own siblings? How dare they let him mistreat the baby (My niece, 10)?"" The only person in the house having a reaction like this was him. Everyone else sort of accepted the events as par for the course.

I fully understand his anger. I fully agree that my dads actions, if they were as described, were abhorrent. My moms reaction was to ban my dad from the house. This has been done before, he gets mad about it, he makes it hell for us, my mom will criticize every aspect of our personalities that we share with our dad, and eventually it blows over and he starts coming over again. She says that our house needs to be a safe space for everyone in it. I agree. However, she does monopolize our time and severely limit the amount of time we have available with our dad. He gets upset because he ""has to be grateful for the scraps he gets"" while we are made to choose between which family we can keep happy. If we are to really live out the ideals we protest for, then should i also cancel my grandparents, who have said they would sooner not vote at all than vote for a non-republican? They have supported me with everything they have for my entire life, but also stand for injustice, inequality, and mistreatment of marginalized people. My mom keeps asking me what to do. I don't know. My dad, while drunk, once expressed that it was always his dream to move out of his shitty, cramped, soviet town, away from people he didnt like, and create a new life in america with just his family- his wife and kids. From day one, that was taken from him. There were constantly people in his space and more and more kids he was forced to accept. He doesnt think its fair that he is supposed to grin and bear it while his dream was shattered. He now lives alone, away from his kids, and has to barter to earn time with them since my mom wants us with her all the time. I dont agree with either side's methods but i do understand the basic ideas behind them.

What is the solution to make sure my dad feels loved by his kids but also we don't feel like we are betraying the rest of our family by associating with their abuser? How do i keep myself sane with my controlling mother on one side and my childish dad on the other?",02Aug2020,1

257,Okay so I've been dating this girl for 7 months and this is both our first relationship and everything. It's been an amazing relationship and we both been deeply in love but I think there are times where I ruin it and confuse the both of us. I noticed in the beginning of the relationship that I am a big over thinker this has caused many pointless petty arguments and me being passive aggressive it has been improving as currently I dont over think often because I know deep down I trust this girl with my life. I do think that since the pandemic started I have been more toxic and this is when there would be days where I would start arguments or be passive aggressive to her and hurt her on purpose. There are times where I just want to hurt her but when I actually see her hurt I get devastated and stop acting stupid. I would also say that I never been the best mentally I would get confused and question alot of things as I have anxiety but that's no excuse to being bad to my gf. I would say that our relationship is really strong and we both built a really good communication where I can tell her what I feel and be comfortable. We talk on the phone alot everyday we fall asleep otp for the past 3 months. I usually start arguments over the phone and I would accuse her of cheating when I know she wont. I get into bad mood where I just want to hurt her and I know I'm doing it and I tell myself to stop sometimes I do but sometimes I dont and continue hurting her. Lately I've been questioning if I actually love her and when I'm with her I think about that. My gf says i think about it too much and just to enjoy what I have and I agree with her. So I really want to improve but I dont know how at times I do improve I have improved alot from the beginning,02Aug2020,1

259,"How do I (13 F) deal with a crappy situation that I feel a teacher (30sF) really mishandled

Hola, I’m 13 years old, call me Sara, the teacher involved will be Ms. H, and dude mentioned will be called Jason. 

Just some pre info before, I’ve known this kid, Jason, since 2nd grade, and we shared science class. This took place in sixth grade.

Basically, we were cool until some random point, where he just decided to hate me. At the end of this post, I’ll tell you why. But him and this teacher were tight. Keep in mind, this teacher has seen him punch my chest (I was holding a toy frog to my chest) because he didn’t like the toy frog? I’m really confused about that, still. She’s seen him bring up embarassing moments from the 4th grade to humiliate me, then managed to flip the script and call me a bad person

Basically, I was all alone in my science class, my friend was gone to attend something. I said something to this dude, like, laugh at in a mocking joking way? Then this dude Jason, out of nowhere says “no one cares about you Sara. It’s not your birthday anymore. No one cares about you” then he said some more stuff that ties my worth to what I could provide to the other party

Then, I kind of start humiliating myself. I kept talking, like to try to make a joke out of the situation. Finger snaps, “honeys” were thrown around. He stop talking, but I just keep talking like an idiot. Eventually, I stop.

The teacher, mouth agape looks at me, shakes her head, and says “swiftly moving on” or “anyway”. Then I cried behind my textbook. That was honestly a really bad memory. Literally just writing about it has my pulse up, heavy breathing, tears are in my eyes as I’m writing this post. It just really bothered me that no one checked on me. 

Literally, after class, I look at Ms. H. I hoped that she’d at least ASK ME IF I WAS ALRIGHT. She doesn’t though. We make eye contact, she looks away, shakes her head, and walks out of the classroom as if to avoid me. That was a punch to the gut. It’s weird, because another time she saw I was sad, and asked if I was alright? But this time she’s annoyed with me?

Fast forward to next year, Jason literally talks to me as if nothing happened. Then I ask him, later on, what I did to make him so mad? He told me it was because in fifth grade, I told a teacher that I thought he was friends with an autistic kid, and he was forced to sit next to him. That was why

And it bothers me. Because he literally asked out one of my closer friends out. And she liked him back. It was so annoying. And the teacher is still Buddy Buddy with him. They faced no repercussions. I still have to bare the weight of that memory on my back. I still cry just THINKING of it. How do I get this off my back? Do I write a note?

All help is appreciated, thank you

EDIT: this dude didn’t even remember that I was in his science class last year",02Aug2020,1
260,"I made a throwaway account for this. It doesn't feel right typing this out but i really want some advice, this incident keeps me up at night. 

Summarised: So basically around a year ago someone who I would have considered a close friend of mine told me everyone thinks im stupid, and the more i think about it the more i realise its true. And it hurts.

	It was at a party and we were both pretty f**ked off mdma. (sidenote, i have done md plenty of times before this and never knew you could experience sadness on this drug untill this moment). 
	I don't remember what lead up to this conversation but i remember the conversation itself pretty well which is surprising for being on mdma and a copious amount of weed. 

It went something like this: 

Friend: Everyone thinks your stupid. Like REALLY stupid.

Me: Why?

Friend: The things you say, the things you do.

I then said something to the effect off ""im alright with that, thats me i guess haha"" and we moved on pretty quickly. (btw this person does genuinely like me and i doubt they would have had any malintent mdma just makes you have strange uninhibited chats i suppose) 

But the truth is im not alright with that.

	Up untill that moment that night had been perfect, just non-stop good vibes, euphoria, if you've done mdma before you'll know all about how it makes virtually any situation perfect, especially parties. Well  thats when the night took a turn. My heart sank and for the first time ever i was having a bad time on mdma. I just couldn't stop repeating what she said in my head, the painful words bouncing around between my ears. All the while i maintained normal me on the outside for the rest of the party. 
I lightly slept the comedown off pretty much brain dead for a day or so.

I had forgotten about the incident for awhile but then it resurfaced. And its been eating away at me. The more i think about what she said the more i realise its true. People think im *really* stupid. Im a little awkward sometimes sure and im not the most socially intelligent but im not stupid right?

Basically its kept me up at night countless times and i know this whole thing is ridiculous really but im bordering on depression and alot of nights ill find myself fixated on why people think im stupid. Stupid people dont know their stupid. I mean i sure didn't. If i knew why im perceived as stupid i wouldn't be stupid if that makes sense. 

im a loner nowadays and im not sure exactly how it happened but ive got no friends. I guess i just slowly distanced myself from everyone and i feel like everyone secretly thinks im stupid behind my back (i know some people do for certain) so whats the point in trying to be friends with them.  

Im joining college soon (couple months) so hopefully i can make some new friends but my main concerns are that ill come off as stupid and ive been alone so long im not really socially calibrated. Also i live in a small place in the uk and im worried my reputation will somehow be carried into college bcos where i live most people know most people.

Can anyone please help me out? Thank you.

268,"For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid of movies and tv shows and recently  sometimes music. I don’t know why. I remember hating it in middle school how my dad would take us to the movies and I would be so irritated and upset and practically at times beg not to go but towards half the movie I calmed down. (Am a girl so my dad would rarely leave me alone at the house so not much options) I don’t know why I am like this. I can’t start to watch a movie or tv show for the life of me. I get anxious and panic and just rewatch something. I have to watch something maybe 4 times to be comfortable with it. 

I hate this about myself. It’s really embarrassing to me. My dad would get to put on a new movie or something and ask me to join him but I tell him a too scared and panic and he looks at me like am the weirdest thing alive. For example, their was this movie I wanted to watch so badly( Down with love..it’s amazing) and I kept putting it off for a month cause I was scared and I was with my dad and my dad said..alright am gonna put it on, and I panicked and said no already quickly making my way out of the room but he changed it since he wanted to spend time with me(he put on The Office..which am not scared of since I have already watched it about 6 times).The only times it’s not a really big deal is if their are other people with me and we ALL agree to take watch it then I calm down a little but it depends on the genre.

Genres also have a huge say on this. Romance Comedy give me the most anxiety. I start to become edgy, panic and sometime on the verge of tears. I haven’t watched one in forever. I don’t know why but that specific genre freaks me out. Sci Fi don’t bother me as much and I can watch a sci fi movie after contemplating for a while. But my best chance at watching a new movie is sci fi. 

Regarding music, I love music. I relate deeply to music and it is one of the things that truly clears my mind and feeds my soul but sometimes I get anxious about about a song. For example, am 18 and I love LOVE Van Halen and I wanted to hear “I’m the one”, but I suddenly got anxious and put something else on.( hearing music isn’t nearly as hard are trying to watch something..this sometimes happens more rarely then usual)

Why am I afraid of these things? What the hell is wrong with me?

Btw, I saw a therapist for awhile for my general anxiety and I brought this up to her and she didn’t understand either and didn’t really pay much attention as to why these things specifically made me anxious.

272,"So I used to be friends with this guy for about a year (we'll call him Jay). We were really close, we went to Prom together, talked all the time for hours on end, hung out frequently for about a year straight. It started to go downhill when I found out he had a crush on me around the time he asked me to prom (May 2019). I had a suspicion he liked me, but never said anything or even rejected him as I didn't want to misinterpret the situation. In May, his best friend texted me if I liked Jay. I simply replied that we were friends and I have no interest in dating anyone (I had been cheated on by my last boyfriend a few months prior to this and truly wasn't wanting to jump back into a relationship). After his best friend and I talked about this everything was fine so I thought maybe I read to much into it, but when November 2019 came around things changed. Between May and November, Jay had become progressively more mean and passive aggressive towards me and the sh\*t talking began. I let it go for the most part as I knew he had stuff going on, but after awhile (January 2020) it got bad, I would break down and cry to my friends as I couldn't take it anymore. If I tried to tell Jay he would tell me it was a joke and I was being too sensitive and dramatic leading me to end up apologizing to him. When quarantine hit we drifted apart and didn't talk often and when we did it was fine, but when the restrictions let up and we resumed contact it got way worse then before. He started talking sh\*t about me to all my friends, his friends, and people I didn't even know. Jay would screenshot and make fun of my spam and posts (I didn't know about this until recently) and a lot more petty things. So eventually I snapped on a three-way FaceTime call where he kept cutting me off and butting me out of the conversation and told Jay to ""shut the \*\*\*\* up and leave the call"". Ever since then he has continuously sought to make my life h\*ll. He became really good friends with my best friend and tried to turn MY friends, not our mutual friends, but MY friends against me. He constantly brings me up to people telling them I am a ""Dramatic B\*tch"" and that they shouldn't talk to me. When they've asked him why he hates me so much, he just says I am annoying and a b\*tch. I don't know how to get him to leave me alone. We haven't spoken in a month, I took him off all social media, and I never hang out with him and avoid social gatherings if he is present, but nothing is working. He won't stop.

So this girl I like in college I'll call her (S) she always had and still has my eye but 1 day she told me she still had a paper I had gave her a paper that had some positive message to make her smile but there was a problem I was and still am at the time of writing this depressed,weak, worthless, useless, penneyless and hate myself. When S said she still had the paper I gave her and I stood there I was shocked and happy that she said that but I was thinking what can I do for her and I realized that there was nothing I could give her and walked away without saying a word then summer came and then the lockdown happen and there was a little window were the lockdown let up I did boxing 4 a little bit but I still felt useless I tried texting her on ig but as you already know she said she wants to be friends honestly I don't deserve to even be her friend honestly I don't even know what to do please help me",02Aug2020,1
281,"Hello, I’m 14 years old, and I’m very ambitious, I have a lot of goals I wanna complete in this life. Within my country the legal age of having a job is age 16, I am not willing to wait that long for my success or waste valuable time. Not to mention those jobs would be working hard instead of smart, I still wanna work really hard. It’s just the downsides outweigh the positives.

My goal right now is to do something to consistently earn money equal to a minimum age worker. Which I know is very difficult to do at my age, and I will know I will have to sacrifice a lot of time and energy. I’ve been trying TikTok but the platform is very competitive, almost everything being done and has already been done. Has been done. I will still continue tiktok but it’s clear it’s a waste of my time.

Is anyone aware of a loophole or an ongoing business that someone is able to do, that doesn’t require a specific age. I am willing to put a lot of time into this. My honest goal is to make enough money that will convince my mother, University isn’t nessasary(I may and will probably still go, I just don’t like that pressure on my mother and myself) Which I know is completely delusional(especially as an immigrant poor family) but the life I see myself doing if I go there all into UNI Is quite depressing.

284,"Hi, first I just want to say that English is my second language so I apologize for any mistakes, I'm also writing this on mobile so I'm sorry for the format and this is a pretty long story but I will cut out details that don't matter so much.

So I think I'm being followed/stalked, but if it is the case than this guy is sloppy and that's why I wanted your opinions/advice as I can be a little paranoid from time to time and I don't want to be dramatic if nothing is going on..

Let me give you a little background, I work at a women's clothing store in a mall and I take public transport. There's this bus I catch let's say the #3, it's a straight line from one side of town all the way to a neighbouring town, so I have to take a transfer from home to the #3 for work and vice versa. I first remember seeing this guy about 2 months ago when the malls in my area reopened, and now I feel like I see him everywhere. The first weird thing that happened was a couple weeks ago when I got on the #3 at the end of my shift. The bus was completely empty except for this guy which sat all the way in the back. I listen to music on the bus so I didn't notice right away but when I got up to my stop to wait for another bus he had moved seats and was right behind me, weird but whatever. He then got on the second bus with me and got off at the same stop, I started stressing a bit so I called my roommate (21M, also takes public transport) to ask him if he would meet me and we could walk back to our appartement together. The guy started walking the same way I did but kind of far back and when my friend showed up I looked back but he was gone.

After that I again started seeing him at my workplace, at another mall in town, at the grocery store, sitting behind me or close to me on the bus, etc. I've also seen him walk to my workplace when I am outside making my way to the bus stop and he started walking in my direction after making eye contact. But I do have to say it's a small town so it's not that uncommon to see the same people often. But today was just so weird I have to share.. there's this shop in a mall I like but it's in a different town. Like I said the #3 will take you there but it's the last stop. I got in and I spot the guy somewhere in the back so I sit at front and he gets down at the last stop with me and a couple other people. Now I just had one thing to buy so I took a 45 minutes ride for a 5 minutes errand and I would take the bus back all the way to the end of the ride so another 45 mins to catch my transfer. But when I got out he was waiting for the #3 again, he'd just got off with me and I didn't see him get in the mall. He was in line to get in but I guess he saw me and looked back at me, stepped out of the line, and waited to get in behind me. When I got in I was going to at a certain spot but the sit was wet (like and actual puddle) so I sat at the seat in front of that one. But he still sat behind me! I even heard him say ""why is this wet"" before he sat down so he definitely noticed. But anyway at some point I got lost in my thoughts and then I noticed his hand/phone? right next to my face and I jumped a little bit and he jerked his hand back to his seat. He then went all the way to the last stop where I got off for my transfer. He left the bus first but he looked back and maintained eye contact with me for an  uncomfortable amount of time and went back to wait for the #3.. 

I just don't see how I could be misinterpreting something this is all just so weird..  and I really don't know if he was trying to get a picture of me but we need to wear masks anyways and this was a pretty crowded bus so not a place I'd think someone would do that.. Anyway sorry again that this was so long but I would really appreciate your thoughts on this..",02Aug2020,1

287,I enjoy drinking on the weekends and i dont go over board with the alcohol i like a whisky alone 2 maybe 3 drinks on a Saturday or friday. Recently i became a health nut im always active basically running every day and i fast and only eat meat and vegetables and have a cheat meal once a day. It bothers me that i consume alcohol but its in my dna. My father was addicted to alcohol and not just the average drunk who just binge drinks he would consume perfume to get drunk he was addicted to the chemical itself. He truly was addicted to the chemical and now hes been sober for a decade and a half so i guess it just bothers me that  i consume it but i naturally have a taste for it. I do enjoy a blunt on the weekends and prefer to smoke but its hard to kick the booze. Basically im just asking what do you guys on here prefer ? I would love to kick the whisky but i like it .,02Aug2020,1
288,"So the thing is that I texted a friend about some feelings I'd been having, such as not being welcome in the 'friend group', but they didn't respond. 

A few days later I followed up by talking about how them not responding bothered me because I couldn't do anything about it, and I couldn't even be sure if the 'read' mark meant that they'd actually read the text or just cleared the notification.

A week after that I sent a screenshot of menu for the game 'Left on Read', which can be found on steam, because them not responding made me think of that.

294,"We’ve been dating for a bit more than two months now, we were distant friends before that. Yesterday he told me that he simply just stopped going to school and that he won’t go back (he never did too good and probably has a ton of missing credits). He hasn’t told anyone else, not even his parents, but he didn’t even finish junior year. Although I respect his decisions and I know it’s his life, I’m worried about him. From my point of view it doesn’t seem like he’s under bad conditions where he can’t attend or work on school. I know that school isn’t everyone’s thing, but if you have the opportunity of finalizing your studies I think you should take it? I think he might regret this choice in a few years.

298,"I (26F) had a fallout with my boss, P (46M). P prides himself on being really flexible low key, he runs a fun office where everyone is family. Well after three years of working here I think P has had enough of me. Recently he called me in for a meeting. He brought up how he is so gracious to me and that I’m not meeting standards or expectations. We work in customer care. I asked if there had been customer complaints. He said no. P said that all complaints were from staff. Overall the problem is that I just look like I’m miserable and unhappy and don’t want to be at work and that staff is tired of me getting snarky with them. See I get asked a lot of dumb questions and sometimes I might snip back at staff for asking something unnecessary. I never lash out at the customer. we work in an open workspace too so we spend all day together and there is little time a part. P also brought up that my behavior and attitude doesn’t garner the raise he gave me last year. (It was a 75 cents raise 10 months ago). Earlier this year  I was supposed to move and had been telling people about it for several months (then Covid happened) wellspring our talk my boss brings up that he had someone hired to replace me and that now it seems like I don’t want to be here and this person may have been a better fit. P then says if I want to leave then I need to let him know and leave an appropriate notice so as to not mess up any future references I might need from him. 

There’s a few more comments he made like that but this post is getting long and I think this is the overall long story short. So what do you think? Is my boss manipulating me into quitting my job? Should I quit? Is he right?",02Aug2020,1
299,"I’ve been out with about 4 people my whole life and they all ended with me being intimate with them. 

I was 18 when I went on my first date. He was a total player but I was extremely infatuated with him. On our third date he asked me to fuck him so I said yes pretty quickly. I had always looked forward to my first time and I was extremely attracted to him. But when things started heating up, I realized that I was too tight. It’s like my body was trying to tell me that I wasn’t ready. After he left my dorm I was overwhelmed with a feeling of sadness. I’ve been told that it has to do with my hormones. It’s like coming down from an endorphin high after being intimate with someone? I felt incredibly sad and it was a horrible feeling that I couldn’t stand. 

Things eventually ended before we could have sex. I was pretty heartbroken and missed being intimate with him, so a couple months later I found another guy online. He was about 10 years older than me and said he was interested in hooking up with a younger girl. I really wanted to have sex with someone so I agreed against my better judgement. However, when I met up with him I realized that I wasn’t very attracted to him. But it’s almost like I felt obligated to have sex with him because we had already agreed upon it. I didn’t want to disappoint him. When things started to heat up I was feeling pretty uncomfortable. I eventually started crying and he decided to stop before it went to far. 

I was kinda traumatized by that and didn’t go out with anyone until a year later, when I eventually found a guy online (who was around my age). I was really attracted to him and once again, I was really eager to have sex. So I invited him over on the first date. But like last time, my body was telling me I wasn’t ready. When this guy left my dorm, I felt really really sick. I ended up throwing up and I remember crying a lot. I never saw him again.

After that I met up with a different guy who asked me to come over to his place on the first date. I wasn’t super attracted to him and I don’t understand why I said yes. We watched a movie at his place and I eventually got bored. I thought it would be rude to leave when he clearly had certain expectations. So I asked him if he wanted to make out and things just escalated. I ended up losing my virginity to him. I still remember feeling sick afterwards. I felt really depressed for a few days. But he asked me out again and I still agreed. We ended up becoming fwb for about a month and I slowly grew to like him more. After a while I started feeling extremely happy after seeing him. 

Things eventually ended with him as well, and I’ve recently been talking to another guy who says he will pay me $200 every time I have sex with him. I find it kinda hot to have a sugar daddy. But this whole situation has being weighing on me so much. I clearly have a ton of issues when it comes to dating/sex. I have a pattern of what I can only describe as self harm. I feel incredibly ashamed of everything I’ve done but I’m having so much trouble understanding why I did any of this. Can someone please psychoanalyze me and tell me how to fix this destructiveness.",02Aug2020,1
300,"I went all through my childhood with acquaintances which were basically people that I talked to in school or occasionally hung out with after school. I wasn't close to any person. I can't even say I have a ""best friend"". I'm not close to anybody on that level. It really started to affect me when I got to 11th grade and realized I didn't have a friend group. At that point I realized I messed up my middle school and early junior year by not making friends. At that point people already had established friend groups and I wasn't just randomly going to be accepted in one. Basically, my high school years consisted of me staying in my house on Friday and Saturday nights. Sad life, I know. Hell, the only party I ever attended in high school was when I tagged along with a guy that lives on my street that I kind of knew. I kind of figured things might change when I got to college because I'd take making friends more seriously, and I was mostly right. I made a few friends at university, but it's an out of state school far from home, so I pretty much only see them during the school year. It is definitely harder to form deep friendships with people I'm only seeing half the year, so I guess my friends in college are nothing more than acquaintances too...

It's been 2 years since I graduated high school, and I'm more lonely than ever. Summer 2020 has completely reminded me why High School was rough for me. I work, come home, watch movies, play video games, repeat. This cycle has no end in sight. I have nobody to talk to, nobody to hang out with. I've barely had human interaction other than my parents since March. I wake up in the morning and have zero texts. I go on social media and see people I follow from high school having a blast this summer partying and chilling. That puts me into further depression. I'm 20 and I feel like I don't have the power to do anything but sit in a dark room in front of my television.

I can come out and say I have some hope. After college I plan to move to a big city like NYC or Boston for work. I might make plenty of friends in the city and finally have a friend group and feel like I belong. But my problems might follow me if things keep going the way they're going. I can't stop feeling hopelessness and loneliness, but I don't exactly have anyone to tell anybody except strangers on reddit. Maybe someone here can guide me on the right path",02Aug2020,1

am i starting to like my fwb? so many questions running through my head

Ive had a friend since 2014 thats two years older than me and was super into me back then but i never gave into it. He was fine with that and was always super nice to me then we went separate ways over a period of time and i moved out of town to go to school and hes had a few relationships since then as well as I have. 


Fast forward to last december we start talking a bit again every few days and we continued this into the new year, just friendly conversation. I didnt want to admit but i was somewhat attractd to him but had a boyfriend at the time so i never pursued anything, even though he asked me a few times this winter if i was interested in hooking up. We spoke every few days until march when i came to my hometown for a month due to COVID and school closing, and we talked a lil more and i became single so he asked again if i wanted to hookup because I was kind of giving the idea in a subtle way (oops). I finally gave in and we had sex, then a few days later my bf tried to fix things and i wasnt sure if i wanted him back and this friend of mine got super mad and told me he never wanted to talk to me anyways and only answered me bc he wanted to have sex etc. and i got really mad as well. He then proceeded to say something along the lines of “well you dont want two boyfriends so” which i never implied ever that i was into him which makes me think he was jealous. I didnt speak to him for a few days as i was so confused it was purely sex thats it and he got so mad over something he shouldnt if it WAS just sex which he claimed it was. A few days later he messaged me on 3 platforms simply saying my name only, which of course made me reply because it freaks me out when people say my name and nothing else lol. He then proceeded to say “I wanna fuck you again. I wanna see and pull your pretty purple hair” and said “you were the only person ive had sex with in a long time that ive genuinely enjoyed”. Of course i gave in (hate my lack of self control) and we had sex 4 more times between then and the beginning of june when i left town to go back to school. He talked to me almost everyday since then, and if i didnt message first he found a reason to hit me up and start a convo so i know he doesnt feel the way he did in march when he claims he didnt wanna talk to me only purely for sex, because now we talk all the time about anything and everything and hes very nice but he still confuses me because he doesnt imply he likes me but he cant go one day without hearing from me. 


I came back home in June and i didnt tell him because i didnt know if i wanted to hookup as i was having mixed feelings and felt like i was getting attached and shouldnt of been, but he found out i was home and he offered to pick me up and buy me mcdonalds and some mints one night i said i didnt feel well but wouldve liked to have sex. It was a sweet gesture but i didnt give in, instead i waited a full week and denied him 3 times until finally doing it in his car (its always been in the car due to his mom being home and mine). I went back to my other town then until today and we spoke again everyday since, and hes been starting to come to me with his personal problems which he woukd never open up before, and he messages me all the time even if i dont reply he will say something else a few hours later. Im so confused because some days i feel like im reading into it too much and he doesnt like me im purely a fuck, but other days i realize he talks to me all hours of the day and now confides in me, and not to mention the more times we hooked up the more often he would kiss me during, he even held my hands once in the middle of it and tells me afterward how great it was and that im the best this or that hes ever had. 


I got in town tonight and hes home alone for the first time in like forever, and he asked me to come over and have sex , so i went and when i got there i was so nervous because its always been simple car sex and then go home. I walked in and he was playing PC and i sat on the bed and we talked for a little, then i had to throw away my gum and had nowhere to put it so he took it in his hand and threw it away for me (id never do that lol), before he came over and pushed me down on the bed and got on top of me. When we were finally naked, i was laying on the bed and he got his duvet and covered both of us up to our heads while he was ontop of me kissing me, and it seemed like it went on for a long time before he actually started to touch/finger me then have sex. He kissed me alot during missionary and we did it on the bed and the floor it was absolutely insane, and when i left he said see you next time, then messaged me and told me it was good and to come pick up my sunglasses i left there tomorrow morning. Im super confused because i feel like im starting to like him as i cant stop thinking about him but then my insecurities take over and make me feel like im crazy for even thinking hes into me bc he’s so attractive and im just not, although hes told me many times that he thinks i am and he enjoys sex with me. Any input? Hes super sweet and i just think if he was only into the sex he wouldn’t message me first daily to start a random conversation if he was only in it for the sex, especially since i live out of town and im gone for usually a month at a time. 


Please advise what you think, im going nuts overthinking about it but i cant stop thinking about him and i feel something when he kisses me so i wonder if that means he does as well, and if he wont admit his feelings because he is afraid of rejection as ive never implied or gave the idea that i want him more than sexually.

he has something on his forehead that appeared recently it has a weird dark purple-ish color ... i don't know what is causing his skin to look this color but i wonder if it's because of the alcohol ...

i'm no expert but i know that my uncle died of cancer because of alcohol and he started to have these weird looking purple bumps on his nose &amp; also i noticed he vomits every morning before going to work ( i know it's because of his drinking ) but can someone explain to me what is happening to him ?

i tried telling him to stop drinking and told him that they are fatal consequences of drinking too much alcohol but he doesn't want to stop since he's been drinking since he was about 10-11 years old ( yeah his mom has never been a good mom 😞 ) plus he insults us when we talk about his drinking. Oh and by the way he drinks like TOO MUCH it anoys me like i always drink water and the way i drink my water is the same way he drinks his wine. 

He doesn't just drink on special occasions like holidays or just for fun or to relax like normal people do he drinks wine with every single plate breakfast diner super all the time ! i have never seen my dad without a big cup of wine ! 
i don't know what to do anymore to make

310,These past few days I’ve wanted nothing more than to engage in self-destructive behaviors just for the fun of it. I want to barely sleep because the exhaustion feels good. I want to starve because the hunger pangs make me feel good and uhm I want to not poop when I have to because it feels good to hold it in. What the fuck? I’m not sad or depressed and life’s great. I’m not doing this to purposely harm myself. It’s just that even thinking about the above behaviors makes me feel REALLY good so engaging in it is a whole new level of getting high.,02Aug2020,1

312,"I worked as a cashier for 7 months. I'm a sensitive person, so when customers are rude/mean it gets to me. They look down on you when you make minimum wage, and feel superior. I've tried to endure it but I guess it builds up, and today I exploded. Lost control of my temper and said I QUIT. 

When my boyfriend (who works there too) found out, he said I embarrassed him and he dumped me.

I'm gonna look for a new job, but what hurts is my boyfriend abandoning me over a part-time, minimum wage job. We already met each other's families, he talked about living together, marrying, and having his baby...he abandoned me over this.",02Aug2020,1
313,"To give some background, I (16f) work in a popular fast food chain.  The manager in question is on the younger side (I think around 20), and speaks Spanish as his first language, but is very fluent in English to the point of never having any communication problems.  Personally, I know a bit of Spanish, but would never consider myself fluent as I am less fluent than a Mexican toddler.  Also, I'm going to be leaving (not quitting) in a week due to school, but plan to come back on my breaks.

Also, while slightly unnecessary, I think it's better to mention that throughout the shift, he had been teasing me because I spoke basic Spanish to him as a joke (barely a full sentence).  I was perfectly alright with him doing that, seeing as me and him usually joke around a fair amount.

So, later on in the shift, a woman who barely spoke any English got in line.  She was with a group and didn't speak much, but she ended up asking for something in Spanish.  It was easy enough to figure out what she was saying (the item was the same word in Spanish and English) so I repeated her request in Spanish.  My manager overheard this and, after making and giving the food to the woman, he then proceeds to start having a full blown conversation to the woman and her family in Spanish.  I would have normally had no problem with this, except based on his body language, vocal tone, and certain words I could pick out, I knew he was talking about me.  I had absolutely no idea what he was saying to them, but eventually they all started laughing and looking at me, as if I was the butt of a joke.  He even stopped to ask me mid-conversation if I could understand what he was saying, to which I obviously responded with no.

Once the family finally left, he told me what he said, thinking I would find it funny.  In his words, he told me that he told the family that he was teaching me Spanish so that he could marry me.  I was dumbfounded.  My manager told several customers that he wanted to marry me while I sat there smiling and nodding like a clueless bitch.  When he realized I didn't find it as funny as he did, he immediately apologized.  He was sincere about it, but I don't think he understood exactly how upset I was, which is my fault for not communicating that to him (I tried to laugh it off but honestly felt like crying).

Now, my question to you all is what I should do now.  I work with him again tonight and I'm not sure how to approach this.  Also, he is not the highest ranking manager in our store.  There is one person above him within the store, a person above that person who manages several stores, and the next level above that is basically corporate.  I told this story to my boyfriend and he highly recommended I bring this up to the in-store manager.  I am very much considering doing that, but I still want to collect more opinions just to make sure that this is what I should be doing.  

Also, I don't want to get him fired over this.  This was not sexual assault or harassment and I am fully aware of that.  He's a good manager 90% of the time, just immature for the other 10%.  And, because I'm leaving so soon, part of me thinks it just isn't worth bringing up to them.

TLDR: Manager tell customers he wants to marry me while I can't understand a word he's saying, tells me later what he said thinking I would find it funny.  I didn't.",02Aug2020,1
314,"Okay here goes.

A pretty good friend of mine (lets call them A for now) had a bad experience with an ex, where they (the ex) filmed A during sex without their permission. As if this wasn't bad enough, the ex proceeded to pass the video around to his friends. This is of course unbelievable shitty - and I have no interest in befriending the ex or even talking to them, as far as I am concerned - they aren't even worth my time. However, I found out that another one of my close friends (Lets call them B for the sake of the post) had seen the video of A, and knew A didn't know it had been filmed. A and B are also friends, and so B 10000% should have told A about the video - but they chose not to, instead choosing to joke about and talk about it with their friends. Finding out about this disgusted me. How can someone do that and not feel bad???

However, now I'm unsure where to go from here. Do I cut B out of my life? They have been a good friend to me for many years - but they were also a good friend to A for many years before this incident. I know this issue isn't necessarily mine to fix or confront, and A needs to handle it herself - but I can't help but wonder if B is worth keeping in my life. Essentially, I want to know what you would do, would you cut B out of your life? Or remain good friends even after knowing what they did.",02Aug2020,1

316,"I was sober for two years. Freshmen year of college was my first real taste of freedom. I enjoyed it slightly too much. 

After I moved to another state (I put a pause on education to get myself together), I decided to stop drinking. Partially because I was working two jobs to save up to rejoin higher education, but mostly because I was worried I was drinking for the wrong reasons.

During that time I struggle with anxiety and depression heavily. The only time I suffered from it more was when I was living in my mom’s radius. I tried to force myself to socialize more, but I always felt worse afterwards. I still made myself do it but I never managed to make close friends like I did back home. I made friends. But not close friends.

I started drinking again last week. My jobs laid me off completely two weeks ago, and my car had repairs that ate up the thousands and thousands of dollars I had saved up. So my future is a bust. So why not drink. 

It feels so easy to talk to people when I’m drunk. Even now the words flow so smoothly, like ink dribbling from one of those more expensive pens that leak and smear if you hold it in place. A post like this would’ve taken me so far 50 minutes. I’ve done this in maybe 3. 

I don’t like that.

If you like talking to people when you’re sober, why is that? What makes you not want to isolate yourself? What do you do right that I so obviously do wrong? 

Why is it so hard for me? 

I feel busted sometimes. Not now though. Bottom shelf vodka is a balm for my soul.",02Aug2020,1

320,"I (15F) have been friends with this girl for years now, I really love and miss her but I don’t know how to tell her why I ghosted her if I ever do talk to her again.

Around April/May she was on Instagram live and I was watching it with the occasional commenting. This guy joined her live and she has always cursed, not a big deal, she called this guy a ‘bitch’ as a ‘joke’. She’s told me about him in the past, I already knew their friendship has always been like that, they always joke around with each other that way.

I commented and told her not to be mean (he had just joined the live, he hadn’t really said anything offensive), I didn’t mean it in a ‘serious’ way because I knew that’s how they acted, she didn’t mind (I don’t know how to explain it).

Her brother walked into her bedroom and started reading the comments, he saw mine and asked who commented that and my friend told him, he then said ‘I’ll beat them up’, not knowing who I was. I found it petty but I’m not mad or anything, he doesn’t know me nor did he have any context, but I can’t help but feel uneasy about it.

327,"For the past few months, our upstairs neighbors kids have been incredibly loud. Running back and forth across the apartment, dribbling basketballs, chasing each other up and down the stairs in front of my house, etc...

Sometimes when it’s really bad I’ll knock on their door and politely ask them if they could stop their kids from running above our place. I grew up in the country with plenty of land, I get that kids need to run around and get energy out. If it’s not too bad or if it doesn’t go on for too long I just leave it be.

Sometimes I notice garbage in the bushes in front of my porch too. I caught the kids throwing their capri suns in front of my apartment yesterday. I confronted them saying “Could you kids please make sure to start picking up your own trash?”

At the same exact time one of them said “Ok, sorry” and the other said “that’s not ours.”

Well today, from 10am to when I left my house at 2pm the kids were non stop running circles above me. I wish I was exaggerating, I have no clue how they kept it up so long. It was literally shaking our windows....

So I went up to talk to my neighbor. I knock, she opens the door, I say “Hey, could you please have your kids stop running around? It’s pretty bad.”

She said “They’re kids, I don’t know what you want me to do.”

I said “I get that they’re kids, I’ve tried to be very patient. It’s been happening all day so far. You could tell them to stop.”

She said “Well clearly you’re not working, so I don’t get why you can’t just ignore it.”

I said “It’s really bad, I can’t ignore it. I would much rather go directly to you than start making complaints with the apartment complex itself.”

She said “Well it’s your problem, they’re just kids!”

I said “Ok, I’ll just start making complaints to the office then.”

She called me a “Bitch” started cussing at me, and I just walked away.


I called the office and they said they’d talk to her, that was around 2. I got home today at 6 and there is garbage all over my bushes and front porch. Gloves, used masks, McDonald’s kids meals, candy wrappers, etc... I’ve been so nice and understanding, it baffles me that she was so rude in return. I’m literally shocked. 


What can I do about this? My girlfriend and I take online classes right now and it’s impossible to concentrate with all of this noise above us. I wish I could show you guys how bad the noise is, I’m generally very patient with people but it’s so out of control.


I’m not very confident that my complex will do anything, what else can I do? My friend said I should call the police with noise complaints, but I’ve never done that before and don’t know if that’s a realistic solution. After how she treated me today, I am done going directly to her.",02Aug2020,1

A bit of back story: both he and I suffer from mental health issues. I have anxiety, depression, gender dysphoria, and am getting tested for ADD and Asperger's in a few weeks. My bf has anxiety, depression, gender dysphoria, and trauma caused by living with his abusive older brother. Cause of that, we both have pretty low self worth, but my boyfriend has been actually starting to be somewhat ok with himself lately, which is a fantastic thing for him. I, however, haven't had the same progress. I'm constantly overthinking things, I basically live in self doubt, and am scared of doing things because I'm afraid of being made fun of or doing them poorly. I'm worried that be being like this, I'm somehow holding him back because he spends a lit of time worrying about me.

anyway i started talking to someone in early may and we hit it off very quickly. things turned romantic either fast and we were texting all the time usually flirtatiously. we got along really well and a lot of steps in our growing connection felt initiated by them. we went on one date in early july because of covid and i thought it went well. we agreed to go on a second and i had started planning something fun for the both of us. 

things felt like they were getting real and the weekend before our second date was scheduled we both consented and seemingly enjoyed a sexual encounter albeit digitally lol. because of that step and because i felt like we were on the same page about or connection i asked how they would feel about labeling what we had. they said they didnt feel ready for that yet and i respected their feelings completely. 

then the next day they called me talking about how they had gotten out of a relationship a few weeks before we started talking and didnt feel like they had gotten the time to process being single that they now felt they needed. i was confused in the moment seeing as our growing connection was rather passionate and i honestly still am somewhat confused. 

we both said we didnt want to completely lose any form of relationship, but i decided i couldnt give them what they needed and still have a close friendship. we both agreed that space was best and i only asked that they continued to communicate with me about how they were doing. ive reached out a couple times since then and our very brief interactions have been relatively positive, but ive just felt so empty and used as a distraction. 

i dont resent them for essentially leading me on for a couple of months, but i am hurt at the fact that things changed so suddenly and at least from my perspective out of nowhere. im not sure if i should just move on or keep hoping that ill hear from them and we can talk things through again. i still think of them so positively but the more time that goes by the more that flame starts to burn out and as much as i dont want it to i know its completely out of my control. i want to continue to give them their space but everyday i just want to hear from them again. im just starting to feel irrational and overwhelmingly lonely and i dont know how to navigate my own feelings and hopes while making sure that they get what they need.",02Aug2020,1

349,"I am a teen girl(16 almost 17), on the verge of adulthood. Being a homosexual or possibly bisexual has been a question that I have grappled with internally for many many years. I feel a lot of discomfort with my sexuality, but I am trying to overcome that. I don’t want to be a fearful person. I know that the world has progressed, and people are significantly more accepting than they were 20 years ago. I am happy to live in a country were homosexuals aren’t persecuted or tormented to a great extent. 

But, still I am bothered and worried. Just by not being heterosexual I will all ready have to deal with many negative preconceived notions from others. Just on the basis of sexuality, being heterosexual doesn’t make you a target of ridicule. No one simply states that straight people are disgusting, or that their lifestyle is sinful. It all upsets me to a great extent, to think that already some people are against me solely because of my sexuality. I realize that everybody has things that someone in the world will decide is not good about them, and ridicule them for it. But hatred of homosexuals is more apparent and rampant. It is an aspect of my identity that I have to live with. I wish I was heterosexual. 

I know a lot of people will state that I have internalized homophobia. That might be true. I refer to myself as an ugly dyke. I generally feel uncomfortable around masculine women/girls. I internally judge women that don’t adhere to what society deems as feminine enough. I know it is wrong, but my own self hatred leaks out and I project. I hate feeling this way, and I constantly think and worry about being a homophobe. I can’t quiet the negative slurs that I throw at myself. I just want to be heterosexual. It disgusts me that I am anything other than that. 

And then once in my 10th year a girl who was not heterosexual I assuming asked me in private if I was bisexual or a lesbian. Obviously, I told her no. I  did sleep over once at her house and we almost kissed. I pulled away, and went to bed right before it was going to happen. After that incident, I ignored her for weeks, and then she confronted me one day about it. She tried to say that I wasn’t straight, etc. I told her to her face that I wasn’t a dyke like her. I called her a dyke. I feel so terrible and disgusting, and wish I could say sorry but we don’t talk anymore. We just ignore each other. I didn’t mean to say such a vile thing to her. Its like my own self hatred took over. I think about what happened quite a lot. 

And I know that I am a sensitive person. I hyper   fixate on the hypothetical reactions of others, along with past reactions and opinions of others. And for those reasons, along with my own self loathing, I think I will conceal my natural preference forever. If I do ever have a relationship with someone of the same sex it will stay hidden. I would hope that they are also not wanting to open up about their homosexuality. 

I have thought about my future outcome. Who I will be with, and what type of lifestyle I will carry out. It will be one of secrecy. I know that secrecy overtime can deteriorate a person’s mental health, but I think I could overcome that aspect of at least deal with it. When things become to overwhelming I will have to find a way to cope. 

I have also thought about marrying a gay man. I would make sure to be honest with them, and tell them of my homosexuality. Overall, I think it could work out very well. I personally don’t see anything wrong with hiding my sexual identity for the rest of my life. Because at the end of the day it is no ones business what my sexual preferences are.",02Aug2020,1

351,"Hello Reddit,

I went on a trip with some friends (age 20-25) this past weekend. 3 of them were my close friends while the other 3 were new friends for me. I was a bit of a party pooper for some time. I didn’t wanna drink as much or pillow fight and I noticed a little while later the mood would change and it was because of me.

In my point of view, in those moments I saw it as me having asthma and anxiety issues. I didn’t wanna drink and I have been recently paranoid about my health and I guess a little off.

That’s not to say the whole time I was like this, I participated in most games that weren’t as physical as  pillow fighting, hiking or taking a lot of shots. 

So after this, a group chat was made of all of us and then the same night made a new one without me to make plans and have been hanging out with each other ever since. 

I was hanging out with two of them before the group chats were made. One was super chill and acted like nothing. The other acted a little off with me. The best friend was texting me normally until that night they made separate group chat and all chilled. She stopped responding. 

I can acknowledge I was a Debby downer for maybe even most of it. My problem lies with 3 of them being friends with me for years, not having any of these kinds of issues and suddenly stopped replying to my texts. (One of them being my best friend since I was 14).

I am wondering if I should apologize now or wait for them to hit me up? It’s been almost a week and I’m conflicted. I feel betrayed they seemingly gave me up so easily but I can see that I was pretty down and deff shifted the mood. I also don’t know if based on this new series of events that they already made the decision to cut me off and pointless for me to apologize?",02Aug2020,1
352,"So my parents are pretty strict about screentime on my phone and stuff like that and I (F17) used to have app limits on my phone each day and my entire phone's screentime would go off at 9-10 pm. Since then, I've had multiple arguments with them about this since I am mature enough to make my own decisions about my phone usage and I should be allowed to utilise my phone how I want without them monitoring what I do. After one extremely bad argument, We had a talk and they agreed to turn off the limits for my screentime if I was able to keep my grades up and attempt to be nicer to them (???)(They think that whenever I try to argue my case, It is being insolent). I agreed and they turned off the limit but still checked everything. I became so much happier without the limits as it allowed me to talk to my friends later at night and just think of myself as more mature as this was one part of my life that wasn't controlled to a massive extent. 

Recently, I've been staying up quite late but only on the weekends, I talk to my friends and overall, I just really love being able to relax on my two days off of school for the week since I am in year 11 and we are bombarded with constant work. Things have been working for both my parents and me and I've been interacting with them more and just overall getting along better with them in my opinion. On school nights I go to bed at reasonable times like 11:15-30pm but on the weekends I usually stay up until 1-1:30 am. This is because it's the only time I'm able to get away from homework and my parents' demands, I can talk to my friends who are also up and then get up in the morning and do my homework. Nothing has been going wrong in the way that I do things and I still get above the adequate amount of sleep. The other day, I worked for nearly 5 hours on studying for law and they both saw me, yet when I stayed up that night until 1:45, they lost it and now have implemented a one and a half-hour limit for all the apps that I use most. I have gone from having no limits at all to only having one and a half hours each day. 

I really don't know what to do as I was so much happier without the limits and there were no indications that I needed them, I go to a private school and my grades are still pretty good and haven't gone down at all since I had unlimited screentime, they are just upset that I stay up late. 

I still get all the things I need to do done and they have also implemented other things that I need to do around the house that I do without any problems, so I really don't understand why they felt the need to do this.

I should also add that they made me start going to therapy because they think that I may need a 'life coach' as they call it. at first, I didn't want to go but now I like talking to her because she helps me in trying to ask my parents for things that they wouldn't allow, like walking my dog later at night because I think it is more peaceful. She helps me with my communication skills and I think it's working a lot overall, but as soon as I go home, all the things we talk about go out the window, as my parents allow no room for negotiation and everything needs to happen in the ways that they want or I get punished with less screentime. My therapist helps me a lot but when I get home and my mum asks me what we talked about and I tell her, she gets defensive and upset that we talk about how I can deal with her parenting skills. She's the one sending me to therapy for the problems that she creates in my life, and then gets defensive when I talk about her during therapy, I don't know what she wants me to do???

Overall, I just really don't know how to deal with my parents implementing this one and a half-hour limit daily to my phone. It may seem small for some people but for me, my phone is a big thing and it is where I am able to talk to my friends freely and express myself and just disconnect from my life at home. I don't know how to argue with them any more about this as I always cry whenever I try to argue with them as they always yell. I've already given them all the points that I can and they won't budge and I don't know what to do.",02Aug2020,1
353,"Some background:

So I grew up in a pretty conservative household and my views more or less stayed relative to that of a conservative household. I consider myself a pretty decent guy (19m), I’m pretty strong to my views but I’m not alt right by any means. Mostly pro 2nd amendment, don’t love abortion, the works.

My friend group has never really been “PC” which sorta meant there weren’t too many jokes anyone was afraid of making which was nice. You know the typically race/religion/slur jokes that done people find offensive. Which I totally understand and this was something we mostly kept to ourselves, nothing too bad but I wouldn’t repeat some of it in front of a teacher at school. 

Anyway around the time we graduated HS is when everything got a bit different. My friends all started going to college and I left for basic training (Air Force). Shortly after I graduated BMT I came home for xmas we had fun except one of my friends I could tell had grown a bit apart from me but nothing too bad. Going to college he got a bit more liberal and more SJW vibe, not terribly far but more than I realized. (I’ve got no problem with it I just wasn’t expecting it). My views had not, perhaps even got a bit more right sided. Little did I know this caused more split than I realized. Shortly after xmas my friend came out as BI, she’s one of my best friends since 7th grade and I’d never known, I was supportive and such but it was still a surprise. I’m not anti gay or anything. Just probably make more gay jokes than I should. From then till now my sense of humor in our group chat haven’t changed much whilst my friends have become a bit more concerning/social warrior type and a little more pc. Due to me not really changing and sadly some jokes that sounded a bit racist-I promise you I’m not I just didn’t realize our group had an issue with those jokes now. My friend no longer calls me a friend. More recently it’s come to my attention neither (really) does my bisexual female friend from 7th grade. And a few day’s ago I made a n asian joke to my asian friend who didn’t care much but shared it with those to and it didn’t go well.
 

I’m trying to make a change to be less stubborn and more understanding of my friends views and actually listening more when it comes to political discussions with them. I’ve more or less lost two friends and I hate myself for it. I will be home again this Christmas and I really want my female friend to feel comfortable hanging out.

I don’t know how to change my ways. I’m trying but please any advice is helpful.

(Sorry if some things are spelled wrong it’s late and on phone)

Please and thanks for any advice :)",02Aug2020,1

I feel like I’ve tried everything that people have told me I need to do, I’ve lost over 70 pounds, I have new clothes, I have a car, I have a job, I’m in college, and yet I’m still too repulsive. I just don’t know what I can do and I feel totally hopeless. I’m good socially, I have tons of friends and I’m invited out all the time (when there isn’t a global pandemic going on) and I always keep people laughing. Anytime I’m ever out with people I know how to make them laugh without making myself look like a jackass, they also enjoy stories from me. But this doesn’t matter and the only thing I can figure is that it’s because of how ugly I am.

I have a therapist and I feel like I’ve told her pretty much everything I can think of about me and she really is great, I 100% wouldn’t be alive right now if it wasn’t for her. She has tried to reassure me that I’m not ugly and that nobody thinks I’m as ugly as I do but I just don’t see how that is true. I’ve been on tinder (which I’ve paid for gold since March), bumble, okcupid, and hinge since October last year and I have gotten probably 15 matches and a whole 0 dates. Even my mom and my sister told me that I’m a 2/10, I feel like such a disappointment to them.

I’ve asked out three of my friends in person before and they all said yes and seemed like they were excited, but out of those three 0 showed up to the date and 2 of them didn’t tell me they weren’t coming until a couple hours after we were supposed to meet. I didnt even feel upset at them because I don’t blame them for not wanting to be with me, I just felt mad at myself because I should have known better.

I just don’t know what to do, it feels like there’s no reason for a girl to be with me. I’m ugly, I’m in debt for a fucking history degree, I have no ability to make a lot of money, any trait I feel like is positive about myself can be found in plenty of guys with better prospects than me or who are way better looking. 

This has made me very suicidal and depressed. I don’t see the point in living when it’s by myself, I know other people can but I can’t. I have always been alone and I can’t do this forever. What do I have to look forward to? A “career” that I dislike, holidays alone, birthdays alone, any positive news would only be shared with myself, nobody to come home to, it feels like I have no reason to keep going.

I don’t know what to do.",02Aug2020,1

The second obstacle is their mother, which while isn't creating any commotion, keeps the brother on the rent check and reflecting his behavior back at them.

358,"First off I am 17 and i just finished driving school and it was horrifying. My driving teacher said I was a really bad driver and i’ll need a lot of practice and extra diving hours on the road. I can’t focus on so many different things when i drive such as the speed limit, staying in the center of the lane, watching for stops and other road signs, watching for pedestrians, etc. It makes me want to panic i’m shaking just typing this. When i’m in the car i hold the wheel so tightly and i hold my breath because of anxiety and i feel like stopping the car in the middle of the road and running out. When i was little (about 3 years old, still strapped into a car seat) I almost died in a car crash. My mom was driving drunk and she lost control of the car and it swerved off the side of the road into a lake and the car started filling up with water and i was going to die but luckily my moms friend in the backseat saved my life. i don’t remember any of it. after that i’ve been in at least 5 car crashes that i do remember (i was not driving in any of these). once someone speeding ran into my mom and they didn’t stop to help us they just drove off, and all of the windows broke in the car and my mom had blood running down the side of her head from the glass and i was so scared. i wasnt hurt or anything and the ambulance came and stuff. but it was really fucking scary. and then once after that i was riding in the car with my grandma driving and we went into a ditch because it was a two way road and these two drunk teens were swerving into our lane so my grandma drove into the ditch to avoid being hit. they ended up hitting the side of the car and breaking the mirror off. there has been so many more i can’t even list them all.. My close friend died last summer in a car crash along with two other girls who i didn’t really know but i just cried so hard and that made it even worse for me. my anxiety never gets better about driving. During driving school i almost got in so many crashes and i cried in the car while driving because he kept yelling at me saying i don’t listen and i’ll never learn. i ended up having to stop early that day. and that’s not even all. the first time i drove outside of driving school i hit my moms car when i was trying to park in the driveway. Then another time i accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake and almost rear ended another car, plus, a turtle tank was in the back seat so when i hit the brakes turtle water and rocks went flying everywhere and i got soaked. not to mention there was also a carton of eggs in the back which spilled all over the car when it happened. the most recent incident was today. i accidentally went in the turning lane at an interactive when i was supposed to be going straight. almost crashed again, the other car stopped the accident by basically swerving off the road and honking at me. please help someone this is awful i can’t take it. i’ve had reoccurring nightmares of getting in car crashes while driving or being the passenger in a crash and finding my parents dead. it got so bad when i was younger (around 8 or 9), i had to go to therapy and special groups and doctors because i would literally avoid sleeping because the dreams were so bad i couldn’t even leave my moms side or sleep alone. i would also panic when my dad would go under cars to work on them ( he’s a mechanic so i would often be at his work). i will also fear when an animal lays under a parked car. i’ve gotten better by now but the fear is back and it’s worse now and i don’t want to go to sleep i’ve been taking adderall to avoid it. someone advise me :(",02Aug2020,1

364,"(not really nsfw but a trigger word that's nsfw) I met my ex-friend on a online game and she was very close to me somehow. she kept talking to me and giving me gifts and i thanked her a lot and she wanted to know more personal info about me after   a month and i don't think before i do something but she showed me her face and told me what state she lived in and she told me ""you have to return the favor"" or something like that but i did. i showed her my face and i told her where i lived. we became best friends and we both had youtube channels and she decided to do this social experiment and i said i would help her. the experiment was that we made a alt account and pretended to be a hater of my friend. we wanted more help so we got a popular youtuber with 40k subs to help us another person with 1k subs. it worked and around 400 people helped my friend and only 100 helped me since i made a video about it too. it was pretty successful until at least 2 people tried hacking into the alt. i have very bad anxiety so i got scared and i had no idea what to do and my friend was offline so i had a very dumb plan to pretend i hacked into the alt and acted like ""hey this is my cousin trolling me"" people believed me and i had to keep lying about it. so me and that friend deleted all those hating videos and made a apology video to pretend it was my cousin and people accepted the apology but people wanted that alt to continue making videos so we decided we should or else our fan base will be sad. it was stupid of us but my friend was mostly the one making the videos on that channel. after all that happened we made our own discord servers and there was so much drama between us after a few weeks for stupid arguments we had and i became very upset of it and i kept venting to my friends i go to school with and they said ignore it and i did until more drama came and i became more upset and my health was becoming bad to the point where i didn't want to eat or go out with family anymore. i took many breaks but she continued. i should of ended the friendship there but i was afraid that she'll dox me and people will believe her because she has 300+ subs then me and i thought people liked her more then me. i was still her friend until she started doing more experiments on her channel and on me. i was telling my personal feeling about that ""friend"" to my best friend from school and i told her something like this ""i just think she's trying to get more fame and subs now since she keeps saying she wants to reach 1k subs"" so after i told my friend i want to quit youtube and stop being her friend she got upset and went to someone and decided to tell them that i'm a ""pedophile"" and show absolutely horrible proof on most of the evidence she had. so me as i am responded and showed lots of proof that i am not a pedophile and i finally announced to my fan based that that alt account we made was fake and it was us controlling it and i showed proof and people luckily believed me and i showed my side of the proof that i wasn't a pedophile and she didn't have much proof and i did so people of course took my side. now this drama is kinda dead but i'm still going to mention it anyways. she tried getting into my friend's discord account but she didn't know it was her account. here's what happened. i emailed her many times before and i don't know what came to her mind be she decided to get into my account. my friend was using my account because she couldn't make a new one yet and had to wait so once she could she could enter her new email and stop using mine. they send the ""i forgot my password"" thing on my account and i showed my friend ""hey look someone was trying to get into your account"" and i knew it was my friend because i knew where she lived and it showed her ip address and i told my friend ""hey look is this you or someone else that just lives near you?"" and she lied about her friend trying to hack me and try to get my subs. but she decided to hack my discord instead of my youtube so i knew she was faking it in the first place. what now made me more upset is that she made a post saying this about me to people ""she's pulling the victim card on herself and exposed me"" first of all i'm not using the victim card on myself because it was also my fault that i decided to help you on these things and i exposed both of us not just you. i at least didn't tell a random person what state she lived in but she had to tell someone i didn't know where i lived and some other personal stuff. she's a horrible person in general and i'm trying to ignore her but i can't because she continues to contact me and lie about me on the internet. i'm tired of her bringing me into middle school drama and i'm not sure what to do. now people on the internet that believe her are calling me ""shitty"" and a horrible person and now she's calling herself depressed which i'm not saying she isn't but she didn't like when i called myself depressed and didn't believe me and she's calling herself depressed kitten on the internet now. i want to end it but i'm not sure how and i really need advice. should i just ignore it and continue what i want to do or should i continue trying to stop her.",02Aug2020,1

368,"I (33F) have been close friends with another woman (49F) for just over three years. We used to work together and had to deal with a lot of the same bullshit so got very close very quickly. I considered her to be one of my best friends and she thought the same of me. 

In the entire three years that we’ve been friends our political views never came up...not even once. Well, in the beginning of the Covid nightmare I discovered that she is a Trump supporter. I was really thrown off by this and had to take a day to process, but once I did I decided that I shouldn’t let that get in the way of such a good friendship. We had a conversation about it and she agreed and we collectively decided that we just wouldn’t discuss politics. 

Flash forward to George Floyd’s death and the ramping up of the BLM movement. I am half black so this topic really hits close to home for me since my dad and family have faced racism several times in our lives.

She and I followed each other on Instagram and I was posting several things a day in support of BLM - documentaries to watch, organizations to donate to, celebrations of black culture, etc. I wasn’t being obnoxious or bashing Trump or anything like that. I was just showing support for a worthy cause that means a lot to me. 

After a few days of me posting about BLM, she started posting Candace Owens tweets that were in direct opposition to the things that I was posting and bashing BLM. I can’t say for sure, but she is very petty so I believe she was intentionally posting those things because she knew I’d see them. 

After another few days I realized that I had lost a follower. I wasn’t surprised and was actually expecting someone, maybe even a few people, to unfollow me. I went to check my followers list and sure enough she had unfollowed me. I went to check her page and got the “user not found” message. At first I thought that maybe she was just tired of seeing all of the BLM posts from myself as well as others, etc. so deleted her account, but I confirmed with a mutual friend that she still has her account which means that she blocked me. 

That was 2 months ago and despite me reaching out she hasn’t spoken to me at all. She gave no explanation. No rationale. Just blocked me on Instagram and cut off all communication. 

As a reminder...she is 16 years my senior...so should be more mature than me, but I guess age doesn’t always equate to maturity. 

Onto the advice part...

Her birthday is on Tuesday and I’ve been going back and forth about what to do. I could...

A. Send her a simple message that just says, “happy birthday.”

B. Send her a message to say my piece on the matter and close the book on the friendship

C. Not say anything and not acknowledge her birthday at all. 

I’m struggling with it because I don’t want to be petty and I want to be the bigger person, but I also feel like sometimes people just don’t deserve your kindness, especially after treating you like shit. 

At this point there is no way to salvage this friendship, so I kind of feel like just saying fuck it and sending her a message, gloves off, telling her exactly what I think. 

Thoughts? What would you guys do?

369,"My girlfriend and I started dating a little over 6 months ago. I told her I liked her but never asked to start dating because I wanted to take it slow. Then she said “My mom will be glad I’m dating a liberal.”  (I know)

When I said “oh, were dating?” she got offended and assumed I was using her. I was just surprised cuz neither of us said that we were dating yet. Every guy she’s ever been with has cheated on her so I don’t blame her for being nervous. But she told me out of the blue when we were just hanging out that her brother and her were texting about how they’ll kill me if I hurt her and how he and his friends jumped her last ex-boyfriend. I was not planning on hurting her but that still scared me. What if we ended up dating for a while and we broke up and she was hurt? I’ve brought some of these things up but whenever I bring up an issue I have in our relationship she usually self harms. She has severe depression and deals with extreme poverty, so I can’t really judge those type of struggles. I still do really care about her and love her and have a blast hanging out with her most of the time. From an outsiders perspective, is this an abusive relationship? What should I do?",02Aug2020,1
370,"So a friend (A) recently got dumped by her boyfriend (B), and while they continued to stay close, I know that he hooked up with another person in our acquaintance group (C). So, not cheating as such. However...

While chatting to A a couple of weeks ago, she said there was a chance her and B may get back together. She also said that she made it clear to B that C was the only person she was very uncomfortable with, and if B and C tried anything it would ruin any chance of a rekindled relationship - this is without A knowing they hooked up, ofc. (Not sure if worth noting but C makes me uncomfortable too - though I try to be polite - so I understand and completely empathize with A)

A and B are now back together, on the DL.

I have no intentions of telling A at current, and I'm not very close with the B, but I feel very responsible for the situation. I don't believe anyone else (bar my partner) has knowledge of both sides, and I feel if I were in her situation I would want to know, instead of finding out potentially years later.

372,"Background: I am a 22M.My mom and dad lives separately but they are not legally divorced.There is absolutely no chance of both of them getting together.A hell lot of shit happened after their marriage.My mom is unemployed.

So here it starts,ever since I was born we(mom and I) have been moving to and fro between my maternal grandparents house to my dad's house because my mom and dad quarelled and fought like animals.But since my mom is poor and my dad is rich as fuck she couldn't get a divorce(no money for lawyer,dad has great influence,3rd world country bla bla).Now recently passed college and got a half decent job so me and my mom decided to rent a house and move their as my dad considers us a burden.As luck would have it due to covid my new job joining got postponed to God knows when.I thought I finally got rid of that abusive dad.At first it was okay but fast forward 2 months and my mom is treating me like shit but there's a catch.She would love me and talk to me like a friend one day and the next day she would tell me to get the fuck out of her house(new rented apartment).I think prolonged abuse and harassment has taken a toll on her mental health.She wants a comfortable life which I couldn't give her(duh,i don't have any job at the moment,only savings).She refuses to lower her standard of life and blames me for all the shit that has happened to her.Just today she broke my phone and flung my bag(with laptop inside) out of the house in a gutter because the vegetables I bought from market is of sub par quality.Ever since I was a child ,my mom is the only person who have ever loved me but now I believe I have failed at being an adult.I could not be the person that my parents wanted me to become.

I don't know what to do,should I go and stay with my dad or continue to stay with my mom? At this point in life,I don't have money to buy or rent a new house and I feel pity for mom as she did so much for me but her recent behaviour is driving me crazy.I feel like shit all the time.This has been happening for the last few months.

I find working hard and just can’t seem to get in that professional work mode other people seem to be in. Due to Covid my role is now much more independent and the anxiety and worry this has induced is pretty intense. However, lots of people at my level would handle this just fine. The biggest problem though is that I’m just so emotional. I have luckily been able to come home to my parents for a weekend and leave today to go back to my flat and work and have already cried about it this morning because I am so sad or anxious to leave. I cry over pretty much everything that I find hard and feel like it’s the end of the world. I’ve actually always been this way and don’t seem to have grown up. I’m fully aware that I am actually so lucky to be in my position but I feel like I’m so sheltered and probably self centred? I’m definitely not good at just getting on with things if that makes sense.

374,"My school has started to plan for reopening and there are two options. A) go back to school with a mask, social distance, and keep clean. If rates of covid get too high, they will switch to hybrid ( 2-3 days in school and 2-3 days out of school each week) or go back to online. If rates of covid lower during hybrid or online schooling, they will switch back to normal in-person schooling. OR B) go completely online, but you have to commit for an entire semester

I want to go back to in-person school because I can easily ask questions and it’s just easier to work through things I don’t understand, but I also don’t want to go back for obvious reasons.

 On the other hand, there’s online learning, which would lower my chance of getting covid, but it would be harder to learn because I’m not in school and I can’t interact with my teachers as well (It would be especially hard for classes like Honors Chemistry which are lab heavy).

375,"I took my pets for granted and now they are gone. I don’t know how to feel better. I feel like there’s a black hole in my chest when I think of what a horrible mistake I made and I cry uncontrollably for hours.

When I was growing up we had a lot of cats. 

I loved them all very much. However I started ignoring them when I got older hanging out with friends and playing computer games and all kinds of stuff and I cared about them less and took them for granted. 

They were so special to me. And they were not getting enough attention. 


The thing is I got my own cat recently, the first I ever chose to get on my own. As an adult now I wanted to make sure I did things right and as I got better at making sure my cat had everything she needed I realized the mistakes I made with my cats growing up. And getting close to this cat who is very sweet reminded me of what I took for granted with those cats. 

It hurts so bad because just a few years ago I went to my moms house and saw the cats and they came up to me and were so desperate for attention. I felt bad and gave them attention but because my mom and I weren’t really close at that time I didn’t go back for almost a year afterwards. 

I can just remember how much they wanted me to pet them and lay with them in bed. I’m crying writing this, I’m such a scumbag for not going to see them more. 

I could have made up for all the years of ignoring them when I was growing up. I recognized how much they needed attention and needed to be pet. I know they’re just cats but please try and put yourself in my shoes. 

I could have fixed it but instead I didn’t go to my moms house again for years afterwards. 

Then when I started talking more regularly to my mom again I found out they all passed away except for one. They lived years and years without getting enough attention except for my mom but she has dogs also and I never felt she really gave them all as much attention as they needed beyond just feeding them giving them water and petting them when she sees them.

Which isn’t horrible but it’s not great especially because due to the dogs she had them living in a bedroom and bathroom. It was a master but it’s a small space for 5 cats to be living in. 

Having my cat now I only realized how horrible that is and it makes me resent my mom for not doing the right things to take care of them. 

They weren’t getting enough space or play or attention and I could have fixed it. I loved those cats more then anything.. I feel like I have done a horrible sin. I know they are just cats, I hope you understand. 

I would just appreciate any advice on how can I feel better? 

All I want to do when I think of them is run to my moms house to go pet them and hold them and then I remember they’re dead and I cry for hours and have to hide from everyone I know because I’m a grown up male and I just do not really like to cry or have anyone know that I cried if I do cry. 

This is tearing me apart. I loved those cats so much. Again any advice on what I can do to feel better is appreciated... 

I wish I could just make it up to them and let them know how sorry I am but I know that’s not possible but I wish it was. My friend told me she would take me to a person who communicates with spirits just so I could tell them and I was so sad and upset I honestly considered it.",02Aug2020,1
376,"So, in my life I’d say I’ve (f18) really only had two girl best friends, one in elementary and one in high school/ currently. In elementary I truly lived in the shadows of my best friend, constantly being chosen second or not at all to her, having my crushes beg me for her phone number. At a young age it definitely takes a toll on your confidence and sense of self, or at least it did for me and I tried to avoid that feeling all throughout the rest of school. I became best friends with this girl a while back, and as of recently it seems every time I post a photo with her, or even mention her to literally anybody, they’re asking who she is, if she’s single and if I’d be mad if they tried to hook up with her. Unfortunately this triggers the sad 11 year old in me and brings up old nasty feelings. I know this situation might not be a big deal to some, and I’m not sure if it is for me. Basically I’m just asking how I’m supposed to feel/react about this?

382,"I'll get right to it and provide enough unbiased information to hepp decide whether I'm the Asshole, we both are, or just the person I'm about to mention.

So basically in 2018 I was in a Discord server and somebody messaged me about Role-playing. They WERE nice. we hanged out more and more. Eventually they asked me out and since I didn't know any better at the time, and I didn't know much about the person. I accepted. This person was a NSFW roleplayer and therefore when I was in the server role-playing with a group of friends and My character interacted romantically with another one. At that moment they snapped and scolded me for it. I began to regret our relationship since I was now seeing this person's true colors. I started to notice they was clingy ever since that one day.

(In my opinion, take this one part with a grain of salt)
I didn't know this word back then, but I would have most likely told them they were being a hypocrite. I'm not the only one they've done a NSFW roleplay with, frankly I didn't enjoy those, and I never scolded them doing such in their past. Yet they thought it was fine to do it towards me. 
(Despite it being PG-13 and not complete NSFW, which means I never did intercourse with my characters and other's characters sine we started dating).

(Back to the non biased text)
They forgave me for it but told me I was hanging onto a thin rope. I reached out to friends for their second opinion and how I should continue our relationship from there. They all advised me to end it right there and live on without them. I didn't listen, being naive and optimistic, I told them I would hold on a little longer becuase I still thought they could change. Little did I know this wouldn't change and then they find out that my friends had been calling them toxic and swears. Such words were used becuase they didn't like the fact I was suddenly pulled into that mess. To not ruin any further friendships I took their words with a grain of salt and just agreed but never recited anything to my partner. They were constantly hurting themselves and vented multiple suicide ""attempts"" to the server. So therefore I thought reciting such words would be an Asshole thing to do so I didn't recite those words. I broke up with them when they found out about those words my friends had said. But my friends weren't done yet. After this person tried to flatter me, trick me, and manipulate me into dating them again. My friends had enough of just hugging me through everything and decided to take a stand. They asked me to add them into a Group with my ex and basically backlashed all over my ex. I hoped they would make it clear that I didn't want to date my ex ever again. Instead they just insulted my ex, and I would have then hoped they would take the hint and stopped using specific set of words around me. Meanwhile I was seeing (who I'll nickname ""someone else"") they were charming and caring. Sure maybe not the sharpest tool in the shed but I really didn't care. Me and someone else eventually got together. We were part of the LGBT+ community. Remember this detail. Me and someone else spent so much time together I couldn't see the backlash my friends were giving my ex, instead of the clear message that ""I wasn't interested into my ex anymore"".

One random day my ex's sister and brother told me that my ex had taken pills to try and end themselves. That they might be braindead but that my ex was recovering. They got me to actually worry, for something I didn't even know if it was real or not, they later said she would have speech issues due to it but that they would hand my ex their phone so that they could talk with me. 

(This detail is important, but you can skim it considering I'll also jam my opinion into this part).
My ex admitted to making up their siblings, most of them, that they actually have one sibling that exists. They gave me stories about the siblings' demise, despite them not being real, right before telling me they were fake. Here goes my theory, they faked the whole pill overdose situation. Why?
1. Their siblings could not have talked to me if they weren't real.
2. Her ""siblings"" told me that my ex would have speech problems. Not a typing one. But if not seeing or thinking clearly was a side effect I didn't know about, then I can logically eliminate this point as well considering..
1. They told me about a Poly relationship with someone else and me
2. They mentioned my Someone else (which they vaguely knew)
3. They remembered multiple miniscule details so if their thinking was tampered with they should not have been able to recall so much.
4. They've claimed to hurt themselves in the past while I was together with someone else. Most of these however were becuase of one reason ""I wasn't with them, cutting theirselve was the only way of getting rid of that pain"".

(Back to non opinionated text)
I had to break up with that someone else becuase of family drama messing with our relationship, mostly disgust from my brother, becuase I and that someone else had seemed to be part of the LGBT+ community. That really messed me up. Then that someone else went on a rampage about targeting anybody who could have been the reason I ended my time with him. This left me vulnerable. So when I was at my lowest my ex approached me one last time.. and got what she wanted..me.. but later Someone else snapped me out of it and I got together back with him. This is the thing I acknowledge as being an Asshole move, leaving my ex like that, becuase of the fact I didn't tell my ex about my issues with someone else. I do blame myself for that but I just didn't want to blurt all over my ex that I broke up with someone else like if it were their problem. Especially after my friends attacked them for constantly messaging me that ""I still love you"". I just didn't think it would be right. 

Then my ex began to play the victim card. Blaming my friends and me for their bad mental health, although I admit we may have had some affect it wasn't as massive as what was done to her before. Then they just ignored everyone who caused her bad mental health from the past and just decided to blame it all on my friend, someone else, and me.

Since then, after many arguments, and convincing my ex that I've never hated them and telling them I just didn't want to be in the relationship they put me through. They promised to change, I was basically the only one who believed them. They seemed to change..

I befriended them, but then we began to drift away. Their old toxic behavior had seemed to reappear, then they started leaching onto me again. I didn't like it. So I told them, they should forget about me and make new friends, even more. They saw this as me trying to get rid of them. So then I told them to hold onto that thought and asked a friend for help. They guided to me to help me tell my ex that
 ""I no longer felt comfortable around them. That I didn't like the pressure any longer and needed to cut them off.  I hope you have a good rest of your life. Sorry but this is good-bye"".

That is what I tried to get across. I didn't like the relationship any longer and that I wanted to end it before it got intoxicating for myself. They would have never let me go if I didn't say one thing before removing them off my friends list.
Something that has kept them from sending me another friend request.
""You telling me you can't live on without me makes me feel chained to this friendship, that isn't what I want""

So uh ...yeah .. Who's the real big Asshole? More than one? I'm new to this so I don't know what can be decided of this post.

Edit: My ex has family! Their family makes them seek help with their issues (hurting themselves ect.) to help themself. Their situation is acknowledged and needs no further action from myself.

Edit 2: Since this is advice related now .. did I really make the right choice?",02Aug2020,1

I don't know why, but these past few months I've kinda got stuck in a rut, and I can't seem to get out of it. I'm constantly feeling tired, sleepy and bored. My attention span is non-existant and I can't focus on even learning how to use new apps, programs. Reading newspapers, books and so on has started to feel like a chore as well.

I'm not obese, I try to keep myself healthy by going for runs every other day, doing pushups, squats, situps and stretching. While I do feel a short energy boost for like an hour or two, after that I still go back to feeling same. I don't drink a lot either, maybe one beer or a glass of wine a month. I don't take any drugs.

I used to think I felt this way because of the weather. Usually when it was raining I felt drowsy and sleepy, and on sunny days I was energetic and motivated. But lately that has not been the case.

Unless I'm at work, my days basically consist of: wake up, eat, open youtube, reddit, do that until 4 pm, then watch Stargate or Sopranos on TV, after that watch twitch streams until midnight, go to sleep - repeat. Some days I go for groceries obviously, but other that that, it's all the same.

I feel like I’ve tried everything that people have told me I need to do, I’ve lost over 70 pounds, I have new clothes, I have a car, I have a job, I’m in college, and yet I’m still too repulsive. I just don’t know what I can do and I feel totally hopeless. I’m good socially, I have tons of friends and I’m invited out all the time (when there isn’t a global pandemic going on) and I always keep people laughing. Anytime I’m ever out with people I know how to make them laugh without making myself look like a jackass, they also enjoy stories from me. But this doesn’t matter and the only thing I can figure is that it’s because of how ugly I am.

I have a therapist and I feel like I’ve told her pretty much everything I can think of about me and she really is great, I 100% wouldn’t be alive right now if it wasn’t for her. She has tried to reassure me that I’m not ugly and that nobody thinks I’m as ugly as I do but I just don’t see how that is true. I’ve been on tinder (which I’ve paid for gold since March), bumble, okcupid, and hinge since October last year and I have gotten probably 15 matches and a whole 0 dates. Even my mom and my sister told me that I’m a 2/10, I feel like such a disappointment to them.

I’ve asked out three of my friends in person before and they all said yes and seemed like they were excited, but out of those three 0 showed up to the date and 2 of them didn’t tell me they weren’t coming until a couple hours after we were supposed to meet. I didnt even feel upset at them because I don’t blame them for not wanting to be with me, I just felt mad at myself because I should have known better.

I just don’t know what to do, it feels like there’s no reason for a girl to be with me. I’m ugly, I’m in debt for a fucking history degree, I have no ability to make a lot of money, any trait I feel like is positive about myself can be found in plenty of guys with better prospects than me or who are way better looking. 

This has made me very suicidal and depressed. I don’t see the point in living when it’s by myself, I know other people can but I can’t. I have always been alone and I can’t do this forever. What do I have to look forward to?

405,"I’m a college student working a summer job at a popular store in my city, been here for about three weeks now. Most of my coworkers are nice, friendly people and I’ve had zero problems fitting in with them, but my supervisors/managers and the store’s owners have been nothing but completely toxic to me. While that’s usually not a deal breaker- every workplace usually has a few sour apples and it’s impossible to please everybody- I feel like a few recent interactions have become too egregious to ignore.

My immediate supervisor has made several racist comments about customers in the store, saying things like “oh they’re definitely not paying for that because their unemployment check can’t cover it” and “that person is so needy must be a ghetto thing.” Although I haven’t personally witnessed this, other coworkers have told me that this person has also made misogynistic and transphobic remarks in the past, as well. 

After the first instance, I reported what I’d heard to one of the management staff where I was met with the usual platitudes like “we value diversity here, I don’t care if you’re black white or purple” and “we’ll deal with this now it’s not acceptable in any way!” and I was assured that the issue was dealt with a couple days after.

Literally the day after I heard that, my supervisor makes several more remarks. Even further, they became openly toxic to me after a miscommunication on their part led to a simple screw up, berating me with shit like “so what didn’t you understand about it?” and eventually leaving early, forcing me to handle a busy storefront at closing time by myself. It’s also pretty clear that they know I reported them so I’m taking a reasonable guess that it might have been retaliation, but I’m not exactly sure.

There are other, smaller things like throwing me into another, completely unrelated department other than the one I was hired to when I delayed my starting date by a week to deal with a family issue or promising me a higher starting wage and then mysteriously “forgetting” about the conversation afterward, but I feel like this is the breaking point for me. 

I’ve taken a day to think about it and my thoughts haven’t changed: I’m supposed to come into work today but I really don’t feel comfortable doing so and a two weeks notice would be hell lol.

I’ve never heard of a bank needing 1000$ to transfer money over to an account which I find sketchy. It’s been over a week 1/2 now and surprise surprise no money has gotten put into her account. Every time I ask her about it she practically yells at me and says I’m stressing her out and this and that but I have every right to be stressing her out because this is my money and she isn’t loosing nothing. I really need this money at this point because I wanna put my down payment in for this truck but without that extra 1000$ it’s going to set me back a lot. I’m debating about going to my grandparents about the whole ordeal, as they knew I was saving up as well for this truck that I want badly. 

I’m wondering should I give it another 1/2 a week to a whole week before I try confronting my grandparents? Or should just I confront my grandparents about this right away?

408,"I’ll try to keep this brief because I tend to ramble and I apologize in advance if I end up doing so anyways. (*after finally finishing writing: yes I did ramble, and really badly too so proceed with caution)

I’ve always been a horrible procrastinator but in the past year, it has escalated to concerning levels. My program in college had us doing our last semester in hospital clinical rotations. It was practically an 8hr workday + being a full time student because we still had assignments, practicals, exams, etc. My mental health was awfully low when these rotations started back in January. I was unmotivated and felt disconnected, and it didn’t help that it was the bitter cold, dark winter months. I was spiraling from ongoing issues with family and friends. I don’t think I had ever felt this low before—it was likely clinical depression but I don’t feel right self-diagnosing. But all the signs were there now that I think back. So yeah, basically I was in a really bad place. I got behind with my schoolwork really quickly because the hospital rotations left me exhausted. Everything piled and piled and eventually the pandemic made its way to the US. Clinical rotations were stopped and replaced with online renditions and even more work, unfortunately. Now this is where it gets real bad. Being left alone to my own devices and no sort of structured schedule, I crumbled. I didn’t touch work for a month probably. 

My advisor noticed how behind I was, suggested summer graduation. I said okay, makes sense. However, I still did not take advantage of the extra 3+ months because I am a grade A piece of sht. Now here I am, with &lt;1 month to finish practically an entire semester worth of classes. If you have ever been in college/are in college, I’m sure you understand how utterly detrimental this is. I’m supposed to be graduating. I don’t know how to even go about this. I’m scared. I feel like even if I do start now I’m gonna fail miserably at the exams and have to retake anyways because I’m so far behind in my learning. I haven’t checked my school email in a month because I’m terrified of my professors asking about what’s going on. Cause there’s no good answer—a concerning level of procrastination, laziness, and low motivation m/self-esteem won’t cut it. 

I can’t possibly tack on another semester because that would be absolutely idiotic money-wise and career-timeline wise. I don’t want to disappoint my parents but I’m at a loss. I’m so so close to being done with college but it just feels like this is the most monstrous mountain left to climb. I know I have the brain capacity if I try, but now time is burning and I can feel my mental health about to take another toll.

I know I brought this onto myself and am an absolute idiot who should have taken the opportunity of a “free” schedule during peak pandemic. But I didn’t. Because I suck and there’s probably some mental issue here that needs addressing but ahhh I really can’t right now. 

Even if no one reads this I guess it felt good to acknowledge my current issues. If you did read this, I’m sorry for this mess of a stream of consciousness. 

I guess the advice I’m looking for is: how do I dig myself out of this deep deep hole that I’ve dug? I just want to graduate by the end of August. Is this even possible with a semester workload and a mere few weeks to do it? This would include written work, case studies, 100+ question exams....so yeah.

417,"A recent friend(29F) of mine(32F) is living at my house with her two children while I live with my boyfriend. She is going through a separation with her husband(29M) and has two special needs children. The husband is an overgrown child-man and has mistreated her and the children. His behavior is concerning and unhealthy for her and the kids. To give you an idea, he walked over the toddler so she fell instead of dodging her and then screamed at the child for crying and insulted my friend (his wife) for calling him out. He insults her and the children and the toddler doesn’t want to be alone with him. 
Another example is the man lives 1 block from his work and even though she is now living 20 mins away at my house, will attempt to insist she wake up early and come take him to work. His parents are letting them use the car so he says it is rightfully his. He is also addicted to pot and my friend feels she has been single mother even while living with him. She recognizes she should have never married him, let alone stayed for so long. 
My friend has a long history of trauma and so much on her plate. She is truly doing the best she knows can. She has a job and is working a full day 6-7 days a week, while managing both children, their daycare and all doctors appointments. She doesn’t truly have family to support her and the man ruined her credit. 
She just recently decided to separate from him and is stuck in a lease with him. She doesn’t have her own car and can not afford to pay half that rent and get her own place with the kids. 
I helped her apply to charities that help people get cars and she is working on what help she can get for her and children as she is legally separating and moving towards divorce. 
Thing is, I really want to go home. I don’t know what or who can help someone in a situation like this. It isn’t domestic violence, though is mentally abusive and full of gaslighting. It is also very harmful to her two children as they are very delicate. She told me he shook one as a baby and that’s so scary to me for them. 
She has been at my house for two weeks. I want to support her, though it’s taking a toll on me financially and straining my fairly new relationship with my boyfriend.

About a year and a half ago, he confessed to taking a picture his crush when they were 17, who had a good butt when she was wearing yoga pants in the library. I was repulsed and he seemed guilty and I moved on and hadn't thought of it since. 

It came up in conversation randomly this afternoon for the first time in 1.5 years and I asked him how long he kept this creepy pic for, assuming that he must've deleted it within a few days/weeks out of guilt. He said he probably had it for a year or so and had simply forgotten about it after a while, hence it was there for a year.  I went on a rant for 10 minutes about how perverted that is from the point of view of a feminist and how would he feel if some creep did that to me? He let's me use his phone/laptop whenever and I know all his passwords (he volunteered them a year ago, never asked) so it couldn't be there anymore. I asked him if he would ever do it again if he was single and he said ""probably not"" and I freaked and said ""probably not? You mean you still don't respect women enough to know you wouldn't"". He then explained that he hadn't consciously thought about how wrong what he did is, from a woman's point of view until last night when I went on a rant.

I came across this post on Instagram from @karinairby (who's verified btw) and she posted this DM from this lady (let's call her L) who said her skin issues (which she was born with) may be because of weight gain and hopefully the advice would help her. 

Now Karina only posted that and one singular response to L saying ""wow"". Karina then made a whole post about it saying how its people like L who make us feel ashamed about having defects and so on. 

Now here is where it gets interesting, out of curiosity, I go onto L's page and on her story is the FULL dm chat between her and Karina. After saying wow, Karina also says ""ok cool... I'm going to jump off a bridge now. Enjoy having my death on your hands."" L then mentions she knew she'd take it negatively and that she was only trying to help. 

Now at this point I'm steaming! So I comment under Karinas post: ""wait but why did you say you we're going to jump off a bridge and to ""enjoy having your death on her hands""??? That is SO insensitive and quite frankly a bit manipulative"" 

Then she replied "" because people take their own lives over consistent bullying every day! You don't know someone's mental health by looking at them, so don't assume they're strong enough to be consistently beaten down by hurtful comments"" 

I agree with her statement but it did not address really why she threatened her own life. To which I replied: 

""I'm not saying what she said wasnt a bit insensitive, what I AM saying is what you're doing (a suicidal threat) is wrong and very serious. Yes, people kill themselves all the time because of harsh words and bullying, but that is NO EXCUSE for you to use that to make a point.""

I (19F) can’t really like other people romantically so easily, almost never.

I’m usually not interested in dating other people and I’m not even a horny person so how do I do it? How do I start doing that? I think it would help me a lot. Thanks in advance!

1. Coming home from work or leaving at night with her blazing high beams aiming at my windows,  (she eventually stopped this)
2. There were moments where I would be outside in my backyard (because you know, it's my backyard) and she would click her car alarm twice as if that would do make me go inside or something. Yet I just ignored this and she stopped.

This is a very miserable woman and I wish everyday that I had another neighbor, So I've ignored her all those times but today I almost lost my cool.

I have a 14 year old daughter and during the rare times, this woman is outside using a weed whacker as a lawn mower, since I guess she can't buy one or didn't want to pay someone to mow anymore. Anyway, as soon as my daughter goes outside with a trash bag to put into the bin, this woman quickly goes into the house to stare at my daughter through the tinted screen door. As my daughter opens the bin to put the trash in it, this woman opens her door, grabs the weed whacker from the ground to stare a little more at her then heads inside. Then as my daughter is inside our home, she comes outside to resume her weed whacking. 

As a mother, I'm getting pissed from this. I don't know the mindset of this woman but it's making me feel that she'll harass/spy my daughter. And before people ask, she's not mentally ill, I asked a neighbor and she works at some Sales job and has three daughters. All of them are out of state, yet one of the daughters, who lived with her until 22 had a lot of anger and depression issues while staying with her, she also tried to commit suicide 3 times within 4 years. Which I feel bad and pray she's doing better, She also had a two year old dog which she yelled at and stressed out so much that he eventually had a seizure and died. 

I don't understand people like this and concerned with what to do about this. I don't care that she's staring at me, yet once she's doing this crap towards my daughter, I start to get pissed. Although I've told my daughter to just ignore this woman if you see her looking through her screen door. I have to say that my daughter is a much better person than me, since she says it doesn't bother her at all.

Yet you just don't know people and their ways anymore, I sense that she's jealous of my family and I'm trying to think of solution for this. Should I just continue and ignore her? I REALLY do not want to form any relationship with this person, I do not like mean spirited neighbors like this.",02Aug2020,1

I feel like he doesn’t quite approve of my partner. I think it’s because my partner is a lot of things that my father would not like. My partner is unhealthy, overweight, and has been struggling to keep a job. (Before COVID) My partner is trying to be more healthy and lose weight. It feels conflicting because those are things that my partner can’t help, but there are other traits that my partner does that has made me believe I shouldn’t be with them. In the past they’ve been very toxic in different ways. It’s hard to explain all of it. My partner has improved a lot and I’ve kept my patience with him, but it’s conflicting.  My therapists have softly suggested I shouldn’t be with my partner, my friend has flat out told me he hates my partner and how my partner treated me in the past, I’ve had my own doubts, and now my father who barely knows anything about my partner has started to try and suggest I look at other people.

I was diagnosed with persistent depression a few weeks ago and the people around me find it very hard to deal with. My sister and my stepmom don't have a great history and my stepmom is afraid to repeat that with me. My dad was defending me and him and my stepmom were inside yelling at eachother, I was crying outside and trying to calm myself down and my stepbrother was in his room. Him and I are both 13-15 years old. We heard everything and I know that it was partly about the fact that I talked back to her when I told them I didn't want to talk. I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it because I already almost had a panic attack once they started fighting. 

Me and my stepbrother ended up going to bed at 2.15 AM and my dad and my stepmom were still very mad at eachother. Luckily my dad was there for me. I slept at 3.15 AM because I could hear them fighting from my bedroom. I woke up at 5.45 AM and about 15 minuted later I heard them arguing again. They talked it out right now and they want to stay here for the next 8 days because that was the original plan.

443,"I (18m) sent my step mom (40f) a video of my dad (45m) masturbating.

My mom and dad divorced when I was 5 years old, and my mom has been completely out of the picture ever since. My dad starting dating my now stepmom when I was 9, they got married right after I turned 10, and she immediately moved in with us. Obviously, since I didn't even know my mom, I quickly grew attached to her and she took me right under her wing. My dad couldn't have married a better woman, and she treated him right. I don't think I've ever seen her yell or get angry a single time in the entire 9 years that I've known her. Her and I have a great mother-son relationship, and I often went to her for private advice on things before I even considered going to my dad. 

Now, in the last few months, my dad has been acting sort of distant from my step mom. I don't know if it's because of the pandemic, I'm honestly not sure. She asked me if I had noticed, and I told her I had.

A week ago, dad got a new phone, and he always gives me his old phone when he decides to upgrade, and it's always a huge upgrade for me from my current phone. I always make sure to reset it to factory settings and this keeps the ""new phone"" excitement. Two days ago, I was testing out the camera when I noticed some pictures and videos on the phone that were stored on the Micro SD that was left in the phone. Apparently those stay even when you return to factory settings. One of the videos I found was a video of my dad masturbating. My step mom never goes on business trips or anything, so why he would take a video like this? I decided to confront him.

When I did, he looked like he had seen a ghost. He said to delete the video immediately and to never speak of it again. I asked him why he would take a video like this, and he said it's none of my business, and he made me delete the video in front of him(I saved a copy on a flash drive prior), and he said if I ever spoke about to anyone, particularly my step mom, that he was kicking me out and cutting me off completely.

This infuriated me. He was obviously cheating on my step mom. My dad is at work (he works night shift), so I asked her if I could email her a video I had found and if she could watch it in private (I didn't want to be there when she watched it, and the video was on a flash drive on my laptop). She looked puzzled, but she said sure.

Afterwards, she asked me where I got the video and I told her everything. She said she had never seen the video before, and that she had been suspicious of him having an affair and this confirmed it. She started packing her bags, and she told me she is leaving. My dad doesn't know about any of this yet, but he will be home in a few hours. She's going to confront him then and most likely leave afterwards for good. I'm worried that I made a huge mistake. My step mom is the the closest thing I have to a real mom, and she is leaving. I have no idea what's going to idea when he gets home. I'm lost.",02Aug2020,1
444,"Hey guys,

as you can tell by the title, I don't have many friends at all. I'm a 20  year old guy that just graduated high school who is lonely and doesn't know how to go on with life.

I  got like 2 friends who I am close with and that's fucking it,  other than that I got no one. I got a handful of people that I talk to sometimes and try to do stuff with but they never got time for me.

Yesterday  I met up with a girl at the lake, who I knew from my school. We went swimming, talked for a little and then after about 3 hours I assume she got bored with me, even made an excuse that she has to get ready because she is going out tonight. It was 4:15 pm. She definitely could have stayed longer if she wanted to.

I'm sick and tired of life, and it fucking annoys me always having to be the one to try to get other people to do stuff with me.

451,"Context: 16y/o, met online in March. Met up early July, seen her 4 times now. Last weekend I was at her house (3rd time) sitting on her bed. Was kissing her cheek, then forehead, and was holding her face in my hands. So I went in for a kiss. Well she didn’t really kiss back and immediately buried her face in my lap and wrapped her arms tightly around my waist for nearly a minute. I like her a lot, and it seems when we’re in person she likes me too — deep eye contact, taking my hand putting it on her leg, kissing/nibbling my neck/cheek, etc. 

Anyway I felt it strange we both said nothing about the kiss so tonight I sent her a text basically asking how she felt about it. Her response:

“i liked it v much [[receipts]](https://imgur.com/a/uh84Uw8)

pls dont hate me im very awkward answering this”

And then I had to take it further and say she can always let me know if she isn’t cool with how things are going. Her response:

“it was okay🥺i have no issue with it” 

So my spirits kinda sunk with this because if I’m kissing someone I don’t really want them to be like “its ok”. She seemed really blushy about it when I did it so I thought she’d feel more than “it’s okay”. Can someone explain what happened or where I went wrong? If I need to remedy anything (and how), and how to proceed with future dates/kiss? Honestly this seems weird to me mostly because in the past she’s very excited in her texts to me. Like texting me pics of me on her bed saying that it smells like me and that she’s sad I’m not there, sending me texts that say “cuddle me );”, straight up texting “make out w me” before I ever kissed her, etc. So I know it’s not that she’s shy about texts. I also know she’s the kind of person who would have trouble telling someone if she genuinely isn’t interested.",02Aug2020,1
452,"It's hard to describe the context of a 20 year relationship but I'll try my best. I'm 20 years old, I moved to a different country for college last fall. However, due to covid, I've been back home since March and don't know how long I'll be back here.

My dad is a traditional, aloof, emotionally unavailable father, but he'll do anything for his family. He is very reliable in the day to day stuff that are involved with managing a family, and I am extremely grateful for all the things he's done for me. Thanks to him, I've never really had to worry about money, even when he was worrying about money. My mom got married very young, she came from a really controlling family, she's the one who actually raised my siblings and I while my dad was working and paying the bills. She's always supported me and been there for me for as long as I can remember. Any goal or ambition I had, she was the first one backing me.

Now to the bad part, my parents have been fighting ever since they got married (24 years :O ago). They are just not compatible together and it took me a very long time to understand that neither of them are necessarily the bad guy, they just don't understand each other. There's a terrible age difference (10 years) and they just have different things they want out of life. No kidding, they fight almost every week. They've ""almost"" gotten a divorce like five or six times now. The latest time was last summer, there was a huge issue that seemed unresolvable. My siblings and I both advised both my parents to just end everything and get on with their lives, but they didn't want to. They kept fighting for like two months, until we helped them patch things up, even though we thought it was a terrible idea, but didn't want to go against their wishes.

My mom was away during this last fight for the whole two months. She was in a different country, so we didn't see her. However, when she came back, she turned into a different person. I wasn't here because I had moved away for college, but I sensed it, my siblings confirmed it, and I confirmed it when I came back. She has no patience for anyone and goes crazy if things don't go her way. My parent are more strict than the average parents so I've learned to deal with a lot over the years. They are extremely religious, and I am not, so I've learned to respect that and not mention anything against their religion to them. However, my mom keeps badgering me about praying and a bunch of other religious bs. When she doesn't agree with my life plans, she keeps criticizing me every single day until I do what she wants. She even keeps criticizing after the fact when everything is said and done. Whenever she talks to me, it's either an order or some kind of criticism. She keeps pestering me about little things, and when it's something I can manage do, I do. However, sometimes it just comes at wrong times or it's something I'm just not comfortable doing. She never understands that, it's do it now or you're an asshole son. She keeps talking shit about me to her family so most of them think I'm an asshole now too. I'm not claiming to be a saint, I can get pretty angry sometimes, but she is becoming really unreasonable. There's even a running joke in my family that my mom has become a ""Karen"" and it's true.

Other than this, she is always complaining about my dad, literally every single day. My dad's far from perfect but I'm sick of being my parents go between. I told them both I don't want to hear any of their problems anymore. My dad's never been much of a talker, so that was geared more towards my mother. However, she says that that means that I am an ungrateful child and a traitor. She has this notion that my dad is the embodiment of evil and we have to save her from him. Yet when we tried to, she declined, and we respected that. She can't have it both ways.


Anyways, the crux of the matter is this, am I wrong for losing my patience with her? See, I have the ability to move back to school, even though instruction is online. For a while, I've been thinking about staying here because I really value the friends and family I have here, but if life at home is gonna be this difficult I'm worried it'll affect me academically. I don't want to throw away everything I have here, but I'm worried I'm going to have to.

Around when the quarantine started things started getting a little weird, maybe because we spend so much time together, but she would become totally unresponsive and sometimes leave without saying a word.

The total unresponsiveness has increased since then. Out of seemingly nowhere she will totally shut herself off toward me and pack up and leave without saying a word. It really hurts, because if I try to ask her about it it almost always inevitably turns into some annoying thing where I am just talking at her trying to find out whats wrong, and she will just become increasingly unresponsive and resentful.

I really don't know what to do when this happens. It happens to regularly now that I feel like she no longer is attracted to me and is only with me because of the safehaven our relationship provides or something.

469,"I’m a high schooler and I don’t know what to do with my life. I made a Reddit account just to make this post because I’ve been struggling with this thought ever since the school year.

My feelings are neutral on business and math, while I’m not that passionate I can learn to become interested or learn how to adapt.

What I’m afraid of is that I’m only in it for the money and not out of personal interest. It’s also a competitive career, and I have a feeling that I might still lack in a lot of areas when it’s time for me to find a job. Maybe I might’ve realized way too late that I underestimated this path and that I’m not cut out for it.

Despite my fears I’m clutching onto this path because I don’t know what to do. It’s only a good idea in theory because it would help my personal finances and support my parents financially.

My dad said he will support whatever I choose even though he would rather have me go into the medical field. He details his job to be stressful and tiring; it’s the major reason why he can’t quit smoking. Even though it’s an unhappy job it provides financial support.

I’m interested in arts but mostly as a hobby. Someone said to go for an art-related career but the problem is I’ve been in a slump for 2 years. While I’m not as passionate in art as I use to be I still love it and occasionally draw, but the end results are always discouraging.

Still, I like to envisioned my future where I draw comics as a hobby or do commissions for fun all while being an accountant with a constant worry over their deadlines and their clients’ businesses.

So, should I become an accountant or should I listen to my fears and find a different path? Should I get back into art more seriously and aim for an art career instead?",02Aug2020,1

471,"For backround I'm a 20 years old female and have been living with my husband (31M) for two years. I have five younger siblings (5-18 years old), my mom is 46 and dad is 44. My mom is a housewife and full time caretaker of my disabled sibling while my dad is working. 
This started a year ago after I had graduated and got my first real job. I was making slightly over the minimum wage of my country and I was so proud of it. 1500€ after taxes is a lot of money for someone who's 19 years old and has never had that kind of money on their bank account before. I had made saving plans and felt like ""a real adult"". However pretty quickly after my first paycheck my mom asks me to loan her some money. They were in a tough situation and she promised to pay back soon. It wasn't too much, maybe like 200€. But instead of paying back next month she asked for more. And more, and more and more. I don't even know how much she owes me anymore and I'm not sure if I want to know. The amount must be over 2000€ already since only last month I had to give her 1000€. She insists that I can't tell anyone, especially not my dad. I had to tell my then boyfriend (now husband) after about six months this started since the stress and anxiety that it caused were starting to strain our relationship. 
Now I'm 9 months pregnant and we don't even have a pram for the baby because of this. I have 0 savings, every extra cent I might save usually goes to my mom next month. We are renovating our home and my husband has mostly been paying for it but due to some unexpected expenses caused by the mistakes of his friend (who was helping us with building) it's on hold and we don't have running water inside the house. If I had money I could help with it, but I don't have any. I can't afford to maintain two families, but I don't know how to say no. I have told this to my mom but she still keeps asking. My siblings live at home and I feel like if I don't give her money it's my fault if my siblings suffer because of it. I think dad is completely oblivious to this situation. I know that this isn't my responsibility, but I feel like it is. 
I'm stressed out and anxious all the time and scared of what's going to happen in the future. I have an anxiety disorder and this is making it worse, but I can't afford to go to therapy anymore. I used to see a therapist two years ago but my mom guilt tripped me to the point that I quit. 
I don't even know what kind of advice I need. I just feel helpless and I know that if I try to get some help for this she will star gaslighting and guilt tripping me again since she thinks that whatever goes on in the family stays in the family and professionals have no business in helping us.

472,"Hey. I don't know if this is the right subreddit for me to talk about this, but I'd like some advice. 

I'm in my late teens now. At the young age of 12, I was cyberbullied and sometimes, memories of it still trigger me. Partly, it was my fault because I was on an app (for fanfics), and I plugged a twitter account and it's not really a big deal and I ultimately forgot because no one on that app followed that account. However, I was wrong. Someone was stalking me and it came to the point where this person knew about my informations because I was careless. They messaged me, created multiple fake accounts to curse at me, harrass me online, threatened to hack, called me names and all sorts of curses you wouldn't imagine telling someone who is literally in pre puberty. The only reason they attacked me was because I created ""side"" accounts to follow myself on my main account to gain followers, and I know that it's wrong but I never bullied other people using those, nor established hate speech against others. While I knew that that was a desperate move of me, I don't think it's enough reason to harrass me or anyone of that matter. 

I honestly don't remember how it ended, but I did block them. Looking back, it's still scary to me. This was 5-6 years ago, and it's probably a troll because they (thankfully) never bugged me again. My regret was that I was too immersed with social media that time and followers, that I didn't realize how serious online security was. I was too young, too stupid and careless. Now, I began to remember it again and my anxiety is so bad. I'm probably overthinking but I can't help but think like what if someone stalks me again? or maybe what if they involve other people (who are important to me) while they try to threaten me? It's scary. I wish I was wiser at that age. I was so overwhelmed by my love of reading, writing, and interacting with so many other writers. I sound so pathetic, I know, but this thing had marked a trauma in me. I wish I took legal actions though, even if it was a troll. 

Hopefully I get some advice because I really, really want to feel better. I want to open up about this to my parents, but I get guilty because it was partly my fault because I was careless.",02Aug2020,1
473,"Hey dudes I’m 13m and I live in Florida not too far from a nude beach and I’ve always thought it would be fun to go but I’ve been too scared to ask cause most people think that’s pretty weird. It came up in a conversation my mom/stepdad were having yesterday so I mentioned that I thought it would be fun to go :) 

They mostly thought it was funny because I’m really shy and introverted so they didn’t take me seriously. But they said if I really wanted to do it, I should go nude at home for a day to see if I could handle it. So I’m supposed to try it today but they said if I go through with it I won’t be able to put anything on until tomorrow, like my bedroom door would be locked lol.

It probably wouldn’t be that bad but my mom got my sister to message a few of our friends that live in our apartment complex about coming over since there would obviously be a lot of people at a nude beach which makes sense but I’ve never really been naked in front of anyone so I’m really nervous!

Our relationship has been very difficult since last December, we decided on a three weeks break to see where we're at. During the break, I told her I want to break up as I basically realized I'm much happier single. She, however, still wants the relationship and still loves me.

She begged me for a chance and said she was going to change ( she was unemployed and not looking for work, trying to make me pay for a lot of things and generally not pulling her weight financially, a lot of resentment built up, amongst other things ). I agreed on one last chance. So she came back. That was two weeks ago. I know that was STUPID of me but I made her promise she would leave without a fuss if we came to the realisation this was deffo over, and that it would be the opportunity to say proper goodbyes and for her to get her stuff. 

Now. I want to break up still. I realized my feelings for her are completely gone and she's made no steps towards change so I told her I still wanted to go through with the break up, reminding her of what we agreed on. She's refusing to leave despite me telling her this is over. She's faked calls with her mom and said her mom said ""she can't come back"" so now she has ""nowhere to go"" and I'm ""the one abusing her"". Everyday is a NIGHTMARE. Non stop arguments, etc...

When my daughter was outside today with me the wind blew her hair back and I saw what look liked a lot of earrings in her ear. I immediately asked her to show her ear to me and two my horror she had 8 piercings going all way from the bottom of her ear two the top. The other ear was not quite so bad but still had 5. 

I was completely shocked as I only had ever taken my daughter to get her ears pierced once and when she asked for 2nd holes told her she had to wait until she was 16. Here my daughter was with 13 piercings.

I asked my daughter how she did this and it turns out she has been gradually piercing her ears over the past few months following her schooling moving online. She has been hiding them from me this whole time. I am mortified that I did not discover this much earlier and have a lot of concerns about potential issues with health if not done correctly.

479,"okay hello, these past few weeks have been Beyond tough for me. Two weeks ago my uncles wife died tragically of cancer on my mums side of my family, and 3 days ago my granddad on my dads side whom I was extremely close to and used to visit for hours every day as he lived next door to be has also passed away due to cancer. I was not very close to my uncles wife or my mams family on a whole, they live far away from me and my relationship with my mam is very strained due to past trauma and her extremely messy divorce with my dad. 

On top of this school (I'm gonna be the equivalent of a high school senior aha) starts up in a few weeks. Anyways, this month has been long and painful and I am emotionally exhausted and drained beyond belief both from having to go to two funerals, comforting and be comforted and watching my granddad become literally a shell, unable to drink or eat in the course of a month but there is something else weighing on me:

Months mind mass (a mass and celebration a month after a person has died in catholic traditions). Depending on how this works out, my uncles wife and my granddad may have the same months mind date, their months mind be one week after another or two weeks apart. Either way , I really do not want to go to my uncles wife's one, as bad as that sounds, and I do feel guilty but my mams family all live about 2.5 hours away (this is far in my country) and the tension in the car is unbelievable at times. I'm so so drained and upset over my granddad that I really want to stay in my home so I can comfort my granny and find comfort in memories surrounding my home. 

I dont want to be catapulted into a place where I have no strong bonds with anyone for several days (3-4) and sure I could just say no but that's the thing..I dont think I can and its stressing me out even more. My mam is very forceful and I'm 17. She has been threatening me for weeks lowkey and guilting me saying I didnt love my uncles wife like my granddad (I saw her like 3 times a year tops) and that I dont know real pain like my uncles children do
.

My brother who is 14 and regularly ends up in the police due to vandalising my dads things and beating my dad up (it's me and my dad vs my mam and my brother at times) never visited my granddad and doesnt seem to be upset at all, I'm most worried that if I tell my mam and explain why I dont feel ready or able to travel anywhere , she will get my brother to bully me into going,I'm really scared of him kajfajdjs and of the weeks to come. I want this all to end and I want to try and heal but I know in myself that I need to be with my dads family for a while.

towards the end of it i get a message from my boss ""you do get lots of days off, we really try to give you lots of days off"" and noted the remark i made. i responded with that wasn't the issue it was that 10 days on 4 days off doesn't suit me and is stressful even though it's like 5 on 2 off at the end of the month. then he responded with sat and sun aren't even half days, even tho sat actually is more than half. i expressed that it was very stressful after day 7. i have to deal with customers all day while working on their electronics(phones, laptops and tablets) with nowhere to hide, no separate place for lunch so unless i leave the kiosk to eat lunch I'm regularly interrupted while trying to eat in the corner.

485,"First, I created this throw-away because my previous posts on my regular reddit would give me away. Second, I wanted to get other people's perspectives on this, as I've never told anybody about this happening.

Last year, I asked out one of my work friends. We were basically work husband-wife and I had thought he had made some advances towards me; brushing my hand with his finger, being very quick to help me out with things, usually looking over at me when we weren't conversing, picking me to work with over his other friends etc. I'm not very good with reading flirting ques and asked some friends about it. They said they got very strong flirty vibes from him towards me, so I tried to ask him out. He thought it was a joke then when he asked a few days later via text if I meant it, he apologized and said he didn't see me as such, but he was ""proud"" of me for getting enough courage to ask him out, as I've shared with him before about my past abusive relationships, which has left me with low self-esteem and second-guessing if guys really like me, or not. We also discussed the fact that we work very closely together; we both had a personal rule of not dating in the office (and I was very upset with myself for even having this crush), and how we shared concern for that possible outcome. 

We still talk and are friends, even the following week after our discussion we got right back to being like work husband-wife, and even threw in low-key jokes about our exchange. However, I find myself daydreaming about us being together. Not necessarily in a sexual way (sometimes, if I'm being honest), but in a ""hey we're a cute couple hanging out"" aspect. Although I know realistically, we wouldn't have worked out because of our different personalities. It's been nearly 10 months since the encounter and I'm still having these thoughts and I just feel weird about it. I also had a similar occurrence play out with the last guy I dated about 3 years ago, even though we only dated for 3 months (but a very intense 3 months it was); where I kept daydreaming of us being a couple again and re-uniting, even though I knew we wouldn't have worked out in the long-run. 

I feel very weird for having these thoughts, and don't want to keep having them. It feels repetitious where I get rejected or leave a relationship, then these daydreams usher in. Typically I don't search for others to date; I avoid dating apps and often have to be directly told by someone that they're flirting with me/interested for me to get it, so when I develop a crush or get vibes on my own it feels like it's something ""special/important"" to me. Being in a relationship isn't a number one on my radar, also; I'm more focused on work/school at the moment. 

Perhaps I'm over-reacting, or maybe I'm just crazy, but I'm wondering what other's thoughts on this may be and if they've ever had similar experiences/ways to rid these thoughts.

tl;dr: I keep daydreaming about ex's &amp; crushes that didn't turn into anything, but we're still cool as friends. Just want to stop having these thoughts, especially after it's been long over and spoken for.",02Aug2020,1

Last night they came home early at 11 and my mum instantly fell asleep. He came out of their room over 7 time between 1am and 5.30am. Each time he did the exact same thing. 
Goes to the kitchen to get ""something""  and goes to the bathroom to sniff it super loud. One time i went through his bag and saw a small wrapper with what felt like powder and i was sure that as it. He sniffes it so loud and thinks I don't hear him. This morning my mum said that he told her the dog was keeping him awake at 5am this morning. He said he woke up at 5am... he was still up sniffing coke at 5am because I was sitting in the living room till 5.40am and I heard EVERY SINGLE TIME. 
I asked my mum something else to do with him being up at 5  i don't remember what I said exactly but she gave me a look and asked if i knew something she didn't about him but I told her i was in my room all night. 
I lied to save them from another break up and I have been sick with anxiety anxiety all night and now sick with guilt all day.

Hi, I just wanted some advice from the reddit community about how a male is supposed to treat the female in a relationship. It sounds  dumb or self explanatory but there are many factors that make it fall in the grey area to me. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2.5 years. While I have a difficult time trusting him due to previous relationships where I am have been cheated on, in addition to things he does that I feel are worrisome , I also suffer from anxiety and really could be totally wrong but also completely right . Either way, he has stuck with me for this whole time despite me accusing him a lot (for the first year of our relationship -unhealthy I know). 

I have been working on it and have not accused in months but I feel that he doesn’t  cares and just gets angry over everything.... when we have arguments about random things that shouldn’t be worth arguing about, he always yells loudly or raises his voice,  and says things like : I don’t want to see your face or I’m tired of you, and leave me alone but he can be completely fine the next day and start talking to me or even have very nice romantic moments depending on the day. the argument words are hurtful and I feel I try to understand or justify it because of me accusing him for being unfaithful for the majority of our relationship. Or things that are just said in the heat of the moment especially If he wasn’t being unfaithful in the first place. 

That’s a little back story, but generally while all relationships are different, and every couple argues, from a male perspective (or woman’s), how far is too far in an argument and what line do you not cross with your words in an argument.",02Aug2020,1
501,"To make a long story short, my relationship with my mother has always been volatile. She had untreated mental health issues (depression, PTSD, ?, etc.) for most of my childhood, and she was (whether or not she intended to be) a very emotionally abusive parent. When my parents got divorced in my pre-teens she started down a rocky path, and when I was in my senior year of high school, she got started on meth. My younger sister had moved in with my dad, but feeling responsible for my mother, I stayed for a little while longer. Eventually, we lost the house, and she was beginning to say quite deranged things, so we went separate ways. I stayed with different friends until I graduated high school, then went on to move in with my now-husband and finished college, too.  

   

   

The year I left to be with my husband and go to school, my mother tried to kill herself. I was newly 18, and even if my reaction was muted at the time, the whole situation was a very traumatic experience for me. I was her next of kin, and showed up to the hospital to help with her affairs. My entire childhood and this experience together have made me not want to speak to her at all; it's entirely too draining, and I feel bad for MY mental health.  

   

  

Once every year or so, maybe more frequently, she'd call or message me online and say how she's getting help or whatever, but I learned quickly that it never lasted. My husband himself would always go to take her here or there, put her up in a hotel, buy her food for the day, etc. I did my best to help in her in those ways, but still have not seen her in-person since she originally tried killing herself. Whenever she tries to contact me, her old ways shine through as she accuses me of hating her, saying she understands why, etc. As I said, it's incredibly stressful.  

  

   

I just received a Facebook message from a friend of hers saying that she tried to kill herself again, and that she will make a full recovery. I do not have the heart to go through this a second time with her, and as it's my only two-day weekend in awhile I am considering just staying home, and perhaps even ignoring her friend. This is a woman I haven't really known in four years, and haven't connected with her in....well over a decade. I struggle with anxiety all the time as is, and I don't know what I should do about this. What makes things more complicated, is my younger sister (now 18) is now living with me, and still completely reeling from both of my parents' fuck-ups. I'm busy with my life, and busy trying to get my sister started on hers. I don't need this distraction, and neither does she, right?





**TLDR My mom has mental health issues and has been on drugs since I was a teenager. This is the second time she has tried to kill herself, and I fear responding at all because I have problems of my own, and so does my little sister. I don't know what I should do about her anymore**",02Aug2020,1

I love them, like they are genuine people and true friends, but I can't help but feel lonely. Sometimes I feel really misunderstood and and out of place when it never used to be that way.

506,"so, I’ll provide quick context just to help a little bit;

I’m 15, almost 16, and I know my perfect weight is probably 150. I’m 5’10 and more of a heavy build? I’m not sure.

Regardless, In school, i pulled 160 pounds, and felt great, exercised, and worked perfectly. I ate like shit tbh, but i didn’t eat too much, and exercised. 

Quarantine rolls around, and after 5 months of eating like an angry ape, I’ve become 200 pounds and hate how I look. 

I got that way of gaining so much weight by eating takeout every day and not having to see myself in a mirror. I ignored what was going on and enjoyed savoring each bite too much. 

Personally it’s no biggie, my weight shifts during summer and I drop the weight in sept when school starts again, but now, we have full distance learning, and I don’t get as much exercise. 

I want to lose weight by fasting (as usual) I’ve already determined that, but I’m lacking the will to do so.

I downloaded site blocks and mashed random passwords in to stop any temptation of ordering, now it’s down to random meals and snacks I mentally convince myself are “nothing.”

I want to hear if anyone has tips of kind of how to get around constant snacking and eating of meals, and being able to fast for long periods. (Even if it’s unhealthy in your opinion.)

Lol I lowkey used to say to myself “would a fat person do this?” And if so, I would not do that thing. It worked somehow.

TLDR: I’m constantly “hungry” and I need any type of brain game, or motivation to stop me from tempting and tricking myself into eating when I don’t need to.

509,"I (27F) was raped 14 years ago when I was 13 years old by two men over the age of 18 at a party.

Apologies for it being so long. A lot happened!    
TLDR At bottom.  
I have also changed any names in this story for privacy \*\*

My cousin and I snuck out of my mother’s house when I was 13 to go to a party near my house. I had to wait until my Mum went to bed before we could sneak out which was late, so when we arrived the party was over. People were coming out of the party and some guys came out and asked if we would like to go to another party, we said yes. Whilst we didn’t know them all I knew who they were. One was a friends older step brother and we lived in a really small town of 22,000 people so everybody kind of knew everyone. They stopped in at at somebodies house on the way to the party to get alcohol. They got back in the car with 2 straight bottles of alcohol one; Jim Beam and I don’t remember the other. We continued on to the party on the way we were drinking. I would take a drink of the alcohol  and one of the boys, James from memory, would tip the bottle up and hold it up whilst I was taking a sip to make me drink heaps more. This happened repeatedly until I don’t really remember much. I will share below the few things I do remember.

I remember arriving at a house that was a little bit out of town, from memory we were there for very long and then went to somebody else’s house back in town.

The next thing I remember is falling out of the back of a car naked, it was an old Ford Falcon (XF) panel van I think 1988. I know this specifically as I have researched the vehicle from my memory. It was a station wagon with double doors that opened up like French doors. After falling out I remember being picked up by James Brown and being put back in the car. Another hazy memory I have is James taking me to the bathroom and me struggling to stand up and somebody telling James to “leave me alone”. I think it was my friends step brother again this is all incredibly hazy. Next thing I remember is waking up in my bed.

The following day I did not feel fabulous mentally, I didn’t really know what had happened the night before. When I went to the bathroom I was bleeding lightly, this is the only real indication I had that I may have had sex/been sexually assaulted.

A couple of weeks later a girl named Jessica from my high school messaged me about that night. Jessica had previously dated James, one of the men that was in the car with me that night. She messaged me to tell me that what James &amp; John had done to me, and that it was not okay and that it was rape. She informed me that they had taken numerous pictures of me while naked, and images of the lude acts they had performed on me. Some of which were them with condoms over their fingers and they were fingering my anus and vagina, they had also taken photos of me whilst having sex with me. I don’t remember any pictures being taken or anything that happened inside of the car. Sadly they also sent these pictures all around their school, which then made it to my school. Jessica told me that she had dated James a while before this happened and that he had also taken pictures of her naked while she was asleep. I didn’t really know what to do about all of this and didn’t really want to acknowledge what had happened, I continued to bury this and try to forget about it. Jess at the time of messaging me was dating a very close friend of my family who was a bit older named Kyle (28). Kyle was somebody I had come to develop quite a close friendship with and he always looked out for me. Jess told Kyle what had happened and he then told my father.

My parents were divorced and my sister and I would spend one week at my fathers and then one week at my mothers. The night my parents were told I was staying at my Mum’s house. Kyle went to my dad’s house and told him I had been raped by two men, and shortly after they arrived at my mums house and told my mum. I was still majorly unaware of what had actually happened to me and at the time my coping mechanism was to pretend it didn’t happen. After my dad told my mum what had happened she was a wreck. She stayed up all night and called every single “Brown” in the phonebook and asked whoever answered if they had a son named James. Fortunately she didn’t find the James brown that had assaulted me, I’m not sure what she would of done had she found him. The following day was filled  with police interviews.

Unfortunately after this happened my family had a pretty big falling out and my grandmother was saying I probably wanted it and that I deserved it. My aunty (the mother of my cousin who was with me that evening) said the same thing and my mum then beat her to a pulp. After this I did not speak to anyone in my family on my mothers side again, still to this day and have basically disowned them. My cousin and I never spoke again after this except for when we saw each other at the court house.

In the end the police said due to me not remembering enough about the incident there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute Jack, but there was enough evidence on James. As expected his defence pushed back against the charges and it meant I would have had to sit in court and recite what they had done to me, and the same with my cousin. I was terrified of this and didn’t want to do that, the idea of telling the court in front of my dad, my mum in front of the people that did this to me was too much. Especially considering it was very hard to remember. So the police recommended just going for an AVO. James’ defence pushed that he had aspirations to be a police officer and a criminal record from the AVO would disable him from being able to hold a fire arm in the future thus meaning he would fight the this charge in court unless we went for something that did not carry any criminal record. And that was that.

Unfortunately it didn’t end there for me, everyone in the town was calling me a slut, saying I wanted it and only went to court because my parents made me, that it wasn’t rape etc. This was pretty soul crushing for me, half my family saying this to me and circulating of me from that night. By this stage I was just starting year 9 and I stopped going to school. I would go sometimes, maybe once a week and usually would leave after half a day. I was bullied very badly after this and being called a slut continued. I also began to act out, sneaking out more often getting extremely drunk, I felt as though I was becoming the person they said I was. My principal and vice principal were both aware of what had happened to me and knew this was why I wasn’t attending school and I was given a pass that meant I could leave school if I felt the need, this was to encourage me to start going again. I continued down this path of rarely attending school for another two years and in year 11 after not being able to handle it anymore decided to drop out and move cities to live with my mum 4 hours away (she had moved perhaps a year after I had been raped and I lived full time with my dad). On the way to my new home my mum begged me to just try schooling in the new city and thankfully I did! At the end of my first semester there I was heading back to my home town to spend my school holidays with my dad. On the way there my mum told me that my Dad had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that they had kept it from me for the past 6 months because they didn’t want it to influence my decision to move towns. My mum thought at this point I deserved to know so I could make an informed decision as to if where I wanted to live. I decided to move home and see out the remainder of my schooling back home, thankfully by this stage I was in year 12 and all of the people that had bullied me had graduated and my final year was much better than previous years. This being said I still didn’t go to school and my attendance was below 20% I was lucky to graduate.

I always planned my escape from this horrible town and thank god I moves 3 days after I graduated school and I’ve never looked back!!

I have great anxiety anytime I am around anybody from my home town, or anyone that knew me when I was a kid as I feel like they have a warped perception of who I am or have based their opinion on the person they think I was.

Fast forward to now.. 27 years old. I am nothing like the person I was then, I am strong young woman! I have however still largely buried what happened to me for 14 years, and had never actually spoken to my cousin about it.

Late last year I was in a situation that I was in an incredibly triggering situation that almost resulted in me being raped again. I am so thankful I managed to get out of that situation and since have not been the same. Unfortunately this really affected me and I couldn’t go to work and couldn’t stop playing the incident over in my head. It has also made what happened to me when I was young come rushing to the surface and now there is rarely a day that goes by that I don’t think about it. Especially now being in a lockdown in Australia I have little else I can think about.

I decided that I wanted to look into re-opening the case and taking both men back to court as I don’t think its fair they got away with this and are off living happy lives! Both men are now married. James the one I remember most now has 2 young female children.

I reached out to my cousin today after 13 years of not speaking, and never ever discussing the events of that evening. What she told me shocked me. She told me that she remembered everything and told the police everything she knew. She asked me why was I bringing this up after all of these years if both men had been prosecuted. And sadly she was unaware that neither had been, and even worse she had no idea the police said there wasn’t enough information on the second man to prosecute. She told me she told them there was two men in the car and she knew who they both were but weren’t certain of their names. She could of identified them in a line up or by picture if she was showed!!

Her filling me in on the evening was quite distressing. She told me that we were at the second house in town, incredibly intoxicated and she went to the bathroom and when she came out I was gone. She went searching for me and said she knew I was in the car out the front of the party with two guys. She said she was banging on the doors for a long time screaming and crying trying to get me out of there. She said eventually the doors open and I feel out of the car naked, with my underwear down around my ankles, she could see James and John men inside with condoms on their fingers and I said “I’ll be done in a minute” and then one picked me up and put me back in the car. She sat in the gutter near the car crying hysterically for the remainder of the time I was in the car. She said when I finally came out of the car she then physically carried me home over 15km back to my mums house.

I am really scared about taking them back to court as I am really scared they will rule in their favour and say that I wanted it and I was consenting because I said to my cousin “I’ll be done in a minute”. I don’t understand why I would ever have said that, I was 13 and never ever in a my right mind would of wanted anyone to do those things to me. I was a virgin at the time and whilst I didn’t put a lot of gravity on losing my virginity this was absolutely not something I wanted to do. I am really scared that maybe at the time I was consenting, and maybe it’s all true. Maybe I was all the things everybody said about me, maybe I did want it and deserve it. But if that’s the case why am I so affected by it now.

I am so scared about dredging all of this back up. Everyone in that horrible small town will know this is happening, they are still to this day quite popular. They are acquaintances with some of my friends. I think they deserve to be charged and for everyone to know that what they did was wrong, but I’m scared that it wasn’t wrong.  I’m sure if their daughters were 13 and this happened to them they would not say it was consenting!!  


**I guess I would really like to know what you think I should do?**   


*TLDR; When I was 13 I was raped by 2 men both 18 or 19, neither were charged. I am thinking about taking them back to court 14 years later. I don’t remember much of the incident as I was pressured into drinking a lot of alcohol and it is all a blur. My cousin was with me and remembers everything. I fell out of the car naked with my underwear around my ankles and said “I’ll be done in a minute”. One of the men picked me back up, put me in the car. Afterwards my cousin carried me home over 15 kms home. I am scared it is classified as consensual and not sure if I will have a defence.*",02Aug2020,1
510,"I will try to keep this short. 

I moved back to the UK late last year, I got a job in February, then lockdown started and I lost my job before it began. I was hired back again on a temporary basis and I have been working from home ever since, on a short contract. Initially, I was really excited about this job, I would be moving to a new city, working at a cool place. But the past few months I have sort of lost that excitement. I work with some great people, I can't complain about that, but it's not the job I expected. There is this ""work all day, every day"" attitude at the company with too much work and short deadlines. One of the things I was excited about at this job was having some free time and well, I have no free time. I am struggling to imagine a long term future here, especially if I have to move there when they reopen the office. 

So onto my dilemma. I've been told by a few friends/people that they need people like me at their company, but it's in Denmark. To be honest, I love the sound of Denmark and I could probably be happy there, plus I already have great friends there. My problem right now is Brexit, I would need to move there before the end of the year and also my family. My parents are in a bit of an uncomfortable situation where one of them is not happy in the UK and wants to move. I don't know if my parents would split up, but I am very close to them and it would hurt me so much if they did. The thing is, my mum can't really live alone. If I am in another country, I don't think it would work out. She has a bit of a disability making it very difficult to walk for any length of time. I worry that if she ended up alone, I would have no choice but to go back to support her. She says my dad won't move away on his own, which I do somewhat believe, but I also worry that he could if he really wanted to. 

So here I am, not sure whether I should commit to this job that I don't really love, or if I should risk it all in a new country. On one hand, I am excited about the chance to move to Denmark, but also very anxious about being in a country all by myself. As I said, I am close to my family, I have lived with them for most of my life other than a couple of months on my own. My main concern right now is my parents and whether they will stick together through this rough patch.",02Aug2020,1

So the housing in my state is at an all time low. When our lease went up a year and a half ago we had to move because our landlord was selling. Given that we had no other option we were forced to move into a small-ish city where the crime rates and homeless rates are through the roof. We have 3 homeless shelters just within a 4 block radius and that is not including the other 7 we have throughout the 7. Every single one of them are filled and we still have at least 30 homeless folk I have seen almost daily. 

Since we have been here we have made multiple calls to the local police department for homeless people shooting heroin in our back yard as well as people coming in and shitting or pissing back there as well. The police never do anything. Even if they show up and catch these folk in the act, they simply tell them to move along. It doesnt stop these individuals from using our backyard. We have also contacted the landlord and he has yet to do anything either. 

I dont use my backyard however, I have 3 kids who can simply look out their window and see these individuals and our second floor neighbor also has a 3 year old son who has caught them in the act as well. I have even caught maintenance from my next door neighbors coming over and pissing in my back yard. 

Is there anything I can legally do about this where the police officers here have been no help whatsoever? Because I swear to god if my kids look out the window and happen to see a grown man's dick or ass, I will probably lose it and end up in jail myself.",02Aug2020,1

Throughout the past 3 years, I've always had frequent scoldings from my mother about my laziness and lacking effort. These have even escalated to beatings and device smashings, though i admit that i deserved all of it. I remember always promising myself after those scoldings to change my attitude and start studying hard to get amazing scores and earn the respect of my family, but after a day or two of motivation i always resorted back to being lazy again. The whole cycle has been repeating for years. I think about it over and over and feel bad but i always turn away.

My grades are not terrible, I'm an A/B student with this attitude, but it just makes me feel even worse. My mother always said i was a very intelligent student and a very fast learner, she even signed me up for 3 instrument classes because she said i was talented. She always reminded me of how i could be truly exceptional if i just put in the effort to work hard, but I've never managed to do so.

I started working out frequently about a year ago, but I've never gotten around to changing my attitudes on studies.

My siblings and parents are all amazing people who have great career paths and discipline, which is why it makes me feel even more guilty and suicidal at times. What made it worse is that i even lied to these people to cover up my own laziness. I feel like a waste of space and money around them now, especially because my mother broke down multiple times in tears in front of me, speaking of how i dont appreciate her effort. 

I swear it pains me but i just cant seem to change myself. It has been years since the first time. I always painfilly wonder of where i would be right now if i just sucked it up and changed back then, but always buried it in excuses.

518,"I (f30) met a guy (m33) in NA a few years ago. We had mutual friends and became closer for awhile until he went back out for the better part of a year. He came back to NA to get clean and ended up working at my job after only being clean again a few months. We were at work the other day (this job requires us to work quite closely with one another and we often have downtime to talk privately) when he told me he wasn’t sleeping and was having a really hard time. He then told me how on his last run he was gang raped and never told anyone about it and is being tormented by his abusers. I told him to stop watching what they recorded and sent to him and to stop reading the comments. I told him I was here for him and that he should get professional help. I told him I would never judge him for what happened and that I wish I could do or say something to help and that if he needs the day off, I had it covered at work. Of course he wanted to stay, which made the day extra difficult, feeling like I should be a better friend, but we were at work so obviously my focus was on the job.

The problem is, I’m not a huge fan of this person anymore. I know he’s having a rough time but he can be very manipulative (like any addict not working a program) and melodramatic. He will also say things in a way that cuts and i’m not even sure if that’s his intention or not, but he does it. He sends me paragraphs and paragraphs of texts at a time, condescendingly telling me how concerned he is about my attitude towards something going on at work while lacing it with compliments and how I should accept the changes made and live in gods will (I was upset about something but got over it very quickly and it was pretty much a moot point at that stage.) It’s annoying and I don’t appreciate it. I’m not a big texter at all and when I answer with “thanks for the input, I’m good over here” he follows up with a bunch of sorries and for making everything about him. no way am I saying what he told me didn’t happen, but he is just stuck in self pity and only relying on me to be there for him. I’m not good at coddling or engaging with people who ask for help but refuse to take any advice or get help. I refuse to cater to people’s needs when they play the martyr. As I’m telling him to stop reading the comments and watching the recording, he pulls up the comments and reads them to me! I told him again to please stop you’re re traumatizing yourself and you don’t need to. Delete the link. And he just says “I can’t stop.” And sits there and won’t let me take the phone away. So, I went back to work to check on the teens Im being paid to take care of. 

To top it off, I’m pretty sure he’s using again, since another coworker called me yesterday telling me they were 90% sure he was high. On the job with kids. Yes the supervisor was informed and he went home. He’s not showing up to all his shifts recently and I’m very concerned but don’t know what to do. He is extremely depressed and I’m scared he is going to die, and am afraid I am being too cold to him. I just don’t know what else to do because he won’t help himself. I should mention he has a masters in psych, so he knows where to go to get help if he wants it.",02Aug2020,1
519,"Hi reddit, I (20m) have been living away from my mom for about 2 years now, I currently live with a family friend while I'm getting through college. Whenever I make plans and go out I'll give the family friend a quick heads up, something like ""hey grabbing dinner with the guys tonight don't wait up"" just to keep them in the loop since I live with them. The family friend and my mother are extremely close, like call each other multiple times a day close and tell each other every single thing going on in their lives. So the family friend will tell my mother I'm going out (unwarranted mind you I don't come up in conversation that much unless it's about my business). Within 15 minutes I get a phone call of my mother acting coy: ""got any plans tonight?"" To which I'll respond ""yeah heading out with the guys probably"" and then I'll get a ""why didn't you tell me?"" Which I respond to with ""well I told family friend"" which pisses her off to no end, then she aggressively tells me to tell her next time when I go out and this happens every single time I try to hang with friends and she isn't the first to hear about it. Any thoughts appreciated, maybe I'm overreacting, thanks in advance",02Aug2020,1

I am supposed to enroll in this new school tomorrow. Should I ask my mom for a plane ticket back to my dad's or should I enroll in this school and just see how I like it?

525,"Cross posted to other subs because I am looking for as much advice as I can get!

First time homeowners and we are a bit overwhelmed. Buckle in folks. 

We moved in 7/1 and submitted a request for a fence to be built to the HOA (I know what you are thinking, this is not an evil HOA story). The neighbors on the left and right of us already had fences, so we only need a back fence and twice small side pieces. Two weeks go by and the HOA approve our request, and in the meantime we meet both neighbors on each side of us, chit chat and tell that we are waiting on the HOA to approve the fence and that we are excited to have it installed for our dogs.

Cue to last Friday, 7/24, and our fence is installed. Monday 7/27 we get a call from the HOA that the neighbor on the left complained that we “connected” to her fence. I told the rep that we did not, that our installers installed independent posts and sent him pictures. He said that this was a neighbor dispute, they don’t get involved in neighbor disputes, and he asked the wife to call me. I sent him the pictures , waited 20 minutes but no call. So I call the HOA back and ask if the pictures are sufficient. He said yes, but now she is saying that we are on her property, but again they don’t get involved in neighbor disputes and he asked her to call me but she won’t. 

So I then proceed to go over to the neighbors house to ask her what is wrong with the fence. Apparently when they built their fence, they built it 6 inches inward on their property and not on the property line. When my fence guys installed my fence, they butted the posts next to their fence so their wouldn’t be a gap (yes, I understand we are legally in the wrong here). So I ask, what do you want us to do? We realistically don’t want move the posts back 6 inches bc we have dogs and other small animals will be able to get through. She said we can either double up the fence, or “pay her for using her fence PLUS split the cost of anything happens to it, such as a storm”. I told her I would have to talk to my fiancé before we did anything.

That night, my fiancé spoke with her husband, and he agreed that the situation was a bit ridiculous and that if anything were to happen to the fence in a storm we would just worry about it then. End of story? Nope, too easy.

Last night my fiancé and I were outside mounting a camera and the wife comes over when her husband wasn’t home. She asks what we decided to do about the fence. I said that the husbands spoke and he said not to worry about it. She said that was not correct, that she makes the decisions and NOT her husband, and she was still looking for one of the two options. She even got her husband on speaker phone, who said the same thing as Monday, and tried saying he wasn’t saying that!!!! She asked me what we paid per for for the fence ($24/foot) and the length is 60ish feet, so she said we could give her $700 now plus if anything happened. I said no, if we had to double up the fence, I would push back the fence to where my house ends- so 60 feet to about 25- and leave a 6 inch gap between the 2 fences that she would be responsible for maintaining since that is technically her property. Not to mention it’s going to looks stupid as hell. She said well if that’s the case, instead of pushing the fence back we could just give her the approx $500!!! I told her we would talk about it, get a quote from the fence compony, call the survey guy back to re-flag the property and see if the HOA will even let us put up a fence. 


As you can imagine, my fiancé is extremely frustrated with the situation as am I. Legally, I know the only thing we have to do is move the posts 6 inches back. However, if we do, the dogs can get out, small animals in etc. I plan on getting a quote for the fence company, showing her on the survey that we are serious about moving the fence back and leaving a 6 inch gap and making it clear that it’s going to her responsibility to maintain. Hopefully she will change her mind. We thought about paying her and getting something in writing, but other people have said that if we give her money now, she is just going to keep coming back for more. 

I wanted to get other people opinions on the situation. Are their any other options that we aren’t seeing? Has anyone else has issues with their neighbors about a fence like this? Our neighbors on the right have had 0 issues with us or the fence",02Aug2020,1

528,"(im sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes,English isnt my native language)okay so im not sure what to do.I have been going to a therapist every once a week for a month now,and it kinda has helped me but it kinda feels fake going to my therapist,ina meaning like,she only wants the money,not really to help me.Heres a little context on the situation.I have been suffering from anixety for the last maybe 3 years and its only gotten worse,and theres a suspisicon i possibly have adhd which would explain a lot that has troubled me for the last maybe 5 years,i also have horrible trust issues and constant problems with myself(in a meaning that i a lot of times feel ugly,annoying,thinking that my firneds dont actually wanna be friends with me etc. i know it sounds childish but its the truth).About a month ago after consulting with my older sisters(they dont live with me btw,they live in another country)because they are the only people i completely trust with everything,and with a bit of their encouargement,i managed to tell my mom about it,only about how i felt about my anixety and how it was getting worse(i didnt tell her about the other stuff that was bothering me cause our relationship is quite complicated)at first she just brushed it off as puberty and stuff,but after my sisters also confronting her,we finally decided to get a therapist,my mom choose the first one she stumbled upon because we live in a small town so things like psychologists arent a common thing,we at the time thought she was the only one,so i started having sessions with her,i must say,it did make me feel more comfy and honestly i felt more relaxed and productive after her sessions.The thing is though,since im quite young(i wont say my age because i would like to keep my identity and personal information private)the first session my mom had to come with me(my dad works as a captian on a chemical tanker/ship so i sadly see him only once a year)and of course she did,the psychologist made me draw some things that i felt drawing,nothing specific while she talked with my mother about my childhood and my family and stuff.Everything went fine,though for some reason my mother had to pay for us both each,as if my mom was also on a therapy session. At first we thought it was normal,though later we found out that the first therapy session,or rather should i say introduction,is not supposed to be charged(we found this out from some other therapist in town that my mothers friend told my mom about).The other therapist seems actually really nice and sweet,keeps up with the internet,is young,kinda like a cool mom if i have to put it in 2 words.Though she thinks kids/teens should go to a therapist while in school,idk why.I understand that psychologists are supposed to be payed for what they do of course but,isnt a therapist someone you should open to,someone you trust and someone whose supposed to help you?Well imagine if someone like that just wants to help you because of the money.I know i seem childish and probably greedy and selfish,but i already have trust issues,having someone who asks for the exact amount of money,in the exact time,and charges you for literal intruduction doesnt really help :/ What should i do?Should i go try a session or two with the other more seemingly friendlier therapist or should i stick with my current one. Im really confused about what i should do. It would be amazing if someone could help me somehow",02Aug2020,1
529,"TL;DR - high risk, need better masks, it's confusing, can someone link me a specific mask you've used that is as safe and trusted as possible(and will fit a larger face)?

------

My roommate and I are both very high risk and need better masks than the few cheap paper ones I got a while back.

N95s don't seem to be available at all. KN95s that I can find... reviews are all over the place on whether they're even rated right or what they say they are. 

I guess I could try and get some big crazy respirator, but not only is that more confusing what I need, but  money's tight(though if someone knows something reasonable and from a trusted source/brand, I'm open to it). 

I think maybe the best option would be a nice cloth mask with a filter pocket? But they're all just made by random people or brands I don't know, reviews are mixed. I'm a large guy with, apparently a large face(some cheap one I got at the gas station next door doesn't even begin to fit despite fitting the clerks fine?), so that's an issue too. 

Can someone maybe link a specific mask available now(preferably on amazon so I can get it quickly) that you've used, and you know is a good trusted(and large enough) mask?",02Aug2020,1

531,"So In a nutshell, I am far too old to be living at home. Early 30's. I have lived on my own for several years, here and there. But ended up back here a couple of years back. I got a big promotion in the winter of last year, pre-covid. I was hyped to move out again and was looking, but was hesitant to live in high density areas. I now make 100k, so this is not a financial thing. I have lived with roommates most of my life, so I would be starting from scratch as far as furnishings. Which would be a big financial undertaking. Not a problem, but was also on the cusp of either saving for a house or just moving out, saving for a home would be hindered by this. However, I am single and would prefer to do this with someone I would see myself settling down with. 

I always felt like a slow developer a bit behind in the curve in some ways emotionally. But I am definitely ready to move out and or make a change. Not sure my hang up. Covid? The stress of really starting from scratch? More financial strain? I have literally made a list of this and talked to friends. Some still do live at home and like it, some live on their own and it like, some live on their own and say they would definitely live at home if they could. 

Living at home has made me lose some self respect, the social life is hurt by this, as well as dating life. I LOVE being social and out partying with friends, being out and about and doing this would be great. I have restricted myself living with an older parent, would be careful if on my own but a little less strict, which may help in the winter. 

Be it harsh, nice, stern, etc. I would love any advice on this. I am not sure my hang up.",02Aug2020,1

535,"This guy and I had been talking on and off ever since quarantine started. We met each other before the lockdown started since we go to the same university, and I had liked him for awhile. We never talked about feelings explicitly in our online conversations. But there were hints, and from the way we interacted, I thought he was at least a little bit interested in me. He would frequently initiate conversations, send/tag me in memes, send selfies, and just subtly flirt altogether. However, his interest in me always seemed inconsistent. There would be days where would be more reserved. He would lessen his interactions with me, but he would never completely stop. He’d still message me randomly every now and then (e.g. he would chat me at 1 am to ask what food he should eat). Eventually, we would go back to our usual conversations. It’s a cycle. Recently, he started to distance himself more than he usually does. I got tired trying to figure what everything meant so I confronted him.

I told him I liked him, and I asked if he felt the same. His response was literally, “I don’t know.” He explained that he can’t figure out if he likes me the same way since we have very few interactions in person. He doesn’t know me well enough to know if I’m his type or not. I then asked him if I should stop. He said that if I wanted a relationship *now*, then I should stop since he wouldn’t be able me that and he’s not into pursuing online relationships. He said he knew I liked him, but he didn’t think that much about it at first since he thought the lockdown would end sooner and we’d be able to navigate our feelings in person. He’s very firm that he doesn’t guarantee anything when we meet, but he’s still open to being friends.

His answer cleared my mind but at the same time it didn’t. His answer explains why he was more openly pursuing me at the start, like he was testing the waters, and then when he realized this pandemic wasn’t gonna end soon, he just kinda stopped. I respect him not wanting to pursue anything online and I understand where he is coming from. In fact, I didn’t want to start a relationship either. I’m fine with giving him space, I just wanted confirmation that we could be something more in the future. But his answer leaves me with more uncertainty that if he just said no outright. If he knew I liked him and that he wasn’t interested in confirming/starting anything now, then why did he keep me hanging onto him for as long as he did? Why keep it up?

I came here to ask for advice because I don’t know what to do. Should I stop talking to him entirely for now? Should I cut ties completely? Or should I remain friends with him? I just want to save myself from unsalvageable heartbreak in the future.",02Aug2020,1
536,"In the 9th grade I gained a lot of weight in a short amount of time (puberty?) and while most didn’t care, it brought on some bullying at school. I recall one day I turned around to a girl who had been picking on me for it taking a photo of me. When I caught her, she slowly lowered her phone and we made eye contact for about a second or so before I turned back around too embarrassed to do anything about it. Unless she felt bad in that moment, I always assumed she took it and recently I hit her up in the DMs just to see what it was about (this was 3 years ago) and upon confronting her, she denied ever knowing me.

This girl and I have been in the same school since our first year of middle school until she left after our sophomore year and every year in high school we at least had a few classes together and besides, she gave me enough shit I’d doubt she’d forget. She tried pulling this, ‘your name does ring a bell’ thing and kept mentioning, ‘completely honest here’ and would respond almost immediately to every message I sent her before I just told her that I was heartbroken and told her that if she was ever willing to be honest with me, to do so.

538,"I'm 17F. I've had a relationship with my psychologist for 2-3yrs total, but I took some breaks in between. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I've started up therapy again and have been in therapy again for a month or two now. I have therapy every week and experienced a lot of life changes/events that really contributed to my mental health and made things so difficult to manage. The lockdowns/self quarantines also are not helping my mental health (even though I know it's necessary, I'm not complaining about the necessity). My therapist and I have been trying to come up with ways to make my depression more manageable, but this is probably one of the lowest points of my life. I have tried 2 different types of antidepressants when I was 14/15, but they did not work with me, so I quit out of frustration. I never brought up the idea of medicine with her, but she thought I should try it at the time. 

I'm at a point where I just want to stop hurting day to day. Every single day, I get some awful mood change. I could be fine for a few hours, then the next I am sobbing about how much I hate being myself and beat myself up for little things. Sometimes I just get mood changes for no reason. I wake up and feel dread. Most of my day is spent sleeping or laying. I barely eat now and when I do, it's in the middle of the night. There is no structure to my life. Nothing is consistent. I have such a hard time staying grounded and trying to improve my mood. On some days, I feel like I'm making progress, but other days, I'm just so close to being pushed over the edge. It's to the point my therapist is recommending to meet twice a week when I used to meet her once every 2 weeks. My parents have even noticed a change in me and it hurts me that I'm hurting them. It's just bleeding onto my relationships with my family, friends, and my boyfriend (who is now my ex because he couldn't handle this shit anymore). I don't feel like I can control anything and I'm tired of being yelled at everyday for being lazy when I don't even have the energy. I don't even want to live or be here. 

Am I allowed to ask my therapist if antidepressants/other drugs would help me progress? If so, how should I ask her? I don’t really know how to ask this or if she thinks I need them now/if I'm a candidate for drugs still.

When we were getting to know each other I found out where she lives, (just the state, nothing more) about her family, she's apparently very close with her cousin who is a dude but the more we talked the less some stuff were making sense;

e.g. her age and her school year or she lies about when the pictures were taken, this ones specific because for a picture that was taken like a month ago, she says she took it yesterday or just as we were talking. 

 I was starting to suspect it's the cousin that tried to catfish me because she said that they used to share everything even the account we met on but ""he gave it to her and moved on"".

In the meantime while we were talking, I decided to look ""her"" up because something was off and I found the girl whose pictures I was getting, I also found out that she's in a happy relationship although I was told she's single. 

I also found the girl's sister, mother, boyfriend and the prime suspect cousin. I didn't look up their profiles, just saw their names in her friend list and she introduced the boyfriend to me as only her gay best friend.

(Sounds stalker ish I know but think about it as research) 

The question is, should I pursue any further? 

Personally, I was going to message her on the social media with a ""Look who showed up on my recommended, its xvin"" she/he knows what I look like so she/ he will recognise me. If I was actually catfished then the worst that would happen is the girl will call me out as creep and block me. If it really is her then we'll have something to laugh about. 

Or I was also thinking about messaging her sister and go from there and just keep it between us. She assured me that her siblings and the ""friend"" know about me so there isnt really anything to worry about, I can just explain as I did here. 

I went through the whole trouble of doing that because I was a victim of identity theft myself and I rather don't want that to happen to her especially if it's only her cousin and not a complete stranger so it's somewhat more manageable. Identity theft is not a joke, millions of families suffer every year.",02Aug2020,1
547,"I am a 16 year old girl in year 10. I have absolutely no clue where to go or what to do in the future. Although recently, I have found that I have a big interest in dreams/lucid dreaming and just that kind of brain activity in general. Does everyone go through a phase when they are interested in this? Or have I finally found something that I am/will be passionate about once I learn more about it? Are there any careers or jobs that study this type of thing?

Also, another random question, how much do the classes I choose for year 11 and 12 matter for when I start university? Like are they extremely important for my career choice? What if I don’t know what I want to do, what classes should I pick then? My teacher said that if we don’t know, we should just play it to our strengths and choose what we are good at.

549,"Okay I know the title makes me sound like a jerk, but here's the deal.

I've inherited my grandparents' house out in the country. It's in dire need of renovations, and I'm still in college for another year so I won't be moving in until at least late next year.

My friend ""Sarah"" is currently roommates with another mutual friend of ours, who is planning on moving next year. Sarah has a part time job and can't afford to pay for the apartment by herself, so she is going to be forced to move in with family in another city. Sarah also doesn't have a license or a car, so she relies totally on other people to drive her to work and such.

Me and Sarah are pretty close, and so when I found out I might be able to own my own home, I excitedly brought up the idea to her about moving in, and she said she would love that.

Unfortunately I really regret bringing it up now, because after having thought more in-depth about it, I've started thinking about compatibility issues that might throw a wrench in our friendship.

For one: the house is out in the country, and Sarah doesn't have a car and doesn't know how to drive. I brought this up to her before, honestly telling her that I will not chauffeur her around when we're that far out from town. Especially when I'll have my own job to get to. She has promised me that she's working on it, but--and I feel bad saying it--I kind of doubt it'll happen. Since I'll be out of town at college most of the year, no one will be around to teach her how to drive, and I don't really know how she'll be able to afford a car when she only has a part time job and is already skating by as it is.

Another thing is that she is a little less...vigilant about cleanliness than I am. Her bathroom is a mess, and the sink and shower are always in need of cleaning. Some of her ""clean"" dishes are sticky or have stuff stuck to them. I have also washed my hands at the kitchen sink, asked for a towel, and she literally picked one up off the floor and tried to hand it to me.

She has a dog, who is adorable and a sweetheart, but the dog is not totally potty trained and will pee on the carpet sometimes. I don't know how she feels about keeping the dog outside most of the time, but I don't want my newly renovated house smelling like dog piss.

One of the more major problems is that she vapes and also smokes weed on occasion. I don't have a problem with her doing that in itself, it's her life. But I *do not* want her doing that in my house. Their apartment always smells like vape and I don't want my house smelling like that, or like weed. Especially when I don't vape or smoke--the secondhand gives me a headache sometimes when I visit then. 

I have brought this to her and she said ""I can go in the bathroom and open a window!"" But I tried explaining that I don't want her doing it in the house *at all.* Even if she promises to always go outside, I do unfortunately worry that sometimes she just won't, if she's not feeling like it or if the weather is bad, or just too hot or too cold.

I love Sarah, I really do, she's one of my best friends and it would suck if she has to move to another city. But after the excitement wore off and I started really thinking about everything, I just don't want her moving in with me. And I feel so awful for having brought it up in the first place! Of course we still have at least a year before anything happens, and who knows what will happen within that time, but if she still wants to move in with me by then I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't want to hurt her, but I don't want her moving in and then we just end up fighting about stuff. I also don't know how to bring up all these issues without hurting her feelings.",02Aug2020,1
550,"Okay, hear me out.

I'm (26F) a full time nanny for two six year old twins. I'm also a full time student. I'm also trying to study for the LSATs in November. My physical health is also a bit spotty at the moment. 

As a nanny for these children, the parents have requested that I give them summer school to maintain and advance their skills. I was the one homeschooling them when schools closed in my area. When summer started, I had been doing about an hour each of instruction with the kids but one of the dads didn't think it was enough and now I do about one hour separately and two hours combined, meaning about four hours total for me during the day. I'm not an educator. I am doing my best to build a curriculum for these kids but I'm exhausted and stressed. I usually spend 50 hours a week at their house, Monday through Friday. I've already cut down for 40 hours. I'm also concerned that they're reopening schools. I will not be able to home school them again when they close schools back down. I just won't be able to juggle everything. 

My grades are starting to suffer because of this. My classes change every seven weeks and one class I'm in now has over two hours of homework every night. I can't keep up with it. I'm also struggling to find time to even take a practice LSAT to get a baseline. The one in November is the only one I can take to get my scores in before application deadlines. I've also been having some problems health-wise that I'm trying to take care of.

Now, my boyfriend is securely employed and makes enough money to for us to float through my last semester. I have an internship coming up where I can just apply for a new job and keep it after the class is over.

The one huge thing that is keeping me from quitting is the parents. They are both doctors and have been working their absolute asses off in this pandemic. I don't want to fuck them over during a really crucial time. Also, how are they gonna hire a nanny during a pandemic? Their entire family thinks I'm a godsend (no really, they used that word) and the kids absolutely love me. I want to do what's best for everyone here. If I were to leave, I'd let them find someone knew (but only until X date) but I don't know if that would be possible right now.

Should I quit my job?",02Aug2020,1

I’m autistic, and I also suffer from OCD. I thought it’d be best to get that out of the way first.
Please understand that I’m not making this post to be rude or invasive, I genuinely want answers, and I’d like to understand other people a bit better, and this is one thing that’s always confused me.

Why would anyone have sex, if they don’t want to make a baby?
Why does pain turn some people ‘on?’
And what’s the deal with pornographic content? Why would watching other people engage in sexual activities, make some people feel good?

I’ve asked some friends about this, but they don’t feel comfortable answering my questions- I don’t hold it against them, I’m a very blunt person. The only thing I’ve been able to gather? Is that the sensation of being ‘turned on’ is similar to that of needing to urinate.
Again, something I can’t understand. To me, that is a horrible feeling.

And, again, why would you want any part of your body to touch the parts where somebody has urinated?

555,"My sister has recently turned 13 and her actions both towards our family and for herself are worrying. Perhaps the main crux of the problem is this boy she is obsessed with (also 13). She has been talking to him for over a year and it was clear pretty early on that he wasn’t good for her, she would stay up until 3am talking to him and lie about where she was to go meet him and be sexual. My mum became weary of this nd decided she didn’t want her seeing him. Long story short she proceeded to make our lives a living hell and completely ignore my mum telling her to not see him. We periodically have 3 day arguments with her when it is discovered she is still talking to him which usually start with her phone being taken away, these altercations have involved (among other things) my sister giving my mum a black eye and various other injuries, my sister pushing my dad down the stairs, my sister breaking windows and china items on purpose, my sister running away from the house for hours on end and my sister attempting to overdose on painkillers. The police became involved at one point but decided to conduct a thorough social services investigation into the family aswell which was a major strain on everyone and apparently the police warning this kid to not talk to my sister was not enough for him to back off. She constantly gas lights my mum, telling her it’s all her fault and she’s ‘taken everything away’ when she is part of a wealthy family and gets almost everything she wants. She has had multiple psych evaluations in which she lies and manipulates the interviewers painting herself as an innocent victim. I have mentioned sectioning, medication and separation multiple times to my parents but they are unwilling to consider it, my sister has visited multiple therapists but lies to them or refuses to talk, she’s also created a web of lies about our family and friends including that one of my friends (who’s never met her) sexually abused her which she’s told this boy she’s talking to and would plan to use as ‘evidence’ if we tried to section and or report her. She has also been involved in drinking and drug use which at 13 I think is a little extreme. We are trapped with her and have nothing to use or say. She hurts everyone in the family physically and mentally and has told our younger brothers that she tried to kill herself because she hates the family. What do I do",02Aug2020,1
556,"Hi, just want to put that there might be a slight trigger warning with assault

My parents are going through a separation, jumping in and out of divorce as well. My mom has a boyfriend who is not a very nice guy. He does steroids and had mental health issues. 

He’s incredibly controlling. When I was visiting my mom, we had planned on picking up my sister from work and she had told the guy she’s done with the relationship. He called her and told her to pick him up, she asked if she could pick my sister up and he said no. She picked her up and dropped her off with my dad then went to pick him up. He used his kids as a manipulation tool to get her to pick him up. The next morning, she was making breakfast and he called her (didn’t even come out of the bedroom) and told her I had to leave. She was visibly upset. 

She got a new car and she doesn’t get to drive it. He drives it and makes her sit in the passenger seat. He’s made her send nasty texts to my dad. 

I left to visit my boyfriend, since this separation has been very messy and being the oldest I was given a lot of responsibility. I had to get away for the sake of my mental health. I invited my mom over for lunch. He fought with her because she wanted to pick me up. She told him they needed a break and he sent a “lol okay”. 

She’s tried to leave several times but this guy forces his way back into her life. 

My dad thinks she’s choosing to stay because she’s an adult. I’ve tried to explain that this guy is very manipulative and uses her soft spots. I’ve also said that when someone is in an abusive relationship, it’s incredibly difficult for them to come to terms with the abuse and leave. I told him that this guy is trying to break off her support system and isolate her, which he’s been doing successfully. I’ve been the only one to maintain contact. He said he no longer wants anything to do with her, that she’s been stupid. I don’t care if he doesn’t want to be with her, I just want him to understand that being in a abusive  relationship is more than just choosing to stay, that sometimes victims aren’t given a choice or are manipulated. 

My dad thinks this is a game to her and victim blames. Last night he called with information that just scares me. My aunt (her sister) saw bruises on her and found out the guy spent several years in prison for r*pe and stalking. 

He’s banned me from staying the night at her apartment, which cuts off a majority of my contact with her. I’m really worried about her safety and I just want him to understand that she’s not choosing to mess up her relationship with all of us.",02Aug2020,1

I can't really talk about this to many people so I'm telling you.

But her husband my so called ""grandfather"" is not I've seen stuff before.( I will call him ass) When I was 11 years old he would often ask me to 'fix' stuff on his phone other times help him with things. In those times he would get really close to me sometimes touching my thighs it always made me uncomfortable but I didn't say much. One time while helping him one I saw one of his searches were and I still remember it ' naked Japanese girls ' at the time I didn't think much of it. I should have.. Then I kept seeing more weird searches . I told my mom about it and she told me and my sister to stop going to their house and she told my dad as well he was livid he yelled saying that I an 11 year old shouldn't be able to see that stuff. He was mad at that ass . Slowly we stopped visiting my grandma had confronted him about it things started becoming normal. Then recently b's  son got married. So now I have an aunt .she's really nice and me and my sister started visiting them again. It's been and 1 month now. My sister visits them regularly and I visit them to talk her and b often. But 2 days ago. I visited them to talk to my aunt and uncle about learning languages. They weren't home but b and ass were but since b was at home I thought what's the worst he can do? And I stayed talking to b. Then b went to take a shower. So ass and I were alone I was in a different room eating snacks that b gave me. But then ass called me. I went to see what happened. And he called me to help him with his phone camera to take pictures. I thought it's just a couple of selfies what's the worst that could happen? But then he said to take pictures while standing up so I stood up and he then hugged me. Not a normal hug but one he's kinda on my side one of his hands on my waist the other slightly touching the side of my chest. Basically he was getting really close to me. I was really uncomfortable. So after snapping a 3 photos I quickly got away. He then told me to lock the photos so that no-one but him can see them. I didn't know what to do or say so I agreed . And then I tried to take those pictures but I couldn't. I'll try to take them again if I get the chance . I haven't told my parents anything yet because I want to have proof and back up. So I'm going to some how take those pictures when I get the chance. Other than that I'm still scared and uncomfortable. I hate everything now. And feel really bad especially for b. How would she react? What would she think? I don't really know . Should I go with my plan and try to get those pictures ?

I got out of my room to see what's wrong but somehow became a part of it. I can't remember much, it was pretty bad but at the end my sister and I tried to explain something.




Here's the thing- my mom had a hard life, she comes from toxic family, she has problem with teeth and we don't have enough money to solve it, she is divorced, she works minimal wage for 9 hours doing 3 jobs at the same time but paid for one. I do understand that and it hurts to look at her getting more tired everyday. It hurts not being able to help at the job. It hurts to see non materialistic person being this sad and stuck because of materialistic stuff. Nobody deserves to feel like that. 



Now, the problem is she uses this to manipulate us. And as fas as I know it still isn't fair to use your bad situation (which never ends) as an argument again criticism. I tried to explain the fact that her not being able to say sorry hurts . Now, I'm not exaggerating. She never apologized to me unless it's sarcastic or for something stupid. And she never said ""you're right"" and that hurts too. It effected me negatively- I grew up not being able to fight back when I really need to because I was born having a curse of never being right. Or that's what my mom sees at least. Today I tried to make her understand how important apology is to me and my sister and at first she started with "" oh, so I'm a bad parent right"" thing, after that she changed it to ""what does 'sorry' even mean I'd rather show you that I'm sorry"". We we're unable to explain to her that we need to hear her say it when she goes to far. We wouldn't need to hear it that bad if she ever apologized but she never did. 



It always ends like this: My sister goes to her room, I go to mine, mom stays in the living room. The 3 of us are crying. No one wants to apologise anymore because my sister and I can't do it anymore. We apologise for fights our mom started, we apologise for fights our mom make last longer, we apologise for having valid critique, we apologise for everything. And then, slap in the face- she never apologizes for her part. And she sure does have a good thing to apologise for. Once in the middle of the fight she told me ""die"". She didn't knew I was actually suicidal at that time and I could've been dead today. I forgave her that because she says a lot of things when she's angry and I know she loves me and that she didn't mean it. I know she regrets it. But I'm still waiting for her to apologise, at least for that. 



But I love her and when we're not fighting we have this really good relationship full of love and respect. I just don't want to wake up one day, realize she's gone and we had these kinds of arguments. That's it. I just don't want to die regretting.

571,"Hello Reddit,

I went on a trip with some friends (age 20-25) this past weekend. 3 of them were my close friends while the other 3 were new friends for me. I was a bit of a party pooper for some time. I didn’t wanna drink as much or pillow fight and I noticed a little while later the mood would change and it was because of me.

In my point of view, in those moments I saw it as me having asthma and anxiety issues. I didn’t wanna drink and I have been recently paranoid about my health and I guess a little off.

That’s not to say the whole time I was like this, I participated in most games that weren’t as physical as  pillow fighting, hiking or taking a lot of shots. 

So after this, a group chat was made of all of us and then the same night made a new one without me to make plans and have been hanging out with each other ever since. 

I was hanging out with two of them before the group chats were made. One was super chill and acted like nothing. The other acted a little off with me. The best friend was texting me normally until that night they made separate group chat and all chilled. She stopped responding. 

I can acknowledge I was a Debby downer for maybe even most of it. My problem lies with 3 of them being friends with me for years, not having any of these kinds of issues and suddenly stopped replying to my texts. (One of them being my best friend since I was 14).

I am wondering if I should apologize now or wait for them to hit me up? It’s been almost a week and I’m conflicted. I feel betrayed they seemingly gave me up so easily but I can see that I was pretty down and deff shifted the mood. I also don’t know if based on this new series of events that they already made the decision to cut me off and pointless for me to apologize.",02Aug2020,1

Due to the trauma after I was taken away from my parents, I seemed to be afraid of any social interaction or even doing simple things such as going for a walk outside or asking for extra ketchup packets at a restaurant. 

Around a year and a half ago, I moved away from the town I was living in for a while, which meant that I had the give up the few friends that I did make, and have to struggle with anxiety while trying to socialize with people in a new school. It was especially hard because last year was my first year in high school, and I spent everyday at lunch with zero social interaction.

The main reason I want to calm my anxiety is because I want to try to get a job. I see people my age getting a job and living a good life, but with my anxiety, it's very hard for me to interact with random people, and I couldn't imagine the stress of having to show up to an interview.(and not to mention, I don't have any volunteer hours or references, but that is a different topic of discussion) 

If the ongoing pandemic allows, I am going into 10th grade this year. I want to try to be more social and overcome my anxiety, but it seems almost impossible with the severity of it. It really bothers me because I am realizing all the social interaction I'm missing out on whether it be joining school clubs that I would be interested in or even just going to a friend's house. I struggle to make friends because I seem like a boring person at first, but the truth is that I don't really reveal my full personality until I get to know someone and adapt to their presence. I want to learn to how be less of a boring person at first glance and start more engaging conversations. 

I am also very worried on how my anxiety will affect me in my future adult life such as applying for a college, going on a date or getting my learner's permit and driving license. I don't even know anything about finances, taxes, or even how to buy a house when I'm old enough.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",02Aug2020,1
573,"I’m not even sure where to post this. Sorry for the long wall of text and horrible writing. I’m doing this from my phone. 

So I’ve been with the company coming up on a year. I was requested to go an business trip, to a hot spot and we all to come right back into the office, but that’s a whole other issue. This was my first time traveling with the company. There was me and one other woman on the trip, my team lead, the HR manager. The rest was all of the c suite level and executive level, including the head of HR, me and the team lead’s department head. 

It was night 3 of the trip and we’re all at dinner when the #2 in command (this is basically his company) is asking me in front of everyone how long I’ve been with the company and asks if he thinks I’ll make it the full year. He then turns to me and says, “you’re so quiet. What’s some dirt on you?”. I say uhhh, nothing. He then says well we’re all going to play never have a I ever. I thought he was joking, but he wasn’t. I said well I’m going to keep things g-rated, hoping it would set the tone for the game. The other woman on the trip sat next to me and was in agreement to keep it professional. I was wrong. It quickly escalated, by the men of course, to x rated questions. “Had sex in the office? Slept with someone of same sex, had cum on my chin”, etc. The other woman really didn’t feel comfortable with answering so I told her not to but then the head of HR said come on, “I know you’ve slept with women so drink” she was so embarrassed and then drank. He looked at me and said, “ I know you’re lying. You haven’t even kissed a woman before?”. I said no. He then turns to me says, “what happens on this trip stays on the trip. We don’t go back to the office and repeat what goes on. We want to keep it professional there and have fun on the trips”. The game went on it seemed like for an hour. 

They see these women on the street and invite them to the hotel. We’re riding back to the hotel with our department head, the head of HR. They text us to come to the CEO’s suite. The two of us decline and both say oh it sounds like a boys night you guys go. Of course, they say no let’s go he asked us to come. We get there and the two women they invited over are dancing everywhere, twerking on the floor, underwear showing. The CEO is making out with one of the girls and the rest are dancing on tables. It’s almost 2 am and finally they start heading out. I’m walking out the door and my department head, the head of HR says, “let’s go” and proceeds to smack my butt. The next morning my team is clearly embarrassed, understandably so, saying how she kept replaying the never have I ever game. 

Let’s rewind for a bit though. Back in February we were at an offsite meeting. I had only been with the company 4 months at this point by the way. After the meeting they’re having drinks. I’m drinking my glass of wine and my department head, once again, the head of HR, comes and sits next to me and starts talking to me about the Super Bowl. He’s clearly buzzed at this point. He starts saying how sexy shakira is and how she looks like she’ll just devour someone in bed. He turns to me and says, “you know you’re just as beautiful as she is. If I had a time machine I’d go back in time and come get you”. I just chuckle (not bc I thought it was funny or flattering just because I didn’t know what else to do”. 

Okay, so we get back from the trip and we all just head straight back into the office (2 weeks before we were commanded to come back into the office immediately full time because someone on the team screwed up). My coworker, another department head (very close with the #2 in command) who didn’t go on the trip is asking me about my birthday because it’s the next week. He and I always tease each other - how I can’t see without my glasses, politics, etc. He’s met my SO so I figured he knew I wasn’t interested in him. Anyways, he’s teasing me again saying how I’m getting old now and I tell him how he can’t tease me about my birthday as it’s a “national holiday”. He turns to me and asked me what I wanted, I jokingly said, “oh the Versace yellow diamond perfume, the lotion, AND the shower gel. It has to be Versace set you know”. I’m clearly joking because who would purchase anything Versace for a coworker? Him apparently. A few days later he tells me he ordered the set for me and would be here in a few days. I said, “you’re joking right? I hope you know I was just joking with you”. He said, “its your 30th so I had to get something”. I turned to him and said, “yea sure a card. I thought you would’ve gotten me one of those gifts that would’ve shocked me when I touched it or something because you’re always teasing me, not this”. 

The gift arrives to the office and he in the card it says, “happy 30th from daddy”. I take a picture of the from daddy part and I said, “really?? Daddy??” He thinks it’s hilarious, I think it’s disgusting. He said, “I knew you’d enjoy that”. I replied saying, “you’re a mess lmao”. He then tells me not to tell anyone, for this to stay between us, because he “never buys gifts for people in the office”. F*ck that, I told my HR manager so it wouldn’t seem like I asked for the gift and that I’m not trying to fool around on my SO. She said, “yea he mentioned he was interested but I told him he was going to get rejected because you’re with *insert boyfriend’s name*. He then sends another text saying, “let me know when you trying the shower gel so I can come by and take a whiff 😘”. I don’t respond. 

I guess I’m just venting because I feel like there’s nothing I can do. Mainly because I didn’t outright put my foot down in these situations and it looks like I’m complicit, like with the gift by saying, “you’re a mess lmao”. Not because I’m trying to flirt or I’m okay with. I just didn’t know what else to do, especially since I’m still the newest person in the office. I’m not sure if that sounds like a BS excuse or not but it’s the truth. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is being a woman sucks.",02Aug2020,1
574,"My girlfriend and I go to different schools and we’re underage, so I don’t know all of her friends personally. She’s always hanging out with them, and obviously I don’t mind her hanging out with her friends, but they’re always drinking and getting hammered and making bad decisions. Like last night her friends got super drunk and some of them slept in a corn field. Luckily my gf wasn’t there, but how do I tell her that her friends really aren’t good for her? I don’t want to be controlling, but she’s so sweet and deserves much better friends.",02Aug2020,1
575,"So I (18F) went out drinking with my friend (21F) on Friday and then ended up chilling at her place with her flatmate (26M) and his friend (26/27M). No jokes tho the 2 guys literally look 18/19. And i get told I look 14/15🙃.

Anyways this is about my friend's flatmate's friend. I wasnt attracted to him but he was fun and nice to talk to. We have the same taste in music and we both have done acid so we talked about that. Anyways i went to sleep in a guest's room and he came in later and asked if its okay to cuddle. Im SUPER nice and said yes. It was awkward for me tho cuz im not an affectionate person so i put music on. Then he said ""i kinda wanna kiss you"" and i was like ""eeeeh nah idk im kinda into someone sry"" and then i was like ""its nthg about u, im just into someone yeah hahah"" and tried to make it less awkward. We ended just sleeping in the same bed and we took the train home together cuz turns out he lives like 5mins from my place.

He just DMed me about doing acid together some day. I wouldn't mind cuz he seems nice as a friend. But I hope I made it clear I wouldnt do anything sexual with him... How do I tell him in a text that I dont mind doing acid with him but if he thinks im into him then im not...? I dont wanna sound rude...",02Aug2020,1
576,"Hello, I come from a strict, traditional home and am thinking about moving out with my boyfriend. I don’t know how to approach the situation in a manor that my parents won’t disown me right away. I’m 20 years old working part time while going to school for nursing. I still have an 8:30p.m curfew and I am tired of being treated like I’m 14 even though I’m the one who cleans the house, does the laundry, and at times cooks for the family. 
If anyone has gone through or is going through a similar situation I could really use the advice right now. Whenever I bring up that I am not happy being treated this way, all they say is that they had less freedom when they were growing up and I should be more grateful. I have talked in hypotheticals to them about me moving out and they weren’t happy saying I was stupid for even thinking it. I am worried how they would react me moving in with my boyfriend unmarried and no plans for marriage for us until later on in the future once we have finished school.

577,I’ve been shutting my door the past few times my boyfriend has been over and my mum is fine with it. My mum told me my dad doesn’t want it closed and said we should talk about this if I have a problem with it. When we’re at my boyfriends house we have it shut no problem.

578,So in Singapore there's this thing called PSLE(primary school leaving examination) and its a big test that decides which secondary school you go to.

580,"Since march 16th, my country has been quarantined, and we spend all day at home. My schedule  in general has changed a lot, but my sleep schedule hasn´t changed much. I still have classes, so I wake up at 7 or 8 most days. Some weeks I can sleep okay, without waking up at all, but lately, I wake up various times during the night. For example, last night I fell asleep around 1.30 and woke up at 9.30, but got up during the night like six times.  The thing is that when it happens, I wake up with a lot of energy, just as if I had had a full night sleep, when I had actually slept just a couple hours. This happens on and off, there were weeks at a time when I slept perfectly, and others which I didn´t. Ik that doing less things during the day and wasting less energy may have an influence in this, but idk why it still happens to me when I´ve been in quarantine for 5 months.

So we both liked each other and chatting for 2 years now, but it's strange that i suddenly lost interest in her. I don't chat to her anymore, the last time we're chatting was a month ago. I'm afraid to tell her that i don't like her anymore because it'll break her heart. I just got used to her and i don't want to be those kind of people who break someone's heart.

582,"Basically, I'm 22 lonely, went through a huge crushing phase with this girl I can't ever see but I feel like I'm getting over her. She still feels like a huge part of my life because she's basically my only close friend, but there's also still some unprocessed pain and feelings that stand in the way. Lately she's been very busy and a bit distant and my mind, with all it's fear of abandonment, believes that she no longer wants to be my friend now that she's gotten over me. I still very much want to be her friend and stay close and I'm also kinda scared it's out of fear of going back to having absolutely no one to talk to, and that I actually use that as an argument to stay in a toxic friendship and being blind to it... 

With that intro, today I'm feeling particularly bad and I really don't understand why... I have some questions in my head about life and things I want to do in the close future and I feel overwhelmed by it. I want to talk to someone about it. But. I only have one person, who I just described above. On top of that, I feel like I only really go to her when I need support and not really when I don't. I feel like I'm treating her as someone who knows the answers, someone who can help me. I feel like by going to her, I'm really not treating her right... Burdening her with my problems... And that leads to even more overthinking: what is this friendship really worth anymore? Why do I want to stay friends with this person, who doesn't have that much time for me anymore and on top of that, who I can never see in real life in the foreseeable future? But on the other hand I literally have no one else to go to and I feel like I really just need that little boost of talking about it with someone and get stuff off my chest and receive some new insights... She's told me countless times that she's always there for me and that I can tell her whatever I want even if it's slightly unbalanced, but I really don't believe that's a healthy attitude of hers and I feel like using her for doing this.... And keep in mind, if this person is my *best* friend, how the hell do I ever talk to anyone about stuff? I just don't know anymore...",02Aug2020,1

Thanks :),02Aug2020,1
584,"I feel like I'm becoming paranoid because the way she acts is very 'lowkey'. She is insecure about her looks so any time I post a photo I think she compares herself to me because she consistently picks out photos where I look really bad and says 'you look so beautiful'. And I'm pretty sure it's a pattern at this point. It can't be that it's just a coincidence. Any photo that makes me look really bad she'll comment on how it's so pretty... When it's very obviously not.

She also told me I look better with my natural hair tied back or my hair flat and I sent her a funny photo and she was like 'I told you that you look good with your natural hair tied back' when it was as obvious as the fucking sun that my hair was flat ironed.... And I told her how important my hair is to me as a black woman that I need to wear it natural, whether it looks good or not. It's my natural hair texture and I want to love it. 

I don't take it personally most of the time. She tries to shower me with too many compliments to the point where it's uncomfortable and it's become less endearing and more annoying/patronizing/her wanting me to compliment her and validate her in return. I feel like she's being super insecure and passive aggressive but I can't pin point it if that makes sense. She's also overall really clingy and it's annoying me.",02Aug2020,1
585,"Hi, I'm a young man, 19 years of age, living in a developing country that will never develop. Currently, I am living with my parents, and we are in a poor-middle class state. My father works as a teacher and manages in his sari sari store together with my eldest, unemployed brother. I am the youngest child among the three, and my other brother is working abroard and probably having his own life. He sends us money when we are in need of money so we are highly dependent on the earnings from the store and my father's job. 

Let's start in the beginning when everything changed when my father was fired from his main job as a seaman in Japan. We were living in middle class, we could buy good things, and even built a second house in one land. Basically, we can afford anything we need and a little bit of our wants. Then, when we didn't have the money, my father earns yearly, we tasted poor. But we're kind of okay with it because we can still afford food, water and other necessities. 

Because of this living condition, I took a risk and decided to stop college for one year. I didn't enroll to a university and talked with my parents about my decision. I didn't tell them that I would do this so we could at least get some money and hopefully return closely to the life we were living, but told them that I would write a novel. They agreed easily to it as if they didn't have a second thought. It was like they were on the same page as mine. So I planned and found a good site to post my story. I worked my hardest for this as if it was my job. But this job was fun, I learned a lot of things as I researched information for my story and made my characters in my mind into words. I was inspired and motivated that every morning, I start thinking of the flow of the story and at the same time, help with the household chores. If they needed help, they'd call me and I'd answer them. This would go on until the evening where I start working. I used OTG connection, a keyboard and my phone because my computer is old and is in my brother's room. For the whole night, I would spend typing the story and would sleep around 3:00 - 5:00 a.m. 

I did this for 6 or 7 months straight. And I already have a patreon account for anyone who'd support me. But within these months, I suffered from my parents especially from my father. He would shout and destroy my mental and emotional state. Because of this, I developed trauma of him. If I hear his footsteps outside my room, I would immediately wake up from my slumber and stare at the door, expecting for loud knocks. My heart beats faster when he talks slightly higher in tone. I would avoid him and more. 

Before, I had depression in my highscool years that I didn't recognize. Right now, I may have worsen my depression and anxiety as I live with my parents because I've been thinking of evil things like suicide, murder, bombing our mall, and other intrusive thoughts. I am expecting it would get worse if I continue living with them. My dislike turned to hate, but I held it in my mind. I don't want them to hear or see this from me. 

In the last month, I was fed up and fought a little with my father about me sleeping longer. Of course, I immediately lost because he has the highest power in the house. My mother would even get scared of him when he gets mad causing her to cry. So, I stopped writing my novel and lived, up until now, as a slave to help them when they call me. 

Because of anxiety, I kept overthinking nonstop. Remember in cartoons, where there is an angel and devil on your shoulders? That's the case of my anxiety. It's bad because they're total opposite and would always argue, but with my growing love of stories and books, I thought of an idea of revolutionizing something into a gadget and make an app that would help a lot of people. This became my only dream. I kept walking around the house, thinking of this and took some note of it. I was happy because I realized that this could change the world for the better or something. And the app is to help people earn money from ads or purchase. Initially, the app was for people like me, suffering from mental illness/disorder/problems because I turned my depression and anxiety to a story where I could let my protagonist commit suicide, kill, bomb buildings and more. It helped me a lot because I put all my emotions to it and I felt at ease later on. I thought if this could help the suffering.

Now, it's 2020 and the schools are coming up. This year, I may be enrolling in our province's university. I am not sure if I could go to college especially these times. That means more years together with my family. I hope I won't commit suicide from this. 

First, I planned to enroll to a university away from home, but quickly rejected by my parents because of covid, my asthma and our struggling finance. 

So I thought of my dream in doubt if I could really do it because it's going to be very difficult. It's just an idea that popped out in my head. I have no talent, skills and knowledge about making a gadget and an app. It's nothing but a dream created from my anxiety. I even thought on how I could manufacture my work if I'm poor. It would need a lot of money to build these type of things. Heck, I dont know if this is even a good idea to begin with and better off forgetting about it. I don't have any confidence in me. I lost it when I kept on trying to be dependable. This made me think that this is stupid, crazy, and I just need to live the life I am fated to. Probably, my angel keeps giving me hopes or false hopes to work on this, but I can't see myself working on it or feel it in the future. All I can imagine is getting helped by someone or some people because of how dumb and stupid I am. I keep on thinking of low expectations to avoid disappointment and depression and that I am below average at everything. I basically suck and have no luck in real life and even in games as I tested on a gatcha game. 

So, I am taking Computer Science as my course for college. This dream of mine has been repeating in my head numerous times, together with the stories I've made from my novel. I am already fine with making my novel because I turned it into a hobby. But my overthinking is my problem because anxiety is what I'm suffering more than my depression. This guy wants to kill me and commit bad things. Slowly as my depression and anxiety worsen, my care for others is fading and the next is my care for myself. When I lose my care for myself, that's when I get the courage to commit suicide. 

So should I give up on my dream? Reality speaking, I am living in country where opportunities are limited. I'm poor and stupid. This is like an impossible dream. So my fated future is to finish college, go find a job and hopefully live a life away from my parents and a life without any dreams. That's it. I want to stop thinking of this to limit my overthinking. I need to stop thinking too much or this will affect my studies. I have exhausted my mentality for too long and I want to take a break by slowly forgetting the dream. 

But this dream is a big deal because it's my only dream. Studying Computer Science and becoming a programmer aren't my dreams. It's just something I took as a choice because I am comfortable working on the keyboard. If I pursue my dream, my other dreams will appear and be done as well. 


Anyway, dreams change and grow when we grow up, but in my case, it's something that can be hold or thrown away and live to what society tells. 

So, should I give up on my dream?",02Aug2020,1

587,So there’s this girl that randomly added me on Snapchat one day and she asked me if we wanted to be friends. I knew nothing about her she just lived in my area so I just texted back by saying “I know nothing about you sorry”. She said ok. Then I was like “ok might as well ask some questions” so I asked some questions it took around 2 days for her to actually see the text but I was like “ok she just might be doing something” so she texted back and i kept asking questions and stuff. I started to kinda like her. She said she moved and didn’t have any friends and just added me to see if I’d like to be her friend. I was like “oh ok” and then the conversation ended. I beat myself up for this but I knew I should’ve said “we can be friends” but I ended the conversation. I still have her added and I don’t know what to do. I want to text her first but I don’t know if I should ask a question or plain out say I want to be your friend. It’s harder for me because I ended the conversation without implying anything.

588,"It’s a long story but I’ll try to make it as short as possible. My whole life I’ve been bullied by others at school and I’ve moved schools a lot because of it. At 14, I began to think that the only way I could ever feel happy was if I died. I almost jumped in front of a train but backed out because some children were waiting for the train and I didn’t want them to see what would happen to me. I decided I would give myself 1 year and if my life had not gotten any better, i would go through with it. I moved to another school and my classmates and teachers seemed genuinely nice to me which was a pretty big change. I started talking to this one girl in my class and found out we both like anime, art etc. I had always believed that I didn’t deserve friends and that everyone was out to get me, but that changed and we quickly became friends. She is kind, smart and can always make me laugh when I need it. My life got better in every aspect after I met her and when my 1 year was over, I decided she was a sign that I needed to keep on living. Now I’m 17 and I’m finally happy with myself. I feel confident, pretty and I am proud of the person I’ve become and the person I will be in the future. She has helped me become the best version of myself and she doesn’t know about any of this. She does know I was bullied, but not how bad it actually was. She doesn’t know about my depression and suicide thoughts either. We’re going for a picnic next week and I am contemplating whether or not I should tell her that she saved my life. I want her to know just how much she has helped me in the few years we’ve known each other, but I also don’t want her to worry about my mental state. I am contemplating not telling her because I’m going to come out as bi to her and even though we have already talked about sexuality I’ve never actually said I was bi and I don’t want to overwhelm her. Should I tell her or should I leave it in the past and forget about it?

590,"Over the past few months my life has been spinning. I lived out of state with a bunch of roommates, two of which were lifelong friends and a third who was new but we needed the money because our agency was scummy. A lot of things went down between myself and this new roommate that were negative, so I ultimately moved out. But recently this roommate got karma'd hard and is no longer around, and showed their true colors to the other two.

During that time I had moved home to my parent's property with my girlfriend/fiancee. Things were okay for a time but the past two months have been loaded with blaming us for anything that occurs to interrupt my fathers 'strict routine' (he likes to think of himself as a military styled man but he's not that upstanding.)

The complaints have been loaded to now being punishments. We didn't do some obscure task we were never told about or asked to address? Now we have to pay the entire water bill, buy a whole new stock of supplies for the week, and if there's anything else out of place -insert some threat that vaguely involves kicking us out, or at least her-. We're both tired of it, but I've lived with this so long that while my girlfriend is suggesting I take the advice of all of our friends and move back in, I'm agreeing and setting up the moving plans to slink off while they're at work (there will be a legitimate fist fight if my dad is home, almost certain) while also trying to cling to some excuse not to. I don't know why I'm feeling this way because I know this isn't right to be treated this way, but I also look at things from a perspective that, while all this is asked of us we live fairly rent free. Granted, there's a part of my dad that shines through saying any investment we as a couple decide on is unwise and foolish and childish, but if he needs money for something 'important' then we're idiots and ungrateful for not forking it over on the fly, highest request was $300, a single paycheck of myself or my girlfriend. He claims he will pay it back but every time he is going to something else has to take the money and it has bordered on him asking for more, which he recently did.

Looking at it written down it seems obvious, but I just feel unsure still, so I'm posting here of course. Is this worth all the fuss, or am I being an idiot?",02Aug2020,1

592,"I feel like I have an undiagnosed mental illness of some kind or a disorder. I just don’t feel like a “normal” person and I’m not sure what to do. 
I know the most obvious thing is to go see a doctor but it’s difficult during lockdown and I also am currently unemployed and I’m worried about it affecting my job prospects if I was diagnosed with something (I had hopes for joining the police or returning to the defence force but I’m doubting those pathways of late).
Basically I am currently stuck because of the situation where I live. I also feel like there’s something wrong with me and there has been for a long time but I don’t even know sometimes I think its ptsd sometimes I think it’s adhd sometimes I think it’s bpd and a lot of the time I think it’s depression but I can’t know until a diagnosis or seeing a professional so I guess I just answered my own question but is it worth seeing someone if it ruins my only career plan. I can’t go back to uni for a few reasons so I need to go into a stable job that doesn’t require a degree. This is the longest I’ve ever been unemployed in fact I haven’t been out of work since before my first job so. This is becoming long winded I’m sure someone understands the dilemma and please respond Thankyou :)",02Aug2020,1

595,"So this friend I’ve known two years. He’s a pretty weird dude. He’s immature and cracks stupid sex jokes every time. He’s been doing that a lot lately. So I went to a day camp with him and on the second day he said he had a girlfriend from *redacted* where he went on vacation. Before he mentioned this he never mentioned her and the day after it was all he could talk about. So then via text he says me and two friends saying she’s telling him to cut off all ties with all friends that are girls. When I said just don’t do it he called me jealous and insecure. So we spend two hours talking about it giving him support. So he then the day after learns she was cheating on him. And then they broke up. He said she was calling him. When she was, his phone wasn’t ringing, making noise, or even showing a picture. He mentioned her every day and yet when we asked about her and said can we be in a snapchat he instantly shut it off. He then claimed that she would lie about him cheating, so I said get proof. He then got proof of her saying that she would lie but can they still get back together? Note how he said no. THE DAY AFTER, after all the shit about this person died down and we stopped talking about it, he said he wants her back. Not to mention, he deleted the screenshot. An argument broke out, he then claimed he didn’t do it. Then he posts on Instagram on his account about how his ex cheated on him, (this was a week after this conversation btw.) and how she’s still calling. I told him to block her. He said he won’t do it FOR SOME REASON. He posted on Instagram and is says “yo should we send a picture of all of us holding hands to her to piss her off?” It took that, for me to realize a something is fishy. So I asked about what part and what town; he didn’t say what town it was. Oh, and then it hit me. There is no girl. Because this is the same guy who tried to bar me from one of his friends who went to the camp, and is going to my school in September. The same guy who did it because he thought I hit his clout. And if it gets to a firefight, I don’t have solid proof. So his friends around my life are more inclined to believe him over me. And the people he lied to know him much better than they know me. But that leaves me with a question. What do I do?",02Aug2020,1
596,"Hey all, not sure how I can describe my emotions, its like an envy, angry, sad kind of mixed, but it's not anything bad at all, its controllable. I've always wanted to do music in the future, and so I auditioned for one of the top music schools in the world: Berklee College of Music and got in. Fine. However due to it being so expensive, I passed on going as I didn't want to put my parents in debt. I am also more realistic and am interested in Criminology, and so I applied to universities with those majors and got into a very good school for that. I have absolutely no problem studying Criminology because I am intrigued by it, the school is extremely reputable and great, but now looking at my friends who are off to study what they ""want"", be it drama, dance, film, english, medicine etc, it makes me feel 'envious' in a way that I am not studying something that deep in my heart I know I want to do for a living. I am a singer song writer by the way. I know some people might say it could be a hobby instead, get a real major/job, you dont need to go to music school to be a famous artist etc and I understand that. It's just, I am not super satisfied that I am not dedicating my life towards or studying it at this point in life. Maybe it's a comparing with others issue, which sometimes it can affect me because I want to show people I've met in the past that I am DIFFERENT (not just a typical Bachelor Arts social science person, no offence at all). Anyone have any advice?

TLDR: Want to study music, got into music school but not going because of costs. Going for a degree in criminology (something I am interested in and don't mind studying at all) but feeling unsatisfied because deep down its not something I want to do compared to music.",02Aug2020,1
597,"My mum recently got another new boyfriend who she found in the pub. I've only known him for about 2 months and he's here every single day... I've never liked him from the start there's just something off about him... Probably because he screams and shouts at all my little siblings and argues in the middle of the night with my mum calling her a slag when he gets drunk. It's like we don't even know him that well and he's doing all this already... He tells her everything what's wrong with her and her kids and she actually listens to that shit. He's said a lot of weird shit which I just find disgusting, the other day my youngest brother (5yo) was crying and throwing a tantrum over something, her boyfriend turned around and said to him ""you should have been fucking swallowed""... I don't like him, even her sister doesn't like him... The other day he came up to me and started an argument over something stupid like a nursery rhyme... Oh and also he's racist so he was shouting the n word and saying shit like Floyd deserved what he got... I was shouting back at him and because I highly disagree with everything he says, he doesn't like me and hasn't said anything to me since... But yeah that just basically sums him up as a person... A prick.

So last night it was quite late, around midnight-1am and I (17f) was playing an online game with my brother (13) after him begging me for hours to play, his room is opposite mine and it's the only two rooms on the third floor (British terraced house) so the only people really going up and down those stairs is me and my brother to get to our rooms. I was in my room with my door slightly open and he was sitting in his room with his door open. After about half an hour I heard footsteps creaking up and I thought it was my mum or something to tell us to be quiet. Nope. My door opened and it was her boyfriend, it was so dark in my room that I could barely make out anything so I just said ""yeah?"" He stood by the door for about ten seconds said something that I couldn't make out and went back downstairs... I thought what the heck? So I looked over to my brother and he said he was fully naked... I said what the fuck?... I felt sick, I felt a mixture of nervousness and anger, like is this seriously happening right now? I waited until the next day, which is today. I was in the bathroom and my mum was in the hallway, I got out and said mum I need to say something to you... She said oh I already know, he told me this morning and already apologised saying it was an accident. I said what? An accident? Who accidently walks up into someone's bedroom in the middle of the night fully naked? An accident? And you're actually going to believe him?! Mum wake up! Why would you be with someone like him anyway?!... He screams at you and your kids, calls you a slag, has no respect and talks shit about your family members... Are you being serious?! She said what she does in her house is none of my business and if I don't like it then I can fuck off and leave... I started crying, then her boyfriend shouted upstairs and said that I'm a piece of shit, I don't do anything, and I'm basically a slag for thinking something like that. I looked over to my mum, she didn't say anything... So I looked down at her boyfriend and screamed everything I could think of in that moment, it was all a blur...I was literally shaking with anger, she pushed me and said that if I don't shut the fuck up she'll punch me in the head... 

So here I am right now writing this, I messaged my dad hoping that he would let me stay at his house for abit and all he said was put something in front of my door so he can't get in, great... Thanks for caring dad. I just want to run away but I have nowhere to go... All my friends I'm not so close to anymore and their busy with their own lives, I've never felt this lonely before. I truly have nobody, I have nobody who actually cares so here I am writing this on Reddit... I have no idea what I should do or what I can even do.",02Aug2020,1
598,"I have no idea what I want to do in life. I've asked people before and the answers are usually the same; photographer or fashion designer. photography is something I am extremely interested in and I adore taking photos, fashion is something I've always liked but I've never designed anything before. I don't know what profession I want. I've also been thinking about becoming a psychologist but I hate the idea of working at classic 9-5 office job. I feel as if I was made to do more than that. I feel like my future profession won't be a normal one considering my first job (i still currently have) is an Etsy where I make decent money selling stickers(plus with COVID-19 there's nowhere hiring and I have a compromised family so I'm not even going back to school in class). But being from a small town I feel like the only option I have is to get that classic kind of job. Side note: theres nothing wrong with a 9-5 job, I just don't have an interest in one like that.

I guess I'm just scared.my future profession is what scares me the most. I have no idea what I want to do and I have little time to figure it out. This school year is going to fly by and I'm not ready for this time next year when I start university.

We broke up and it was a bad fight - not bad enough to have 30 days of NC.  I suggested 2 weeks of NC and then to slowly build up a relationship. He said No. I suggested us just having space and not having tinder so it shows we want to work on us. He said No.

He told me he cares but never tries to show it by telling me how he feels. He just said, 'we had fun. it was good' about our relationship. I had a conversation about how I couldn't wait 30 days. He said we should just leave it then.

606,"     So a little backstory, about a year ago I was dating a girl in my high school, it was such a good chemistry, and I related to her and her own struggles so well. She ended up adopting a lot of my hobbies, and it was the happiest I’d ever been. Then after we both went to college, it ended with a pretty nasty breakup (I found out she was cheating on me a couple days after that but she had been avoiding me and acting strangely before then) 

      I now know I emotionally invested way to much into it. As such, it destroyed me like no breakup had before. and I turned into a pretty disheveled wreck, lots of drinking and bad thoughts, but little by little I’m getting over it and getting back to normal. 

     Fast foreword about a year and I had been inactive on a pretty large discord server. I decided it was a good time to get back into the swing of things there, only to find out she was not only in the discord, but a prominent member, suddenly my stomach churned and I went right back to the nightmares and garbage that I thought I had finally beaten. 

    I don’t want to leave the community. after all, it was me who introduced the game this is based around to her in the first place and I don’t want her to take something else from me. But seeing her brings back memories I tried very hard to forget. Especially me teaching her this game. I also don’t want to kick up a fuss about it. Since her being there isn’t exactly wrong in of itself.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy in all other areas in my life - truly. My relationships have just been such a defining element of my identity for so long that I'm feeling a little out of water here.

613,"(I'm not sure if this is qualified as a medical issue) For years I have had a problem where I occasionally have fits of laughter that I can't control. It has no correlation with my mood at all. And I can't control it. The most I can do is try to muffle the sound of it. It isn't very frequent, but it still bothers me a bit. On more rare occasions it is accompanied by tears. 

I also have a problem with my emotions not being displayed properly. Even if I am exposed to something barely funny (or not funny at all) I will laugh uncontrollably for almost a few minutes. (My longest is roughly 3 minutes or so)

 It ranges in intensity. Sometimes it will be just regular sounding laughter and other times it sounds like hysterical laughing. 

Some people feel good after smiling or laughing, but for me, this type of laughing makes me feel bad. There have been times I've been in the presence of other people during laughing fits and it is very embarrassing to me. My family members say it makes me look ""deranged"" or ""crazy."" I had the problem with the inappropriate display of emotion when I played D&amp;D (multiple sessions) with some people. They didn't comment on it at all (thankfully). There wasn't any lasting tension from them, but I was still embarrassed. 

I have only had this problem for a few years (I think since I was 14). 

There were a few things that happened when I was 14. I was put in a psychiatric hospital for mental health problems that have gotten worse over the course of a few years and a couple of days before, I hit my head really hard and got a concussion. Those are the only significant things that happened that year as far as events going on with my head.

 The laughing started around a month (or multiple) after the incidents (It was still pretty rare. I documented it in a journal which is how I remember. The episode was brief.). Once again, it is not frequent so it doesn't significantly impair my quality of life.

621,"I am an engineering student. I started a blog in college. Starting a blog, doing lots of other ECAs in addition to writing articles and being tired/not being able to dedicate proper time, made my Percentage extremely low.

I got backlogs. One is cleared...that too just with pass marks. And this time also , I was writing blogs.(I regret this as well).

My percentage is 69%(average percentage in 4 semesters).

It feels more bad because throughout my life, I have been an extremely good student. 90% in 10th grade..86% average in 11 and 12 grade. And, I have got even decent percentage in engineering when I didn't do any ECAs-: 76%, and 72%. I was kind of adjusting/depressed/regretful in 1st semester so I made only 66%.

I started a blog because my family always used to tell me"" We are sending you to a college that we can't afford...bla bla..and just ruin my mood...Although they didn't tell me to work and earn, it was due to immense pressure by them, that I could not focus at all into studies...and thought that earning some money with a blog, might help them....It feels sad to tell but we used to have regular quarrels for around 6 months of my college enrollment, I even questioned them ""if you can't afford why the hell did you send me? please let me focus and study...after getting backlogs in 1st semester, they also kinda understood...I have now, kept distance with them, and I don't speak with them much, I try to avoid them as much as possible.) **But, this situation is not repsonsible for regret, rather blogging is**

**Few days ago, I asked question in yahoo answers, and they advised me to talk with counsellor, to know if you can retake some courses. I was confident that in few subjects, I can score at least 10-15 marks more than now. Which will add up some percentage...But, turned out it was impossible in my university.**

So, only option left for me was to stop regretting and start doing.

No, i don't want to be a blogger. I did it due to intense family pressure, continuous pressure of telling me ""We are putting you into expensive college""...(I had scholarship for class 11 and class 12, so I think that might have made their mind that they need me to study for free always)..

I am working hard these days, but when a regret thoughts pop us(the triggers are especially those concepts that I didn't learn during 3rd semester...those concepts I have to learn...It is not like they are a large chunk, but they pop up sometimes....making me remember my regret of not studying properly and focusing on blogging. Problem of doing extra activities is that take up your willpower, and you cant focus on 1 thing, although you have enough energy to do so. I was kinda unconsciously doing all those, that was even greater mistake..Had I done it consciously, I guess, it won't be as fatal it became...I would not regretted if I did blogging consciously..probably managing time for exams, learning my materials first and putting time in blog...would have helped me.

622,"TLDR; I was threatened with a knife by a drunk and/or high man having an argument with his S/O. I don’t know whether I should press charges or ignore it and hope I don’t see him again.

A couple nights ago I was hanging out with some friends at one of their apartments in an outdoor communal (apartment owned) space. It was getting dark and we were about ready to leave when we heard a loud banging a few apartments down from us, followed by a crash. I looked over in time to see a man smash the window of the apartment with what looked like his bare hand. Someone immediately called the police. 

I (21M) am relatively tall and strong and was being followed by a larger neighbor, so it seemed like the right decision to walk over and ask if everyone was alright.

I approached the man and asked him if he was ok. As I got closer I realized that there was a woman inside the apartment. Seeing me, she immediately came out and began reassuring me that everything was totally fine and that I could leave. “He’s just a little drunk,” she told me. Her demeanor was so calm it was off-putting.

Thinking I must have misread the entire situation, I laughed and said “Oh alright we thought someone was breaking in.” The man, hearing me, blew a fuse. “Breaking in?? I live here, this is MY apartment!” Becoming more and more aggressive by the second, the man started to threaten me completely unprovoked. I did everything I could think of to de-escalate the situation and let him know I wasn’t a threat. Now he demanded to know what my name was, and I told him (I have a long, complicated name, it was unlikely he would remember it). My responses stayed calm, but his behavior only got more hostile.

Now he was screaming at me inches from my face. “N**** I will DESTROY you! Square up!” He took a step back and raised his fists, so I told him very clearly that I had no intention of fighting him.

At this point I wasn’t going to leave before the police came without knowing for certain that the woman wasn’t in danger. Despite what she was saying, this man was violent and had the capacity to hurt her. I’ve read enough about the psychology of abuse to understand that women in this kind of relationship often defend their partner to the grave.

When I refused to escalate he told the woman something that I didn’t catch and stormed inside. I stayed outside talking to the woman, who was still acting like this was a normal night for her. Had I heard him, I would’ve bolted because my friends who stayed behind later told me he said “Babe get the gun.” 

A few seconds later he ran out with a knife and started aggressively pointing it at me. He was screaming something. I backtracked quickly and told him I was leaving. I was still somewhat under the naive impression that he could be calmed down, until he started advancing at me quickly and suddenly it clicked that if this man wanted to kill me I would die. I turned and sprinted back to my friends apartment. The neighbor ducked into his own apartment.

Thirty seconds later, the police arrived and he was tackled. I assume he spent the night in a holding cell. I wrote a statement and went back home, as it was late. 

I don’t know what to do going forward. I hope this man gets evicted from his apartment. I don’t feel safe at my friends place anymore, which is a pity because I spend a lot of time there. We now know he has a gun, and thankfully he didn’t get it but I may not be so lucky next time he sees me.

I believe menacing someone with a knife is a felony in Colorado. Regardless of whether you think I was an idiot for intervening in the first place, should I press charges? On one hand, this man clearly has the capacity to be dangerous, especially to that woman. On the other hand, I will be going back to school in Ohio in three weeks, and it would be a massive hassle to have to fly back for court dates. Do you think I should take legal action? Is it ethically wrong for me to let it slide?",02Aug2020,1
623,"My boyfriend dropped me off at work but used my phone to pay for some car parts at the auto store since I don’t carry cards with me. He doesn’t like to leave his phone around me (I caught him messaging a girl one time. Separate problem though...) so I didn’t have any way of contacting him. I work in a lab and once finished with my experiments, messaged him using Facebook to let him know I was done, and waited. I waited a while and never got a message so I figured I would just walk to the auto part store. It turns out the store was much much farther than I had thought. In the almost three hour time period, he filed a missing report and called everyone on my phone. I ended up walking 7 miles in total, and he never went to the auto part store. 

Now, everyone is really upset at me including the CEO of my company and all of my coworkers and friends. How should I approach these hard conversations? Everyone is really upset at me for not leaving a note or saying something, but I genuinely thought the walk would not take long and that he would be where he said he was. 

He’s not sorry for filing a missing persons report or calling everyone on my phone because he thought I got abducted in broad daylight because I’m “so small” and wouldn’t be able to fend for myself.

624,"I (27F) am a bridesmaid in a wedding that was scheduled for october of 2020. In order to attend this wedding I have to fly to a different state. That is not the problem. My favorite band, My Chemical Romance, announced a reunion tour after I had already agreed to be a bridesmaid. I was bummed but knew I had to miss the concert. Pandemic happens. MCR announces they’re post-poning until next year. My partner buys me tickets for our anniversary on 6/14/20 since the wedding is 10/2/20 and the concert is now 10/1/21. fast forward to 7/14/20 and I get a text from the bride saying they’re rescheduling the wedding to the same date as the concert. I have grown apart from the bride and had some other BS happen that makes me want to go to the concert instead of the wedding, how do I tell her in the nicest way possible? I know I will lose her as a friend in the process which is okay as I only see her when I visit family back home but I still wanna approach it in a non a**hole way.",02Aug2020,1
625,"I am really bad at writing and expressing my feeling in general, because I feel lost everytime, it's like my emotions are always drifting off in the space. But I'm hurt, I'm in pain all the time and no one understands, not like I want them to understand it's like they judge me, everytime I tried to open up everyone always judged me, misunderstood me, because I'm ""taking everything for granted"" and I should ""fix myself"". Most of the time I'm being judged by the people who dont even know me, I dont care about that much but when I'm not in the right place mentally everything gets on my nerves and right now I have to deal with health related issues and I'm trying to take it easy but it still affects me.
I dont like talking about the issues, what made me depressed and caused my insomnia, and I understand that because of this people find my depression ""forced"" or ""unnatural"" but I dont owe anyone explanation right?
I just hate that I constantly need reassurance, and I wish I could receive it from my friends or family. I just dont know what to do, I'm constantly trying to take off my mind, trying to keep myself occupied by watching movies and reading books. I always used to be introverted by this year I took being introverted into the next level. I basically never leave my home and if I do I hate it. But I dont feel lonely, I'm used to being by myself but at the same time it feels suffocating. It may sound cheesy but I want to disappear, so I wont feel pain anymore. 
Please dont be harsh, I just need advice how to deal with it, I know I've been very vague but maybe someone with similar experiences can help :c",02Aug2020,1
626,"Look: I know I'm not in control of what my friends do. Nor do I want to force them into a ""it's me or them!"" situation.

I use to have a friend, things went to shit with them, feelings were involved. She resents me and to be honest, feeling is pretty mutual.

But some of my closest friends were also friends with her and attempts to meet up or chat with them never work recently. Yet they always have time for her, 1 friend can't make time for me ever, but sets aside DND time with her and she plays WOW with them and I'm suppose to make myself scarse.

I hate it, I'm losing my friends and theres this feeling that she might be getting pleasure out of this (considering she called all my friends ""annoying assholes"", weird she'd suddenly want to spend time with them) perhaps I need to let it go?

628,"I [25M] am recently single coming out of a semi long term relationship, and I have just moved into a new apartment building back in my home town. I am one of the few people I am aware of in my building living alone. The people in my building are super friendly, and a lot of them are around my age. I have been here for about a month now. In the apartment next door to me, there are three girls around my age, and they seem really cool. 

The interactions I have had with them have all been very positive, and I feel like I would like to become closer with this group of girls. My problem is that I don’t know how to do this without coming across as creepy. I’ve been finding it really intimidating to approach them in any way other than randomly passing them in the hallway. I’m worried that whatever I do to try and become friends with them will be misconstrued as me trying to hit on them. I also don’t want to make things weird as a result of some kind of rejection, so that when we do see each other in the hallway it is uncomfortable. 

They do know my name, I was added to a building iMessage group and I introduced myself there, so when I’ve seen them they’ve referred to me by my name. One of them was actually in the year above me in high school. But the problem is I barely ever bump into one of them! Once every couple days would be a lot, so I really want to come up with a more proactive way of getting to know them than hoping that I bump into them. 

In terms of actual conversation, I’m quite a confident person and I don’t really have anxiety about that once the ball is rolling. I just want to find a smooth non-cringe way to get the ball rolling first though!

630,"Some backstory: I’m 16M very shy living in COViD America and for some reason my mom decided we should take a week long vacation eight hours away at a rented beach house with her friend and her family and now I think I’m in love??

Her friend is also bringing her husband and two daughters (15) (18) (I’ll call them F1 and F2) I’ve known them since I was little and I would basically call them my sisters at this point because we known each other our whole lives. Anyways they unexpectedly announce that they will each bring a friend ( F3 which is 15 and F4 which is 16) ok, no big deal eight people in a small house for a week we probably already have Coronavirus. We are spending a week with them at this house on the waterfront. Since I’m shy and forgot my anxiety medication I don’t talk for like half the week. (This was my first time meeting F3 and F4) All of them are really sweet and great people it’s just that people aren’t my cup of tea. Us teens talked a little on the first day but I go quiet for 2 days and finally I break out on Wed halfway through the trip. We hangout on the beach and in this outdoor hot tub together all trip and talk about life everyone’s pretty calm and relaxed and we all have fun and like one another. Now F3 friend is really outgoing and always talking and laughing telling stories etc while F4 is more calm and shy like me (also good looking). A couple days go by and I’m starting to really like F4 (as a friend) even though we never talked one on one. Well suddenly it’s Fri the second to last day and by the end of the day I realize something. Do I like F4 or do I like like F4? She is super relatable, sweet, funny, shy, calm, good looking and essentially my dream girl (I would prefer to date a person similar to me). I wasn’t sure but what I was sure of was I was still nervous as hell to talk to her after a week. By Sat next morning we leave unexpectedly early without really saying goodbye to them but I did get the courage to ask for everyone’s IG and made a vacation group chat. On the car ride home they dm each other sending photos they took etc but F4 doesn’t chat really. We go back home and by night time I realize I can’t stop thinking about F4, a feeling I’ve never had before. I’ve had small crushes in school and stuff but F4 is literally keeping me up all night thinking about her. I miss her already. I start to have thoughts about her (nothing sexual, which is weird for 16) like talking hanging out holding hands etc even though we barely talked throughout the trip. I think about her smile and how nice and perfect she was and by then I figure out maybe I love her?. I can’t stop thinking about her and I’ve never felt this way I want to dm her but I’m way too nervous and I’m not even sure what I’m feeling rn. I never felt this way before so I guess I’m in love? What should I do? Ignore the group chat? Message her privately? I really don’t know but I do know that I probably missed my chance since I didn’t realize what I felt till after the trip and my darn anxiety. I probably won’t see her until next vacation (maybe a couple years) she also lives in a different state. Not sure what I’m feeling or what to do about it.

I know I am not going to need a charger for a laptop from 2005. I know I am not going to need 30 cell phone charger bricks. I know I am not going to need the lotions people have gifted me at Christmas. My family was middle class and we always had what we needed until my parents got divorced. There was times where we would go without even on things we needed because my mother couldn't raise two kids on her income. It basically became a thing to only get rid of something if you can't fix it at all because you may need it in the future. I make just enough for my bills and have no savings so that concept kind of carried into adulthood.

632,"I recently got a job in a fast food restaurant and I’d noticed one of the cooks always smiles at me in a super creepy way but I didn’t think too much of it. Anyway a couple of nights ago I was getting ready to leave and he starts talking to me, asking normal things, like when I’m next working etc but then he tells me I look like his ex second wife, he then shows me pictures of his two previous wives and they were like super young, he said one of them was 19 and he looks at least 45 if not 50, I suppose that might be considered normal where he’s from which I assume is India or a neighbouring country. I find it tricky to understand his accent and I think he doesn’t really understand a lot of what I’m saying and so when he showed me these pictures I just said that the dresses were pretty, they were like Indian wedding dresses, and then he starts saying that his friend is coming over from whatever country he’s from and he will get him to bring me one of these dresses and then asks me what size I am, since I’m never really certain of what he’s saying I just answered his question and said ‘oh uh small?’ and then I finally left to go home and whilst I was walking out this older woman who works there told me that he was making another girl my age(17) feel uncomfortable because he asked if he could get the bus home with her. Anyway I was working earlier today and as I was leaving he starts talking to me and says that he’s spoken to his friend and he’s bringing me the dress, I don’t really reply I just do a polite smile because I really don’t want to be rude since it’s my first job and I’m really not a confrontational person but what am I supposed to do if he brings me an Indian wedding dress?! I don’t know if I should report it to the manger because one boy I work with said he’s a bit of a creep too and I think they might just get rid of me because a cooks more essential than someone new who’s just serving customers.

634,"I know that I'm a terrible person, so please don't roast me or berate me. About three days ago my parents filed for bankruptcy, and I feel really guilty because I know that I made my parents bankrupt.

Last year, I really struggled with school. I needed a tutor for pre-calc, physics, and SAT/ACT stuff. My parents found a really expensive tutor, and I still didn't do well on the standardized tests. All the tutoring cost close to $10,000, and I can't believe I'm such a burden on my parents. It would have been much better if I just failed school (at least my parents wouldn't have to spend all that money on me), or if I studied 24/7 and just used Khan academy. I know my parents wanted me to do well in school and they knew I was struggling; however, it's still my fault they spent all that money. I totally should have just done stats and environmental science last year, because they say those are super easy.

They also spent a lot of money on my extracurriculars. This included money on private piano lessons and expensive tuition for my swim classes. Oh, and not to mention the gas money on transporting me and the times my mom just bought fast food when she was too tired to cook after picking me up.

They also constantly spend money on me. I kind of feel guilty about it, but I try to justify it by convincing myself that what they buy for me is a necessity. They bought clothes and food for me, and paid for all the school supplies I use. 

I just feel terrible about myself. I can't believe I made my parents bankrupt. They fight about finances every day, and I feel terrible about it. 

My plan is to get a job and pay them back. My district requires students to take a math and science course every year, so I will just take statistics and environmental science next year. I'm going to quit all my extracurriculars, and see if we can get food from a local food pantry and get clothes from a thrift store or something.",02Aug2020,1
636,"&gt;Okay, so the title is a massive simplification, there goes a lot behind it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Around a year ago the relationship with the girl I thought I was going to marry ended, with parts of me dying together with that relationship. (I promise this will be relevant)  
&gt;  
&gt;I was afraid that I would never start caring/loving for someone the way I did for her.  
&gt;  
&gt;For hopefully easier reading I'll be known as Me (Duh), my friend as L and the girl we're in love with F.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Me and L were talking about the olden days at school, and about people we met there, including F.  
&gt;  
&gt;We both send her a message and we started hanging out again, It didn't take me long for feelings to develop, and I noticed that, the feeling I mentioned earlier came back, happy me! But no.  
&gt;  
&gt;My friend tells me he is starting to feel the same, except with his past, he tries to supress it.  
&gt;  
&gt;So at this point we now know eachother's feelings towards F.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eventually we even tell her, because we didn't want to ruin the friendship or anything, so we were like; Might as well tell her, so she knows what's up.  
&gt;  
&gt;She has been single for a while, and because of that she's very carefull and told us there weren't any mutual feelings, although she mentioned she considered L and thought about a possible relationship, but she wasn't sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most important thing my friend and I agreed on is that we won't let her ruin our friendship, and we do try preventing this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last weekend me and L went out for drinks, and his feelings came up. He told me I deserve it more, because he doesn't know what proper love is (his words, not mine) and because I had it, I deserve it more.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I think, exactly for that same reason, that he never had it before, he deserves it more, because he deserves it to feel it.  
&gt;  
&gt;He also thinks I deserve it because he was told, that if one of his other female friend becomes single, they would become fuckbuddies, his reasoning being; If i agree on these things even though I like her, means I don't deserve her.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I think, feelings are feelings, they are there and you can't deny them, no matter what.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also right now I'm on the point of pushing my own feelings away, simply because I think he deserves it more.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I am really at a lost of thoughts and I hope someone can give me some unbiased advice and I'm willing to awnser any questions.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;TL:DR Best friend and I both in love with the same girl, both think the other deserves it more.

638,"Here are my(23F) thoughts and pros and cons on getting an apartment and living there part of the week. I currently live with my 63 yo mom and 19 yo sister. I want to move out because my sister is super judgmental and mean. I have anxiety and although I'm on medication and in counseling she really gets to me and even has put me into a panic attack. My mom is disabled and while I am happly to help with things she can't do, she frequently asks me for unreasonable things(going to the store at we0 pm for icecream, typing emails for her so she doesn't have to). I have a 2 year old daughter that I have from Wednesday night to Sunday afternoon. Her dad is kind of crazy so I wouldn't want him know I had an apartment where I was alone. Because of this, I would probably go back to the house after picking up my daughter and leave after her dad picked her up.

Cons:
1. My mom is partially disabled(she struggles to walk and has back and hip issues that can't be fixed). I don't want to leave her with my sister because my sister is lazy and doesn't help her a lot. Not to mention she makes her feel bad for asking for help.
2. A little less money in savings for when I can afford a house.
3. My sister will probably harass me over it. She can't understand that she's really hard to deal with. 
4. Because of 3. my sister will probably stop watching my daughter while I work from home out of spite. I could probably make it work but it's part of the reason why I don't leave altogether.
5. I'd have to bring clothes back and forth or have 2 sets.
6. I feel guilting for wanting to escape my family.

Pros:
1. I'd have a place to relax without the judgment of my sister or stress of my mom.
2. I can have my boyfriend over without worrying about my family judging him.
3. I'm genderfluid so I wouldn't feel weird when dressing differently and not worrying about questions from my family. (They are completely accepting of LGBT+ people but I feel like it's something I do for me and don't want to deal with awkward questions).
4. I would get a break from cleaning the huge house.
5. I could decorate however I want.
6. I could have friends over for game nights (after COVID stops ruining everything).

Has anyone done something similar to this? Lived in two places at once for whatever reason? I'm seriously considering it. The biggest hurdle is judgment from my family.",02Aug2020,1

644,"A background on my mother: she was emotionally neglected by her own mother, and as a result developed tendencies which I can only describe as narcissistic or borderline. She refuses to be criticized in any way, and by that I mean she will start rambling on about how much she was hurt in childhood, how terrible her life is, and then start guilting you by saying you are hurting or torturing her in some way. She is a severely emotionally abusive and manipulative person, who also used to be very physically abusive. One of my strongest memories of her was her threatening to kill herself to intimidate my father. She has threatened to kill me multiple times and threatens to hurt me very often, but I think they are just jokes for her.

No one is really aware of the extent of abuse my brother and I faced in early childhood. My brother would get beat till he was on the floor and she would still continue. To give an idea of how bad it was for him and I, she has beat him till the point in which her own hand was bruised and sore for long periods of time. I was not spared from it as well, though my brother was treated worse physically.

My life has gotten better. But today it has all fallen apart. I went insane for about 10 minutes because of her. Basically, she was rambling on and on about my grandmother to me, and how hurt she was, how horrid her life is. She had been abusing my grandmother, and to hear her deflect, deny and justify her elder abuse was so irritating to me I tried to reason with her, to get her to see the errors of her ways. She started guilting me again, saying that in my eyes, she is just a slave to work for the family, and that she should be mistreated by my grandmother. These assumptions are all not true.

I couldn't stand it, and so I went up, grabbed the keys and tried to leave for a walk. She got extremely angry, yelled, ran forward and grabbed me, wrestling the keys from my hand. Idk why but that action terrified me, coupled with the fact that she started to say 'YOU WANT ME TO DIE. YOU WANT ME TO DIE.' I started yelling 'no no no' and 'stop, stop stop' again and again. She wouldn't stop. This is when my dad ran out and yelled at her, screaming at her that she is a crazy bitch. She lost it. She started yelling: 'I'll kill you' or something similar, and then started beating herself up. Literally. This terrified me. I was so fucking afraid for both myself and I. I couldn't stop stammering stop and no, like a cornered child. I'm 15,almost 16.

647,"I've been working in this store since the first week of June, and have 2 weeks left since I only work here for the summer. Last week he brought me into his office and told me that everyone has been complaining, that I don't do what I'm supposed to do. I feel like I have not really been portrayed in a fair light because what they have been complaining about are things that I have in fact been doing, or they just look at the remaining boxes of items that I have yet to stock the shelves with and think I've just been sitting there, instead of considering all the customers and the fact that I have barely been able to leave the register. This was not really his main problem with me though. 

He told me that they have been talking about me and comparing me to a ""ghost"", because I come there 5 minutes before, and I'm very quick to leave ... when my shift is over and I've been there for 7 to 8 hours.. He said I'm not giving enough initiative and that I just come there, work, get my money and leave, as if that's a bad thing. Last time I checked, I was hired to do a paid job, not to be another member of their ""gang"".  I'm 22 and they're all 20-30+ year older than me, and I have TRIED to get to know them but they have not been welcoming or including and have basically just ignored me. They've given me rude remarks, I've overheard someone say something mean about me before and one of them shouted me out in front of 20+ customers because I asked a second time if someone could come to the other register (the line went all the way to the back of the store and there was so much noise I thought maybe no one heard me). I learned quickly that these people weren't interested in getting to know me, so I naturally distanced myself from them. He and his assistant constantly give me shit for only being there 5 minutes early, and say I should at least be there 15-20 minutes before. Not because there's something important related to my work that I have to do before we start, just so that I can sit there while they all drink coffee and smoke and talk to each other and completely ignore me. The times I've tried to be a part of the conversation I only get short answers, sometimes they just look at me like I'm from a different planet and then keep talking to each other while I just sit there.. uncomfortable. The only times they've asked me questions about myself is about physical things about me .. like making comments (multiple times) on why I wear leggings under my work pants (they are way too big and I feel more comfortable wearing something that doesn't fall down underneath .. and yes I have said multiple times that the pants they gave me were too big) and then comment on how I'm not wearing them when I don't .... all I'm thinking is; why are you all looking at my feet? My point is, they don't include me, and if they ask me something about myself its usually uncomfortable questions about my physical appearance. My assistant once took me to the side and asked me why I go to the bathroom, because according to her I went to the bathroom A LOT, which is an exaggeration and I only go in my breaks anyways so why does she have to know. I have to go to the bathroom when I have anxiety which is all the time because of these people. I'm at a point where I feel bullied and cry every day after work because all I get is criticism, often uncalled for, and I'm never given positive feedback when I do things well. It's also extremely uncomfortable to be around people who don't like me.

He told me that if I don't get it together and give more initiative these next weeks and try to be a part of the ""gang"", he would be ""honest"" with my next employer if they decided to contact him. I told him I felt uncomfortable trying to be part of the group and then he just said ""TRY, we don't bite.."" .... So, instead of just trying to include me and make me feel welcome, he has threatened me to be part of the group, all of whom I now know have been talking shit about me behind my back and comparing me to a ghost. It's one thing to criticise me for doing something wrong, but this feels like a direct attack on my personality. I am naturally quiet and reserved, but can be really outgoing if I feel comfortable. However, I feel so disliked and excluded that just thinking about sharing my lunch break with them makes me want to cry. This is also my first full-time job and I have never worked in a store before.

Today, I randomly woke up with this overwhelming sense of nostalgia which I haven't had all summer since end of school in spring. I felt sweet for the memories I had and bitter in the sense that they were gone. But it wasn't just the memories that I missed - it was the feeling of love and content I experienced with my friends and coach and team for the past 3 years. It made me sad to think it was all gone. And I know that college will have its own experiences - most likely even better but I can't get over that Nostalgic feeling. I'm also confused why it came out of nowhere !

I have been at my mom’s house for a couple days and every morning (7-10 am) she will just be slamming doors, singing music, stomping(we live in apartments up stairs) and obviously doesn’t care for others, like her neighbors.

Well because of my insomnia, I am unable to fall asleep before 3 am on a good night, 8 am on bad night. I have told her that if I was to do the same at 1 am she would be FUCKING PISSED, and I would probably be kicked out of the house for a bit.

Today when she woke me up, she was stomping and throwing laundry basket on the floor for some reason. I told her I didn’t fall asleep until 4 am last night, she says “well that’s not my fucking problem.” And then continued to scream saying she never gets alone time, so I continued and said I am leaving today then, you can do whatever you please, said “ that not it, that’s not even the beginning of it, I am so fucking stressed out rn. You do not even understand anything”

During these past few weeks, I’ve constantly messaged my cousins and asked for updates on my uncle to show some support, but I don’t know if it’s better to just let them grieve on their own now that he’s gone, and there isn’t really anything to be updated on.

655,"Hey guys,

So I’m at a real loss in life. I’m 32 and am from the UK. I’ve lived in Spain for the past 9 years since graduating with a BA in Spanish and German, and have been working as a self-employed translator here. The money is ok, although being self-employed it’s quite difficult to take time off and really disconnect.

I came out of the closet about 3 years ago and have been dating a guy for about 9 months. It’s been a bit of a rocky relationship – he’s 40 and it’s his first relationship and he’s left me three times over that period saying something is missing and our relationship isn’t what he imagines a relationship to be like. Now we’ve just come back from a holiday to the beach (I had to take my laptop to keep on top of emails). I sometimes feel like the energy between us is off – like he never really seems that enthusiastic about anything in life, including his job, and sometimes randomly goes quiet during meals out.

So, for the past 6-7 years, I’ve been dying to study medicine as a mature student, but have put it off out of fear. It would mean moving back to the UK and really stepping into the unknown (a lengthy admissions process, probably being rejected at least the first time, and possibly more, etc.).

Now I’m at this stage where I’m completely lost. Like my life is pretty ok and I live quite well. However, I have this voice inside me which is like you’re not fulfilling even half of your potential. It’s like I’ve settled into a life which is fine but not excellent at 32 and this will be my life forever. I feel like I was super motivated and driven at university and that my best days are in my past.

Do you guys think I should just have the balls to dump my boyfriend, leave Spain, do medicine and stop overthinking things?

As I say, I’m at a real loss and don’t know if I’m just being spoilt and will regret it once I’ve left.

Any advice would be much appreciated!!",02Aug2020,1

663,"A throwaway because I really don't want any details of my abuse getting out to people ik irl. 

I was raped at 13 by a guy I used to be best friends with and it triggered a delayed recall of abuse I experienced when I was a child. Ever since then I've found that I'm incapable of developing crushes on people - I'm not asexual or anything I definitely feel sexual attraction to people and I can acknowledge when people are attractive but I just cannot get that ""crush"" feeling anymore. I remember that I definitely crushed on people before my assault but afterwards its like I'm completely numb and incapable. I think it's a symptom of self hatred or a coping mechanism but I really don't know.

Fast forward a few shitty years and I'm 16 (17 at the end of this month) now and I feel left behind and pretty much underdeveloped.

Most of my friends have ""done stuff"" (as they would say lol) and dated and whatever and I understand the argument of ""everyone does stuff at their own pace"" but I feel like not even having a crush on anyone at all for someone who is almost an adult is just downright weird. Every time my family and friends pry about my love life I feel even a little guilty because I can't even do the whole ""well I have a crush"" thing and I can tell that (my family in particular) they are almost disappointed in me. What  16 year old doesn't even have a crush? For like almost 4 years running now? 

Well god must of answered my prayers (I don't believe but this really has made me question) because I'm pretty sure I have a crush? Like heart beating really fast tacky tween shit.

It feels fucking uncomfortable 😂.

I've been friends with this boy for like 2-3 years now and I always thought he was good looking but over lock down we became alot closer (mainly playing video games together and having alot more time to hang out bc no school - yes we have been social distancing and wearing masks blah blah) and I started to like him more than just a friend and the whole concept is just foreign to me. This isn't the only boy I'm close with or anything so it's not like I haven't had crushes before because I've never really talked to boys. I feel super comfortable around him and I even opened up to him about my assault but I just don't know how to approach the idea of confessing my feelings. It really came to ahead when I had a *dream* about him (which made me feel super uncomfortable thanks subconscious) and I've never had any dreams like that before at all (and hopefully never again).

On the one hand, I'm scared. Survivors often disscuss how they end up in abusive relationships because they unknowingly route out people who resemble their abuser. On the other hand, I really want this to work out - I mean isn't this what I was hoping for? I've known him for a while and he's so nice and trustworthy and his exs (one of whom is my friend dw I got her blessing and everything) said that he's a little clingy but super nice and respectful. I don't know?

I'm not sure I even want a relationship? I'm not sure he wants a relationship? But I feel like if I tell him how I feel and he turns me down I can maybe move on? I consider just having a crush a milestone so confessing my feelings to someone would really make me feel like I'm making progress...

Heres the thing though. I want to have sex with him like, alot. It makes me really uncomfortable because usually I avoid sex like the plague. Maybe having sex would help or would it make me feel worse? 

I think I'm asking for advice on how to confess my feelings and also advice on how to get over my fears. I used to go to therapy when I was at school (school therapist) but because of lock down it's not really an option anymore...

It became so frequent, I know the time when she would do it. If she dosen't have work, she would masturbate randomly during the day as long as she has her blanket. If she has work however she masturbates late at night and early in the morning and I have a hard time sleeping due to it.

671,"TW: Mentions of Violence.
Throwaway account.

Okay, this sounds bad from the get go but hear me out okay. I have a younger sister who’s always been the problem child behaviour wise. She’s a very academically bright and athletic student but since she was a baby, she’s had massive anger issue. Her issues started from throwing fits as a child over bare minimum issues to full out violence now. Whenever she’s denied something she demands or a situation doesn’t go her way, she goes into fits of blinding rage. She’ll throw things around, get physically violent which ranges from throwing things at us to physically attacking us. She threatens to stab herself or fatally physically wound herself when we don’t respond to her rage anymore. 

Sadly, my parents have given up on parenting her and expect my brother and I to step up each time she goes off which is almost every day. I have a sister younger than her who bears a good chunk of her violence as us elders are able to fight her off but we rush to her rescue. I’ve exhausted all means of getting her to change her behaviour. I’ve gone to polar ends of the spectrum but nothing works so far. I’ve tried talking to her, I’ve tried to limit her play time, I’ve tried taking away her gadgets but I’ve never physically tried to discipline her. 

Another point is that rage runs in the family. I had issues, I worked through them. My brother had them, he’s worked them out. My parents did too so we understand exactly what she’s going through but hers are very extreme, none of us physically harmed anyone or ourselves when we had our respective problems so I suggested my parents to take her to therapy and now they’re upset at me for suggesting my sister might have mental issues.

674,"Caught friends mom cheating. What do I do.

Now to provide a little backstory my friend(let’s call him Alex) has two parents that run a business as well as well as both being realtors. 
This summer they decided to host a work camp where Me, Alex and two other friends go hand out flyers in our community, Alex’s mom is paying us $10 an hour.

Now a few things to note is that we hand out flyers in the neighbourhood different to hours so we have to take a 10 to 20 minute drive to get there, because we live in North America the driver Seat is on the left side. 
Now one of our work camp members was not participating this particular day so to accommodate to the new seating arrangement I sat on the left side closest to the trunk, so I was in the seat right behind Alec’s‘s mom.

After doing our work camp for about an hour we started to get back in the car and because I was sitting behind her I was in the optimal looking over shoulder spot.

It was a really warm day that morning so I was really sweaty and uncomfortable while in the car seat 
 So I was just looking around at the surrounding trees and houses and as I moved my head from looking out the right side window to the left I saw what looked like a picture of an undressed man in her phone so I double tracked and looked at her phone from my spot.

And sure enough it was a picture of a young looking guy I. The mirror taking a selfie so at this point I’m kinda freaking out because of what I just saw but I decided I should figure out of much of the story as possible.

So while we(three teenage boys) were sitting in a tiny Volkswagen Beetle in 32 degree Celsius weather sweating our asses of I see a semi naked man on Alex’s moms phone.
As she exits the photo I see in the bottom right corner of the screen the tinder logo( one thing to note is that Alex’s parents are married and about the happiest couple I think I know),so I’m almost mad and in disbelief right at that moment about what I’m seeing but I managed to see a few messages one which stuck out to me the most was from Alex’s mom to the contact named Scott saying “ good morning baby *kissy face*”.

And I saw what looked like the outline of a photo sent by Alex’s mom to “Scott”
And other single words along with kiss,heart and other such emojis.
 
Now after looking at that conversation and image for about a total of 10 seconds Alex’s mom puts the phone away and I can no longer see the messages and she starts driving back to Alex’s house.

This is where my story ends after that we played dnd and then went swimming at another friends house all the while I was thinking about this.

It has since been almost a week I will be at the work camp this next Monday and will see Alex and his mom there.

Now I’m just wondering what to do. it’s been hard not to say anything to anyone and I don’t know what to do in this situation. It was definitely on tinder which leads me to believe that it was not a one time thing. But I need to know what to do.

675,"You can mute people on Instagram. They will keep posting as they normally would, but you won’t see it on your feed, unless you unmute them. I really want to learn how to do that in real life.

I know some people who can do this. In discussions, they will be physically present, but they won’t be listening unless they think something is important.

My mother is really good at this. There are times when she’ll be in a discussion, 5-10 minutes will be spent on one topic, and she’ll have no idea what was said in those 5-10 minutes. That never happens with topics my mom thinks are important.

Some people would say this is rude, and it probably is rude to a certain extent, but I think it could be really useful.

I probably could do this with headphones, but I think that's too bold and rude.

For example, it’s 10AM and I’m already annoyed by having heard a ridiculously frustrating discussion at the breakfast table. If I could learn how to go ""oh it's that topic... let me turn my attention off now.""

So I want to learn this skill. A lot of things people say are absurdly uninteresting, but I cannot zone out even if I try to. Sometimes, topics can even be frustrating to listen to. Do you have any advice on learning how to zone out?

I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to render the idea of consciously zoning out of discussions. If this has a name and if there are articles written about it, sending me off to a good video/article would also be helpful.

681,"So two years ago I began working at this upscale grocery store in the 
Health/Beauty department...

it was great, until about one year later myself and another coworker were moved into the Grocery department because that's where hours were needed.

The manager there was the complete opposite of the woman that managed Health+Beauty... this guy was my age (late 20's), and was insensitive, never showed appreciation or encouragement, literally always serious with me, never said hello to anyone... clearly an emotionally unhealthy person. I'm the opposite of all that, so you can imagine we clashed a lot.

So my time in Health+Beauty, one full year, I was never was written up and never had any conflict with management... 

I was in Grocery for 8 months and written up 4 times, and fired... 

This Grocery manager, let's call him Shane, would micromanage and constantly get on me for the most minor of things... 

I would politely tell him via email how much this stresses me out since I'm a sensitive person... 

His response to that would be to be calm and sensitive for one day, and then revert back to his harsh intense demeanor...

he actually amped up his intensity and would be even more overbearing on me, and before I knew it I was called in for a writeup... 

1) didn't organize the aisles perfectly...

2) I didn't clean the shelf strips how he wanted... I thought he meant sanitize them, when apparently he meant to clean off the sticker residue and to him it's a ""black and white issue""

3) He also loosely manages health/beauty and wrote me up for not fully working backstock, like excess product we keep in the warehouse. The assistant manager never said it was wrong to work backstock this way.

4) After two months of adapting once again, being completely focused and working with all my heart, he wrote me up for missing literally two items in backstock... this was a week where I was tasked with working like five literal times more backstock than usual because we were short-handed... i remember it being like 100 degrees back there and climbing up in these bays and i just missed two items in the back.

And then, I was fired.

***** The greatest injustice is that ALL of these writeups were during times where I was very distraught, stressed out due to Shawn being so intense with me... 

he made me feel like I was always walking on eggshells. He doesn't see that he could be an efficient manager and still be gentle hearted and uplifting and encouraging.

I told Shawn numerous times all year long how it's a very tough time outside of work. I cried at work numerous times due to Shawn's intense behavior... even aside from that, his write ups were not fair.

Around my second writeup I had a strong feeling that Shawn was already planning to fire me through these unjust writeups... 

I told HR and emailed regional HR a very thorough detailed statement to undo these writeups, and she told me she was unbiased yet did not remove any of them.

I built such a strong case for myself and store management and local HR, even Shawn told me that they are not wanting to fire me, but they did...

They gave me such a stronger level of scrutinization, and anybody would be fired if they received my level of scrutiny...

I corrected myself every time after each writeup, and they found something else to write me up for that was so minor.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough and they were going to fire me eventually. I believe they all conspired to do this.

Shawn wanted me out. I was the odd guy out who was a gentle-hearted person. They want the opposite, like a military mindset.  I was outstanding with customer service and progressed by leaps and bounds after each writeup and it was always overlooked how much stress Shawn put me through.

683,"TLDR: ‘best friend’ I have supported for two years has been distant for some time, possibly engaging in an affair with my ex gf after sending mixed messages about his sexuality. 

I suspect this ‘friend’ has slept with an ex gf of mine who has a longterm boyfriend. Now, I don’t care who she sleeps with because it ended a long time ago. BUT this friend of mine has been distant towards me despite all the support I have given him through his mental health struggles. 

During lockdown he said he missed me but then cancels every time we are supposed to hang out. He sent me a partial nude in the bath in May (the sort a girl would send a boy) and has repeatedly done other things that would lead me to believe there was an attraction there.

The next second though he acts like I don’t exist. I know he speaks to this ex of mine and and she has tried to sleep with him in the past. He has said repeatedly he would never get with her but my gut is telling me he did a couple of days ago. She always posts photos of who she’s with but didn’t this time during a bbq. There a lot of signs that make me think he slept with her. If he did, and has lied to my face and let me support him and show empathy as he claimed it was mental illness making him distant, I would be unbelievably angry and feel betrayed.

I really hope I’m wrong about this. Will provide more details if necessary.

What should I do??",02Aug2020,1
684,We were friends since birth as our parents were great friends and we considered each other to be our best friend. We saw each other regularly every weekend and walked to school together but he slowly wanted to do it less until we stopped all together. I stupidly assumed it was because of his new girlfriend and that he would prefer to spend his weekends with her. Since lock down started we've only briefly spoke once and my Nan was worried about our friendship so she went to his house and asked what had happened. He replied that I had been verbally bullying him. When she told me on the phone what he had said I was confused but as soon as I put down the phone I couldn't stop crying. So many memory's of things I've said to him that I thought were jokes or he wouldn't take offence to I now realize were just plain mean. I'm disappointed that I didn't notice what I had been saying was wrong and even more so since I was supposed to be one if his closest friends. I even realized before that some of what I said was mean but didn't apologize for no reason. I feel selfish and stupid and wish I could've noticed sooner. I want to make up for it and fix things but I don't know how or if I even can. Any help or opinions would be greatly appreciated.,02Aug2020,1

692,"I'm a 23 year old from Colombia, I'm currently living here waiting to finish my colloge degree to move to Spain with my Girlfriend, or at least that was the plan. We have been together for 2 years now, one year in Colombia and one year in Spain. 
So I was working in Spain (internship) , and I was waiting for a plane ticket to come back home, because of the coronavirus i couldn't get a regular plane ticket. So on June 15 when I finished my internship, I went to my girlfriend's house, while I was waiting for the ticket.
So when I got there, I saw her texting with a guy I didn't knew a lot, on a daily baisis. So after a couple of weeks, I asked her who he was, and she told me it was an old friend from school, and that he was gay. So I didn't have to worry about anything. The thing was that he was saved with the name of her male best friend. So I thought that was a big fucking coincidence, because she lives in a small town of 40 thousand people and her best friend is also gay, but I believed her because she never gave me any reason to suspect. 
So a week passed, and I went to my girlfriend's family restaurant/bar to celebrate her graduation from university, all her family was there, and a couple of regular costumers of the bar. One the costumers is a really good friend with all his family and specially his mom. So I girlfriend introduced him to me and I saw he had a really distinctive tattoo in his forearm. A couple of days later, I was really I was thinking a lot about the guy she kept texting, because like I said before it was a really fucking big coincidence. So one night when she was sleeping I went through her conversation with his friend. I didn't see anything compromising, like nudes or love messages anything like that. But the guy kept sending my girlfriend a lot, but a lot of shirtless photos, and for my surprise, her gay friend that she kept texting and the guy I met and the bar had the same tattoo. I confronted her and she told me they weren't the same guy, she swore it to me. So I let it pass for the day because the fight was getting really big, like shouting and stuff. 
A day later or two, I was really fucking thinking about that guy I met and the bar, and there it hit me, I remembered my girlfriend telling me a long time ago, that her ex boyfriend always went to his family's restaurant, and he always tried to hit on her.
So I confronted her again, and this time she got really mad, so I left that topic go for a couple of days again. 
But something didn't feel right with me, so one week later I was kind of tipsy on the beach, and I went to to talk to her about that. She was getting mad again, but I got madder, because I told her the my suspicions and she wasn't answering me any of my doubts. After 5 minutes of a really heated discussion, she confirms all my doubts. His friend that she kept talking to all day, that she had saved on her phone as his best friend, is the same guy I met in the family dinner, and that guy is her ex.
So I got really mad really mad, I almost broke up with her. But the thing is she as always told me that if we break up she always wants to stay friends, because she doesn't like to lose people that are important to her, and I always understand that, because she has a really fucked up family situation. 
So she tells me that that is the reason why they talk, that they were friends since the age of 12, that they only dated for one year. But the problem is that they broke up because my girlfriend's ex was being unfaithful with my girlfriend's best friend. So I don't understand how can she talk to someone that did that to her. 
So after a really long fight I end but believing her, but not completely again, so I went through her phone that night to read the conversation. It was really really long and I read it like for and hour and a half, and never found any incriminating text, just regular really friendly texts, and the shirtless photos were always random, without any text attached. So I was calmer because I didn't thought that she was being unfaithful. So we left the problem there because she promised me that they were not gonna talk anymore , or so I thought. 
So all of that was one month ago, and one week ago I got to Colombia, because I have to finish my last semester. Three days ago I was checking her photos, via Google Photos, because I wanted to put a photo in Instagram and we always took the pictures with her phone, and I saw a screenshot of a conversation of my girlfriend with his ex, two days after I left. In which the ex was telling my girlfriend that he is still in love with her, and my girlfriend telling that she doesn't want to talk to him anymore because it messes up her mind, but they were also a couple of photos he send her a day later. So that means they kept talking. I asked my girlfriend about it last night, and she swore to me that they aren't gonna talk anymore, that he messaged her after I left and that was it 
So I don't know what to do, because I really fucking love my girlfriend, but we are gonna be apart for at least 6 months or 1 year depending on somethings, and I don't know if I can't trust her anymore, because of all the lies. The thing is I don't want to break up, but I don't want to move to another country to find out my girlfriend is being unfaithful.
Any advice is appreciated.

697,"\- trigger/rape warning-

I'm doing a postgraduate course at the same university that I did an undergraduate degree at.

Before starting my undergraduate degree, I had a traumatic experience at the end of a date. I hesitate to call it rape - for a long time I thought it was just a misunderstanding or I blamed myself for not fighting back - but hindsight has made me realise what it was. I've never reported the incident. 

A year or so ago, I tried to get over the experience by dating - admittedly for only two weeks - a guy from my university, we'll call him B. I thought that if I could force myself to 'get over' the trauma, that I'd be okay. That wasn't the case. B seemed like a sweet, safe option. But I can barely remember what happened during our time together, I remember staying the night at his place, but not what we did - not because I think he did anything strange - just that whenever I think about it or see his face, I think about my rapist. I don't know why I've amalgamated those memories, my only guess is that forcing myself to get over what had happened in that way wasn't right.  I cut off the 'relationship' a few days later and told him that I wasn't in the right place mentally. He was somewhat clingy after that which only frightened me even more so I apologised and said that I needed to be left completely alone. 

For the whole of last year year, I avoided A at my university like the plague. Whenever I'd see him, it would trigger memories of my rape from before university. I know it isn't his fault - he's done nothing wrong, but I'm absolutely terrified of him. I started seeing someone new in February of this year -- he's been very patient and kind with me. So far, so good. I haven't had any of the same reactions as with A and we've taken things slow.

I've recently found out that my university is willing to fund a substantial amount of the graduate degree fee for me - that graduate course is my dream and has been my dream since getting to university. I'm hoping to live in university accommodation.  Renting privately isn't an option at this stage. 

What I'm terrified of is having to share a house or corridor with him (and therefore a kitchen, shower etc.). I know he's done absolutely nothing wrong. But I can't help but be frightened of him as whenever I see him I remember my rapist. They don't even look alike, but I'm still get a visceral reaction of terror. I am working through this and getting better.  I will have to see A next year as he is still going to be a student there. I can cope with that now - I'm better than I was a few months ago, but I don't know if I can live with him.

I go to a UK university with different 'colleges', and A is in the same 'college' as me, these provide the accommodation. There are probably around ten graduate houses. Would it be wrong of me to write to someone in the university and asked not to be put near A? Just in a different house - I think they're usually allocated randomly. Am I being too entitled or dramatic? I don't want A to be seen in a negative light, as this is completely on me. But I don't want to drop out of my course because of this.",02Aug2020,1
698,"so i have a fairly small friend group, it’s me, A, F, and K. A and i have been best friends since kindergarten, and we became friends with F and K in middle school. now we’re in high school, and A kinda has her own other friend group, but we’re still all friends. 

it kinda changed last year, A started hanging out more with a different friend group and kinda hung out with them a LOT more than us. i really didn’t mind i guess, because i want her to be happy yk, but i think it really bothered F and K. 

another thing was A would never text in the groupchat, so K i think made a separate one with just F, K, and i. at first we didn’t text too much in that one, but eventually it became the main one we used. i’ve tried so many times to get them to text in the groupchat with all 4 of us, but every time we finish texting, they all go back to the second one. 

it kinda reached a peak last week. so A texting in the groupchat (which we haven’t texted in for months at this point) and asked how we were doing and if we wanted to hang out. our schedules weren’t really all free until the next week, so that’s when we decided to hang out. we were planning on going to an outdoor plaza in our neighborhood. 

but then F texted in the second groupchat and asked if we wanted to go to that plaza sooner. i thought that was absolutely stupid if we were gonna go later, so i made an excuse and said no. but F and K still went. then today i texted in the groupchat with all of us and asked if we were still good to go to the plaza. F responded by saying that she went last week. 

that pissed me off, like you knew we were gonna go, and you were still gonna go with everyone but A? that’s just an absolute asshole move. 

but i’m not sure where to go from here. i don’t think it’d be best to tell A, she doesn’t have the most confrontational personality, but i don’t wanna start a war. on the other hand, i feel like she deserves to know that some of her friends are being dicks.

The other part of me is feeling well about myself because I was able to make it before the deadline and I scored pretty well on my second try! So even if it took me longer, I did it with a good score that could possibly be higher than those who passed it from the first try.

707,"I feel a little stupid posting this, but this is my first relationship and I don’t really know what I’m doing. 

We’ve been together for a year, and that year has been relatively fun. She’s funny and attractive, and she thinks I’m those things too. We have a bunch of inside jokes and when things are good, they’re actually good. But at times I feel like I’m walking on eggshells with her. 

She’s depressed and anxious often, which I know isn’t her fault, but taking care of her can be exhausting. I say everything I know to say to her when she’s feeling bad and it drains me so much, and when I’m upset I feel like I can’t say anything to her because she’ll get upset too. When we’re together I’ll sometimes cry from being upset about something, and she’ll take care of me, but then she’ll get unresponsive and eventually cry too because she thinks she’s the one upsetting me, which is sometimes true, but she’s so fragile I feel like I can’t be honest with her. 

There are so many things I haven’t been able to say to her, and I know I wouldn’t have the courage to say them. I feel so isolated with her, and she probably doesn’t even know it. I know that’s not her fault, I have trouble being honest and I don’t really trust people. This is really stupid, but I’m even worried she’s trying to manipulate me, which is stupidly far fetched, but it’s an actual fear of mine. 

Here’s the part that makes this most difficult: she basically has no supporter but me. If she’s crying, I’m there for her, and you can count on me being the only one she can talk to. Her mom is a bigoted asshole and shuns people who express their emotions, and her father doesn’t understand mental health problems to the extent of thinking she’ll just “get over it”. She has some friends, but I doubt she’ll open up to them as much as she has to me. When we break up, I don’t really want contact with her anymore, but I’m worried she’d hurt herself or worse without me. 

She’s self harmed in the past, and she’s done it about four or five times throughout our relationship, but as of recently she hasn’t. She’s definitely suicidal, or at least was in the past. She even told me that if we hadn’t met when we did, she’d be dead by now. I know it’s not my responsibility to make her happy, but the idea of her committing suicide because of me is daunting. And even if we do keep contact, I feel like it’d be a little awkward talking to her as a friend when she knows me the way a lover does. 

And how does a person even break up with their partner anyway? Through text seems ideal since in person seems so awkward, but people act like it’s the worst way ever. I feel like a FaceTime call would be best, but that’s still super awkward and I wouldn’t know when to bring it up. And like I said, in person seems so awkward, especially since she lives in a different city so we have to drive long distance to see each other. If I say I want to break up when we first see each other then we have to spend an entire weekend together in an awkward state, but if I say it at the end of the weekend when one of us goes back home then it’d be like an ordinary, romantic weekend crashing down to nothing. 

I still feel stupid for this post, but if anyone read this entire thing than thank you, I know it was longer than it probably should be. I’d appreciate any advice.",02Aug2020,1

Fast-forward to now that I’m just an HS Graduate but yet I make enough to help out with my family. He’s always been very critical but proud of me since I’ve landed a good job with good employers and benefits. He was really rooting for me and calling me frequently to check up on me and give me advice. He keeps on reminding me to save up to continue my studies and aim higher etc. 

But I’m pregnant. And I want to keep it, And I know that he’d disown me or at least cut off communication with me so I’ve been holding off telling him. On the 3rd month mark, my boyfriend (who my dad really dislikes btw) told his side of the family and it was great since I’ve been on lockdown with them and they could not be more supportive or caring. But they are pressuring me to tell my dad so they could collectively plan for the baby together. 

I just feel so lost, I’ve only just made it he’s only this proud of me now. And now I’ll have to disappoint him.

About 6 months ago I was raped by my girlfriend(f23) now ex girlfriend and since that day I've been coping really bad, I've developed ptsd and depression and I can't sleep. I'm constantly thinking of her and of what happened and I'm currently having therapy. So 2 weeks after it happened I told my best friend about it and at first I felt really relieved, she really seemed to care about it and actually wanted to help me she even texted me that night after I went home how she always would be there for me and stuff. We hang out everyday which wasn't new because we always hang out everyday prior to what had happened and it never was a problem. She wasn't in particular there for me she just kinda did what we always did and it was okay like that. It kinda bucked me to know that I couldn't call her or text her when I was having panic attacks or something has happened but I just kinda brushed it off. So about 3 weeks ago she went on vacation for 10 days and she promised to call at least once everyday to check up on me, she also promised that we would hang out way more the week after she would come back from vacation, I didn't really believed her or expected that beacuse she never holds any of her promises. So the first 2 days she called, the day after she said she was out with her parents the whole time and this was why she could call and that went on for a few days and I was kinda mad at her for not calling at least once and not really answering any of my texts so I told her that I just want to talk to her like 15min not more just 15, and she said OK and the next day she didn't call again, the day after I was at a really bad place and had suicidal thoughts so I called her she didn't answer but instead texted me that she was busy and I should stop calling her, after that I tried to take my life but my other friend saved me. I never told her that but when she came back she told me that she couldn't spend that much time with me anymore because she felt bad with having to deal with me everyday and she also wouldn't call me as much, when I said that she just straight up kinda left me in my darkest times she said that this was going on for much longer than just that. And yes we have been hanging out everyday since over a year already and it never ever was a problem she sometimes even got mad when I said that I would come a little later beacuse I wanted to spend time with my girlfriend. We've seen each other in the last 3 weeks 3times she doesn't answer my text for hours but when I asked her if we should just end the friendship she started crying and told me that she didn't wanna end it. I'm confused beacuse she also told me she didn't wanna leave me alone but she also doesn't want to spend time with me. So since a few days we don't really talk and I'm actually getting way worse than before. And we want to talk about everything tomorrow. I know that the most logical thing would to just end the friendship with her but she really isn't a bad person. I really just want my best friend back and want everything to just be like it has been before but I don't know how to tell her that without her feeling attacked or getting mad at everything I try to say to her. So can somebody please help me?",02Aug2020,1

Been married 8 years and the more the years go on the more I think my spouse and I are not a great fit.

Background: His father committed suicide 7 years ago and my husband found him. This has stayed/haunted him but my husband refuses therapy. I should mention his father was not well, I suspect he was  bipolar (not medicated) as my husband's childhood stories of his dad were not good ones.
My husband is irritable, angry, and difficult, but he does have a sweet side when he chooses to share that with me. 
We have 2 rambunctious children which don't get me wrong are blessings but tend to make him irritable and puts him in very bad mood. I'm trying to be patient and kind and model good behavior, and let him know I am here for him. But I don't think the kids and I are enough.

727,"My cousin (aged 38) is a currently dependent to my aunt due to the fact that he is suffering from mental illnesses (i'm not sure what). He was involved in a major traffic accident a few years back and now he is extremely anti social and  irresponsive to most stimuli. I haven't met him for a year or so but the last I met him although he wasn't 'normal' per se it was still possible to have conversation with him  and he was generally active. Now for most of the day he just sits and stares blankly. I never realized before this but I just went for a short getaway with my family (including said aunt and cousin) and I witnessed firsthand how physically and verbally abusive she is to him. In the morning before anyone would be awake she would be up berating him at the top of her voice and during the day although she acts nice she is very forceful with him and ties him down at times (under the pretense of her not wanting him to get hurt). She had previously seeked help for him but through religious means (rather than psychiatric) and this has exacerbated his condition ( the places he was sent to mistreated and abused him terribly the last place he was sent to apparently he was locked up in a chicken coop) but my aunt insists that the places that she's sending him to are great and are helping him. I can't say for certain but the way that my cousin stares at my aunt is different he just looks so hateful and aggressive towards her. She told my family that she had sought help from professional psychiatrists and therapists before quote ""I've met with the best doctors and they told me he can't be helped because his brain has already shrunk."" but when we inquire on what condition he is inflicted with she just veers the conversation somewhere else and when we ask why she hasn't admitted him to a psyche ward she just ignores it. I'm so worried and scared for my cousin because I don't know what she does to him behind closed doors. I'm currently 17 and don't really have or know of any means to help him.  I'm by no means am an expert on this kind of stuff but I believe that he can get better because he seems to have some semblance of his old self ( he generally remembers his direct and extended family members and when you play music that he listened to in the past he would sing) .

731,"My BF and I are 20, we've been dating for nearly 2 years. Things have been great, he treats me like gold, we never fight, we are best friends, I could go on and on. About a year and a half ago, he confessed to taking a picture of his crush without her consent, when they were 17, who had a good butt when she was wearing yoga pants in the library. I was repulsed and he seemed guilty and I moved on and hadn't thought of it since. 

It came up in conversation randomly this afternoon for the first time in 1.5 years and I asked him how long he kept this creepy pic for, assuming that he must've deleted it within a few days/weeks out of guilt. He said he probably had it for a year or so and had simply forgotten about it after a while, hence it was there for a year.  I went on a rant for 10 minutes about how perverted that is from the point of view of a feminist and how would he feel if some creep did that to me? 

He let's me use his phone/laptop whenever and I know all his passwords, so nothing like that could be there anymore. I asked him if he would ever do it again if he was single and he said ""probably not"" and I freaked and said ""probably not? You mean you still don't respect women enough to know you wouldn't"". He then explained that he hadn't consciously thought about how wrong what he did is, from a woman's point of view until last night when I went on a rant. He then said ""I wouldn't, I'm just scared to say I definitely wouldn't because how do I know I wouldn't if I haven't been single for nearly 2 years, i don't know how different I'd be without you and neither do you"". Im furious and I don't know what to do. I feel it shows a severe lack of respect to take a picture of someone for masturbation and the fact he wasn't immediately certain he would never do it again seriously upsets me. I haven't responded to him at all since last night, I'm too angry. Is this a deal breaker?",02Aug2020,1

734,"I was looking to buy a Logitech Folio Case for my Ipad. As far as I know, this product comes with a cover which has a pen holder and the keyboard. So, I looked for one on Kijiji and found a post selling it. The seller claimed that the box was sealed and brand new. 

So, we decided to meet up and he gave me the box. At this point, I should have checked the box to make sure it was sealed and exactly like he mentioned in the post, however my dumbass did not do it. I realized it a couple minutes later and decided to open the box. At this point I noticed there was no seal on the box, there was a small dent, the iPad cover (with the pencil holder) was missing, the inside box which housed  the cable was ripped. So, ultimately it was not brand new like he mentioned.

I called up the seller and he agreed to meet again and take a look. He said that he bought the cover brand new along with his iPad from another person and didn't touch it ever since. That doesn't make sense to me as the package was clearly opened, the cover was missing, there was a dent, and it was partially ripped.

So, when we did meet he kept looking inside my car, asking me what's in my bag (it was garbage), and said that I might have switched the box. Eventually he returned the money, I returned the package, and advised him to contact the person he initially bought the case from because he was clearly duped. 

Around 20 minutes later he gives me a call saying the keyboard number (I guess model number or something) was different than what was in the box and that I had switched it. I said that there was nothing switched and the box is exactly as he gave it to me. 

Then 5-10 minutes later, he messages me on Kijiji saying he talked to the previous seller to say the following: ""I checked with the guy and he gave me a sealed box, unopened. You tricked me for this and you will be punished for what you did one day"".

Patreon is a spot where you start projects and get monthly donations from users.

You can link this to discord (a chat program) making it sort of a ""pay only"" access. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I reciently started a discord channel for my patreon, and my mod and the friend who's helping me insist on creating a room for folk to share other art that is not mine. The thing is that this poeople are paying to see some of my exclusive contnent, enter raffles and such. I feel that placing a channel for people to share art that is not mine is like giving free publicity to other artists, besides that each time I see a new message on the server, it's probably gona be just somone sharing art.

Should I keep this art room for everyone to share random stuff on my server? or keep it exclusive for my stuff (which is what I want to do, I never planned this server to be a chat room like any other, it's just for my stuff) but my mods just added such room without asking me and I feel like a selfish mean fool if I fight against it. A few more opinions would help me!

746,"To give you a bit on context I’m 26, male. I’ve only had one serious relationship previous to this current one it lasted 5-6 years and as you can tell from the title of the threat it wasn’t a healthy one. 
My ex liked to place a wedge between me and my family often by claiming ridiculous stuff about how my mother hated her. She had an unfounded inferiority complex because the difference in our families economic status behaved overly submissive never talking the initiative for anything. I had to come up with a plan on 9/10 of our outings because “I broke up with her the first time she planned our date and she felt traumatized” mind you that was years ago in high school when we had a short argument. At least once a month she would get mad at me suddenly giving me the cold shoulder because “she had the feeling I had cheated on her at some point” which was completely unfounded since I spent literally ALL my free time with her. 
She was crazy jealous  as she would often check my phone, which she had the unlock code for and check my messages on all social media. This was obviously a bit alarming but I always brushed it off as her just being the “overly jealous type” and I had nothing to hide so it didn’t bother me that much. 
I had some suspicions about her being unfaithful because of how paranoid she was but by that time my feelings for her were fading so I honestly, didn’t care to find out. 
Literally not a week after we broke up she started dating some other guy and I learned from a common friend she had brought him out to an outing with them and openly  kissed him when she was in a relationship with me. The suspicion was harmless but actually learning about her betrayal shocked and affected me too much, this was someone I almost married!
 I felt like I was robbed of the 5-6 years of life that I invested into the relation. Taking me for a fool saying she loved me while fucking some other dude on the side and flaunting it openly is a  humiliation I still can’t swallow. 
After that I had many casual relationships that never develop into more because of my fear of commitment until I meet my current girlfriend. She is absolutely amazing I enjoy my time with her a lot  but I’m having trouble even saying “I love you” to her for the first time because I don’t want to place myself in a vulnerable position because of my trust issues. I really want this to work but at the same time I can’t stop thinking “what If shes cheating on you too?”",02Aug2020,1

The following week I go up to hers and we are totally normal, we went out for a meal the following day and once we returned home she started saying how she was unsure and doesn’t know what she wants and I basically got told to leave and go home, basically assumed our relationship was over, I wasn’t in a fit state to drive for 2 hours so I phoned her an hour after saying what happened what are we now then? And it simply ended up with us both saying I want to come back and I did and stayed for the following 2 days until I had to return to work.

I know it’s a big thing moving to a different city, not knowing anyone although I do have a few friends there but I am constantly questioning myself. 

I’m worried about everything, I want to get a job before I move but ideally only 30 hours (gives me enough to live on but also enough to go and network and put myself out there which is what I’m really there for) I have a fair amount of money saved up but, 2k and going up every month. But I’m just really scared. 

I kind of guess that the fear of the wolf is bigger than the wolf itself but I am just constantly questioning how I’m even going to live there.",02Aug2020,1
757," So everything started at the end of the first year of grammar school and we clicked almost instantly. Everything was going great until the end of the grammar school. I applied for a Russian university while she stays here in Hungary.

I met her about a week ago and she looked a bit strange. She sat me down to the nearest bench and she broke up with me. She didn't have a reason to why, exept for the fact that I am going to Russia. I want to build a great future for myself and my future SO, who I thought would be her.

She told me she couldn't handle the distance and that she would probably cheat on me. I was devastated and didn't know what to say, and after the basic question of why and telling her that she is too selfcentered and didn't care about my feelings I left her there with crying eyes. She made the decision on her own and I was only told that our relationship was over.

I really need her, because a big change is going to happen in my life and I'm feeling betrayed, since I would have really needed her support. I could see that she couldn't handle it pretty well too.

After a few days I went to her summer job, which I didn't told, then I spoke with her and she was pretty cold to me. This time she said that she broke up, as I was vengeful and she felt that the relationship flattened. She told me she couldn't imagine me by her side for the rest of her life. Otherwise she told me that I did nothing wrong ( or at least she didn't say anything and I don't know what should I have done differently) and that she only changed. I never saw the breakup coming and I felt that her changed pretty dastically in just a few days, since she stayed at my place 3 days earlier and she showed no signs.

I'm meeting her in two weeks. Any suggestions on what should I do to win her back? She means the world to me and I don't know how could I survive this breakup.

TL;DR My girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue, but I love her and want to continue somehow the relationship.",02Aug2020,1

761,"Hey just wondering how to go about this. Have a best friend, who has been dating my cousin for about 5 years. Me and her just recently became friends about 3 years ago. My friend “Jen” has a car, I don’t have a car due to financial reasons because of COVID and losing my job, I was suppose to get a car by September but seems like this is just emergency money for now until I get a call back from places I applied to. Which in all honesty sucks, because having to ask friends for rides is embarrassing or taking the bus or spending money on Uber’s and Lyft’s just adds up at the end of the month. My friend “Jen” has always told me, if I ever needed a ride she would have no problem giving me one since she was in my position before and understands how it is getting around when you have no car especially when you live in the suburbs and your job is in the city. She told me her car story about how she was tired of asking people for rides, or they’ll have snobby comments such as “Oh this is my car and you want a ride” or something along the lines of that and basically told me I wouldn’t have to worry nothing like that from her. Recently I have been noticing Jen kinda rubbing in the fact about me not having car and when I’m going to get one and I’m just like ?????? When I’m financially stable and have a job again is when I plan to get one. She would also ask me when I would be getting my drivers license, but I told her “Why would I get my drivers license before a car? That makes zero sense because I’ll have no car to drive and no one will let me use their cars”. And I told her when I buy a car is when I will drive to get my license that same day.” And she’ll be quick to say “that’s dumb and makes no sense” than she goes to say “You can always drive my car” and I hit her with the instant “NO THANK YOU”, because I rather have my own car than ask someone else to let me drive their car because than I would have to hear their comments about how I’m driving their car. I rather not in my opinion. However when Jen would drink she would have me drive her car since I was DD. I NEVER ONCE, asked Jen to drive her car, she was always the one to say “Hey you wanna drive my car? I don’t feel like driving” or “Hey can you drive sine I’ve been drinking?”. Jen just traded in her old car for a brand new 2019 car, I was happy for her but also kinda depressed because I was hoping that was going to be me finally to be able to afford a car for myself and would no longer have to ask people for rides...ESPECIALLY from Jen. But non of the less still told her congrats and I’m happy for her. She tells me she’s going to pick me up so we can cruise in her new car. Once I get in her car and I’m complimenting her car she’s say “Yeah I know it’s a great car right?? But you can’t drive it” with a smart ass tone and I turned my neck so quick I thought my neck would break because I was like “Wtf???” That’s uncalled for when all I was doing was complimenting your accomplishments. And I told her, I never once asked to drive your car, you were always the one offering me to drive your car when you were either intoxicated or tired from driving all day. And than I told her she’s one of the reasons why I’m going to stop asking for rides and do shit on my own because I don’t need someone in my ear telling me “Oh watch out for my car” “don’t drink water in my car” “oh you want me to take you somewhere in MY car” and the way she would emphasize and say “MY car” in the past would make me livid. Just wanted to know if I was in the wrong? Because I know once I get a car, I would have NO issue driving around friends or family who need a car ride. And I would not be the one to say the constant “My car this, my car that”.",02Aug2020,1
762,I’ve only been able to work 3 weeks out of my summer because nobody in my area is hiring due to covid.

763,"Last night I had a nightmare from my job I was so stressed out. For reference, I work at a bakery in a grocery store. I’ve enjoyed working here because it came in handy. During the week, I’d go to college. Then Friday afternoon I’d drive an hour back to my parents and work the whole weekend. It was nice and helped me pay for books, phone bill, and gas, etc.

I’ve been here since 2016 and have a lot of experience. Because of college, I never was able to work during the day. However, because of COVID-19 (and since it’s summer) I’ve been able to work more often. I literally don’t do anything other than work, go home, work, go home, work. I live in the states, so I’m pretty much waiting until the virus is under taken care of. I live with my parents and I don’t to risk their health by going out. 

I’m stressed out now. I feel like my job doesn’t care about me.

 Before COVID-19 came, my department had over 100+ hours cut. Four of my coworkers were moved or quit. Everyday 7 people used to work in my department, now only 3 people do. I was only a cleaner, meaning I’d come to clean up the bakery for the next day. Since I’ve been there so long, I’m also trained to be a baker and I can even decorate cakes. (I’m studying to be an art teacher so it’s second nature lol.)

Now, on top of my cleaning schedule, I’m supposed to bake as well as decorate cakes. That’s one part time job with two full time job responsibilities- three jobs in one. It’s very frustrating for me to be asked to do all of this extra work but then hear them complain if I didn’t have time to sweep every speck off the floor.

I started with $10, eventually got to $11, and now because I’ve been decorating a shit ton of cake, $11.50. It’s kind of a slap in the face honestly.

I’m starting to realize that they’re using me. For the last four years I’ve closed the bakery EVERY WEEKEND. I have to request a weekend off MONTHS in an advance. 

Here’s the huge problem: I live in a small town, population around 7,000. If I wanted a new job, I’d probably have to drive 30+ miles. If COVID-19 didn’t happen, I would be student teaching in the fall, but I’m too nervous to now. I don’t want to risk my health.

I can’t finish college without student teaching, so I can’t become a teacher yet. My state, Iowa, is the ONLY state where there is no mask mandate, and our governor is forcing every school to return to in person classes. I’m terrified to teach. But at the same time, I’m being fucked over at this shitty part time job. I don’t even get paid $12 for fulltime work and work every weekend.

I have to leave in a minute for work, but for an example here’s something that happened. Last night a lady ordered a full sheet cake, $60. The cake decorator on schedule- the only one- didn’t want to do it since she’s off the clock. So I was forced to. Cake decorators are paid $16-20. I’m not even paid $12. Like, what the hell?

Should I just quit, or should I ride it out until I can go back to school? Maybe I should stay until I find a new job. I just feel like I’m being scammed. Any advice?",02Aug2020,1

There is this girl online who I've known for about 10 months now (only 6 of those months actively talking to each other).

It was going smoothly when we started talking again but recently I haven't really had anything to talk about with her, but I still try to make at least small talk once a day (which drains me). A few days ago I said something that make her uncomfortable and we are on another break, just for context we were talking about the long term future and different parenting styles and that was probably the trigger.

Just like the first time it hurts a lot and I have become an emotional mess mostly because I keep blaming myself. I'm thinking of cutting ties with her entirely so I can't say anything cursed again meaning I can't hurt her, and so I don't get hurt again either.

766,"I feel like I am at an all time low. I lost passion for everything.

I found my old pictures from like January and not to sound like a complete narcissist, I really didn't appreciate how good looking I was back then..Back then, I wasn't THAT happy, I still compared myself to others and constantly had issues caused by these competitions I created in my mind but I still looked happy and I was on top of my game, thriving..for all that matters..So I thought since it was still summer break and I don't want to return to campus looking and feeling like a huge nightmare (since everyone remembers me as this pretty happy intelligent bad ass girl) I will try stuff you want me to try (so you guys don't have to if its risky) and document my experiment..Hopefully, this will distract me from my issues and even maybe help me?

767,"I’m on mobile, forgive any grammar mistakes. TLDR at bottom. 

I am 5 years out of college and working in the other side of the country (west coast) while he is on east coast currently. 

This all started my freshman year of college when I met this guy at Japanese culture club. He was a junior and was extremely attractive. I knew what I was getting into because my brain started playing “womanizer” by Britney Spears. He was so charming (and well-dressed, talking Armani model nice, not necessarily actually Armani) that impulse young me said yes to a few really nice personal dates. The most we did was making out, I will admit to stopping just short of doing the deed. 

I broke it off with him and put the focus on him potentially rape/molesting a girl I know. Now the grey area. As much as I told him this was why, it was only the straw that broke the camel’s back. I know from the first minute I met him he would be dating multiple women (he made FB posts of romantic dinners and ballroom dancing with 4 other girls after going on dates with me) because my brain warned me. I knew we were not exclusive, but please don’t say “I should date nubile girls like you” while making out with me. Implied complements are soured by talking to me about dating someone else. 

And now the molestation accusation. The girl in question is definitely crazy. Like budding Karen mix with drama queen and has been known to lie. But she did tell me the last name he had been giving me is not even his real name. Big red flag. So I ended it and told him we should not talk anymore. 

Fast forward 9 years, and I get a FB message request from him. I noticed that he scrubbed his public profile and it’s now just an illustration of its face. I feel a little bad having told him the reason why we “broke up” being this girl. 

Now this is the question: do I explain why I don’t want a relationship with him and all the reasons why it ended like it did? Going into all the details, last name drama, gross comment etc. or do I ghost him/block him?

774,"I (21F) live with my mother (59F) and sister (27F). We get along well usually but sometimes when we are having a family time out and there’s a disagreement, I feel like they immediately take it too far.

Just in general as well whenever we talk, I find some of the stuff they say kind of rude. Like if I forgot to do the laundry, my mom would say “how can you forget to do the laundry, are you an old lady” or “I ask you to do one simple thing and you can’t even do that?” and my sister wouldn’t find it rude either. She’s not joking when she says stuff like that either. I understand that’s how an asian mom speaks typically but at the same time, she knows how to be more polite. She isn’t as rude to my sister as she is to me. 
At the same time, my sister would just say ok to whatever she’s saying or agree and then continue to not do it. I would give a reason as to why I forgot and then do it straightaway. But they both find me more rude because I don’t just say ok or agree with them before doing something. They find it rude that the first thing I do is give a reason.

Also relevant to another instance, we don’t have a good relationship with the men in our family, my father(57m) and brother(23m) both live away from us. When I get into arguments with my sister, she always compares me to my brother and say I’m exactly like him. I was bullied by my brother so hearing this makes me angry and I cry when I’m angry. Whenever I bring this up, she says “oh I’m used to it because dad did it to me so it doesn’t affect me as much anymore” but when I tried doing it to her recently she immediately snapped at me and told me I crossed a line and that I should know better because our dad traumatised her. So she doesn’t have a thicker skin to being compared to them, I just don’t do it to her because I know it hurts her.

I wouldn’t do/say something to others if I wouldn’t want it to be done to me. I think like the difference just lies in how we think. They think that when they are talking like that, they are making me more prepared for the working world and the criticisms I will face there. I understand they are trying to be protective but their delivery changes how I perceive it.

I’ve also worked before and have had no issues with criticism. In fact I have gotten praised for taking criticism well and improving based on it. 

In university as well I’ve taken criticism of my work well and the only time I’ve disputed a criticism is when I was in a group and did majority of the work but was given the same grade as other even when I told the professor about this. I’m a course representative in school so I legit deal with criticism most of the time. I’ve had work experience at a hospital 3 months and at H&amp;M for 1 year. 
They don’t take those instances as seriously because I’ve only worked part time and done internships before so it’s not an actual “serious job” aka 9-5 profession.

Every time I try talk to them, they call me too sensitive and defensive (to my face) and after I leave to go to bed or the toilet, they talk about me behind my back and compare me to my father/brother so I don’t feel like I can talk to them. (I can hear them bc my hearing is good, the walls are thin and they don’t know how to be quiet or inconspicuous.)

 Since I can’t change how they speak, I want to change how I react to their words.",02Aug2020,1

778,"Before the whole Coronavirus thing happened, I had a lot of friends I would hang out with. I knew I had a wonderful group of people I could turn to and vice versa. During lockdown, we all communicated via FaceTime and texts, etc. When restrictions were first lifted, and everyone started seeing each other again, we hung out a lot for the first few weeks and were so happy to see each other. Now, it’s almost August, and no one ever makes plans. Since late June, I’ve always had to be the one to ask to hang out, and some friends haven’t even bothered to call me. I don’t think I’ve been asked to hang out by someone in a month without me saying something first besides on one occasion. The thing is, I don’t think most of my friends are hanging out a lot with ANYONE. I’m wondering if this is like a mental thing from being on lockdown for so long that we’re more okay being alone? Did I do something wrong? I’ve acted the exact same since the first day I met my friends until now, I don’t know what I could’ve done to ALL of my friends from all different groups that literally NONE of them would ask to hang out with me.

I don’t know why there’s been such a sudden change. I swear I did not do anything to my knowledge, and we’ve all acted the same since the beginning of our friendships to now.

Anyways, so my boyfriend and I have been talking about getting a cat for a while and we finally decided to get one. So I started looking through the lease and noticed that any cats in the apartment \*need\* do be declawed. Its a rule. However I believe that declawing a cat is cruel and unnecessary especially since there are claw caps you can put on the cats claws if scratching things is an issue. Theres also really nothing in the apartment that belongs to the apartment that the cat could really claw up, ive never experienced a cat just tearing away at a door frame or something, its always been furniture or curtains (we dont have curtains). I plan on getting the cat some scratch toys. Even if furniture scratches are an issue our couch is old and used. 

So heres my question. How do I talk to the property manager about this? Should I put together some information and tell them about said alternatives? Or do I just get a cat and neglect to tell them that said cat has claws? There is tons of information out there about why declawing is bad i suppose i could present. What do?

A few months ago, the guy and I stopped seeing each other. Actually I called it off. I had tons of fun with him but there wasn’t much of a deep emotional connection and I wasn’t really feeling it anymore. 

A few days after we ended it, the brother DM’d me on Instagram replying to a post about my dog, asking me to bring the dog next time we all hang out. I told him it ended with his brother. He seemed to feel sorry, then within the next few days, he suddenly turned very directly flirty with me.

Tldr: I dated a guy casually, during which time I met his brothers. I stopped seeing the guy, then his older brother reached out to me and we’ve been flirting ever since. We plan to meet this weekend to hook up. His brother doesn’t know any of this. Is this wrong??",02Aug2020,1
785,"I’m not sure if this goes in this subreddit, so I’m sorry if it’s in the wrong space!

I graduate pretty soon, and I still have no idea what I want to do with my life. I have too many interests that I want to turn into careers, and it’s hard to pick between them all. I think I’ve narrowed it down to three different fields, and those are: astrophysics/aerospace engineering, marine biology, and radiology.

I’m pretty sure that I would enjoy studying any of these, but I’m worried that ten years down the line I’ll realize that I’ve made the wrong choice and it’ll be too late to do anything. I have no idea what to choose or how to choose it. I’m looking for someone either than my family to give advice, because they just tell me to be a lawyer or a doctor.

787,"Some backstory: I’m 16M very shy living in COViD America and for some reason my mom decided we should take a week long vacation eight hours away at a rented beach house with her friend and her family and now I think I’m in love??

Her friend is also bringing her husband and two daughters (15) (18) (I’ll call them F1 and F2) I’ve known them since I was little and I would basically call them my sisters at this point because we known each other our whole lives. 

Anyways they unexpectedly announce that they will each bring a friend ( F3 which is 15 and F4 which is 16) ok, no big deal eight people in a small house for a week we probably already have Coronavirus. We are spending a week with them at this house on the waterfront. 

Since I’m shy and forgot my anxiety medication I don’t talk for like half the week. (This was my first time meeting F3 and F4) All of them are really sweet and great people it’s just that people aren’t my cup of tea. Us teens talked a little on the first day but I go quiet for 2 days and finally I break out on Wed halfway through the trip. We hangout on the beach and in this outdoor hot tub together all trip and talk about life everyone’s pretty calm and relaxed and we all have fun and like one another. 

Now F3 friend is really outgoing and always talking and laughing telling stories etc while F4 is more calm and shy like me (also good looking). 
A couple days go by and I’m starting to really like F4 (as a friend) even though we never talked one on one. Well suddenly it’s Fri the second to last day and by the end of the day I realize something. Do I like F4 or do I like like F4? She is super relatable, sweet, funny, shy, calm, good looking and essentially my dream girl (I would prefer to date a person similar to me). 

I wasn’t sure but what I was sure of was I was still nervous as hell to talk to her after a week. By Sat next morning we leave unexpectedly early without really saying goodbye to them but I did get the courage to ask for everyone’s IG and made a vacation group chat. On the car ride home they dm each other sending photos they took etc but F4 doesn’t chat really and neither do I. 

We go back home and by night time I realize I can’t stop thinking about F4, a feeling I’ve never had before. I’ve had small crushes in school and stuff but F4 is literally keeping me up all night thinking about her. I miss her already. I start to have thoughts about her (nothing sexual, which is weird for 16) like talking hanging out holding hands etc even though we barely talked throughout the trip. I think about her smile and how nice and perfect she was and by then I figure out maybe I love her?. 

I haven’t slept in two days and can’t stop thinking about her and I’ve never felt this way I want to dm her but I’m way too nervous and I’m not even sure what I’m feeling rn. I never felt this way before so I guess I’m in love? What should I do? Ignore the group chat? Message her privately? I really don’t know but I do know that I probably missed my chance since I didn’t realize what I felt till after the trip and my darn anxiety. I probably won’t see her until next vacation (maybe a couple years) she also lives in a different state. Not sure what I’m feeling or what to do about it.

Summary: I probably have Covid but I did meet a girl and now I’m going insane thinking about her. Not sure what to feel or what I should do.",02Aug2020,1

790,"I was supposed to graduate this semester, but am fairly certain I am going to fail the last class of my degree. I did not prepare for this- I now have a full-time job in my degree, and none of the online classes my school is offering have any seats left. I am supposed to finish the last 30 credits of my degree at my main institution, but I'm really freaking out about not being able to get a seat. My work is fairly understanding, but overall, I am worried about this scheduling and just generally feeling like a big failure. 

How would you go about this if it were you? I really want my job and am not willing to go back from full time. My job is actually a dream come true at the moment given the circumstances. I've emailed all my advisors anxiously asking for help but I'm afraid they're gonna say ""tough luck"".   


Any advice, even just to help my mental health with coping with this is very much appreciated- thank you!",02Aug2020,1
791,"My mom, 5 years ago, had met a man on a dating site and only about a little over a year ago, he moved in. Prior to moving in, I really enjoyed his company. He was very laid back, friendly, and seemed like a pretty chill person overall, which was what my mom was looking for in someone since her verbally abusive marriage when I was really young (about 4 y/o - I'm now 15, almost 16). Because of his odd schedule (working at night, sleeping during the day), we had a specific day each week when he'd come over (Tuesday, until his job hours changed so it became Thursday only a few years ago) and I remember I liked him so much that I even wanted him over on days he couldn't come, so it was good because this meant that my mom is with someone that I feel comfortable with.I'm not exactly sure how many years ago, but around 2018, my likeness toward him began to dwindle. To some extent, this was because of talks of him moving in - I didn't like the idea because I feared my mom might not be around me as much and although I'm not sure if this also has to do with it: I had (and still do, but it's gotten better) separation anxiety most likely brought about because my mom was who was there for me and not my dad, so I got really attached to her and feared not being around her more than the average child. Looking back on that specific reason for disliking him, it was really petty and unreasonable, however there are other things that I began to understand more as I got older that I began to not like either: He is a massive homophobic, for one. There was a time around 2018 where my best friend was over at my house when he was, and a conversation sparked about the LGBTQ+ community, and he showed a lot of his true colors during this conversation - Ones which I won't say here b/c they're disgusting, and even though he doesn't post these beliefs online, they hurt me a lot. My friend and I are both supporters of the community and I myself am currently questioning. My mom is a supporter as well, however she tried to look past this, as well as many other things such as the fact that he believes women should be partially to blame for being raped, as well as toxic masculinity. These were all things that I became far more aware of at this point (please understand that my mom feels like she really needs someone to love in a partnership way and tries to find the good in people).My mom is someone who is affectionate and if in a dating-relationship with someone, wants to hold their hand, and have the same done to her. She is not, however, one of those crazy ""feminists"" who believes all men should treat women as if they are the superior sex in every way, and thinks that her boyfriend should treat her like a God-send, riding up to her on a white steed. Because they were now officially dating, my mom, growing up in a household where her parents showed mutual affection to one another, holding hands, putting their arms around each other, holding them, etc, expected a little bit of that, but never made huge deals over the fact that he rarely showed any form of affection past being a friend. \*\*I just want to make it clear before anything else: It's okay to not want to be touched - There are tons of reasons why people might not want to be - What isn't okay is going into a potential relationship knowing what the other person thinks and what they feel about showing affection, and waiting until you've moved in, to say that it was never brought up, when indeed it was (on the dating profile and before any moving plans were settled for sure).\*\*When it was finally time for him to move in (The process being from January through February of 2019), I became increasingly less friendly (and once again, I think this was really petty, mostly because it put more stress on my mom), and my mom made it clear that the type of relationship once he moved in wasn't one of friends, but a partnership between two people that showed mutual affection and care (he claims not to remember this, but I was there was well, and I do). My mom is a sensitive person, and that was only increased because of my father's yelling, name-calling, and pettiness over every little thing that was a slight inconvenience like crumbs on the table - Raised by her, I developed a lot of empathy and sensitivity as well. During one of the long drives to his apartment, he was being a major backseat driver (as my father was), and just not acting nice or friendly in the car, and she started to tear up. He didn't notice at all, and when he got out, my mom started to cry and I comforted her (At this point, she wonders why she didn't just call it off there, because this wasn't the only instance where he didn't show much care or respect toward her after she did things for him).I'm sorry this is getting so long - I just feel like this needs to be prefaced w/ lots of info. He moved in, helped around the house, and all that, and despite the fact that he still acted like a friend having a prolonged sleep-over, she never complained, and pushed through how he acted when she tried to help him out with his boxes which have been in the garage for over a year now and have only just now been moved because of a water-heated leakage. When he moved in, the amount of times he snapped at her increased and used the excuse that he was stressed since he just moved in (Understandable, except that that's not how you treat your significant other who's trying to help you and is the one supporting you during this stressful time or at least I don't think it is?). Jumping to more recent times, issues have only progressed more. He pretty much acts like a roommate every single day and my mom feels more alone when he's around then when she's downstairs by herself because he sits in silence, not talking, and not even sitting next to her a lot of the time. He uses the excuse that it's because of his schedule, except that my mom is up at 8:00AM and he goes to bed at 12:00-1:00PM, and my mom stays up past 12:00AM downstairs with him, and pretty much nothing goes on - He spends most of the time he's up in the room with his computer and when my mom does go to hold his hand, he sometimes snatches away. My mom has become really depressed over these 5 past months, saying it will get better, but it hasn't at all, and conversations become arguments that I can hear while doing summer work, and I can't take it. His thoughts hurt me, as a growing child trying to figure out my sexuality, as well as supporting the LGBTQ+ community. It just becomes toxic all around and it's horrible. I don't know how much longer I can take it before I snap, myself; he legit got upset and snapped because I accidentally put the jam in the cabinet after opening it (I was an idiot, okay fine - I already know that - But can't he be nicer about it? I didn't know, and b/c I dealt w/ my father's rage, it made me shake and my stomach churned). I blame myself a lot, wondering if it's my fault because of how I acted when he was moving it, but I don't know. He's always showed signs of being self-centered but recently he pretty much said that he only does things for others that he would personally want done to himself, and that he only does what he wants and when he wants (which is fine if you're living by yourself and don't have a partner you should care about - He claims he cares but when my mom cries, he says she's acting like a 10 year old and that what she's crying over is irrational, calling her crazy and an asshole) - He says everything is perfect until my mom brings up something that's bothering her, but everything ISN'T perfect - It's just perfect for him because no one's disturbing his peace inside our house.Pretty much, my mom and I don't know what to do because it's just toxic all around - My mom's admitted to making mistakes in conversations and saying stupid/petty things, but she's never called him names, and has always responded calmly until he begins to belittle how she feels, treating them like jokes. How do we handle this - Do we get lawyers and help him move out without being on the streets? Because, if nothing changes soon, we're going to need to do something.I'm sorry this got so long - Thank you so much if you read it &lt;3

One more thing: He openly admitted to viewing mY mOThER as more like a mother-figure to him (What???) - and that he only really found 25 year old women/women half his age attractive, claiming that AlL mEn are attracted to what they were attracted to in the past, if they're older like he is. He says that my mom's crying is simply to mess with him, as well. He says to her to bring up something if she's not happy about it (mostly in reference to how alone she feels when he's around), but when she does, he replies annoyed (I've been there for these things to happen). He says she harps about things that happened way in the past, yet he does the exact same thing during arguments/conversations.I just really can't take it anymore and I don't know if my mom can either.",02Aug2020,1

793,"So my dad and I don’t have a great relationship for many reasons but seeing as this happened this morning and I’m at a loss as what to do, I’m talking about this specific instance. 

Some personal Background: I’m 21 going to college living under my parents roof. I want to move out but I want to finish college first and either way not in a viable financial position. I have severe anxiety and depression. In a Hispanic family (I mention it because there’s dynamics and culture that affect the situation like, sons help their dads, and parents aren’t really understanding of mental health issues). 

Some background on the situation: we switched to refrigerated air like 5 weeks ago so we had to remove the old air conditioner on our roof and do some roof work. Some trash was left and has been in the backyard since. My dad never said to take it to the landfill, it’s just one of those things that he expects me to do. I never really get around to it because I’m currently doing an internship and I was also getting my school stuff settled for the next semester. And also we bought some new couches that were supposed to get delivered so I was gonna throw away the old couches when they came in and throw away the roofing trash with it. After a few couch delays they finally arrive but on that day my dad took the bigger truck so the only trash that fit were the couches so that was the only thing I took to the landfill. Also I’m not extremely comfortable taking my dads truck cause it’s new and there’s a lot more room to account for then I’m used to. With that in mind I tried to line up the day to when my gf doesn’t have work so that she can help me maneuver the truck to make sure I don’t back into anything I’m not supposed to. 

So for starters my dad isn’t an approachable or understanding person. I feel I can’t really talk about issues with him without feeling extremely tense, scared, or on the verge of crying. I stayed up a little late last night finishing evangelion but I also had to drive my gf to work this morning since her car broke down. So I drop her off at work and come home. My dad wakes up early so he sees me awake (might be relevant cause maybe he saw me awake and thought I was ready to do stuff or something). I go to my room and go to sleep cause I didn’t get enough sleep last night and I’m tired. So a little later I’m barely awake but I hear him in an upset voice saying to mom, something along the lines of “wow the old man of the house has to take out the trash in this house. If u/ivyri asks for so much as a dollar don’t give him anything.” I just don’t see how I could have handled the situation differently. Also I hate to use it as an excuse but my anxiety and depression really make a lot of things harder in this scenario and my entire life. If there’s anyway you think I could have done it differently or what I should do differently in the future please let me know, thank you for reading my post. 

Tl dr: my dad did some work this morning that he didn’t tell me about and he’s upset that I didn’t help him.",02Aug2020,1

She texted me day of and told me not to come because she thinks I’m not ready to be around him in a small setting. 
I honestly just feel so hurt. 
The reason he broke up with me was commitment issues and that he didn’t have any time for me. Yet he still wanted to be friends and he would still be there for me. 
We were in the same uni in a really niche program and still had another full semester together. And during that time he didn’t once speak to me or even acknowledge my existence I had texted him a few times when I wasn’t doing good and he took days to respond, only to respond with a “I’m sorry you feel that way”

And just recently I found out he was texting her back when we were together that things weren’t good, at a time when I was practically begging him to speak to me and tell me what was wrong.

Anyway I’m not sure if I should continue being friends with her even though I literally have no one else.

797," 

I feel like a lot of us have inferiority complexes, and try to compensate for our supposed inferiorities by acting like idiots (dressing badly, making tasteless jokes (to some), making self-depreciating jokes about themselves, etc.). We are smart, and yet think we are not the best, so we think we are not deserving of looking and behaving our best (wearing proper clothes, occasionally cracking a tasteful joke, putting ourselves in the best light possible).

I have had a major inferiority complex in 9th grade, and played the clown for the whole year (acting like a degenerate, being ""edgy"", talking shit, and dressing like a hobo) only because I felt like I was not good enough to play the king. I am trying to make the change to playing the king as a rising sophomore.

The sad truth is that the smartest of people (like the 1% of the 1%) usually don't land up as successful as you think. They are not respected as much as say the CEO or the CTO of a F500 company, because they land up doing research, being taken advantage of by the big boys.

The difference between the CEO (of a major company) and the person who is too smart for his own good, is that the CEO puts himself in the best light possible, wearing proper clothes, acting refined, as well as being smart (not too smart however). The CEO is the king of the jungle.

So make the change. Wear your best clothes, stop being self depreciating, and act your best. Stop being insecure, and please... stop comparing yourself to others.",02Aug2020,1
798,"I have known him since kindergarten and even back then, he would always ask me to give him my stuff and if I didn’t he would threaten to stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with him from 3rd to 5th grade. Once middle school came, he became friends with me again. My other friends and him always came to me for rides because my parents were the only ones who would drive us places.

Once high school came and everyone got their license, he pretty much never asked me to do anything or talked to me. Then after high school, all of his friends went away for college so he started inviting me places again. Then when they come back for the summer, I receive no invites at all. It’s literally like clockwork, as soon as the semester ends, he doesn’t invite me anywhere until college starts back up again.

I told him that if he’s really my friend then would he would invite me to his house or parties when he has them, but he just calls me “crazy” or delusional” even though I have proof of it.

A few weeks ago was his birthday and he had a huge party at a Lake House and invited everyone he knew except me. Also, this week he and bunch of his other friends went on vacation to the beach which he knew I wanted to go. In fact, he told me I was welcomed to come, but when I said yes, he never responded.

799,"My ex gf has been seeing man. Being a curious snoop, I did a little googling and found his ex-wife's blog. Her blog, while clearly written as personal venting, detials a number of very disturbing,volatile, controlling behaviors that, from what I've read, did not manifest until after they'd been married for a year or two. If it were much more general, I would not think much about, it but the incidents described are so specific that I can't help but pay them mind.

It's entirely possible the posts are very out of context and obviously they are wildly biased as presented, and if they are true, it's possible that this man has reformed himself and will no longer behave that way.

At 18 I Finished high school, after attempted a personal training course (Which I hated) and had 4 different jobs over the year - a waitress, team leader of a retail store, hospitality worker back and front of house for a bingo centre and a commission sales job. This sales job had the amazing opportunity of having an office in Europe so I moved overseas to travel. 

At 19 I moved overseas and spent just over a year travelling on and off in Europe and working in the 100% commission sales role. It was an absolutely amazing experience and I got to see so many countries while working this job. When I would work it would be 6- 7 day weeks, 12 hour days to make a decent amount of money in a short time and then I would take a couple weeks to a month off to travel. However there was of course weeks I wouldn't make anything which was extremely stressful. I would never go back to this type of job. 

Next I went to Australia for 3 months (Feb - May last year) working for the same sales company and then onto Southeast Asia for 3 months (May- August) then the month of August in France.  

September rolled around last year I had decided I might want to become a chef as I developed a real passion for food and cooking through my travels. I settled back in Europe and I worked in a kitchen for 8ish months until Covid happened and I lost my job in May. It turns out I hated it anyway the long hours, bad pay and back breaking work. However I still love working with food and the creativity it allows me. I love to cook and create and make amazing delicious things inspired from all parts of the world. 

A month and a half ago I managed to find a job in a cake shop as an apprentice baker, it is okay but I am sick of working minimum wage. I want to get into a career or industry that allows me work life balance the ability to save, and have some freedom or sick days. I am over not getting holiday leave and 10 euros per hour. It is barely survivable. 

I am strongly considering going to Uni to get a bachelor but I don't even know in what. I feel like I have tried a lot of different jobs and I am still not sure what I am even interested in. I don't want to go back to uni to get a useless degree. I want a degree that will provide good stable job opportunities.

What careers should I look into that allow good work life balance? Should I go to uni? Should I just attempt applying for other jobs? How do I get out of minimum wage? I feel like I have a lot of experience for my age and have so much to offer companies but don't know how to get my foot in the door?

Obviously I want to have some freedom and have fun, but I still rely on them for foood and shelter but so does everyone else I know and they aren’t given all these restrictions. My parents also think that I go out so much based off the few times they let me go somewhere, not knowing that I barely go out compared to my friends are anyone else my age. Kids used to not believe when I told them about my parents acted. I am now 20, with my own car job and In school, and my parents act like it’s the end of the world whenever I tell them I’m gonna go hang out with friends. They think it’s weird that a 20 year old male goes out later at night. It’s not even like they’re cut off from the world but it’s like they have no idea how things work",02Aug2020,1
807,"I (f16) have recently had this thought in my mind a lot. I'm not sure where it comes but I have this feeling that I should drop my friends. 

Then I could focus on myself and school. I haven't been happy with my gpa and how my school is going. I'm starting upper secondary school or high school whatever it's called here soon and it would be perfect time to start focusing more on school. 

On the other hand I would have no friends in school. Only some mutual friends who I can be with for a while but not too long. Mine and their personalities and opinions just don't meet. It's a new school and there will be new people but I already know like 95% of the people that are coming to the same school and I'm just not friends with them and also I'm really shy and have a hard time making new friends.

But even with all those kinda negative sides to it I just feel like I should drop them. Some of them have been my friends for like 9-13 years and this is just so weird.

I feel like I'm so lost in life and everything ugh",02Aug2020,1
808,"They actively protest against groups like BLM. My grandma constantly makes racist remarks, especially about people who are Mexican but she also clearly doesn’t like black people. I never realized it until recently, when everything happened politically and she’s pretty clearly not on a good side of history with her views... which I suspect is pretty common with her (dying) generation. I’ve looked the other way when she has said extremely awful things about trump, when she tried to manipulate me into having a relationship with my equally toxic mother, and when she did a barrage of other horrible things because I care for her deeply and she has gone above and beyond for me in the past. 


Today she shot my entire family a text about how she and my grandpa are actively protesting against BLM, with a sign, and said that people who support it “don’t know their history”. 

My grandma is extremely manipulative, and she’s also genuinely not interested in hearing any outside perspectives. As she’s gotten older, it’s gotten worse. 

I want to emphasize that any approach that involves trying to rationalize with her will absolutely not work. If you’ve dealt with truly unreasonable people, you know why. 

I am tired of just writing it off. She’s my grandma and she matters a lot to me, but it is exhausting being around her when she’s being so fucking toxic.  

I don’t want to cut her out of my life because I do care about her, but this is so irritating that I don’t want to deal with it anymore.",02Aug2020,1
809,My country has been heavily affected by covid with more than 1.8 million affected so far and today I got a call from some NGO saying that some kid wanted my blood type in some hospital which is one of the biggest covid relief centre in my country with patients being admitted in thousands. I live with my family all of whom are diabetic and my grandfather is more than 90 years old. and therefore my family is very apprehensive about me donating blood there. We asked someone from the staff could come to my home to collect blood but that doesn't seem to be an option and when I enquired about risk of covid I was told that I should come at my own risk. Should I go donate blood at this time even if it meant risking covid for my family? Please advice. Thank you.,02Aug2020,1
810,"this is gonna be long i guess to thankyou if ur gonna read the whole thing,,

anyways, im still in highschool and and im gay, and im in the middle east. and i live there. and once i tried talking to my parents and asking them if i was gay what would they do, and they simply responded by: wed kill u. so yeah i think u understand now. and they were dead serious. and my parents are not abusive but you never know what would happen when they know sooo.

eventually i had a plan of going to the us/canada and to study there (college) and graduate and work and live there and be myself with absolutely no problems.

however now we have an economical crisis and i wont be able to go anywhere near the us or canada. because 1$ used to be 1.500 ll and now 1$ is 7.800 ll which is alot. and both my parents salaries are in lira so that wont help.

anyways i got two plans, and thats where i need the actual help; 

plan a)
i think i might be able to go to italy. and study in med school there, but will i be able to finish residency and live there? for like ever? so i can be myself. without being threatened to die? yk? (and will i be able to do the steps and then go and do residency in the us/canada freely? ik its gonna be hard but yeah).

plan b)
however, (incase i stay here) theres this good university (i think 70% of the students there are not homophobic but still yk im scared kinda) and its closer to my grandmas house and it teaches in the american system and its pretty recognized internationally, so if i finish my bachelors (im gonna major in medical lab sciences) here while i live with my grandma and i plan to go finish my masters/phd in the us/canada but will i be able graduate and live there if i just did my masters/phd there? and will i be able to find work (maybe in some lab or something).


i really dont know what to do. im still young and i still have time. and i know that. but i need to know whats gonna happen to me. and which path i should take. bc its all gonna affect me and everything that ill be doing next year.

and if i leave or something itll need to look like im going to study, because i dont wanna completely lose touch with them. but how are they gonna know that im gay if im gonna live abroad right?

anyways thanks for reading and i hope someone will give me some type of advice.",02Aug2020,1
811,"I have known him since kindergarten and even back then, he would always ask me to give him my stuff and if I didn’t he would threaten to stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with him from 3rd to 5th grade. Once middle school came, he became friends with me again. My other friends and him always came to me for rides because my parents were the only ones who would drive us places.

Once high school came and everyone got their license, he pretty much never asked me to do anything or talked to me. Then after high school, all of his friends went away for college so he started inviting me places again. Then when they come back for the summer, I receive no invites at all. It’s literally like clockwork, as soon as the semester ends, he doesn’t invite me anywhere until college starts back up again.

I told him that if he’s really my friend then would he would invite me to his house or parties when he has them, but he just calls me “crazy” or delusional” even though I have proof of it.

A few weeks ago was his birthday and he had a huge party at a Lake House and invited everyone he knew except me. Also, this week he and bunch of his other friends went on vacation to the beach which he knew I wanted to go. In fact, he told me I was welcomed to come, but when I said yes, he never responded. And a couple of weeks ago he told me they weren’t going to the beach because nobody could go.

Guys I've learnt the hard way, NEVER leave a job without securing another position. I feel I'm just stuck in a vicious loop. I've handed out and also posted Cv's, pounded the pavement all hours of the day, I'm on every job site known to man, I've made phone calls, sent emails, well you get the jist.

817,"A little back story: My SO (30M) and I (31F) met about a yr and a half ago when I was hired at the same company as him, but we worked on different teams in the IT department. At the beginning of the year, my SO (30m) and I (31F) started planning to move across the country. We were researching areas, housing, jobs, home improvements to our current house, etc. Then the pandemic hit and we lost some steam.

Luckily (sort of), I'm in a ""high risk"" category and could work from home. Even though the IT department is fully capable of doing this, I would have otherwise been required to keep coming into the office. Since HR would arbitrarily decide when it was ""safe"" to come in or WFH, I used the time saved from not commuting to search for a new remote position. Nailing down something remote would help with moving when the time came anyway.

I put in dozens of applications within a few months, but didn't have much success. However, a recruiter from local Company Y reached out with a job offer. Company Y is working remote indefinitely due to COVID19, but normally requires office attendance. After talking about it with my SO, we kind of agreed that it might be some time before we could really move (given the state of everything right now).

I was going through some burn out in my current position and taking the new job wouldn't be a bad idea for the experience with different tools/practices. I hyped myself up and accepted the offer with Company Y and informed my current Company X. Company X countered with some crazy raise. I told Company X it wasn't about the money and I was leaving to look for guaranteed remote work during the pandemic and remote options after it ended. They responded with even more money, but said they couldn't guarantee remote options.

Another note: Company X is very much against remote work, but one of my teammates works from another state. Company X decided it was better to make WFH concessions for this teammate given their talent and it’s been a great experience for a few years. Company X acknowledged this arrangement during their counter-counter offer. So, it's very possible Company X would have worked with me if I’d told them about my plans to move out of state (not trying to sound narcissistic about my abilities, but I think I'm a pretty dependable employee). Overall, I usually enjoyed my work and teammates so it would've been great. However, I couldn't reveal this because SO was concerned about the news trickling to his manager (which is understandable with regard to potential raises if we're still here at EoY).

I had a week between leaving Company X and starting at Company Y, so we road-tripped to the state we'd planned to move to for some camping (social distancing in mind). While gone, I texted my boss at Company X a photo of our location and jokingly said ""I'll stay with Company X if I can work from here!"" (my boss and I have a good enough relationship to make those remarks, but also there were several times when management said they'd welcome me back if things don't work out at Company Y). Boss replied positively and I laughingly told SO if only I could tell them it was for realsies. He responded with something along the lines of he doesn't care if they find out, he just wants to move now.

He's been gunghoe about moving since we got home (and I am too), but now I'm kind of in an employment pickle. Having JUST changed jobs, I'm very concerned what this will look like to potential employers once I start applying to things again.  Knowing what it's like to hire someone only to have them leave quickly also makes me feel really bad about maybe doing the same to Company Y. 

Given my SO's change in attitude towards letting Company X know we're moving, would it be a mistake to reach out to Company X about this development? I would feel better about leaving Company Y sooner than later so they don't waste time on me. However, even though I don't think the people I worked for at Company X would be vindictive, they could be? And maybe it doesn't even matter and they won't really have me back anyway.",02Aug2020,1
818,"Hey! So last weekend I met up with a girl from my friend's workplace at  our house party and after that she left me her number through a text via  a mutual friend. I sent her a text right away as we got along well at  the party. We talk for a day or two and then the mutual friend asked me  If I asked her out but I hadn't and she said she's waiting for me to do  that. Well, I do that and the next day I end up at her place with a  bottle of wine and we had a great time talking, and we ended up making  out in her bed for hours. She is a bit shy and I couldn't figure out  what she wanted, and the next day we go to an island and we get along  pretty well again. We talked and talked and I end up at her place two  days after she invited me, We held hands watching a movie and little  flirting here and there. We ended up making out and then I proceed to  pull out a condom and she undresses herself and I ejaculate right away  because I was really nervous. She said it's okay we can and we proceed  to smoke a bowl of weed. I have major anxiety from Childhood problems  and I shouldn't have smoked but I can handle a little weed, but I get  really paranoid (after bad sex) and proceed to go back home as I wasn't  sure if she wanted me to stay. She's busy for the next two days, but I  let her know that I had a great time but she seems not interested.  Meanwhile I felt like she just wanted to sleep with me and after that  didn't work out, she doesn't wanna talk  so I deleted her number and our  mutual friend messages me again asking how are things with her and I  explain most of it and said I don't think I am ready for anything  intimate and I told her about that bowl of weed and how I got paranoid.  Then the mutual friend proceeds to show the lengthy text I sent her to  the girl and she says that I shouldn't have told her at all. I told her  today how I felt being pushed into this and her and the co-worker blame  me as I was ready to sleep with her. I sent the girl a lengthy text  saying I apologize for sharing what she said, I understand that  she is  really shy and doesn't like to talk to people about her personal stuff  and I told her I do no think I was ready for anything and she said I  initiated  the date and everything so and laughs when I tell her I felt  pushed into this. Well she's right but I don't know what to do next and I  feel like a total jerk as she was a really nice person and I felt that I  should just have a hookup and get away because I wasn't sure if this  will work out.",02Aug2020,1

Im in my last year of college and ive been filling the rooms up my buddy wantes to rent the master bedroom so before i let her put her stuff in the room i inspected everything the bathroom got a shower and a seperate tub the shower worked fine

But the tub's faucet was broken so i figured a simple maintenance call would take care of it the people came and toldnme that it would be a very expensive repair and left i notified my landlord and now shes blaming me for it being broken i had a previous roommate renting the room so i have no idea who broke it.

Basically my landlord is very upset with me... ive tried to have a good relationship with her shes usually very kind and understanding but i think this really set her off...

Ive helped her get 3 years worth of rent from multiple people ive tried my best to be a good tenant i even fully furnished the home it was completely empty when i moved in.

Over this past year I grew close to someone who I originally thought was a nice guy. Boy, was I wrong. We were friends for about 4 months before we decided to start dating. I thought things were going really well. But, as time went on I noticed things were a bit odd.

And then I found out something that scared the fuck out of me. I found out he didn't actually leave his ex, she knew everything that was going on between us. They had constructed a plan to find someone that he could 'be with' to eventually get them pregnant and once that person had the child him and his current girlfriend where going to kidnap the child and run away together. Because she can't have kids. I seen the conversations between them once I snooped when I sensed something was extremely odd. 

Like I'm an understanding person, but to me that is seriously fucked up. I have a child of my own and once I seen what was going on I told him to never get a hold of me again and I never wanted to see him and I removed myself from the situation. I took screenshots of the conversation and sent them to myself and deleted the pictures and the messages to myself. It's still fucking with my head. 

I'm not asking for legal advice, but I was just wondering if anything like this is illegal and if if so I will contact the State Police.

824,"I (18f, American) am heading off to college on August 10th. Three days ago my university sent out a message saying that every student staying in  the dorms was required to provide proof of a negative PCR test at least 48 hours before moving in.

My friend tested negative, so all was good, but I still didn't go out for two weeks because of it and am therefore in the clear.) 

My parents say I should say I have symptoms in order to get a test. Technically, I am having symptoms. However, those particular symptoms (muscle cramps and headaches) are almost definitely from my period, which I am currently having.

I just dont know how to react to all of this i feel like im talking to a different person because just three weeks ago before all the fighting we were talking about traveling and how much we liked each other and now she said shes bored and not excited anymore which is a pain in the ass for me because everytime i want to do anything,she says shes tired from work and just wants to sleep?!!!. i have offered to break up twice but she says no and that we can make things work, 

honestly what are your guys opinions this is my first relationship so i dont know how they change over time is all of this just a reaction to the end of the ""honeymoon phase"",does she honestly just not like me or can it because of her work she blames her temperment and emotions on the fact that she works long days in a place she hates and that makes her depressed, can this be a reason she acts different,

832,"I'm a fifteen year old who has lost her mom on December of 2018. I currently live with my grandparents.

I really don't know where to even begin with my story, so i'm sorry if this is a mess.

It was only the two of us in out home, i don't even know who or where my dad is, my sister ran away from home when i was in elementary and now my mom is gone. Everyone i ever loved seems to just go away and i don't know how i handle it. 

My mom and i sleep together every night and when i woke up this particular morning, it was late, 9am, it was weird that my mom haven't woken up, she was always an early riser. So like i always do when my mom is asleep, i hug her and feel for her chest rising up and down. I always wished that she would live forever like a superhero that she was. I looked at her when i noticed she wasn't breathing and her lips and fingers were purple and i just knew, i knew she was dead. I didn't know what to do, i cried for her, screamed her name, wishing she would move and this was just me being paranoid. I never felt so alone and scared, i called for my neighbors, who i barely knew. I sat in their home for hours waiting for my relatives to come. I couldn't watch her get taken away, i don't want to see her that way, so lifeless and gone.

So after a few months, i got back to school and suddenly i just break down all the time at school,  and not even come at all. My friends backstabbed me while i was grieving for my mom. They said to me ""It was just backstabbing, get over it."" I tried very hard not to kill myself that day. 

So after finishing the school year with me barely attending, i moved to my grandparents house. I don't know if i'm just being too emotional but my grandmother has told me that she wished i got covid, that i didn't care for my mom because i didn't cry when they arrived, that i was the cause of my mother's death, and so much more and i cried every time and i stayed quiet, i didn't want to be more of a burden than i am.

One day, i got a severe panic attack, got sent to the hospital and the doctor said i should get evaluated to a psychiatrist. When we got home, my grandmother said that she didn't want to care of a sick person.

My aunt called shortly after that and i spilled my guts out to her, but i just knew she didn't understand, she said that it has been a long time since my mom was gone, that i shouldn't cry about her anymore nor think too much about her. How could i not?

Then when my grandmother said that i didn't care for my mom again, i told my aunt. My aunt said that i should express my emotions, i felt angry that she didn't understand how hurt those words felt.

837,"Started a new job 3 weeks ago. I was hired by A, a manager. I like A, he's great, friendly, approchable and has been checking up on me every week.

A asked the dept's lead, B to train me. However, he has different ways of training than I'm used to. A few examples

-He does not want me to ask him questions if the they are already answered in the manual documentations. I'm used to asking questions, as redundant as they may be, esp in training phase.


-He asked me to do a test project for the first time on my own. I did it from scratch. However, I forgot to place the source file in the same folder as the final product, I placed it in another folder instead. Instead of asking me where the source file was, he accused me of copying someone else's work. When I provided proof. He said that's expliciality stated in the documentantion. I apologize for missing it. He didn't apologize for accusing me, not that day at least. He apologized the next day but it was a non-aplogy ""I apologize for jumping into a logic assumption."" ?

-Everytime I made a mistake, he called me out. Naturally I asked for a clarification and questions. Apparently to him this was me pushing back?

All of these are documented (company's chat). 

I'm also leaving because

1. the new job is a better job (better title, better pay, and I get to do something more different)

2. Insurance. my current employer has 90 day waiting period. My new employer's insurance is kicked in right away. I do have medical conditions on top of the fact we're in the middle of a GLOBAL pandemic


But my main reason leaving is I don't think I fit it with the lead. 



When I give him a 2 week notice. I'm pretty sure this won't be needed and as I'm still IN training period and I'm fine if they don't need the 2 weeks. But how should I tell my boss? As I said, he has checked up on me. I have tried to clue him in saying things like ""B and I have different ways of learning. I think he expects me to learn the way he does. I'm adapting and I'm trying my best. Esp since we're doing this remotely etc."" 

SO any advice?

I don't care about my relationship with the lead but I do care with my boss. As I said I do like my boss, I think he's great. I don't wanna burn any bridges. How should I phrase my resignation/call with him?",02Aug2020,1

840,"TLDR: suckered into getting a dog, with promise of everyone pitching in, to be stuck with caring for the dog 24/7. 

My significant other wanted a dog for our child for their birthday this year. I agreed with some concerns since I have felt like I have been doing majority of the heavy lifting and household chores as it is (cutting grass, tending to garden, laundry, dinner, dishes, vacuuming, cleaning bathrooms, taking out trash). I was assured this would be an us thing and it would be used to teach our child some responsibility. 

Then, my significant other wanted a specific breed &amp; against my better judgement we put down a non refundable deposit of $500. I saw some concerns around the house as I ended up doing more and more of the household duties (now giving every bath to our child, doing bedtime myself, grocery shopping) all the whole I’ve noticed my significant other on their phone ignoring our life more and more. I bring up that we should just eat the $500 and not get the dog. My significant other then goes and tells my child they’re getting a dog for their birthday. Fml. 

So we get the dog, which in total costs $2400. Since we’ve gotten the dog it started biting and nipping, as puppies do. So my significant other says the dog and I need to do training together. In the last 3 months, I have been to training once a week, been getting up or staying up till midnight to let the dog out, getting up at 5 with the dog &amp; our child, and I am the only person to take the dog out, clean up accidents, or feed it. 

I am over the dog. I have spoken to my spouse about this and she continues to ignore me with normalizing dramatic excuses for why they cannot help. I am half tempted to get rid of the dog, eat the $2400 + vet bills, and move on with my life. What should I do?",02Aug2020,1

842,"TL;DR • Parents are alcoholics, drive drunk occasionally and don’t go a single day without drinking. Stepdad is verbally abusive but later proven to be physically abusive behind the scenes as well. Don’t want little sisters to grow up witnessing this. Wife is passionate for kids to have good homes, during emotional phone call told my mom that we would call CPS if they didn’t shape up / leave stepdad. Don’t know what to do, don’t want to ruin little sisters lives.

•••

^Sorry for this wall of text. 

My parents divorced eleven years ago. My stepdad, who is 10 years younger, and significantly less mature than my mother, also enters the picture about eleven years ago. He spends more than he makes on impulsive purchases, and is an alcoholic. My mother shortly becomes a alcoholic as well. About a year later, my sisters enter the picture. (This is why I believe they’re still together to this day.)

I was about 11 when my 21-year-old step-dad came into my life. I first-hand, have seen how angry he gets, but I’ve never actually witnessed him hitting my mom. He consistently gets angry as a result of his drinking and it never changed, my entire time of being there. I’ve even called the police because of them yelling and throwing stuff.

Fast forward to now. I left the house at 18 for the Army, and am far from my family now. I call them about weekly. My mom tries to keep the fact that my parents still fight and drink obsessively from me, although I know for fact it’s still a problem.

In July 4th weekend I tried calling them to see how they were doing / just for the holiday. They didn’t answer. Two days go by, they don’t answer or call. Finally, one of my sisters calls me and they casually tell me that they got in a huge fight and are separated, and “aren’t drinking anymore”.

I found out from my mom, when I called her shortly after, that they got in a huge fight. The cops were called by my uncle who, IMO, would normally be one not too quickly do that. He would be one to try to de-escalate the situation before anything. Well, she told me he hit her, and that’s why the cops were called. He’s not allowed on the property/near the kids for now. She’s told me she pressed charges, and that she has to be the one to let him back; however I don’t know exactly how the law works.

It was a very painful conversation for me because she told me it was the first and only time he’s laid his hands on her, however I don’t think it’s true. She already tries to hide all this conflict from me, and I believe she’s trying to protect me from learning his awful history. She pledged to me that she would stop drinking, and that he would not be allowed back in if he couldn’t pledge to stop drinking as well. She also told me she would tell me if/when he was going to come back. 

My wife was a huge victim of abusive parents and was actually in foster care for more than half of her childhood. She understands the system first hand, and cares just as deeply for my sisters as I do. She takes it personally that my mom isn’t trying to fix her alcoholism / the situation my little sisters have to grow up in. She is going to school to be a social worker. During our tense phone call, my wife exploded and told my mom (against my wishes) that she would have no choice but to call CPS on them if she couldn’t fix it. Of course, this didn’t go well, and the rest of the phone call was very emotional. We all ended up on “good terms”, but my wife worries my mom resents her.

My sisters’ birthday was last night, and I called them for it. Talking to my phone, it already sounds a little like she’s buzzed, but to make matters worse, I hear a deep, familiar voice briefly in the background. It 100% sounds like him. Of course, the voice ceases and shortly after, she “lets us go” to end the phone call. 

After we get off the phone, she innocently sends(shares) me posts off FB. She does do this occasionally but it seems quite obvious why she is so quick to do this now. This further sparks my suspicions.

This was last night. I plan to call today to try to talk to her about it. What advice would you give me? I don’t see a way out of this that won’t break my family apart. I want what’s best for my sisters over everything else. I don’t want them to get taken away by CPS... I just truthfully want this POS gone..",02Aug2020,1

845,"I’ve grown up looking at pornography since I was about 12.

852,"So, these past few days have been pretty hard on me. Let me explain. LONG POST AHEAD.

I am about to be a college freshman. In fact, I am moving to college in 15 days, as of writing this post (this is pretty important information for later.) I didn't go through any of the problems that most people have when it comes to finding a roommate and finding a good place to stay on campus. I got pretty lucky, to put it lightly. I was able to meet my roommate pretty early in the year, and we hit it off immediately. We got along so well, and college didn’t seem so scary when talking about all of the things we would do together. We started talking every day and buying dorm room items to coordinate our room. I even got a custom door sign with our names on it! Things were going really well, until the last week of July, where she told me some heartbreaking news over the phone.  


She called me to tell me that she isn’t coming to college this fall, and will be staying home. She told me the reason why, but I don’t remember, as I completely fogged over once the news hit me. Once she hung up, I sobbed on my bed for a full hour, and I’m still tearing up while writing this. The funny thing is that I'm not mad at her in the slightest, but I am heartbroken. The story doesn't end there though. There is more.   


With this sudden change of plans, I had to find a new roommate ASAP. I posted on this Facebook group that I was in and asked if anyone was still looking for a roommate. Some people reached out, and I got excited, but I found out quickly that they only wanted me to room with their current roommate, so they could move in with their friend, which is pretty scummy. Don't do this. Thankfully, I found one girl that was genuine and I planned to move her into my room as soon as I was able to.   


I rushed to my laptop and saw the worst thing I could find. My roommate had moved out already without telling me, and someone else had already reserved the space in the span of 30 seconds. The girl in question is a college junior, and I am only a freshman. I've already told my former roommate about the situation, and how hurt I am that she didn't tell me ahead of time. I've tried to reach out to the girl that has moved in, but I have gotten nothing from her.   


I am just defeated at this point, and I don't even know if I can do anything at this point. I am moving in 15 days, and I am just exhausted and depressed at how things turned out. If you have any advice, please tell me. I will do anything at this point. Even just some words of encouragement and support will help me a lot. TIA.",02Aug2020,1
853,"Brief backstory: I (25M) was born and raised in the Midwest, moved to the South for college, and have lived and worked in Atlanta for the past 3+ years (and loved it).

Recently I’ve started feeling the urge to move and start things over - even though I love the city, things haven’t turned out how I wanted, and I feel like I’m getting too comfortable with how things are to change them, if that makes sense (even before COVID).

I’ve always loved other big cities, particularly Chicago or LA/Southern California, and can see myself living + having a family in either someday. (Both are also closer to family in the Midwest and on the West Coast.) But leaving now feels like I’d be giving up, which I know I’d regret if I did (not to mention the cost of living). I’ve set a goal to turn things around by 30, with the caveat that if by then it’s time to leave, that I will. 

Has anyone else felt this kind of thing and how did you get through it/what did you do with it? 

Much appreciated in advance!!

858,"My poodle and I have been living alone together for the past 6 months.

We just signed a lease with 2 random girls that I found in a Facebook group. They are good friends though. I only spoke to one of the girls and didn't meet girl 2 til today when she moved in. 

I told her I have a dog and explained her personality, our schedule etc. I even offered to keep my pup in my room with me as much as possible. She said no worries, she can free roam! 

When I met girl 1 when i moved in a few days ago, she was a little taken back with my puppy's excitement and jumping. I told her i am working on it and explained she has to adjust to living with other people and is really stressed/excited. Girl 1 seems to like her though. 

Girl 1 told me to move my dog's bed to the hallway outside my bedroom. I put it in the living room, and it matches the decor and is nice. I have 2 beds for her, and this one stays in living area where she eats treats and chews and bone so it doesnt go all over the carpet and she can still be where the action is. She also told me to move the water bowl from the kitchen/front door area to outside my bedroom. I have another waterbowl in my room but like to keep one out there for when she is back from walks or just... not around this area of the apartment. I understand 100000% where they are coming from. But now, they have a huge tredmill taking over the living room. But I cant have a dog bed in the corner?  i dont wanna argue cause its like them against me.

Girl 2 moved in today and is acting very scared of my dog? Then she speaks in a diff language to girl 1. She called me and said my dog is in her room as she was setting up, so i had to lock my dog in my room with me while she whined and sat by the door. Then the same girl called me and said that my dog jumped on her? She seems really petty btw, but again, I totally see this from her eyes and get it if she doesnt like dogs and it IS annoying. But what do I do, chase my dog around the house and everywhere she goes? Lock her in my room? Like what do they expect. Again I told them the settle signal to do when she is excited to stop jumping. This girl is just acting strange.

Aside from the doggy stuff, they have taken over all kitchen cabinets, and the living area, and kitchen area. They moved my stuff into a closet and then put their stuff there, and its just a mess. Again, I feel like it is them against me.  Not to mention, theyre fucking lucky to be living with a standard poodle puppy.",02Aug2020,1
859,"I’m leaving the title ambiguous. First of all let me say growing up knowing I was autistic was a blessing and a curse. I work so hard trying to fix my personal shortcomings and I try so hard to fit in. However try as I might sometimes things I say or do just don’t stick well with certain groups. I think I’m just too much of an individual to fit into a group.

There’s a saying “know your audience” but I cannot tell you how difficult that is for me. I’ve only told my closest friends I have autism. I want to be treated with the same respect at work as everyone else, which means I’m expected to act like a normal person, which isn’t true. But if I tell people I’m autistic, I know I’m painting a giant target on myself to be mocked, or worse, avoided and ignored. I’ve been avoided most of my life.

I get along with people just enough to seem normal, but if I get too excited or stressed out in a social situation, my brain just shuts off and stupid shit can happen. I’m surrounded by interesting people every day at work and I can hold a conversation, but at home, I’m alone. I have a very hard time getting close with other people.

I’ve never really went to any parties in high school, or college for that matter. I’m not a virgin, but I don’t call one night stands with tinder matchups to be very successful nights. (No girlfriends since high school either) It’s not that I wasn’t invited, it’s that I simply didn’t know anyone. It’s kind of my fault I think, but I can’t help but feel so jealous of others who have had experiences I know I may never have. 

I wanted to mention this, even if it’s not totally related. BUT just because I haven’t been to any parties doesn’t mean I haven’t tried drugs. I’ve done loads of psychedelics. I strongly believe they helped me come out of my shell, but I was out of control until very recently. They’re part of the reason I’m transferring schools, among other universal issues... Shoutout to my best friends for helping me chill out on the substance abuse. Unfortunately I don’t get much sympathy for being a drug abuser, so I keep that shit super private, too.

However, growing up with autism is not all that terrible. It’s quite lonely, but I think I have a pretty wild imagination that I use to fuel my fantasy writing. One of my biggest life goals has been to write a novel based upon the crazy daydreams I used to have as a child. I’m very inspired by authors of modern fantasy. Admittedly, it makes me sad to know that there are people in this world that don’t feel like they have a purpose in life.

Also, I think that having a no bullshit attitude about myself has helped tremendously. I accept who I am, I don’t tell myself lies, and I accept that the most discriminated population in the world is the individual, especially (in my opinion) individuals with mental disorders.

Although sometimes I’m looked down upon for “not living in reality” I think reality just kind of fucking stinks. Screw you realists for trying to make me feel bad that I cope with the human condition by deluding myself! Even if I had everything I wanted, there would still be something that bothers me. Anxiety and suffering are universal truths in this world, and up to us to find meaning in our suffering.

Maybe I don’t know what I’m talking about. I just hope somebody reads this whole thing and takes some time to help. Take care everyone!",02Aug2020,1

I work at a clothing store. My area requires masks but people don’t like to wear them so I spend half my shift asking people to put their masks back on. I feel like the mask police because I don’t want to be the reason that any more people get COVID. Today my store let a woman in who claimed a “medical exemption.” She shopped for half an hour. No mask. Not social distancing. Crowding others. I was working in the fitting rooms and she came in so that her (teen/young adult) daughter could try on clothes. There’s no way to social distance in the fitting room. The hall is too narrow. I asked her to give me 6 ft so that I could open the room for her daughter. The daughter kept pulling her mask down so I kept reminding her to pull it up. I stayed 10 feet away on the other side of the hallway the fitting rooms are in. We got busy and she kept brushing past other costumers who were wearing masks. The line got backed up because I refused to go within 6 feet of her and she was standing in the middle of the hallway. 

Her daughter locked herself out of the fitting room, meaning that I had to go unlock it again. I asked her to give me 6ft so that I could. She started yelling at me about her she has a medical condition and can’t wear a mask. I told her that doesn’t matter. She eventually stepped back and I unlocked the door. But on my way back to the other side of the hall she approached me and I wasn’t able to stay 6ft away. I have now been potentially exposed to COVID. I texted my manager under the table that I couldn’t do it and he needed to have someone else take over the fitting rooms. I told him that I’m not willing to risk my life like that for $10/hr and I ended up going home when they asked me to touch the clothes that she was holding. 

My boyfriends mother was planning on coming to visit this weekend but now that’s been pushed back again. Last time he was exposed to a customer who had just tested positive for COVID and decided to go shopping anyway. I’m self isolating in the spare bedroom for now. I feel so guilty that he is suffering because of my decisions. I don’t know if I should go back to work or not. Apparently this is a rare occurrence. One manager said that I could claim a medical exemption to not be required to serve people who aren’t wearing masks. 

I know I’m not self isolating. I’m no better than any of the people out going to malls right now. I know I left my coworkers high and dry on tax free weekend which is one of the busiest days of the years. I feel so guilty about this whole situation but I feel stuck. What should I have done?

868,"Hey guys. My relationship (10 years, both adults) suddenly hit a turn for the worse. We definitely almost broke up. We are both at our wits end but we still love each other and want to be together. We just are tired and hurt and don't know if it's good for us anymore. We have been to therapy together and separate and last year was definitely the worst year from start to finish.

The issues at hand are valid. Last year was horrible and we are both still recovering, but things had been good for a few months now. We worked together and came up with a plan to address our current problems in a healthy way, and this is encouraging because we could do this without therapy and we both feel good about our plan. We have already started implementing things, so we are able to follow through. These are all big improvements from therapy.

The problem is, hurtful things were said, things feel grim, and we are having trouble moving back to a good place mentally/emotionally for our plans to really help us. 

How can we forget the things that were said and just act like things are normal? Is it possible to just act like things are normal to have them BECOME normal? Have you ever been able to pull your relationship back together when you really felt like it could be finished? Thanks and I wish everyone the best.",02Aug2020,1
869,"Title sums it up. My boyfriend (25m) has depression, and has for several years, and since his depression started has gained more and more weight. He is now 100lbs over his healthy weight. His weight is making him more depressed though, which leads him to eat more food because it's the only thing that makes him feel better, and even though he knows consciously that that's not right, he can't not do it. 

And just for context, he is on medication for his depression, he is exercising, and he has tried therapy (he didn't like it, I know that people will say he needs to try another one and I agree, but he just needs to decide to do that on his own terms). We've tried a lot of things, like keto and calorie counting and eating more or less of different food groups, but nothing seems to work or stick. Calorie counting got him the furthest for the few weeks he did it, but it was so hard to keep up with it because of how fast paced his life necessarily has to be because of work that he keeps falling out of the habit. 

Does anyone have any advice? I don't know what else to try. I'm not sure why everything is so hard to stick to. He's always stressed and that causes him to stress eat, which makes him more stressed and depressed, and the cycle continues. Any advice would be appreciated.",02Aug2020,1

871,"It’s completely fucked up but it’s something I (F20) have wanted for a long time, probably since about 6th grade. I’m not really attracted to him physically and he’s kinda annoying to be around. It’s definitely something I long for more when he isn’t around than then he is. It’s something I have thought about regularly for years though and get extremely turned on when I fantasize about it. With all these years of build up, it wouldn’t take long at all for my legs to start shaking if he was inside me.

I think the rape part to it is partially my submissive side and that I love being controlled and forced to do things, but I think part of it is also because I want this to happen but for it not to be my fault. It can happen and I would never have to admit how much I wanted it. 

Lately, I’ve been considering just telling him about it because I am pretty sure he would be down. But I don’t know if I will regret it later. Or if the fact I had sex with my father would be a secret that just replaces the secret of wanting to. And then i’m still stuck with something I want to talk about but can’t.

873,"So two years ago I began working at this upscale grocery store in the 
Health/Beauty department...

it was great, until about one year later myself and another coworker were moved into the Grocery department because that's where hours were needed.

The manager there was definitely and unhealthy ISTJ, the complete opposite of the woman that managed Health+Beauty... this guy was my age (late 20's), and was insensitive, never showed appreciation or encouragement, literally always serious with me, never said hello to anyone... clearly an emotionally unhealthy person. I'm the opposite of all that, so you can imagine we clashed a lot.

So my time in Health+Beauty, one full year, I was never was written up and never had any conflict with management... 

I was in Grocery for 8 months and written up 4 times, and fired... 

This Grocery manager, let's call him Shane, would micromanage and constantly get on me for the most minor of things... 

I would politely tell him via email how much this stresses me out since I'm a sensitive person... 

His response to that would be to be calm and sensitive for one day, and then revert back to his harsh intense demeanor...

he actually amped up his intensity and would be even more overbearing on me, and before I knew it I was called in for a writeup... 

1) didn't organize the aisles perfectly...

2) I didn't clean the shelf strips how he wanted... I thought he meant sanitize them, when apparently he meant to clean off the sticker residue and to him it's a ""black and white issue""

3) He also loosely manages health/beauty and wrote me up for not fully working backstock, like excess product we keep in the warehouse. The assistant manager never said it was wrong to work backstock this way.

4) After two months of adapting once again, being completely focused and working with all my heart, he wrote me up for missing literally two items in backstock... this was a week where I was tasked with working like five literal times more backstock than usual because we were short-handed... i remember it being like 100 degrees back there and climbing up in these bays and i just missed two items in the back.

And then, I was fired.

***** The greatest injustice is that ALL of these writeups were during times where I was very distraught, stressed out due to Shawn being so intense with me... 

he made me feel like I was always walking on eggshells. He doesn't see that he could be an efficient manager and still be gentle hearted and uplifting and encouraging.

I told Shawn numerous times all year long how it's a very tough time outside of work. I cried at work numerous times due to Shawn's intense behavior... even aside from that, his write ups were not fair.

Around my second writeup I had a strong feeling that Shawn was already planning to fire me through these unjust writeups... 

I told HR and emailed regional HR a very thorough detailed statement to undo these writeups, and she told me she was unbiased yet did not remove any of them.

I built such a strong case for myself and store management and local HR, even Shawn told me that they are not wanting to fire me, but they did...

They gave me such a stronger level of scrutinization, and anybody would be fired if they received my level of scrutiny... yet nobody did.

I corrected myself every time after each writeup, and they found something else to write me up for that was so minor.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough and they were going to fire me eventually no matter how hard I work. I believe they all conspired to do fire me.

Shawn wanted me out. I was the odd guy out who was a gentle-hearted person. They want the opposite, like a military mindset.  I was outstanding with customer service and progressed by leaps and bounds after each writeup and it was always overlooked how much stress Shawn put me through.

Does this seem unfair?",02Aug2020,1

I have some equipment already given to me from the OT- on Tuesday they are coming out to asses me further and looking at more support for me. Recently I was in an abusive relationship. I reported him to the police. The police told him not to contact me under any circumstances. He did try to keep contacting me. I changed my number but he tried adding me on fake Facebook accounts- I noticed straight away they was fake and blocked them.  which was also reported to the police. I am scared of him.

Hello, I’m 14 years old, and I’m very ambitious, I have a lot of goals I wanna complete in this life. Within my country the legal age of having a job is age 16, I am not willing to wait that long for my success or waste valuable time. Not to mention those jobs would be working hard instead of smart, I still wanna work really hard. It’s just the downsides outweigh the positives.

My goal right now is to do something to consistently earn money equal to a minimum age worker. Which I know is very difficult to do at my age, and I will know I will have to sacrifice a lot of time and energy. I’ve been trying TikTok but the platform is very competitive, almost everything being done and has already been done. Has been done. I will still continue tiktok but it’s clear it’s a waste of my time.

Is anyone aware of a loophole or an ongoing business that someone is able to do, that doesn’t require a specific age. I am willing to put a lot of time into this. My honest goal is to make enough money that will convince my mother, University isn’t nessasary(I may and will probably still go, I just don’t like that pressure on my mother and myself) Which I know is completely delusional(especially as an immigrant poor family) but the life I see myself doing if I go there all into UNI Is quite depressing.

My friends live there and because of a horrible time at highschool , i hate the area where i live and theres no longer anything here for me.

Moving out isnt really an option for me as much as i wish it was as i dont have a job and doubt i will be able to get one that could afford a place in the city anytime soon.

So I'm 19 living at home in the UK, and was enrolled in A-levels until covid hit and I went kinda off the rails education wise. I've been working for the last couple months through covid but I dont want to stay where I'm at. For context I have had a pretty ""colourful"" past in education getting kicked out a couple schools when I was younger. But that isnt a issue so much now, although I do still have a EHCP. So my question is what should I do moving foward education wise, cause i want to move into either estate agency or Bussiness management. But that's not set in stone but it will definitely be something finance related. So the only options I see are start A-levels again and just loose a year although idk if anyone would even take me at that point. Or work my way up. Atm my only qualifications are 8 GCSEs A-c and a couple Ds.

887,"First of all, I know I am going to get a lot of hate for this but please hear me out. My boyfriend and I have been together for over 4 years now. About a year into our relationship we got a cat who I love very much. My boyfriend had a dog who was really sweet but old when we started dating. The dog died in January of 2019 while we were living together. This was and is very hard for him as the dog was his emotional support animal for many years. It was very much a traumatic experience for both of us, but we have been working through it. We have lived together off and on due to school and other circumstances for about two years now and honestly we have very little problems. We moved into a place of our own about a year ago and are very happy together. 

Shortly after moving into our apartment, my boyfriend started talking about getting a new dog. I at first said absolutely not. I didn’t want to bring a dog to live in an apartment unless it was a small dog and I am not a huge fan of small dogs, so we weren’t going to get a dog. After we had lived in our apartment for a while we found out there was a dog park within a mile away that my boyfriend convinced me we could take a dog to everyday. I still was not totally convinced on getting a dog which made my boyfriend pretty sad for a while. 

Weeks had gone by and with more and more convincing from my boyfriend I started to come around to the idea that a dog wouldn’t be a bad idea. Our roommate moved out so we had some extra space, the dog park had really good reviews online, and my boyfriend had done a lot of research into getting a dog. I at one point even said that i too wanted a dog. I still had conditions though. 

1: I didn’t want a big dog -even though we were gonna take the dog on walks and out every day I still didn’t want a big dog in our tiny two bed apartment 
2: I didn’t want a puppy - my boyfriend and I are both working class and spend 30-40 hours at our jobs every week even with the pandemic. Most days our schedules are opposite so the dog wouldn’t have to be alone for very long but some days the dog would have to be alone for upwards of 5 hours and I don’t want to do that to a young dog who needs to be potty trained and constantly looked after. I am also a nanny and a puppy is a lot like looking after a kid. I don’t want to spend all day looking after kids and then come home just to do the same thing in my home life where I try to relax. 
3: I didn’t want to get a dog from a breeder - there are so many animals in shelters that are so smart and are just as worthy of love and affection as a purebred animal. +pure bred animals almost always have some sort of genetic mutation or health issue because of inbreeding that we just can’t afford. 
4:I wanted a smart dog - you know how sometimes you can look into a dogs eyes and just tell that they have nothing going on inside their head? That might sound mean but I feel like I can always tell when a dog is actually listening to me and is intelligent vs when a dog is just always food focused and doesn’t listen at all. 
So after we had decided that we were going to get a dog we looked around at shelter websites because the actual shelters in our area have not opened back up yet. I was looking for a 1-2 year old medium to small sized mutt who was potty trained and good around other animals. That is what I thought that my boyfriend was looking for as well. After a little while, all the dogs we found either had already been adopted and the websites weren’t updated yet, or they never responded to our applications. 

I thought that we were just gonna give up. About three weeks ago I went out of town for a week to visit some family and while I was gone my boyfriend messaged me and said that he had heard back from a shelter and was going to pick up “the perfect pup”. Him using the word pup didnt worry me because that’s just what he calls all dogs. “Puppy” could be a 17 year old dog. He didn’t send me any pics Bc he wanted me to be surprised when I came home. I came home three days later to a 4 month old dog who was already bigger than any size dog I could have wanted. 

I love her and she is so sweet, but I just can’t handle a puppy. I am very much a cat person because they are very lowkey and I am a very high anxiety person. Having a dog in our apartment that’s already 25lbs at 4 months has added a lot to my already stressful life. I spend all day at work trying to potty train and discipline and I just did not want to do that when I came home. She is also really big and jumps on my very submissive cat a lot to the point where I have to call her or even pull her off sometimes. 

My boyfriend does do a lot with her and I know he is making progress and that she is just a puppy and things take time, but on days where he’s at work and I have to take care of her she just completely drains me of what little energy I have. Like I said, I love her and I care about her so it’s hard for me to even consider not having her anymore after a short period of time, but I feel like my boyfriend shouldn’t have gotten a puppy in the first place. I am scared to talk to him about it because when he’s with her he’s the happiest I’ve seen him a long time. I just don’t know what to do or how to approach my boyfriend about this. He followed the second two of my conditions, but the first two were not. Is half enough? Please help.",02Aug2020,1

891,"So, this is a story about a damsel in distress guarded by a toxic dragon. Except the damsel is my ex-boyfriend and the dragon is his mother. And I'm the knight who gave up trying to rescue him, because he's afraid of letting go of the beast. 

So far so good. But he started to copy everything that I do, which makes me feel more and more uncomfortable. It seems like he sees my happiness and well being and tries to resemble it with f.ex. buying the same or better physical goods. Today he even bought a new computer to play the Witcher 3 (he wasn't interested in neighter a PC nor the game until I said that I'm saving money for it) just to be superior. 

Now, the dreams. He appears in them, always just skin and bones, half dead, trying to create physical contact with me. In my last dream, I was living in a castle and he  was at the door. I let him in, he looks frightening, soaking wet from the rain, basically a skeleton with skin. He wanted to kiss me and passed out.

I know, weird dreams happen. But it got creepy, when my mother told me this morning, that he was in her dream, too. Nothing specific, just creepy and dying as in my dreams. 

The problem is: I can't just walk away. I deeply hope that he'll get out of the dragons cave. His mother destroyed his psyche and is highly effective at implanting a new reality into his brain. She completely changed the days, when I broke up with him in his head and made me look like a racist piece of trash, although I didn't say a word about races, we're both white.

I am fostering, potentially to adopt, a 1 year old pit/boxer.  She is a real sweetheart and generally good on leash, laid back, friendly with strangers and other dogs, etc.  I have had her since yesterday and I know she is decompressing from probably a stressful time at a kennel and whatever else she has been through, I don’t know her back story, and I am being patient with her and trying to go at her own pace.  She is super affectionate and wants attention all the time so I’m not sure how nervous she is, it is hard to tell, definitely a little jumpy.  However, 2 things have come up.

1.  she doesn’t seem interested in food at all.  I have to practically force her to eat and drink it is starting to worry me, she hasn’t finished a meal and I’m using good kibble with wet mixed in.  Treats sometimes she will take but she is super ambivalent about them, she won’t touch her water bowl and will only drink if I get a cup fill it up and bring it to her.  It’s weird cause she is happy and loves long walks and cuddles and plays a little and seems fine otherwise.  She is getting enough food with this work, but It is worrying me, and also making everything I have read and told about training obsolete, as she doesn’t care at all about food or treats and therefore doesn’t care at all about trying to get them.  It is also making me worried she might be sick, she ate breakfast but it took an hour and she didn’t even finish it.  High quality treats, of many different kinds, she will eat sometimes, other times she will just spit them out and leave them on the floor, and she never is motivated at all for them I practically have to force the issue to reward her.  

2.  The place I am fostering with requires crates, crate training, for the dog to be in crate when u leave and at night, etc.  However I have watched 10 YouTube videos on crate training and spent 7 30 minute intervals trying and she just won’t go in at all. I got her in once last night with a kong (the one treat she shows even a tiny bit of interest in, although still not much) and was able to have her sleep in it, but now it’s almost like she remembers that and has no interest in any of my treat tricks.  When I got her in I didn’t close it immediately I did one 20 minute session with door open I’ve tried the in and out and everything, but she just wants none of it.  She will literally lay down and go to sleep in front of it rather than go to the front, not even the back, of the crate and lick the rest of the kong.  It isn’t even far enough in where she would have to put her front paws in.  I know I’m not supposed to force her in, so I think I might just have to let her sleep outside of it?  Any advice would be appreciated !",02Aug2020,1

I feel that my life is not going anywhere everything that I wanted to do has been scrapped because of corona. My dreams and aspirations on hold with no sign of them returning. 

I’m hard working, motivated (when it’s about my passion) but everything I do seems so pointless at the moment. All my hobbies have become boring, I look more forward to work than my days off. Every time I finish work for the weekend, on my walk home I feel this sense of emptiness, yeah I’ve finished work, but now what? I go and sit at home for 2 days then I’m back at work. It’s not like I don’t do anything on my days off I go out with friends, I play sport but when it’s all done I’m just bored and feel numb.

900,"I'm (24) in this dilemma and debating between inviting my friend or better known as an 'acquaintance"" for my birthday trip.

She's my best friend's closest friend- let's call her 'Amy'. I've known her for a couple years now but haven't been able to get close to her because of an issue that happened with her boyfriend- let's call him 'Steve.'

I've known Steve since he was in middle school &amp; long story short- he basically told me he liked me when he was already talking to Amy. So I brought it up to my best friends attention who then told Amy.

She's really cool with me when we all hangout as a group, but she will plan her own things such has her birthday and I have never been invited. We live in the same city, whereas all our other friends have moved.

So, when my best friend hosts her birthday party and I make the drive (2 hours drive) to see her and I see Amy there it's always awkward for the both of us, because we both know we could've just driven together, but we just don't.

She recently broke up with Steve, and now I'm debating about reaching out to her to invite her to my birthday. A part of me wants to put it all behind and try to get close to her, but I'm afraid of being too nice &amp; put myself out there if she's not going to reciprocate that to me. The other part of me just wants to realize that we are just not friends and say ""f her"" for the times I wasn't invited.",02Aug2020,1

902,"Hi everyone, 

  
I am going to graduate from college soon. I am signed by a modeling agency and have been shooting, but have not been making money yet, as I am building my portfolio. (these are called test shoots and are normal, I am not being scammed) 

  
If the coronavirus never happened, I would have gone to LA and begun the process of making money (something that can take up to 6 months because of the time it takes magazines to be published). However, because of the virus when I graduate in December I will go to LA for the first time and begin working as a model. 

  
However, I am pursuing an opportunity to teach English in Japan (please don't judge my competency from a reddit post lol) and it would begin in august of next year and last a year. 

  
My feeling is that taking this position may essentially tank my opportunity to model. I am getting pretty old to have no real experience in the modeling world. I am worried to bring this up to my agent, as I think she would be pretty mad lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Modeling has the *potential* to be a high paying career, while the teaching will not be lucrative but will give me life experience. I could always model for a year and *then* teach in japan but I don't want to waste too much time, however, it may not be that big of a deal. also, my boyfriend is applying with me and it would be awesome if we could do it together.

905,"I'm 23 and since I've been through mental health issues which led me to leave college in 2017. Since then my focus is on getting help for my mental health. Fast forward to 2020, doing much better and had plans to get a job to gain work experience but COVID19 hit and my plans still held back but it is what it is cant control about what's going on this planet. I've always had trouble on what I want to do with my life. I jumped on different careers that might seem interesting like radiology when I was a junior in High School. Then I thought about nah not my thing. Then I wasn't sure on what to do. I tried in college in 2017 majoring in Liberal Arts and then switched to Travel, Tourism and Hospitality but then my mental health began to take a turn for the worst which led me to leave college. It's been a struggle for a few years. Last year I was doing better with my OCD that I decided to enlist in a career program and I did Hospitality in a culinary school that has courses on culinary and hospitality. I did my best but again my anxiety about not being social and not understanding led me to not go to school and I drop out of the culinary school. Which I went back to therapy for my social anxiety and low self esteem. Now, I'm doing better but with this pandemic still lingering around the world, my plans have backtrack. So, in terms of what I want to do with my life, I'm just confused on what I want in life. I do want to help others in life, first I considered being a life coach. Then my OCD group therapist told me to become a peer support specialist but then on the application that I need to have a reference to see how I improved and how I qualify to help others. A medical provider nor family members are not allowed to write the reference to me. So, my group therapist said to research on careers or certifications on continuing education. I researched and one interested me is being a Medical interpreter. (I'm fluent in Spanish) The course is two months to complete and get my certification through my old community college I went to several years ago. But the thing is the course is $1125 USD (There's a payment plan option) I'm stuck in terms of college. I don't really feel like committing to go to college for four years and being in debt. But college in a way is important to get a college education but also hearing that people get bachelor's degree and still can't find a job related to their major. They end up doing a job that is unrelated to their majors. I'm just stuck in this trap of what I really want in life. For me I want at least financial security and have a good life, travel and live life full of happy memories.",02Aug2020,1

907,"I've been best friends with M and C all through my last year of college, we graduated together! For about a year straight, we played video games together every night online and we were very tight.

But then, a new person is added into the picture. We'll call him J.

J have been best friends with M and C for years. We decide that M, C, J, and I will play this campaign-like adventure game together so we play for a few weeks almost every night but J and I don't get along. He's very rude, and obviously not very interested in playing the game. 

One night, he's being very rude and unhelpful to me so I straight-up ask him why he's being ""*such an ass tonight*""...

That sets him off, he goes into a rage and starts calling me names and pretty much every profanity he can think of obviously with some pent up resentment he had for me for a very long time, like a shaken soda being opened for the first time.

I mute his microphone, and instead he goes to typing profanities to me in a childish rage.

**The real problem:**

All while this exchange is taking place, I'm just telling J to shutup.

M and C are listening and saying absolutely nothing. I'm getting verbally barraged and made fun of physically and M and C aren't backing me up at all. Not trying to defuse the situation, not trying to call J out on his bullshit and support me as their friend. 

I ask M and C ""are you guys going to do anything or will you just let J treat me like this?"" They don't say anything, and keep playing as if nothing is happening.

**Aftermath:**

After that night, we haven't spoke for about 3 months. The only communication I've had is reaching out to M and C saying how I was disappointed they didn't support me that night, and their only response was that they ""didn't want to take sides"". 

It hurts because I went from having a few best friends that I still see playing with each other every night on the video games I love to play, while I feel FOMO and that I lost my best friends.

**TDLR:**

I was verbally abused by a friend-of-a-friend as my best friends watched and did absolutely nothing to support me.

I’m in total shock but I can’t begin to imagine how he feels right now. He usually doesn’t show emotion at all. I’ve been with him 2 years and I’ve only seen him cry once and that was 3 weeks ago when his grandmother got admitted to the hospital. I need advice on how to approach him right now since he doesn’t really cry or talk about anything that upsets him. Should I ask him if he wants to talk? Should I get him flowers or a picture of him and her? I haven’t had someone this close to me lose a beloved family member so I want to make sure Im there for them in every way right now.

915,"I came across a rental that I liked, so I applied for a 6-month lease. I paid the application fees (about $560) and was approved 2 days later. The issue is that when I went to review my lease agreement, the dates were off. Instead of the 6 months I applied for, there were 12. 

I’m aware that the typical apartment lease is 12 months, but due to the current times we are in, I wanted to play it safe and go with 6 and see where things are about 4 months in. After I saw the lease terms had been changed by someone, I let the leasing agent know what was going on, and he explained that they were unable to accommodate a 6-month lease, but could do 10. I asked him why this was an option on the application, and he just apologized and said it should not have been. 

My question is, is it reasonable to request a full refund of the fees I paid to apply since they aren’t honoring things on their end? The application states that the admin fee would be refunded if the applicant was denied, but it doesn’t refund the fee for the credit/background check. I think a full refund is fair considering the fact that the rental application gave the option of 6, 9, or 12-month leases, and I selected/applied for 6. 

This is my first apartment rental, so please let me know if I’m missing something here. Thank you!",02Aug2020,1

I don’t use English as first language and aside from school, i largely learned English through tv - especially “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” which, obviously, uses a lot of slang so i naturally adapted some of it. While i generally don’t use slang nowadays (mainly because i got used to business English), i still use it occasionally when it “fits the situation”.

Besides English i also speak several other languages, and in none of them people make an “issue” out of how i speak it so it’s simply very confusing/difficult to understand.

918,"As the title says, we are new homeowners who have lived in our house for a month now. Our home is a new house that was built on a 0.84 acre lot in the fall of 2019. The lot was purchased during an estate sale in 2018 by a builder. The builder demolished the old house and got rid of many trees on the lot. Basically, our home and yard look nothing like what was here 2 years ago. 

We only have neighbors on our left side (other side is a road) who have lived here for 20 years. Their yard has a lot of landscaping and is about 0.6 acres according to records online. One of our neighbors is always outside working on his yard. 

For the 4 months we were waiting to close, the builder never mowed the lawn. The lawn was mowed right before we closed, but we lost a lot of our backyard to tall weeds that were not removed. 

We have since had a company come and remove the weeds, mow, etc. in order to regain our full backyard. Every time a worker is here, our neighbor will come over to the worker, sometimes interrupting them while mowing, to talk to them. The neighbor has even walked over to the far side of our yard to look at our property line. We have 2 surveys (old and current) and have had our landscapers find our lot markers. The neighbor has also come into our yard to remind us numerous times of the easement between our lots. He also has gone into the back end of our lot to look at our lot markers (our yard extends further back than his yard). 

We are trying to be friendly and respectful neighbors, but I don’t like that the he keeps walking in our backyard like he is “inspecting” our land.

923,"TL/DR: How do I approach this subject without hurting feelings even though I really want to say WTF?! 

My wife (44) and I (M, 46) have been separated for 4 1/2 years. We’ve recently begun communication more and have been dating again, working towards a better relationship for the last several months. We have a 13 year old daughter who we were both taking care of where she split time between the both of us on a regular schedule. We’ve always communicated and there has never been any animosity towards each other. 

During my separation, 4 and a half years ago my sister (43) fell on hard times and moved in with me while she got herself on her feet. She has two other daughters who she shares custody of with their father. Her youngest daughter (16) is extremely close with my daughter, and they are thick as thieves. She is in a regular rotation with her father also so spends time here with her mother when she has her. 

Both my niece and my sister spent over a year at my place a couple years ago. Her oldest daughter spent some time here too. My sister eventually got herself established with her career, licensed massage therapist, renting a studio office and using that as her residence. 

Thinking all is well, I had an opportunity to take a job out of state on contract for a year, which I discussed with my wife and daughter. I left for a year, maintained communication with family then returned home. During my time away, my mother watched  over my house, which I’m sure my sister spent time there as well. 

February of 2020, No more than 2 weeks back, my sister says she needs to stay with me for a little bit as she’s working on a loan approval towards a new house, and needs to show a certain amount of time of self employment for approval. She also says that she got busted by the landlord for staying at the office so now she needs a place to stay so she can’t call her office her home anymore. Mind you her daughter stays with her on rotation still. 

Me being her brother, of course I’m obligated to help her. So I do, gladly. Every time she’s with me, I do for her and my niece to include my daughter. Dinners, breakfasts, snacks. Family outings. Movies. I pay for it all. I ask her for nothing in return. But lately I’m feeling a little taken advantage of. She never replenishes regularly consumed groceries like bottled water, doesn’t ask to do anything, never takes out the trash and acts like she just wants to stay out of my way and not bother me. But she sleeps on my couch and it’s not like I have a big condo. 
She will buy food for her and her daughter, sometimes offering to buy fast food for the girls if my daughter is with me. 

Then COVID comes along and really messes us all up. Initially she stopped working due to the virus, applied for unemployment and received stimulus money. My wife and I did not experience any disruption thankfully. My sister just recently returned to work due to restrictions being eased. During our reconciliation my wife and I have been talking about purchasing a new home and we are looking forward to beginning a new chapter in our life. 

 My sister says she’s still working on getting her place but I feel like she’s not where she needs to be financially.  I am at the point in my life, that even if I was not going to continue with my wife, that I would still be on a path to make some life changes and continue on and selling my house and purchasing a bigger home is paramount. 

I’m concerned my sister is going to want to tag along or find someway to stay with me again and I honestly am not comfortable with this. She’s my sister, but I’d really like to be able to walk around naked some days, be intimate with my wife, enjoy my quiet time without having to wonder if she’s going to walk in at any given time or waking up to her on our couch. 

I’m trying to figure out how to approach this without it getting incendiary as deep discussions usually do with her. I feel like she doesn’t have her priorities figured out as she could have easily found a place to rent, but is hell bent on owning a house. I get it, but I feel like she needs to make some changes in order for her dreams to come true. I feel bad for her daughter, my niece, and try to be a father figure for her whenever I can. But I also don’t want her to think that I’m getting a bigger place so she can just move in with me. 

She has some medical expenses which I offered to pay, but she hasn’t taken me up on it, but how much more can I do to help her when also trying to get my own life together? 

It’s awkward when my wife and I wake up now and she’s on the couch. I’m left wondering if she’s going to come in the middle of the night, so now we can’t spend time in our own living room because  that’s her sleep spot.

926,"This is going to be long, I'm sorry. 

I (23F) met my boyfriend (26M) 6 years ago and we started dating 2 years ago. He lived in a different state at the time but I was still in college (commuter), so he quickly (matter of months) moved to my hometown and we moved in together. We've had our ups and downs but one of our biggest issues is our friends. He left all his behind and doesn't see them often. Up until a couple months ago, all my (two) friends lived over an hour away. One recently moved back and I've seen her much more frequently. As a result, I've seen my second friend more frequently with the first friend. So I've been going out quite a bit more in recent months. I think he's been jealous and resentful that he doesn't have friends here. 

Yesterday he was applying to a job and I didn't inquire because I thought it was part time, as a second job here. I got bored today and asked what the job was. He said it was a driving job (what he does now) in his home state. I got kind of bothered because he didn't mention seriously wanting to move back. 

He said it's up to me whether or not I come with him. I've *always* wanted to move away from my hometown. There's nothing wrong with it but I've been here 23 years, I feel like there's more out there. But issue is, his friends don't like me and I don't really like them. I think it's fair to assume that when he moves back, he's gonna see them a lot more and I'll frequently be left out. The reasons I don't like them largely center around jealously. His one best friend, a dude, is the reason we met and I love him. But it's his girlfriend and all her friends that I avoid. I *know* this is super immature. 

I don't know what to do. I know it's childish, and toxic, to still be jealous of other girls and them being near my boyfriend but I just don't know how I'll handle it. They all push boundaries in some way but I don't feel like it's right to ask him to not see them. 

Lastly, I finally have a job I love. It pays next to nothing but I don't hate my life like I have in previous roles. I don't really want to leave it but it also has nothing to do with my degree so maybe it makes sense to move on. 

Maybe I'm just being childish. Has anyone else been in this situation? Will my problems just sort themselves out if I go with the flow? What can I do to alleviate my fears and make an informed decision? Someone help, please.",02Aug2020,1

932,"So I (16F) have a sister (12F) who’s been struggling for awhile. When she was younger she was physically violent, and luckily that’s gotten better but she has her moments. She also is insanely emotional. She’s not allowed to eat a lot of sugar (medical reasons) so if she so much as sees me with anything she can’t have, she freaks out and screams. She has very few friends, and the only things I ever see her do (granted i work a lot so I don’t see her much) is talk on the phone with her friend that moved away. She talks sometimes to my parents and I about how she has no friends and how horrible her life is. 

Our most recent problem is the horses. I have one personal horse who I own outright, and my family has one lease horse. The lease horse was originally gotten back in May for my sis but she’s only ridden her about 4? Times. She doesn’t like her and has expressed how she doesn’t like riding. I feed both horses every day, take care of all of their medical needs, tack, etc. I’ve started letting my friends ride the lease horse and one has been riding her a few times a week with me. I, to other people, call her my horse. 

Sister gets EXTREMELY emotional whenever I say this near her, even when she isn’t part of the conversation. She will scream and cry that she’s her horse and to never say that. Every time I just say she’s your horse when you take care of her (something she never does) and try to end it there. She screams like a banchee when I take my car to see my friends, or am allowed to do something she’s not. She also screams when she doesn’t get her way (I.E. mum didn’t buy the food she wanted, won’t get her Starbucks, etc) and she has zero ability to take any form of criticism, even from our own mum. Today, she was told to step back since she was infront of Someone while walking dogs and she pouted and stomped her feet. 

I give lessons and work at a summer camp and I’ve never seen a 12 year old that’s so emotional or unable to communicate about negative things such as her. 

Today I brought up with our mum that I believe she may have Borderline Personality Disorder. Here’s a list of symptoms from wiki:

Markedly disturbed sense of identity
Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, and extreme reactions to such
✅Splitting (""black-and-white"" thinking)
✅Impulsive or reckless behaviors
✅Intense or uncontrollable emotional reactions that are disproportionate to the event or situation
✅Unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships
Self-damaging behavior
✅Distorted self-image
Dissociation
✅Frequently accompanied by depression, anxiety, anger, substance abuse, or rage

My mum has always talked about how emotional my sister is and I think it’s her way of downplaying my sister’s problems. I tried to bring this up, but she wouldn’t talk to me. Just threatened to make all my friends leave. 

So Reddit, do you think my sister has BPD and it’s something I really need to work on talking to my parents about?",02Aug2020,1

935,"I know I should just ask but I'm honestly afraid to. I don't want to ruin what we have. I'm okay with a causal undefined thing, in fact it's better. But I don't want to be played.

We've been dating for a couple months. I met him at a bar and we had sex that night. I wasn't expecting a real relationship but to my surprise he asked me out to dinner and the movies and even introduced me to his friends. Gradually, it morphed into mostly going to his place, watching TV and movies, hooking up, watching more TV and talking and then leaving. Once a week on average. 

We're both independent and a little emotionally reserved and cautious but we get on pretty well and the sex is incredible. We're both incredibly chill, non-angry, non-demanding people who demand very little of one another, never get mad at one another, and enjoy each other's company a lot. 

However, he is definitely the one that seems to always be initiating contact and wanting to see me more. I  was planning to keep things casual, and I thought he was as well, but he has seems to want to move the relationship forward. He's just been extra attentive lately and even though we've been hooking up for months is suddenly pushing to go out on more real dates (nice dinners, bowling, jetskiing and camping to name a few of things he's asked me to do). We've done a couple of these things, and it's honestly been really great for the most part, except that sometimes I get the feeling that he doesn't like me at all. 

He never cuddles with me, and he often doesn't want to sleep over or, if at his house, hints that he doesn't want me to sleep over (he says he is a finicky sleeper). He also rarely, if ever, compliments me or shows affection even though I often tell him the things that I admire about him. In his defense, I have been fairly shy around him thus far (except in the bedroom lol) and I guess I don't talk about myself as much as he talks about himself, though he has tried unsuccessful to get me to open up, so it's easier to compliment him (he's a bit of a braggart). 

I don't  think he's just asking out me on these dates merely for sex since before this, we were having regular, casual no-strings-attached sex but I suppose this could be the case.

Tl:dr: Guy \[33m\] I've \[23f\] been casually dating (mostly just sex) for a couple months seems to want to move the relationship forward. He is always initiating, wants to take me out on nice dates, and introduce me to his friends. At the same time he is fairly aloof when we are together. What could this mean?",02Aug2020,1

So some of you may think that this is the emo phase but my mom didn't allow me to go through that but anyway I'm a 14 year old sophomore in high school I was dubbed the werid kid at a very very young age and basically sense I was born I was watching horror movies and playing videos games sense I was the first born girl of my family(of my 5 siblings) and I was also the first of my siblings to have a medical condition(and the only one). But besides that I always felt different growing up(not sexuality or stuff like that). I was different from everyone in my family I didn't really have anything in common with them except physically traits and I didn't have anything in common with my younger or older siblings either. I've been called bad thing by my siblings(I wont say them because I dont wanna remember them) but now that I'm 14 and dont have many people to talk to I've been making up voices in my head to talk to sense middle school.

That's one of my... mind gut spillings? 

So now for the problem that just arrived today: so today I had to spend the day shopping with my mom and sister for a 3 day vacation to the beach and my mom was making me try on girly stuff that I dont like wearing so I told her that I had shorts are shirts at home and dont need more and she had replied with something like this: "" well (my name) you shorts makes your but look saggy and you cant just wear any normal shirt and shorts to the beach for swimming"" and I remember be angry because I'm very self conscious and I just dont like wearing girly clothing and I dont like attention either and I dont know how to tell her that I dont wanna wear stuff that makes me uncomfortable an also due to the fact that I not exactly the girly child that she hope for and I'm also more confortable swimming clothes that I usually swim in.

946,"I don't know if there's a Reddit for this kind of topic but i need advice either way.

I recently saw a stray kitten and decided to pick it up. I didn't pick it up immediately because it was obviously feral but i wanted to take care it. This was a big decision for me because i lost my 8 year old cat on December 2019 and I've never felt such loss. I was so heartbroken and it was really hard for me to stop crying. Just recently have i started to accept he was gone and think back fondly of him without crying every time. Back to the kitten, I started leaving out food for it and soon i realized there were two of them and i thought ""well, i can take one more."" so i brought both of them in and again i realized there was a mama cat and brought her in as well... so i'm left with 2 kittens and a cat, okay. The Mama cat is really sweet and just came up to me right away asking for attention which i was surprised at because these are feral cats. The kittens are more apprehensive but they are warming up to me especially when i brought their mama home, they were so happy, now here's the dilemma. For the past couple of days I've been thinking that her belly was strangely round and one day she was laying down and i could see her ""pinking up"" and thought she could be pregnant. I started looking up her ""symptoms"" and it match. It could also explain her sweetness towards me and her annoyance with her own kittens. I felt around and couldn't feel any babies nor could i see it but today i could CLEARLY see her belly moving. Now i'm stressed about what to do. I decided to pick up one cat but it turned into two, then three and now newborn kittens?! I picked them up so it's my responsibility, i'm not gonna just throw them back out there when it's become troublesome so i'm looking for solutions.  Shelter is a no go partly because it closed but also because it's kitten season and shelters are always full but now they'd be extra full. If i can take care of these guys until i can get them adopted then there'd be an extra space out there for a homeless cat that can get a chance to find a home but i really need advice on what to do. I was only expecting to get one kitten but now i'm ending up with more than i can take care of by myself. I don't think i should move her right now because i don't want to stress her out and risk hurting the babies. I don't have anyone to ask for advice on this. What i was thinking was to start a GoFundMe to be able to at least spay/neuter, vaccinate and feed them all properly and start looking for potential homes for them but i'm not sure where to start and it's stressing me out. I want to adopt out these kittens myself to know that they are doing great in their new homes but i have no clue what to do. I was also starting to looking into organizations but i don't know where to start or who to trust. This is the first time I've experienced a pregnant cat and i'm not sure what to do.

950,"TLDR; Friend got hired at my company making 8k more than me for the same job. We have the same educational and work backgrounds. I’ve only been there two months. Should I have a chat with my boss?

Alright, so I should probably start this off by saying that I’ve only been at my company for two months, but there’s (in my opinion) good reason for me to renegotiate my salary. 

When I first applied, one of the questions asked the minimum salary I require. I know a couple friends that work at the company, and they both said that 33,000 is the non-negotiable base pay for all entry level positions, so that’s the number I put down, worried that if I go any higher, that might kill my chances at getting the job. Unsurprisingly, that’s the number they offered me.

A friend of mine, however, just told me that he received a job offer at my company for the same position that I have. For the same application question, he answered “42,000”, and they offered him 41,000. 

It’s worth noting that him and I graduated with the same degree at the same school, and we both have very similar work history. 

So, here’s where I’m coming from: 8,000/year is a huge difference, especially considering my friend and I have the same background. I’m very aware that I undersold myself. I’m not angry and I don’t feel like I’m being ripped off. I mean, why would a company pay more than what someone asks for? 

At the same time, though, finding out that my work is worth a considerable amount more than what I’m being paid has me thinking that maybe I should respectfully bring it up to my boss, but I’m understandably hesitant. Would doing so put a target on my back, especially since I’ve only been there two months? Is there an effective strategy to do this? If not now, how long do you think I should wait to bring it up? What would you do?",02Aug2020,1

953,"Obligatory on mobile and also posting on behalf of a friend.

I (F20) recently signed a lease on a 3 bedroom townhome with 2 coworkers (M and G) of mine. During the process my roommates have made many decisions without consulting me such as living room furniture, giving G the biggest room with a connected bathroom, as well as a few other small things. 

M and I had toured a 2 bedroom townhome in the same complex (completely different layout from the 3 bedroom we currently occupy). During this tour we discussed which room we would prefer, but nothing was set in stone. When moving in this week I noticed that the layout was a bit different and 1 of the rooms had a small (4sq ft) cut out with an extra window (this was the room that M had said she wanted during the tour). I texted M and asked if I could have this room instead since I have a lot of plants that need sunlight and both of my roommates have cats that eat plants so I can’t keep them in common areas. She replied saying that the room was mine and not to worry so I moved my bed and a few other items in.

The following day she shoots me a text saying that she changed her mind after seeing the rooms in person as she didn’t think she could fit all her stuff in the “smaller” room. I told her that I had already moved some of my things in and wasn’t willing to give up the room since we had come to an agreement on it previously. She replied saying that she “was putting her foot down” and would be taking my room. I replied saying that there was no way I’d give up the room and told her how I felt about being left out of a lot of decisions as well as how I was frustrated that I was the only one having to make compromises.

She texts me today, profusely apologizing and saying that she had moved her stuff into the smaller room and had no space so she kindly moved my stuff and took my room without consulting me. I sent a group text to G and M asking that we sit down and have a talk about boundaries and respect tonight. I was planning on moving the rest of my stuff into the townhome tonight but now I’m considering breaking the lease and telling them to find a new roommate. I guess I’m just wondering how I should approach our discussion tonight and how to deal with someone so irrational and entitled that she would move into my room without asking.",02Aug2020,1

957,"So from young, my parents always made it seem like we were well off and had money to pay for anything. They would buy us things we needed (not useless toys or anything, but like more expensive school supplies or a new computer when the old one broke). We were never spoiled, but I thought we were really fortunate considering we lived in a high economically disadvantaged area.

Well, it was only about a year ago when I really started becoming interesting in business and finances (I’m thinking about perusing a major in business). After some questioning, I realized that my parents’ essentially had zero savings for our future college plans. They lived mostly on a paycheck-to-paycheck basis, and any money left they would take us out for dinner about twice a month. They are immigrants, so they don’t really know the education system in the US, and assumed we would be “smart enough” to get a full ride to college, or at least take out student loans for anything not covered by scholarships.

The thing is, we’re Asians. And as if it’s not already very competitive for Asians, they’re hardly any scholarships granted to our particular ethnicity. Upon questioning, I found out that they only had 2.5k saved up for me and 2k for my 14 year old sister. I am very frugal with the money I have and hardly spend it on anything, so I have about 1.5k saved up. Combined with my parents’ savings for me, that’s about 4k for college. I had originally planned on going to an out-of-state private college, since I really value education and my grades are quite good, but with so little money, I feel like I don’t have many choices.

So, is there anything I might be able to do for the next 2 years to save up for college? Maybe a specific type of investment plan, a loan, or just anything else to help pay for college? I researched about 529 plans, but because it’s so last-minute, I would hardly get any benefits and it also negatively impacts chances at scholarships.

I'm a bit annoyed about this since I just wanted some ice cream without having to worry about germs. Should I toss this icecream or is there a way I can save it?",02Aug2020,1

962,"This will be a long read, but I seriously hope you read all of it because you having full context of the situation is very helpful. 

My friend is 15 years old, she is transgender (Male to female) but is deathly afraid of ever coming out because of her families reaction to her sexuality, her brother often calls her derogatory slurs like faggot, fairy, etc in a harmful way, and her dad makes homophobic jokes. This is an online friendship by the way, which makes gathering compelling evidence... highly difficult, which is partially why I'm texting here. 

Her father and brother also insist on her doing most of the work around the house, they make her do all of the dishes, as well as clean the house (not just her room), clean after their messes... and feed all of the animals, including the shelter that the PARENTS got themselves, meaning that the parents are indirectly neglecting it by forcing her to take care of them by herself, and the parents never help her with any of these tasks. 

Her father threatened to knock her out one night because she wouldn't turn the TV down and was being too loud, and the family STILL persists this behavior despite her revealing that it contributes to her depression and suicidal thoughts, showing that her family doesn't really give a shit about her. 

Well... her mother is decent. Can be a cunt, but she seems to be the mediator, she accepted her being bisexual and she seems to attempt to shut down attempts of ridicule from the brother or father, and also seems to be more overall supportive. 

She almost constantly has to get up for things the parents could do... raising your child do to chores is fine, but this is more child labor than just chores, she often says that they don't do anything around the house and that SHE has to do most of the work, because everybody else is too lazy to, stuff like her being yelled at to be getting a beer from the fridge when the fucking dad could just do that himself. 

Me and my boyfriend talked about this, he recommended that I call CPS and get her out of that hellhole of a family, but my mother said that while it's horrible, that kind of stuff isn't illegal and that CPS unfortunately relies on evidence of physical abuse moreso than anything else, and that I might not be able to help her in this case, due to the fact that I can't live near her... nor have the contacts to her parents or brother, I can't be a true witness to any of this, if I had a video tape of her parents verbally assaulting her or something then it'd be case and point, but I don't... I'm mainly getting this from her word, and that makes me worried that we can't help her. 

I'm genuinely scared as to what to do, she doesn't deserve this, are my mothers words true? I searched this up a bit and it made be feel bleak, what can I do?",02Aug2020,1

966,"Backstory: 

I’m a CC student and made some close friends within the last two years. One of the girls in this friend group Ive never had any serious chemistry with, but we would flirt admittedly. 

Ive been on and off with this group because they did have a history of being really dramatic and petty towards each other...something I myself don’t have the time or energy for! 

I have boundaries Ive set up with them about that behavior, clearly asserting that I don’t think its cool. I would rather spend my time with those who value me more. I definitely lost attraction for this girl because of this. 

Well after quarantine, we all hung out after a pretty big break from each other. Heres where it gets interesting. That same girl started bailing on us, being flaky, and personally towards me I felt like she was way more distant. 

One night she obviously made “other” plans while at the same time was VERY closed off when I asked what was up. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out she had something going on with a guy, so I wasn’t really trying to get in her personal business. 

However...I went through this exact shit in HS with a girl I actually had a thing with. THAT was rough I have to admit. 

I took it pretty personally on top of the other disrespectful shit unfortunately. I decided one night our friendship really wasn’t worth it at that point. I ended up unfriending her on social media, and let her know it would be better for me to move on. 

This all really took her by surprise I think and I left her and everyone else confused...since I basically dropped her it looked like I was upset or jealous about her endeavors with this guy. When truly I think the fact she started walking over me that made me more upset. 

We haven’t talked in over a month, that friend group thinks Im heartbroken when I literally dgaf...Im moving to college in 2 weeks and feel like it would be appropriate to clarify some stuff with her in person before we both just end up hating each other and burning a bridge. I see so much opportunity ahead at this new school In no way would I be doing this out of desperation or regret. I genuinely would just like to resolve any resentment.

Even when I sit down in the perfect environment with no distractions I will just sit there and look at my computer screen. I have the worst mental block of my life and I don't know why.

My mother and I have had several large disagreements over the years which while no longer relevant in and off themselves lead to me generally not trusting her much or spending time with the rest of my family. Instead I will spend all my time in my room, eat separately and sleep at slightly different times so I can be downstairs on my own at night. The accumulated effect of this is that when they go on holiday camping (which I don’t enjoy) I stayed at home by myself. 

The question itself started bugging me when their was a minor incident causing a row which I was texted about by my sister and I really wanted to feel relief I wasn’t their but it is countered out by the guilt I feel for missed opportunities with my family like I am ‘supposed’ to be having even if I know from experience I wouldn’t actually be enjoying it.

971,"Hey all, Posting here partially to vent and to perhaps partially to seek advice.  I’m really just writing this in hopes that it could be therapeutic in some capacity.  

I’m a 27-year-old attorney.  I went to law school at a T1 law school in the Midwest.  I wasn’t a great law student in terms of grades, though I did win awards in moot court competitions, participated in tons of public-interest related extracurriculars, engaged in public-interest internships, and studied abroad through a sizeable scholarship.  I hated law school 90% of the time and didn’t make a single friend there, though my time abroad was the happiest time in my life.  I went into law school still very naïve, immature, and without a real plan as to what I wanted to do with my life.  Embarrassingly, my parents encouraged me to go to law school, so I more or less did so for that reason.

I graduated from law school still without a real career plan, but I had a vague interest in serving in public-interest law.  I’d read the horror stories of “Big Law” (poor work-life balance, soullessly working for corporate overlords, toxic work relationship dynamics, etc.), and I avoided it like the plague.  The notion of truly helping others appealed to me and making an enormous amount of money was not an objective.

I currently practice as a public defender.  I never had an interest in criminal law or criminal defense, but it was the first attorney position I could land after a lengthy, arduous time spent sending out applications post-bar exam.

I’ve been a public defender for \~1.5 years now, and at this point, I hate it.  Really everything about it.  I hate negotiating with (oftentimes) backhanded, unprofessional, and lazy prosecutors.  I have similarly negative feelings towards most of my own colleagues.  I cared at first for my clients, but for the most part, no longer.  I’ve become entirely disenfranchised with the criminal justice system, as it feels very much like a game where there are no winners.  The prosecutors feign interest in seeking “justice”, while I increasingly feign interest in protecting my clients’ rights, and we all just go through the motions in an endless loop.  I’m absolutely not helping anybody in any meaningful way, and I feel so alienated when colleagues say and think otherwise.  At the end of the day, cases are disposed of in very much the same way, while my clients remained plagued with mental health and substance abuse issues and recidivism is all but assured.  And of course, my pay is about as low as one could feasibly make as an attorney, and I’m in a tremendous amount of student loan debt.

I’ve been applying for other jobs for \~6 months (though I’m certain a new job won’t magically fix my problems), and while I’ve had a few interviews, nothing has materialized.  Meanwhile, work has become increasingly loathsome, and I think it’s very likely that I’m depressed.  I’ve gained an enormous amount of weight, and I drink daily, oftentimes excessively.  The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has made things worse in every way as well, as my job and what I’m supposed to be doing is even more disorganized and chaotic than usual, my clients (as is their nature) have no notion of space and call me at all hours of the day and night (including weekends), and my caseload has also grown to a preposterous magnitude (\~150 active felony cases and counting).  I feel increasingly isolated from friends and family, and all of my energy and hope is gone.  Beyond that, I feel guilty and ashamed as I know I am no longer giving my clients my best effort.  I don’t think I’d ever kill myself, but I do think about it sometimes.

I have little expectation that many will read all of this, but if anyone does, I guess I’m curious if anyone has ever felt this way before?  Did you ever pull out of it?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?",02Aug2020,1
972,"I have posted this on r/datingadvice but haven't had a response. 

I hope this is the right place for this question, but it's a longish story. 

So I matched this girl (21F) on Bumble back in March, and we hit it off right away. Great conversation, had an awful lot in common, mutual interests, the whole nine yards. Gave her my number, and we spoke all of that day and well into the early hours of the following morning, we were both into the conversation. Long, well thought out replies from both of us. Time just seemed to fly. We made plans to meet up and go on a date - great! Then she just ghosted me, and I was really torn up about it. Then about a fortnight later, she messaged me and said she was sorry had a family member pass away, which I said I understood and that I was sorry to hear about that. And we spoke for a little bit again. Then she ghosted me a second time, this time for a month. It took me around 2 weeks to get over it again and by the time she messaged me again I was over it. We got talking again, she said she was sorry and she was writing her dissertation for university and just wanted to focus. I said that I understood and I hope she managed to get it all done. She replied that she had, she wasn't overly confident with it (who is? Completely understandable) but she wanted to resume our plans. So I asked her if she was free that weekend. She said yeah of course. Then she disappeared again. This time for 2 months. She messaged me last night with a simple ""hey"". Said she was sorry again and had had two more family members pass away but that she she was over that now. We had a short conversation and she asked me some things, I asked her about life and she seemed into it. Then I sent her a response about quarter past 10 last night, and now she's ghosted me again. No reply but I can see she's been online. I feel like I'm being harsh by asking, given what she said has been going on, but am I being messed around? What might be the reason for her to randomly message me back and then stop again? And should I confront her and just ask her to not message me again since its messing with my head? 

Thank you all for reading and for any thoughts and advice.",02Aug2020,1

975,"To start it off, my friend has been going through a rough patch for a while. After high school he's been becoming more depressed and by the end of 2019 it escalated. Not to a point where he harmed himself, instead I think he's been consumed by his emotions. It has become a point where his emotions are choosing how he lives his life.   


Before quarantine, he would often mention how he didn't like who he was or his body. He didn't think he was worth something. I would give him advice on what to do, such as go to the gym or take a hobby or even write how he feels in a journal. As someone with depression, I thought I could understand him. Even though I feel everyone handles it differently, maybe I could knock some sense into him.  


Fast forward till a month or two ago. He started sending e snapchats of how he's very miserable. I didn't think much of it at the beginning and ignored it. They would soon become constant. He would things like ""I hate how emotional I am"" or ""I'm feeling very sad and I'm going to log off tonight, if anyone needs me I'm here, but I'm going to try to go to bed"". An hour later he'll say ""I'm feeling a little better now, my emotions change so quickly"". After receiving them every day I decided enough was enough. I asked him how he felt, but he wouldn't tell me why. Yet, he would send snaps hours later of him feeling terrible again.   


Our mutual friend (the other person he sends it to) and I decided to make a group chat and ask him if he's feeling alright. I think it made him uncomfortable because he didn't want to talk about it. We assured him this group chat would be available to him for any purpose. Whether it'd be for him to talk to us if he's sad or lonely or just wants to send us a funny picture. It did not work. He still sends us snaps of how depressed he is. He is getting a therapist, but I don't know when.  


I don't know how to handle this. I handle my depression differently, I don't post about how I feel, I have a bad coping mechanism of trying to ignore those feelings. Therefore, I don't know how to talk to him about what he is doing. Our mutual friend and I want the best for him. We also want to understand why he sends those snaps, but won't elaborate on them. Anything I can do to help him?  


Tldr; My friend sends snapchat of how miserable he is, but when confronted he doesn't want to talk about his emotions.",02Aug2020,1

Now that i am older i regret not doing normal high school things like skipping class, experimenting sexually (literally didn't lose my virginity until i was 22 and it wasn't even with someone special) , trying drugs, underage drinking, going to partys, even just hanging out with your friends and making memories. 

I cry watching l movies that involve these kind of topics.(even comedies) I remember when the movie ""blockers"" came out and i was crying almost the whole time. The people sitting next to me probably thought i was crazy.

So recently since it's been haunting me I came out of the mental hospital due to suicidal thoughts due to the trauma I experienced as a child.

985,"Here's my problem. When I was young, my mom had this whole 'Golden Child' Complex about me. She thought I was brilliant, thought I'd do great things, heaped all kinds of expectations on me from day one. Early on, school was super easy for me: my grades were perfect, I never had to study beyond going through the standard lessons and doing the assigned reading. Everyone around me told me I was 'so smart'.  


I started to stumble around Fourth Grade. I was doing poorly in Math (dividing and multiplying fractions were such a pain in the ass), my grade in the class slipped from the A's of the past to a C. My mom flipped her shit and came down on my like a hammer. We'd had problems before. I got in trouble for talking in class a lot in third grade, or reading during lessons. Problem was, I knew the answer, and the teacher had been ignoring me. I get now that she was waiting for an answer from everyone else, but none of them were answering, and as a kid I just wanted to get on with the lesson so I could go back to my book, get back to \*my\* time. I'd gotten into the habit of hiding my teacher's notes from my teacher, even deleted a phone message from her once. The more I fucked up the more I got punished, and mom was a master of psychological punishment. She didn't need to lay a hand on me to hurt me, though spankings were pretty common.  


As the years went on, my math grade continued to suck. It didn't matter to her if I was getting straight A's and B's in every other class, that one unacceptable grade was all she ever focused on. She made me feel like I was doing it on purpose. By the time I was in my senior year of high school, I had pretty much given up. I still excelled in the classes I actually enjoyed, but every other class I barely kept above a C on average.  


But I still made it into college. Twice. I bailed out each time because I had no idea what I was doing and didn't feel like the debt was worth it. Now I work in a factory, and I'm almost thirty, and my life is basically...shit.  


I manage to live above the poverty line, and I don't starve or struggle with my bills, but I'm just miserable. There's no satisfaction in my job and there's no future for me that seems even remotely appealing. I get stuck in a depressive downward spiral pretty easily, though I've gotten a lot better about shrugging it off. These days I can mosey on pretty much unscathed, but I can't shake how bleak the future looks.  


And the one thought that keeps dragging me down is: ""How fucking smart am I, really?"" Because everyone always told me I was intelligent, but I'm constantly marveling at all the fucking things I just don't know. I don't really know how to do anything. I work a dead end job that requires no skills, no intelligence, no creativity or critical thought. I spend my whole fucking shift daydreaming and trying to answer my own questions or just trying to focus on breathing and staying in the 'Flow State'.  


So I can clearly write, I can communicate coherently, and while my grammar isn't flawless, I'm capable of recognizing that. Given how bored my work leaves me and how I choose to answer that boredom, I have a very active mind that is both flexible and creative. I'm definitely not an idiot, but if I was any kind of brilliant mind, wouldn't I have made more of myself than what I am?  


I have no idea how smart I really am. I've got no gauge to measure my intelligence against. I've apparently got \*something\*, but I have no idea how to see how much of it I've got, and very little genuine opportunity to develop my use of it. I've got no fucking guidance. My life is stagnant, and I can keep my depression at bay, but if I don't find some way forward, some way out of this bog, I won't live for much longer.

988,"I know I need to go to bed. I know if I put my phone down and just try to sleep that I will. However, I don't.  I stay up on my phone just browsing, listening to music, and watching the same old videos. Sometimes I'll even waste 15-20 minutes jumping back and forth on apps trying to find something to do. I eventually finally fall asleep. 

Then I wake up. I try to be productive, but I just feel tired and unmotivated. I lay in bed for about an hour or two. I get up around 10am-12pm and watch TV or play video games and only do 1 or 2 semi-important things. Around 1pm I tell myself I'm only gonna take a 30 min nap before I work at 4 cause I'm super tired. Well, once the 30 minutes is over I reset the alarm and go back to sleep. It rings again, I reset it, and go back to sleep. I finally wake up at 3pm and get ready for work. I know if I didn't have work at times,  I'd sleep even more.

Work goes from 4pm-12am. Thankfully I put in my two weeks for this god-awful job, so maybe my sleep schedule will be a little better. I'll start having morning shifts at my other job. 

Right now I'm living with my parents for a few weeks, until I can move in to my new apt. I thought I'd take this time to stop smoking weed for a few weeks, but just last night I hit up my dealer. He didn't have any though, and I've gone about 3 days without smoking now. I know the moment my friends invite me over I'm going to smoke though. 

I've also been trying to lose weight for like a year and half. It's been off and on, and I've lost 25ish lbs. I've been around the same weight for about 5 months now, and it's really disappointing. My goal weight was something I was really excited about, but i haven't reached it. I've just wasted the days. Food just comforts me.

I don't really know what to do right now. I just feel stuck and helpless. I feel like I may never get better. I feel like I'm super lazy and just don't put in any effort.    Work is draining, dating life is nonexistent, and I don't feel good about myself.",02Aug2020,1
989,"Hi,

For the last week or so I've been having severe anxiety a few times during the day, but especially in bed. The anxiety is centered around a fear of getting older and losing function, energy and options because of old age. I'm feeling intense worry that I'm wasting my days and thinking that I'm already halfway to 50. This evening I laid down in bed next to my girlfriend(f31) of five years and felt intense guilt and anxiety that maybe I'm wasting her life and child bearing years on a relationship that doesn't offer her the kind of love she deserves. I feel sick to my stomach with guilt and just overwhelmed with everything. This is also combined with an anxiety for the phenomenon that time feels as if it passes faster as you get older, because I feel like the next 25 years will be over in a second.

I would up gaining the weight back and then some during quarantine because the healthier foods like chicken breasts and produce were harder to find at the store, and the gym was closed.

After awhile I started working on cardio indoors by doing things like playing Beat Saber on my Oculus Quest or Just Dance on my Switch, but theres only really so many hours you can put into those kind of games. Since then things have settled down a bit and I'm back on the diet but I'm still not managing to lose as much weight. My gym is still closed and I'm not comfortable joining another one yet because of crowds, and the fact that no one would really be wearing masks there. My state is still getting hundreds of new covid cases every day and so I'm still trying to avoid going out too much. 

I live in an apartment with no yard, and I can't really afford a big piece of equipment like a treadmill or elliptical machine. I've tried going to parks for walks but it seems like so do a lot of other people lately, and im trying to avoid crowds like that.

We are supposed to stay in a hotel this Tuesday/Wednesday and I want to use that time to hold him extra tight and make him feel as loved as I possibly can. I plan on suggesting we go to the mall so I can buy him some little gifts and things. But...It just seems like he’s not in the right headspace right now to be in a relationship, I don’t want to be here and have him think I’m just another thing he has to worry about or think about. I love him so much but I want him to feel better and not think “oh yea I have a girlfriend I have to talk to”. So I was thinking, breakup with him. It wouldn’t be too bad, he has one less thing to worry about and I can focus on starting school. But that might go bad because what if he doesn’t want to breakup, what if me breaking up with him makes him feel worse? I would like to talk to him about it but he hasn’t been texting me.

I'm very suspicious of the fact that I will be watched now.

How will I know if I'm being monitored by this person? Should I just get the phone as they bought me a case, and just not use it until I get my own phone plan?

1005,"For context, I’m at a library, and the assistant director has just announced her last day before retirement. I am in the position just below hers, working part time, and really want her job and full time + benefits.

The boss is “restructuring.” She is quite literally planning to boot me from my current position as the technical processor to roll that into the assistant director’s job, which will now require a library technical assistant certification at the very least. I was never warned or given the chance to earn this certification before this happened, even though she’s known the assistant director’s retirement was coming.

I want to speak to the board during a special meeting already scheduled for this week to discuss specifics. Ideally, I’d like them to be aware of *precisely* what the director is trying to do, here. Because I’m positive they don’t know that *I’ve been at this library for over 8 years*, which is about five longer than anyone but the director herself now. They also probably don’t realize she’ll be ousting me from my job to some social media manager bullcrap, as she’s told me.

I want them to know I already have almost all of the training for this job, given most of it will be what I’m already doing. I just need to learn one or two more technical responsibilities. I’ve been the tech processor for going on four years now. Before that, I was a desk clerk. So, more or less, the boss wants to demote me and put in someone else that would need to be trained from scratch.

I told her I’d gladly take the classes for the cert. I’ve found an accredited, very reputable school recommended by the American Library Association that would give me the certification in just barely over a year. I feel this should be fair, since I already know this job and could be up and running and just get the technically required certification as I’m working.

Sorry for the essay, here. All this being said, how do I go about trying to get into this board meeting or contact the board members to let them know this is happening? I don’t want to come off as accusatory or antagonistic, I only want a fair shot at full time, since I’ve been waiting since I was in my early 20s. I want to handle it professionally and tactfully without making my boss feel like I’m just going over her head... even though I sort of would be, but I feel like for good reason.

After a while I started to get really into video games I started disliking my mother even more I would stay in playing borderlands and she would try to come into my room to talk or tell me stop playing so many damn video games or something 
I get she’s just trying to look out for me and get what’s best for me but it got to the point to where it was affecting other relationships I had 
Honestly I think I blame most of my problems on her but still it’s my own fault for letting it get this bad i should’ve talked things over with her
When I got into high school she kept treating me like some kid constantly trying to kiss and hug me and ask what the hell is wrong with me 
I was a bit rebellious well not a bit I was very rebellious just not enough to do something really stupid 
I started thinking she looked down on me that’s why she kept giving me all this attention
She thinks I’m some pussboy that constantly needs all this attention so I started hating her
So I started doing stupid things I got into drugs and all that to feel idk free from all my problems or whatever 
She found out and went crazy I never told her I hated or or cursed at her god no ima get my ass beat 
But she could tell I didn’t like her just not why
She thought I started doing all this because I wanted even more attention like she wasn’t giving me more than enough already 
So she started hugging me and kissing me even more 
Eventually I got fed up with that shit and I told her everything 
""I don’t like your damn kisses or your damn hugs I don’t like anything about you stop treating me like a kid"" something like that but a bit nicer 
And what did she think?
Oh my boy no no you need even more attention and love now 
I told her everything I told her everything she could work on if she wants me to like her
I told her to treat me grown up already since I’m not some damn kid anymore

Everything about her pisses me off her presence pisses me off her coming into my room gets me angry

For the beach trip, my best friend and i agree that we want to take this trip just the two of us. This would normally be fine, but the other friend asked if we wanted to do something at the time we planned the trip. We don't want to invite her, but we also don't want to hurt her feelings.

My family are VERY white, and me too of course, and still have the stupid idea that racism is OK.

They're mostly racist towards asians and middle eastern people. Not in public, more subtly I guess? They won't be openly racist to someone, but they'll talk in private (usually only when I'm there) about it and make fun of me because I like things from other cultures.

My entire family makes fun of ""slitty eyed people"" and ""Asians eat everything and are disgusting"" Just because I like Asian food and buy a lot of it, yet I STILL get made fun of for liking anything that's not made by a white person BY ADULTS because ""that's what slitty eyed people eat"" and how I like ""Chinese things and can speak Chinese"" No, I learned Japanese. But OK. 
""I don't want Chinese grandkids"" ""You just like it because it's Chinese"" 

My parents also say the N word a lot, it's horrible, but if I ask them to stop because it's absolutely disgusting, they'll just laugh.

Because of Corona, my family always go on massive rants about how non white people are unhygienic, disgusting and that's why they have a higher covid rate. I can't deal with their bullshit anymore, I try to tell them that it's not okay and they shouldn't talk like this but they continue like it's some kind of joke.

I got out of a 5.5 year relationship with a girl I spent a significant amount of time with in those times.

To spare some details we both weren’t the nicest people to one another but I feel strangely guilty still for things I did and still think about. We apologized for a few things and moved on with our lives. I am currently seeing someone new and the relationship is healthy and I’m shedding lights on my past relationship and knowing where I went wrong. I want to disclaim that I am not constantly still thinking about this every day. But now and again I remember things I did that would be so wrong now. Personally, she didn’t treat me the best but I know I did everything I could for her but I don’t think I treated her as well as I could have today. 
Besides the details, should I write a letter and mail her my concerns? I believe she’s thriving and is a new relationship but I know who she is and I wonder if my shitty actions have her wondering if she’s good enough. 

Should I apologize ? My current partner supports what ever decision I make as we have spoken about it.

1018,Hi guys hope you are all well. 4 days ago I fast from 1am to 9pm (no eating or drinking I had a bowl of cereal at 1) but I had to cut it short by 2 hours all because of something that happened. Basically I have health anxiety so any ill feeling makes me panic like crazy and think the worst but I had been on my Xbox all day and I came off and 5 mins later I got this intense buzzing/vibrating feeling in the front of my head and it felt quite heavy! It felt like someone was shaking my head. It lasts for less than 5 seconds. Does anyone know what this was or atleast if it was caused by my fasting ? Since then I’ve had a bit of a headache like a heavy tense feeling and today I was walking (haven’t been out in a while just only on Xbox) and my eyes were hurting so much my head felt so tense and I started to work myself up and had a panic attack and thought I was going to collapse. Eventually I calmed down and have felt alright since with a mild headache and feel somewhat dizzy when I move my head a bit. I must also add when I stand up stair guy or mouth too much pressure on my neck I get a ‘head rush’ the feeling you get when you stand up too fast. Anyone had any of these ? Anyone know ehat these are ? Any advice for health anxiety? Thank you in advance. (Forgot to mention my health anxiety is making me feel like it’s a brain tumour or epilepsy which makes it even worse),02Aug2020,1
1020,"To bring you up to date, Im 23 and was hospitalized with a benign tumor that is found in 2% of Americans. Surgery was performed at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and after almost 1 year of crutches and surgical recovering, my health is finally on the mend (yay!). I am a recent college graduate, but due to student loans and financial hardship, I moved back in with my parents, and relied on them to care for me.

About 1 month ago, my father and I got into a small dispute about a very small issue, but it got out of hand. He has a significant temper that we are all aware of, and in anger he yelled to me that he ""regrets all that he did to help me with my medical situation"". I was so shocked, and starting to calmly tell him to ""leave the conversation because that was very hurtful, and please end this conversation"". 

Im not entirely sure how to react, its been a month now and I still am just really confused. I could use some valuable advice, please and thank you!

1021,So after about 12 years this girl from my elementary school picked me up and we had lunch a drink and then we hit it off.  We made out a bit and watched the sunset. Im sure we both know our chemistry is undeniable. Though we just hung out last night would it be weird to have her pick me up again tonight? She knows Im working on my car and the part I need comes tomorrow. So it wont really be an issue. Or should I just plan something down the line.

I dont have any benefits from my job so I have to pay $400/month for Obama care just to get my meds.
Rent in a decent area/apartmeny would be $1,500
Car insurance is normally $120ish (outside of the covid discount)

So thats at least $2,000 per month I need just for fundamental necessity, not including bills, food, etc.

This insurance is really screwing me and i need to figure something out asap.

1025,"My housemate is male and late 20s/early 30s. He is Cree and grew up on a reservation with religious beliefs that seem very ""out there"" to white people. He believes in things like magic, astral travel, and monsters, and this is all ""normal"" for him. He doesn't drink but smokes a lot of marijuana.

I've known him since we were in high school, and he's changed recently. He's gone from just believing in myths to thinking everything is connected to the paranormal, which I've heard is a sign of mental illness.

He thinks that people are talking to each other telepathically and saying bad things about him. He thinks that our neighbor's 7 year old son, who probably has a developmental disability, is a ""skinwalker"" and possessed by a demon. Our neighbor has threatened him to STFU about that or he'll call the cops and such, and he's taken that as an admission that his father knows something he doesn't want getting out. And he rambles about how covid is caused by demons summoned by the Chinese to kill all the white people.

He gets mad when I try to approach him with logic and says losing sleep over paranoia apparently makes the world more interesting than atheism. I haven't searched through his things, but I haven't seen physical evidence of drugs just from looking inside his bedroom. He keeps weed in his truck and smokes it there. I've noticed a weird smell on him sometimes that I can only describe as being like the taste of brushing your teeth right after eating starchy foods. It's strong at times, but he doesn't notice it on himself and thinks I'm just talking about BO. I know what weed smells like and it's for sure not that.

How should I approach this? I don't want him to get fired or do something stupid.",02Aug2020,1

Particularly in terms of dating. 

I understand that it is an important skill for any adult, and that it can be incredibly annoying to be on the other side of this, and that it's not fair to make others always make the decisions, yet I still do it. I do lack confidence and I just can't seem to get over the fear of making a ""wrong"" decision (aka a decision the other person would not have made by themselves). I'd so much rather just do what they want to do. I am happy when they are happy. It doesn't matter what we are doing. 

Still, I know other people don't always want the responsibility either, and that's where I just become selfish and controlled by fear because even that knowledge is not enough to make me make a decision. I literally cannot make a single decision about the smallest thing. It's like the words just won't come out. 

I recently started dating a nice, chill guy. For a while he was okay to take the lead, but now I think he is getting very tired of my inability to make even minor decisions. He usually plays his own music in the car, but only because he knows I refuse to choose it. Lately he is trying hard I think to get me out my shell, so to speak. He asked me to a pick a song to play. When I got flustered and couldn't do it, he asked me to pick a genre. I wanted badly to just pick one but I couldn't. Finally he just did it and I was all like ""yes, this is great so glad you picked this."" I'm sure he was rolling his eyes. He has been trying to get me to make decisions about dates, too, and I'm completely useless. I can't even pick a time to meet because I'm so worried it will be inconvenient for him and he won't tell me. I apologized to him for making him make all the decisions and promised him I would plan a date for us, where I decided everything, and he said ""yeah right."" Based on my track record I don't blame him. The poor guy has to decide everything. Even though I'm always happy to do whatever and I never complain about his decisions, it still must be exhausting. He is often asking me if I'm bored or having a good time. I feel bad that he has to worry about that because I am so timid. 

I can't even initiate sex with this when we are laying in bed and both of us are clearly horny. A little voice in my head just says ""what if he doesn't want to?"" ""he's probably too tired"" ""don't want to force him or make him feel obligated to"" I know I should just take the risk and deal with consequences which I know will not be that bad, even in the worst case scenario, but something renders me totally passive and almost mute. This guy is literally begging me to choose something, ANYTHING, to take the lead just one time. And I keep failing. Every. Time.

Even if he leaves me I will do the same with the next poor guy till he gets so fed up when he realizes he can't fix me and leaves, frustrated. I think I am going to stay out of relationships from now on, until I fix myself, just to spare others. This is just one of countless expressions of my own lack of confidence that drive everyone around me nuts.

 I know I need help. I am in therapy, and this is part of what we are addressing, but progress is slow. I realize that this is quite selfish and that I'm essentially asking everyone else I engage with to shoulder the very same responsibility I refuse to. 

In the meantime, please let me know if you have any advice for me, any strategies to overcome this? Besides ""just do it,"" unless that's the only way. I've tried to tell myself that but couldn't get over the fear. Also should I talk to this guy about this? I already apologized for it so would bringing it up again be seen as just ruminating? 

Thank you",02Aug2020,1
1029,"We're 27F and 28M, been together for 3 and a half years. Sorry if this is long, I need to preface it. 

My boyfriend was one of *those* people. From 14 to like 24 it was drugs, parties, alcohol. Same for his whole friend group. I am the absolute opposite, have only ever smoked weed, rarely get drunk and usually don't drink at all. I've been this way ever since we met so it's not like it's news.

I never felt comfortable around my boyfriend when he got drunk (too often), because he becomes very annoying and he reminds me of my alcoholic father. Fortunately though, about 10 or so months ago, he decided he would stop drinking completely. He's had maybe like 3 beers ever since. I was/am proud of him for taking that step and I've told him so. 

My problem with the drugs, alcohol and him is because he is a very extreme person, either all or nothing. He would say ""just one drink"" and then drink 8-9. When he did drugs a lot (before we met) he would often go *way* overboard, he put himself in a depression hole for months by doing way way too many party drugs in one night. I have also seen him on MDMA twice before and he was SO ANNOYING. Oh my god he just followed me around the whole night talking about himself constantly and loudly. 

All that aside, I have a really weird fear of people on drugs. Not talking weed, but like party drugs, more noticeable stuff. And I think it's because people become unpredictable. I don't like unpredictable. I get very nervous and scared. I never had friends who did drugs or partied like that and I am completely unfamiliar with it, as well as don't get it. I can't explain to you how incredibly uncomfortable and bad I've felt in situations where everyone was on something. Maybe you'll think I'm close minded or lame or whatever, but I don't know, I just *can't deal with it*.

The current situation is that we're going to camp at the seaside in a couple of weeks, with another couple, my side of the ""family"". He mentioned when we were hanging out the other day that he wanted to get MDMA when we go to the seaside. They were like, you do you but we're not interested - so he'd be doing it alone. He brought it up again tonight and I told him that I'm not comfortable with it and that I'd rather he didn't but that I can't force him to do what I want. We bickered on the subject some more, I got pissed off because of his attitude. I told him he can insist all he wants but I'm not interested in trying it with him (especially in a context where I didn't decide it myself). He thinks that just because I'm not comfortable with it doesn't mean he shouldn't be doing it because it's safe and it's his body and his time and his vacation too. Can't say I agree with the approach but whatever, sure. 

After some time this evening, I told him like yeah OK go for it, but I need you to do this: on the day you want to do it, you let me know, you tell me how much you're taking etc, so that this can be more predictable for me. He kinda rolled his eyes and said ""yeah OK whatever, but I do *not* like this situation."". He's been cold and distant since. 

Basically he is only pleased if I'm excited about him doing this or want to do it with him. I don't know what more I can do or say beyond what I did.

TL;DR: am I being too sensitive for wanting BF not to do MD on our trip? Because I am uncomfortable with him (or anyone) doing it around me. asked him to at least detail the situation the night he decides to do it (for my peace of mind) and he didn't like that option either.",02Aug2020,1

1031,"My fiance has never been someone who is good at multitasking. If he is looking at his phone or at the computer and I start talking without realizing this, I will have to repeat myself again because he won't even notice I've started talking, even if I say his name. We just got a new puppy and are potty training (she's already a pro, but she eats her own poo sometimes if we aren't quick enough) and he won't notice that she has gone and has begun eating it, which you can hear, smell, AND see that she isn't anywhere else in our one bedroom small apartment. Even if I'm on the computer across the living room I will notice before he does.

He also is unaware when we are at a store and he gets too close to someone, or is in someone's way, or bumps someone with the basket. He doesn't notice when he is actively spilling a drink on the floor if he is on his phone and is sitting on the beanbag and isn't paying attention. This also leads to another issue. He is careless and oblivious to what the consequences of small actions can be. He will leave a glass on the edge of the counter, or rest a drink ON THE COUCH and not hold it, or countless other things that I feel like a lot of people would take a second and think, ""what will happen if i do this?""

Honestly I'm beginning to think it might be medical, even though he has always been this way. I'm not sure how to confront it or what to do, I just know I'm frustrated trying to juggle these things he doesn't recognize are happening and trying to keep them from happening or having to always be ""on"" to catch things, like the puppy, that he won't.

How can I address this?",02Aug2020,1
1032,"Hey, this is my first time ever using reddit and I need. I started playing football at a very young and a quickly developed into a Good player accomplishing many thing like winning states and Midwest championships. And for basketball I make the school teams and play AAU and put up pretty stats avg. about 15+ points a game. And I have major size and strength. And I used to love the sports. My biggest passion. Would shoot outside over 500 shots a day and not I just can’t. I just lost my love for both games and my parents push very hard and say if I don’t get a scholarship and stuff like that I’m a failure and after every game even I do good they never have anything good to say and only focus on the bad thing that I did. So I think my parents have just pushed me away and made me lose my passion for it. I don’t wanna play anymore. And that make me kinda upset because I used to love it all but now it just feels like a chore to me. I don’t know what to do because with my size,skill and just iq for both games I just feel like i have to play and my parents for go sicko mode if I quit or something. They should be supporting me but they just push me away. I love 2k,Warzone,Madden,R6 and stuff like that and they blame everything on that and do anything to take it away.

1033," Hello, Just a note that the post might end up me being just rambling. I have read a lot about Childhood Sexual Assault lately and have realized how it has impacted me in every aspect of my life. I was sexually assaulted by two different people in my life as a child, I think I was 8 (It lasted for months) and 12 the other time. I was a weird child when I was young, I have always been good at school but socially a bit weird. Now that I've grown up and going to University, I realize how nothing seems to work out. Although, I have a number of friends, I am always in a different world (in my own mind) so in a way they are just there but I am not.
 I don't trust people at all, my first impression for everyone is me thinking of how they might be trying to use me or what is their real purpose of interacting with me. I have been on a few dates but instantly get mistrustful so most of them end up being a hookup and then I just can't seem to take it further because I just can't seem to trust them in any way. This also leads me to have low self-esteem and even though I've been told by a lot of people that they find me attractive and all that but I just don't believe it. There was this girl who would also tell me how much she liked me, the more she did, the more I felt I needed to get away from her.
 Also, I just want to sleep around even though It makes me feel worse afterwards. I've read in a number of different books that Males who are sexually abused as a child seem to view it as showing themselves in a way that they are capable of getting laid in a way. I'm not sure if that's how I feel but there's that. Also, I don't think I like guys but I would still sleep with them as It just left me confused If I like guys or not. 
 A few days back, I went on a date with someone and we had a great time. I go to her room and I just felt like I will be a burden for her and I slept with her but afterwards I proceed to tell her that I don't think I am ready for anything else and she rightfully gets annoyed at me. 
 Also, I think just the feeling as to how am I going to go to sleep keeps me up at night. Once, I took a lot of pills but I still couldn't sleep so there's that. Also, I am really secretive. I don't think there's anyone in this world that I am comfortable talking to who knows me. Also, I am really fearful of being touched by someone, a sudden accidental touch on my skin seems to just scare me. 
 PS- I have a therapist but I am unable to meet him in person due to COVID-19 and I am not comfortable talking to him at all over the phone. I just want to learn how to trust people.",02Aug2020,1
1034,"Right now I (23, F) live in a house with the landlord and two other renters (42, F &amp; 51, F &amp; 27, M) . I had just moved to a new city before lockdown started, so I have no friends here. Additionally, the landlord doesn't like to use the AC or heat very much. 

My coworker (26, M) knows this, and has a roommate moving out so he asked me if I'd like the room. It's him and his wife (26, F) + one other roommate (26, F), and me if I live there.

1037,"This is gonna be long and messy. But I wanna explain everything so you guys can get the whole story to form an opinion on it because I’m lost at this point. 

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 8 years now and for the most part we’re pretty happy. One thing we do constantly argue about is my close relationship with my female friend, who also happens to be my neighbor. 


It all started a few months ago. I had went away for a week with my girlfriend and during this time I didn’t contact anyone. I simply just wanted time with my girl without distractions. When I returned home, my neighbor female friend, let’s call her Penelope, was upset at me, and I mean EXTREMELY upset, that I hadn’t contacted her in a week and felt that my girlfriend was the cause of it and that she’s clingy and requires too much of my time, that I essentially had to make more time for her and not spend most of my time with my girl. At the time, I apologized and agreed that I shouldn’t have ignored her because I wouldn’t want my friends to ignore me either. She then tells me that she thinks my girlfriend is toxic and too clingy and requires too much of my time and that I need to think about either fixing the problem or breaking up with her. As this conversation was going on my gf was giving me a call and since I was in the middle of talking to my friend, I ignored my girl’s call (I know, bad move). 

My girl continues to call back to back because she knew I was with this female friend and I’m assuming didn’t like the fact that I wasn’t answering because I was with her. I saw that she wasn’t gonna stop calling and turned my phone off. Long story short, that night was ugly, my gf ended up coming to my place and cursing me out along with my female friend, and I had to diffuse the situation by taking my girl home and talking to her. I guess you can say this night was the end of any possibility of my girl and my friend getting along. 

Fast forward to present, and my female friend is still constantly calling me, constantly asking when I’m coming to her house to hang out, if I’m with my girl my friend will blow my phone up which looks weird to my girl also. My friend even went as far as buying a camera for me, because she knows I love photography. And when I brought the camera around my girl, she immediately said “Bring MY camera back to my house, I don’t want my camera around her.” I feel like she brought me a gift just to dangle it over my head and control me, and my girl seems to think it may be because she wants to break us up. 

I honestly am jaded to this whole situation. It’s extremely stressful feeling like I have to choose between two people I care about. I can admit I love my friends and I love my girl and I love being there for people I love, but at some point should I have to choose? I’ve even recently found myself lying to my girlfriend when I choose to go and hang out with my friend, because I know she’ll be upset, which then raises further suspicion from my girl. What do you guys think? Maybe I’m just in denial and not paying attention to the obvious red flags on both sides? Please help..I’m desperate with nobody to talk to about this..",02Aug2020,1
1038,"No one so far has been able to help me. This is probably going to be badly explained but thank you in advance if anyone has any advice. If more details are needed, I can try my best to explain more.

My parents and I don't have a great relationship. They aren't good people and they are verbally abusive and have destroyed my self image and confidence. Soon I will be turning 18, and I was planning on moving in with my best friend and their parent. I made my intentions clear with my parents and they freaked out on me. They told me I would be losing their financial support ($250 a month), and that if I ""failed in life"" (my mother is 100% convinced I will fail), I would NOT be welcome in their house. Their reasoning is that they think I'm stupid for moving out for a purpose that isn't school (all my classes are online), and that my friend and their parent are taking advantage of me. 

Before Corona, my friend and I planned on moving to the city our universities were at. Obviously with the virus, classes have been moved to online. This wasn't a last minute decision. I have a job, I got a scholarship that has paid my tuition in full, and I have other sources of income that would help me out.

I use TV shows and movies to fill this gap in my life. I experience true heartbreak and jealousy, friendship and loyalty, sorrow and loss, possibility and joy, only through the characters laid out in front of me. It breaks me just to feel all these emotions and experiences slip through my fingers as they play in my mind over and over again. Watching those characters takes up every part of my mind, as I see them fall in love, create effortless friendships, live a life full of hope and warmth, and I want so desperately to be a part of it. I feel a pain in my chest every time I laugh at some joke they make that becomes a part of their bond. Nobody around me could even fathom what I go through every minute, every second.

Other than that? If I felt society accepted women being taller, I wouldn’t care. Someone has to be the tallest, right? Might as well be the woman.",02Aug2020,1
1047,"When my sister was 31, she would make jokes about me (25) wanting to sleep with my father. Any time she saw us talking or joking around with each other she would tell us to get a room and leer at us, for example. I would tell her to fuck off and she would strongly imply that the lady doth protest too much.

The last time this happened, my mother was present, and to my surprise she snickered along with everyone else. My father looked embarrassed and bashful and obviously straight up awkward, almost the way I imagine he'd act if he believed her. A few hours later I confronted her and asked her why she found that funny, and she had no idea what I was talking about. She had no memory of it and was aghast at my account of what happened. 

I brought it up to her today, because she has no idea why I'm...not my sister's biggest fan. I brought that up as an example and she had no clue what I was talking about, I had to lay it all out for her again.

She then went on to say that it wasn't uncommon. She said it's a very typical thing for siblings to razz each other with, and probably every sibling relation had that joke, but that they, unlike me, know to let this stuff go and not hang onto it forever.

Now, I don't get out much, but I have never in my life heard of siblings ""razzing"" each other over wanting to sleep with one of their *own parents.* Am I wrong? Is this some incredibly common thing that I'm still somehow unaware of?",02Aug2020,1
1048,"I don't trust myself to answer this reasonably on my own, so... here we go!

The word *hybristophilia* refers to a fetish for murderers and convicts-- but mainly serial killers. Now, listen: this might sound just a bit odd, but have any of you heard of *auto-hybristophilia*? 

In short, character in a book that I'm writing is beginning to go in his own direction. 

Without going into too much detail, this character is not only sadistic-- but he also enjoys what he is. Very much so, in fact. The simple *revelation* of what he is, what he's become, and the things that he's done are almost as important to him as the acts of violence themselves. 

Now, I've definitely spent some time scouring the Internet, but, well, as far as I know... I'm the first person in existence to use the term auto-hybristophilia. 

Has anyone heard otherwise? Again, I don't trust myself on this. Am I making any sense at all?",02Aug2020,1

1050,"Hello. I’m going to try to make this as quick and concise as possible.

A short while ago, I (20f) allowed a friend (22f) to stay with me for (what she said would be) two weeks. It’s now been 6 weeks and nothing has changed. She still isn’t working, and she’s not being very productive.

I love my friend and I care about her, but I don’t want her here anymore. I do feel bad that she doesn’t have a place to go but I also feel like that’s not my problem to worry about. 

I want to make it clear that I am willing to give her some time to find somewhere else to live. I wouldn’t just tell her “hey, I need you out of here by tomorrow.”

I just don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I can’t deal with her being here anymore. I need my own space back.",02Aug2020,1

I currently live with my grandma due to my mother passing away a couple of months ago. I'm ok now but I was miserable.. still kinda am but anyways... I truly wanted to kill myself but I know that it would make things worse for my siblings. So I asked if I could get a service dog or bigger dog. Well, she had gotten me a puppy and I will admit, at first I hated the puppy (her name is panini), I strongly dislike small, yappy, ankle biters. She's a malchipoo (Maltese, chihuahua, poodle mix) so I'm stuck with this tiny, annoying, puppy. I've always been a cat person and I still am but now i absolutely love her... she is my world but I've been having difficulties trying to potty train her... she is my very first puppy so I didn't know how to train her or anything. But we had bought puppy pads for her and she's using them. She's gotten so much better at using them now, I'm so proud of her. But it's only in my room, my grandma doesn't like the puppy pads being in the living room because it looks ugly and apparently panini never used it... how can you say that she never used it if you never let it happen? I hate keeping her in my room because it's the hottest room in the house. So I'll either stay in the livingroom or open my door. But either way, when my grandma see's that she went potty on the floor (we have tile so it's not like it's hard to clean up)  she'll order me to shove her face in it... I hate doing it, but I know that if i don't do it she'll threaten to give her back to her friend... it breaks my heart, I'm literally trying to fight back tears because of how much I don't want to lose her... she's helped through my depression and suicidal thoughts, she's helped me keep active and to not stay in my room all day, I actually love going out with her because of how much attention she attracts (she's a small dog but she was the runt of her litter so she's a little smaller). When people ask how old she is (she's 5 months almost 6 now :D) they get shocked, and always comment how tiny she is. I love her with all my heart, and I will do anything to keep fighting for her. But I can't keep up her way of disciplining my puppy. I'm grateful for her even buying me panini but.. I just hate hearing her cry and have her run away from me... I was abused as a child and whenever I have to do it, it gives me flashbacks of what my biological sperm donor (he doesn't deserve to be called a father or any type of parental figure) to me.. now here's the thing, panini squeals when she's scared. She'll squeal even if I'm right next her and there's a slightly bigger dog across the room 10 ft away... but still, her squeals are heartbreaking... I always make sure that I didn't actually shove her nose in it. I never actually do it, I usually just slightly push her head down to make it seem like nose in the mess. My grandma is not a bad person, she just doesn't know how to treat animals, it's not her fault. I understand why she thinks that way, she was raised with no animals as pets since they usually had to kill and eat them. (She's from a 3rd world country and resources are scarce) I guess no one told her the truth, and damages that could be done with such harsh disciplines... this felt so good to actually type this out...",02Aug2020,1
1052,"Ive been going out with this girl for 6 months. We have know each other for 6 years and always liked each other. She ended up having 2 kids in the mean time, and the last 3 years ive been in a very bad depressed state, unemployed, boring life, way worse than when i was younger when we were always hanging out. She moved in with me and my family, Brothers sisters mom. She always misses her family and her children and i understand that. We would always talk about how we wanted to be happier and make life better. Im a horrible person and did absolutely nothing for the last 6 months, but she totally understands my extreme social anxiety, she promised she would help me be more social and free.


What happened here was she had to move back to her parents house because my mother kicked us out because of my brothers actions. Something that didnt make any sense, but either way, i ended up coming back here because i didnt have a place to stay but she was going to her parents. She would say we will get thru this and she will still talk to me. I noticed over time she blocked me on facebook and my number. She completely ghosted me. I made another account and added her and i got a message saying ""listen im doing me right now. I cant do us right now. Im doing for my kids""


This is the girl ive always wanted and i feel i fucked up. I should be so much better and i hate this depression. I want to do the world for her and her children and losing her made me realize i dont care if they are not my kids, i love all of them the same. If it makes her happy itll make me happy...i really have love for her


But i dont understand why shes ghosting me like this. It makes no sense at all and i dont know what to do...i want to start trying to prove to her i can be so much more...but i can show it if she blocked me...


Any advice would be amazing because i cant stop being so sad...shes all i have on my mind...",02Aug2020,1

1055,"My brother found a job in the city I live in a couple of months ago, and asked if he and his dog could stay with us a week whilst he finds accomodation. 
After 2 weeks he said he doesn’t want to rent/share, that he wants to buy a house, and he would like to stay here until then. I told him that it’s not ideal him being here, and that he could stay a max of 2 months, it’s a small 2 bedroom home that is now very cramped and that his dog is disrupting my 2 cats lives, and making a mess of our backyard.

Now it’s been 7 weeks of him being here, and he’s made no mention of looking at rentals or share houses. He hasn’t been approved for a mortgage yet, so that’s quite some time away.

He’s not paying any rent. He does some odd maintenance/little Reno jobs, but we haven’t asked him to and sometimes it’s not actually what we want.
He is home all the time when he’s not at work. It’s hard not to be, due to the current lockdown in my city. But it’s just difficult he’s always in our space. He cooks in the kitchen every night, so it’s hard for us to get in there, and a few times just left things cooking to the point they burn to a crisp and it stinks out the house. He’s doesn’t do any cleaning. His dog smells and he brings her inside all the time. 
He’s the type to be extremely sensitive and argumentative whenever I discuss any of these issues, and says mean things to me. So I avoid confronting him.

I’m wondering if it’s fair for me to say it’s now near 2 months of you being here, you need to find accomodation? Or do I need to give him more time? Maybe ask for him to pay rent? (I’m reluctant to ask for rent because he’ll think he can stay longer and we really want him gone)

Our city is in a lockdown but you’re still able to move house. He’s working and saving plenty of money, so I don’t see why I need to financially support him just because he wants to buy his second home (he already has an investment rental)",02Aug2020,1
