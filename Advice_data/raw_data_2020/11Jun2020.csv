3,"So I'm a 16 year old trans guy (relevant dw) and I'm 5'1. It goes without saying that that's vastly shorter than the average male.

My height is a real source of stress for me. I've gotten to a point where it's always on my mind. It doesn't help that my friends are constantly making jabs about it - they don't know how I really feel, and I always try to laugh it off. But the truth is, being this short makes me feel like I'll never be anything.

A bit of context here - I'm pursuing a career in musical theatre. Now, I don't know how much whoever reads this will know about theatre, but seeing a guy my height onstage is practically, if not completely, unheard of. Ensembles usually have to be between certain heights, i.e. 5'8 and 5'11, and I can only think of one short leading man despite knowing a huge amount of shows, and he's still taller than me (5'4). I feel like I'll never get cast as anything but the comic relief best friend, or more likely, I won't get cast at all. I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I'm reasonably talented, and I can't stand the thought of people overlooking me because of something I can't control.

Moreover, being around cis (non-trans) guys my age, who are all around 6 feet tall, makes me feel like I'll never be a ""real man"". I'm not a shallow person by nature, I try not to judge anyone by their appearance, but I feel like it's all people see about me. I don't fit in with anyone, and it's humiliating when pretty much every kid over the age of 12 I come across is taller than me.

I have a history of mental health issues, and dumb as it sounds, being short is one of the biggest things that makes me suicidal, at least right now. Envisioning a future surrounded by other actors who are all a foot taller than me makes me think I'd rather die than experience it. I know it sounds stupid, I mean there's a million perfectly valid reasons I could be sad - I've had death threats for being trans, and my family doesn't accept me. It would make sense to be miserable for those reasons. But thinking about my height makes me feel like I'm nothing. For the first time in years, I feel like I'm at genuine risk of suicide, mostly because of this, and I don't know what to do.

Sorry for the rant. If there's anyone out there who has any advice, please say. I'm at a loss.",11Jun2020,1

And I laughed hard and my ""sorta friends"" (I'm in their group) stared at me in shock. I mean in my defense comedy is subjective and I guess my sense of Humor is very extreme. After that, i sorta thought about it and questioned myself and forgot about it because I just thought comedy is subjective so... and 2 weeks later one of the people in the group got hurt and I just laughed at the person. I mean I can't help myself it was just funny to me. Then I noticed how my classmates reacted differently and at that moment something was wrong with me mentally.

The thing that I am afraid of is that I will forever be like this I want to be the person I was before with friends and jsut being normal. Another thing is that when I get called out that I offended them I really dont give two shits about them or everyone in general like if someone died in front of me I really don't care.

28,"My partner and I live in a house that has been converted into 3 flats. Annoyingly, we live in the middle and have had to deal with annoying noise from both above and below but nothing too serious.

We all get along and usually have a quick hello or how are you when we cross paths. I’d obviously like to keep it this way but am really getting fed up with our upstairs neighbours habits.

The thing is, it feels a little irrational because they’re not necessarily doing anything wrong. The building is just so old that we can hear everything. The issue is that they have a later bed time than we do, we try to fall asleep from 11:30-12am (which is pretty late as is!). But they start their going to bed process at this time.

For some unknown reason, they tend to walk back and forth and back and forth (meanwhile dropping at least 3 items on the floor per night) from 11:30-1:30am. God knows what they have to do for that long of a period (I always get it bed and that’s it). But here we are...

I was working at my location since April 2013, slowly moved up the ranks and was made a Full Time Manager in 2015. When all this Covid stuff went down in March, my coworkers and I were all laid off.

During quarantine me and a fellow manager kept in contact, got close and formed a romantic relationship. This was in April and we are still dating. I was brought back to work on June 8th but before going back I emailed my HR representative and my General Manager to inform them of our relationship. The manager I am dating didn't return and decided to stay laid off until she felt it was safer to go back. 

Today (June 10th) I was fired with cause because I breached the Code of Business Conduct and Code of Ethics and Standards of Behavior policy that specifies Managers are not allowed to have romantic relationships in the work place. This is understandable and I did sign the policy. 

This is where it gets tricky though. Technically my partner is not employed with the company and she isn't planning on returning in the future. So was this a just fire or should I look into fighting it?

Hi everyone! First time posting here, I hope it's ok (it took me a while trying to figure it out where I can post this).

I always had an obsessive mind, I remember ruminating since I was a kid (especially about bad feelings) and it's kind of an issue, so I know that is not something that is gonna go away easily.But now I'm wondering about specific tips that could help me with this in particular:

I find myself thinking about the same person all the time. People say that talking to yourself out loud isn't really abnormal, but the thing is that I'm *constantly* having conversations with people on my mind (about things I wanna tell them, things that I like, things that I found funny when I'm hurt or sad) it's kinda having an imaginary friend.I'm not very sure if that is normal anymore (but that is another issue).

The thing is, I have severe insomnia (you can guess some of the reasons) and it is starting to bother me that some of the reasons I can't sleep are because I'm thinking about this person.

He is someone that it's not currently on my life (whom I care for) but I decided that I needed to stop giving so much energy to that friendship. Our relationship wasn't equal so I decided to stop, but I still spend a lot of time thinking about it.People say that you shouldn't invest time or mental energy into someone that doesn't invest in you too, so finding myself thinking this much kinda bothers me because I'm sure that he doesn't think about me.

And yes, I could find hobbies and stuff that I like to keep my mind off that, but how do I stop thinking at night when I have nothing to distract me from?

TL;DR: How do you keep yourself from thinking at night about obsessive thoughts when you don't have anything that can distract you?",11Jun2020,96
38,"I (23F) feel stuck. I’ve briefly struggled with depression and anxiety. I don’t know how much it actually impacts my life as it comes and goes, so I tend to downplay it, but Covid-19 has definitely amplified my negative emotions. I don’t like my life. I can point out some specifics about why that is, but the problem is that I don’t know what I’d prefer over my current situation. And that’s why I don’t know where to start. I just feel lost. 

I created a daily routine to try and bring some normalcy and meaning to my life, but it mostly consists of surface tasks like beginning to experiment with skin care, hair care, stretching, etc. I have low self-esteem and I know that improving my appearance and physical health will help to an extent. I believe you need to look good (to your own standards) to feel good! At the same time, I feel as though I’m just trying to conform to society’s beauty standards, which I find superficial. I have very few interests and hobbies at the moment, so it’s hard to incorporate something creative into my daily routine as well. 

I guess what I’m saying is that, I know for a fact that I need to look deeper to love myself and find happiness, but I don’t know what brings me happiness. Maybe I haven’t lived long enough to understand what my passion is, but until I find out what my purpose is, what can I do until then?

43,"Okay so to start with, my boyfriend and I have been together for about 9 months now. We lived together during quarantine due to me being vulnerable, he did all my essential stuff for me.

So I am a hairstylist, and I have been living in a college town for 4 years. My boyfriend lives 2 hours from me and we see each other on Wednesday’s and weekends so we drive A LOT. We have been planning to move to a bigger city which is halfway between where I live and where he lives, and it’s closer to my family, so I’m excited to move. When quarantine started I moved in with him temporarily because I lost my job for a bit and I am vulnerable. We did great, I loved it, and honestly, bills were so much easier to make because we halfed everything else. After quarantine when I got back to work I have been growing more and more ready to
Relocate to a nicer bigger salon, because I want to keep growing in my career and living in a college town, clients arent exactly stable. So to your surprise I’m getting tired of the town I live in. 
I have recently sent my resume to a salon, not expecting a reply and now I have a interview this week 

So here is where I need advice. 
I’ve been trying to figure out where I’m going to live because my boyfriends lease isn’t up til January. The original plan was in January him and i will move in together to a apartment and save money for a rent house that next year and then I suggested I was going to move into  a apartment and he was going to move in with me in January and my boyfriend will finish my lease out with me and then we move into a house but now My boyfriend suggested I move my stuff with him we finish his lease up, cut our bills in half, save some money, and get a rent house that is an actual house a whole year before we planned to. I was hesitant at first afraid it’s to soon but now it’s starting to sound enticing 

My mother says it’s a great idea but my dad says it’s not, he wants me to wait til my boyfriends lease is up to move in with him because he doesn’t want us getting stuck in the small town my boyfriend lives in and driving 30 minutes to and from every day is wear and tear on my car and be expensive. 

Butttt I disagree to an extent. My bills will be cut in half so what I pay In gas and tolls will not be anywhere close to what I pay in bills right now. 

I’m torn because one parent is saying do it and the other is saying please wait, and I just don’t know what to do.

46,"My boyfriend and I are both 18, and his parents have a beach house that I’ve been to with. His family a few times. To celebrate my birthday we wanted to stay over mostly just so we don’t have to worry about driving home at 10pm and can watch the stars, etc. Fun relaxing evening stuff. His parents are fine with it, and I brought it up to my dad once when I was 17 and he said we could talk about it when I’m 18. Since I’ve asked he said he’d have to think about it which basically means no, but he’s gonna take longer to tell me so plans can’t be made.

I don’t understand why he’s saying no. The reason he said before was that he didn’t want to say yes to letting his underage daughter sleep over with her boyfriend (even when his family would be there). He said he trusted me, etc. and basically made it seem like he was fine with it except for my age. Now that I’m 18 I have no idea why he’d still say no if he trusts me, likes my boyfriend, and seemingly the only problem was that I wasn’t an “adult” yet.

The fact he’s saying no but claiming he “trusts me” makes me feel like he doesn’t and that’s upsetting because I guess I don’t know where I stand with him. I’ve never been the teen who goes out to parties or is reckless. I’ve always been on great behavior, I was an excellent student, I graduated and going to a great college, I’m responsible, and have never given him a reason not to trust me, and he usually is okay with letting me doing the things I want because I never do anything stupid. He knows that.


I’m not really asking how to convince him to let me go because he’ll make up his mind either way. I just want some advice and input on the situation from other people. I’m at a loss and feel like he doesn’t truly trust and respect me like he says he does and it’s making me feel like there’s a strain on our relationship now. I just can’t see why he says no if he’s basically backtracking to explain that he completely trusts me, etc, and all things that implies that he’s okay with it.",11Jun2020,2
48,"Some background context: we're each other's first relationships. I have been on dates with guys before, but he's the first guy who I've really connected with and fully committed to. He never really got girls in high school or dated around, so I'm his first ""everything"". We also met on tinder. He also had anxiety in HS and was really lonely for most years until senior year, where he glowed up and made friends with the boys in his grade.

""B"" and I started dating December 2018, and since then, we've had our ups and downs. About six months into our relationship, I asked him when I could meet his friends. Our discussion came to this: both of us aren't really comfortable meeting each others' friends in full settings, so when we meet each others' friends, it would only be me, him, and his friend to start, and vice versa with my friends. He promised me ""soon"".

Just a sidenote: Before this talk, he mentioned going to a party, and said something along the lines of: ""I'd bring you, but I don't know if its a good idea..."" When I asked him to elaborate, he said something about his friends being stupid, I can't exactly remember. It hurt me a bit, but I brushed it off. He also did invite me once to dinner with his friends, but I feel like it was just an invitation to appease me because he knew I'd say no because I wasn't really comfortable in a full setting. Fast forward to the January of this year and I ended up not meeting any of his friends, although he said ""soon.""

Maybe I'm being paranoid because of my past, but I feel like he's embarrassed of me. I talked to him about it before, and he said it absolutely wasn't because of that. but I don't really see any other reason why. In the past, it was a big issue for me. Two guys I've gone out with hid me from their friends, deliberately took me to places their friends wouldn't go to. I try not to apply that to my bf because he's not them, but I don't understand why. I think it would be because of my looks or my weight.

He also told me that his friends don't do that. They don't bring around their gf's to meet the other boys. His one friend has been with this girl for 3 years and she hasn't met his friends, but they started dating in high school so I feel like that doesn't really count. As far as I can tell, his friends are a bit ""bro-ish"", complete opposites from me and the friends I hang around. He always gets in a bad mood whenever I bring this up. At this point, I feel tired of not being listened to after bringing it up multiple times. I love him, but I'm tired of the fake promise sand as much as I don't want to, I'm considering giving him an ultimatum. But the other side of me says: ""if he really wanted to, he would have, and you shouldn't have to force him."" He's really sweet to me, listens to me, and he's my best friend but...I've been thinking about it a lot and I feel unhappy in our relationship even though we have good days.

I suspect that I will be wanting some help relatively quickly after we get home, but my mom (who lives out of town) is basically beating down my door to get the green light to be here when we get home from the birth center. So far, I’ve been able to say that things are up in the air in regards to having people around because of Covid, which is true. But I don’t really want her breathing down my throat as soon as I’m home, and she thinks that, by virtue of being my mom, she is entitled to seeing her grandchild (despite us not having the best of relationships). On top of the pressure of ensuring the health of our newborn, it’s just a cocktail of really intense emotions and frustrations on my part. 

ALLLLLLL that to say.... does anyone have advice for 1.) navigating Covid and visitors with a newborn (even though we live in a mostly open area of our state, PA) and 2.) dealing with demanding family members that, while being annoying, could also be somewhat helpful. 

I don’t want to disingenuously use Covid as a reason to not let people visit, but I also want to ensure that I’m keeping my child safe. And dealing with annoying family members on top of the pressure of bringing a new little one home is weighing on me, on top of the whole safety thing. Any constructive thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",11Jun2020,1
51,"For the last few years of my life, since i was 10 (im 14 now) my mother has always made suggestions for me to go on a diet. I struggle alot with my body confidence and self esteem and i feel like being around her is ruining it even futher. I have gained a signicant amount of weight the past couple years due to stress eating and binging and purging. She's trying to get custody of me which I do want, but I'm not as sure anymore as the last couple days here have really hurt me.

While shopping for clothes she feels the need to pick the largest size they have even though its far too many sizes big than i need. i only need an l-xl and she chooses 3x. Eariler today she told me that i should start drinking slim fast and down sizing my dinner signifcantly. When she plates my dinner she only asks for me ''Oh is that too much, should i take half of the ribs off'' and i just end up saying yes.

Is it understanable for her to comment on my weight or unacceptable and to what degree ?",11Jun2020,8
52,"My brother is around 3, and he has kind of gotten used to sitting and watching TV or being on a tablet. I don’t really like it but it’s just the family barely plays with him.

I’d like to play with him more but I just find it enjoyable for maybe 5-10 mins before I get tired. I’m either tired or just don’t like/feel like playing, usually I just pretend he made me pass out and have fun with him as he tries to wake me up or I scare him, but it’s like an excuse to just rest a bit.

Is there any way I can feel more motivated to play with him? Does anyone have any fun games you play with little kids that you yourself can enjoy or even rest on?",11Jun2020,1
53,"TL;DR: A new hire who is starting in my previous position is making the same amount as me now even though I have been working at the company for 2 years and have since joined a new team that is more technical and has more responsibility!!! I am honestly contemplating if I should give in my two weeks notice to the company since I just feel so under valued. What should I do?

To start off with some background context, I have been working at this company now for about 2 years. I initially started at a lower position straight after college and after a year and a half was promoted / selected to move to a brand new team at the company which has a lot more visibility within the company and greater impact to the companies goals &amp; initiatives. 
During this time the company also merged with another forming a new corporation, meaning new executives &amp; entirely new HR department. 

Since this was my first real job coming straight out of college, I did not really try to negotiate for a higher salary since I was just happy to finally find a company and position I liked enough to say yes to. Over a short amount of time it became clear that I was well suited for the job and ended up learning rather quickly, surpassing many of the more senior members of the team. 
One by one, many of the senior team members either took a position in the company that they liked more or ended up leaving the company, leaving me, less than 1 year at the company the most senior member on the team of around 8. Which meant I had to train and assist all of the other team members, some who even started out before me. At this point I KNEW some of those same people who came after me and that I was helping with their workload were getting paid more than me. 
Management had their reasons. ‘They had more experience coming into the position.’ ‘You haven’t been here long enough to get Senior title and get a bigger raise.’ ‘You didn’t fight enough at the beginning to start at a higher salary but your pay raise is a bigger percentage than everyone else’ Etc...
Whatever, I let it slide since the pay gap wasn’t too large and they would always promise me a higher raise at the end of the next review discussion. (Some coworkers I knew didn’t even get a raise so knowing that I was happy with at least knowing I would get a raise).
Some more time went by and I got picked to get on a different team. Again, even on this team I was the youngest member. Even had a higher job Title than one of my coworkers on the same team and I KNEW I was getting paid less. This time SIGNIFICANTLY less.
Again I tried to fight this and get at least equal pay but they had their reasons... ‘He somehow convinced management he should be paid more.’ ‘He started with a higher salary but again your pay raise percentage is much higher.’ ‘You have more opportunity for growth.’ Etc...
Whatever, alright imma just do my job. And do it well so they HAVE to pay me more... I feel like anyone else in my position would have left already at this point. I was really thinking about it, but I liked the company and didn’t want to go through anxiety of finding a new job and starting all over. 

I kept going and I know my manager knows I do good work and deserve to be paid more. It’s not up to him apparently though. It’s not up to the new management of this merged company and new HR department. I even tried talking to our CEO saying how unfair it was I was getting paid less. I told myself I would wait a year, to see what my next raise would be. But now I found out some new information that just angers me to my core. 

I recently found out a new hire ( old friend of mine ) just accepted an offer with a base salary of what I’m currently making!!!!! He is a recent grad, with no previous experience, and frankly only got the position because of a referral. 
I had to fight so hard to just get where I am now. And to be clear the raise is 30% more than what I started out in that beginning position and that is after already working here for 2 years and moving on to a new team. 

This overall just sucks to find out. I feel so under valued. Some upper management know I am essential to this current team and the goals we are working towards. I also like the work I’m doing and want to continue doing it. I just want to be paid fairly to do so. I am also not big on confrontation and will literally start crying if I talk to my manager about this. When I cry, I also hold back on how I’m feeling so I don’t cry more and just accept whatever excuse they come up this time. 

I just don’t know what to do. The way I’m being treated with compensation makes me want to quit. But also during this time I don’t want to quit and not find a good job with the big Rona roaming the world. 

This was really more of a rant if anything. But if made it to the end of this, feel free to give some advice on what I should do or give me some words that would help how I’m feeling. 

There is actually a bit more to this topic since it was focused on me, but I also know that the rest of the team the new guy is currently on is also getting paid way less than what he is starting out with. Which just sucks to think about as well.",11Jun2020,1

59,"The backstory is we have never met in person. He is someone I conversed with on another forum years ago. I exchanged contact information with him. At the time when we met, I was an impressionable 21 year old. I admit it is my fault for being naive and trusting. We would speak on the phone, meaning we would call or text each other.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I used to be a bit outspoken but now I realize that he tried to condition me to not give my opinion on things, so that slowed down for a while. I would ask him for advice and he would give it to me. It did not always work but he would swear it did.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, well I remember he would tell me not to get tattoos because they were ""ghetto"" and black women who get them are seen as hoodrats but white women who get them are artistic. When I would end up getting tattoos, I did not tell him because it wasn't his business, but he would say why didn't I tell him? Mind you his daughter who is older than me has tattoos and so does his ex wife. He would also say I shouldn't color my hair and just leave it black. he would even say that black women who wear long acrylic nails are ghetto and that we can't wear it like white women do.

&amp;#x200B;

He would also say if you have a child out of wedlock, then it is the worst thing ever. I have no children. His ex wife has four children by three men. He raised his ex's son as his own, but he is judgmental of other women who don't marry the father of their kids. He made comments saying as a black woman, we are stupid and this is why black men are not interested in us after a while. It would make my self esteem go down, but I would try to please him (I was young and so dumb, I know I am being hard on myself).

&amp;#x200B;

He made comments saying I should call my boyfriend my master. He said white women who date black men have no problem calling their man ""master or owner."" I am not lying about this, but these comments would freak me out because I know they are not true. Any time I would say or do the opposite, he would say things like ""well a white woman wouldn't talk back"" or ""a white woman would do it and not argue."" I felt like I had no choice but to basically conform. What i did not realize was that he was grooming me and trying to mold me into a type of woman. Always saying that black women are not feminine and that white women do every thing right so we have to be exactly like them.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to let everyone know, I have friends who are white women so I don't have anything against them. I just felt like he was being manipulative.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I figured out that he lied about something else. I know I stated before that I met him online. I have never exchanged info with someone else that I spoke to on a forum. So I will never do it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Well what I realized is that he lied about some things. He said he was dating a woman who was a light skinned Creole from Seychelles that lived in New Orleans, Louisiana. He said this woman was born in 1993. He sent me pictures of ""her"" that were pictures of different women. He sent me a picture of a woman. All this time, I assumed it is the woman from NOLA named Katie. Well, I came across a music video. I am not making this up, I am being as honest as I could. The music video had the same woman in the picture he sent me. It didn't make sense because it did not add up. The song came out in 2003. That means Katie would have been 10 years old. The picture of the woman he sent me was a Latina woman. I saw her in the video, so i reverse searched the pictures and found out he downloaded it on Google.

&amp;#x200B;

I was surprised at that. I started thinking what else has he lied about? I started feeling like he is a pathological liar. His three children (including his ex wife's oldest) has her second husband's last name. Their last names were legally changed. He says he is an investor and pays his daughter's bills, but she works and admitted to living in a home with other relatives. So nothing he said added up. He would even make fun of President Trump's comments about my heritage (Haitian). Trump said that the country is a s-hole and well my former ""friend"" teased me with this, saying did I know what Trump said? He laughed as if it was funny. Then he would call me a b word or tell me to stfu. I have so many regrets for ever talking to him. I also feel he hated black women like myself and would take the frustrations out on me. He would swear he was always right about things when he was not. He also called my boyfriend a thug when he has never been arrested nor went to jail/prison. He said that black immigrants hate ADOS or black Americans when his people did all of the work to come here and benefit off of their blood, sweat and tears.",11Jun2020,1

81,"I live on the second floor of a nine story apartment building in Washington DC. Like most of us, I have been home all day due because of the quarantine. Around noon, I tried to toast a bagel in the oven but it didn't warm up at all, I thought nothing of it at the time tbh. After dinner, I decided to sit outside for a little bit and when I came back into my apartment, I noticed a very distinctive gas smell. I checked the pilot light and they were on so I immediately thought of the oven from earlier. I went to the lobby called the emergency number, but there was no response just a machine saying the building was closed. they have a very especific number and extension to dial for emergencies which did not work. I called the landlord (which I didn't want to do at 9pm!) because I felt this was an emergency. She asked me if the pilot light was on and I said yes, but I still smell gas. She told me she would send someone to my apartment to check on that in the morning and to leave the kitchen window open. she assured me it would be fine to wait until tomorrow. I'm not sure if this was dismissive or if she's right, but she's been nothing but nice and helpful since I moved here so I'm not sure if I'm being dramatic or if she's not taking this seriously enough.

Update:
I called the fire department non-emergency number and told them I suspected a gas leak. They said they would contact my local fire house and they would come out and check for me. I have also found a nearby hotel I can stay at for the night jic. Let’s hope This isn’t a big deal or anything, but I’d rather be safe than sorry.

Update 2:
The firefighters came and checked my apartment. I definitely had a gas leak (although small). They shut off the gas to my stove and told me to open the windows and it would be fine. Someone suggested I do this in the comments but I wasn’t able to move the stove. They had a device to measure the natural gas in the apartment and they told me it was already going down. I feel a lot better having called them and them telling me it was safe to stay here. Maybe I’m extra sensitive to the smell because the leak was really small, but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

A bit of context, I met a girl at a comi con years ago and we became fast friends after finding each other online. Nothing happened romantically or sexually then, we got along but neither of us are are the type of person to go all the way with someone they just met. For years we supported each other, gave advice, and even jokingly flirted. I was happy to just be friends at first but then thoughts of a relationship slowly crept their way into my head. At first I pushed them away, she lives in a very big city in Texas and I live in Rural Oregon we grew up in completely alien worlds yet have so much in common. Eventually I decided I couldn't ignore these thoughts I had so I started saving up for a big trip to Texas to see her.

I'm average height, only recently started exercising again so still slightly overweight and have a low paying job as a line cook for a restaurant. He seems like a great guy although I've never talked to him and in her words he thinks I seem pretty cool too.

I want her to be happy and with whoever she's meant to be with be it me, him, or anyone else I just want her to have a good life as she's had a fairly ruff life so far.

 A bit of contex: I have been raised a jehovah's witness my whole life, as has most of my family on my mother's side. Over the last six or so years i have slowly begun to realize my own sexuality and just how tight of a predicament I'm in. Recently i have distanced myself from the faith as i have, in the past year, come to terms with my own sexuality and even come out to all my friends to great success. But coming out to my family im afraid is a totally different beast. They hate LGBTQ+ people, it's not a 'god hates fags, march outside of a pride parade' type of hatred, its the quiet and venomous, rumbling just beneath the surface, sort of hatred if that makes any sense.

 The predicament i face is im 70% sure my entire family will excommunicate me, and my parents may even kick me out onto the street or worse. On top of that my dad is my employer and im afraid of workplace harrassment or even being fired.

92,"My brother is 4 years older than me, almost 30 and lives with my parents. He has had jobs which he quit and spends most of his time gaming with irregular sleeping patterns. Off the bat he may sound like a typical 'neet' but... our circumstances have been very unique. We moved to a new country at around 18y/o. New language new everything. He did not quote adjust and started gaming more and more. He is very sporty and eats healthy but at one point he started 'party' drinking. He quit when he saw it was bad, it seemed like it wasn't hard to quit and he'd still be having fun and partying without drinking. However just about a year ago he started again. He'd get drunk with people, never on his own tho. Drinking is not the main concern anyway. 

I'm worried about his mental health. He has always been somewhat odd. He doesn't pick up on social cues, has no interest in small talk and talks very little in general (unless it's nonsense joking with people).  I thought it was because he's antisocial or just awkward but lately i think it might be more than that... I've been around awkward people but he seems like he honestly does not understand that he's acting weird. He would talk about his games with me or my cousin even though we have no interest or understanding about it. 

He has told me once the only time he was truly happy was when he drank, because he did all these silly things. And that worries me. 

How do you help a person discover what makes him happy? How do I help? Should I ask a doctor whether he has a condition? Should he know that? How do you ask anyone to help a almost 30y/o man? I don't know what to do...

Note: in our culture mental illness awareness is non-existent but the country we moved (Norway)to is very aware of such things and could help but I don't know what to even look for....",11Jun2020,1

97,"Repost because I'm still unsure of what to do and got no advice.

Please don't say anything about me being a simp. That was old behavior.

I'm gonna put the tl;dr up here.
Screwed up a friendship, drama happened, friends changed dramatically and that lead to many arguments and friends being lost.

Now what I want advice on is on how to cope with these feelings, which I will explain later.

First, some context. (I don't want to hear stuff about meeting people online. You can meet some very genuine and nice people online.) I'll keep try this as short as I can, but basically I met a girl on discord, who I simped for. (Don't attack me please.) I'm also friends with a few of her friends. There are about 3 of our mutual friends involved and 1 of their friends (I am not friends with this last one.) My simping continued after the girl I met got into a relationship. (Stupid, I know. I had a disorder called Obsessive Love Disorder. You can search it up.) 

Eventually, I was confronted by 2 of our friends and I stopped some of my behavior. It lingered slightly, and I was confronted again, by everyone mentioned previously this time. It was a lot of telling me what not to do and stuff. So, I stop contact with said friend because that's what I was told to do. In the discord server, I was previously a staff member but was booted and replaced by their friend who I was not friends with. (I don't do posts like this often so sorry if it gets confusing. You can ask for clarification.) In the server, we had previously changed our nicknames to Sailor Moon stuff. For example, mine was ""Sailor Sol."" This time, they added something afterwards, such as ""Sailor Sol: The Speed."" 

Apparently the friend I was previously simping for had done this again, however I saw some of my other friends doing it and joined in. I was accused of doing this to get her attention and was admin-abused by the person who replaced me in staff, who was constantly changing my nickname to ""Stop copying,"" even though he himself copied the nickname and despite me having stopped my behavior and cutting off contact. (He does this again afterwards, when the owners put ""issa"" in the beginning of their nicknames and he does the same. I don't know what the joke was but he was copying them.) He also has broken the rules several times when I searched his messages (racial slurs, disrespect, etc). An argument ensues because of his abuse and eventually, the friends who were against me start turning against this person.

Fast forward a few days. The people who confronted me were my friends now, but the girl I simped for and her friend were getting into arguments with them. The guy told one of them to kill themselves and the girl was acting overall toxic, calling them insults and even banning them from her servers. The point is that now, they're gone from our servers and we all (besides her ex-girlfriend) hate her. 

I'm conflicted between hating her and wanting her to come back. I believe that her new behavior is due to her friend's bad influence. Part of me wants to give her a second chance, hoping she'll realize her mistake and come back. Yet there's still a lingering part of me that's wants her to suffer. I want to yell at her and attack her (not physically) but I need to hold myself back for the sake of not causing drama and for my friend who is still on good terms with her. I'm very confused on what I should do and how I should feel.",11Jun2020,1

102,"So I started a job about 6 months ago. I was encouraged to apply for it, by someone on the search committee, and it was good money so I applied. When I got the job, I was aware that my coworkers at my new job may not be super pleasant (I learned this through prior interactions). Still, everyone kept telling me how this was a great opportunity. I started working my new job and my boss quit within the first month of me being there because she hated her job. They didn’t fill her position so I haven’t had a manager really for months. They just finally found someone to fill in, so I have someone interim for the time being. Meanwhile I have been learning my job by the seat of my pants. I have had bits and pieces of training but nothing super formal. My coworkers are overwhelmed and frustrated and can be abrasive because they are overworked. So getting guidance through some of them can be hard. Also. In March, just when I thought I was getting the hang of things, we had a major system changed which changed much of everything that I had already learned. Overall, I’m very anxious all of the time because I feel like an idiot and I don’t feel like I have anyone to go to. Also, when I was hired, I was supposed to be the lead in one area but now I’m doing something totally different. Am I being a baby? I already have super bad anxiety and have been just trying to find a career that I like since I graduated college but it seems I keep making the wrong choice. Am I just too sensitive?",11Jun2020,1

106,"I worked for this company for over a year and recently just got fired for theft (sweethearting in smaller words). I have never really had issues with the company as I was a senior cashier and even trained new employees. 

One of my newer coworkers got caught giving away free product when cashing customers out. She would scan less than half of the product and then just put it all in the bag KNOWINGLY for hand fulls of customers. 

I caught wind of this and immediately reported it, as I think that’s completely out of line and it’s part of my employee agreement to report such acts. Not even a week later I get called in to review and analysis and GET FIRED FOR THE SAME THING ! 

They had a video of me ringing out a coworker. I rang up all his items and then deleted one off the purchase. May I mind you it was 5 months prior to me being investigated so I honestly couldn’t remember the transaction or why I had deleted it. In the video you can clearly see me scanning quick and then also quickly recounting. 

I expressed that it was obviously an accident and as I don’t remember the transaction I’m sure I just miss counted. He had two of the same brand protein bars along with many other items and I only cashed him out for one. It was $1.27 and a one time slip up for my whole year of working there. 

This is a government business I worked for and they have now fired me for theft. Is there a way around this ? I would never have knowingly done that which I expressed to them but they didn’t seem to care. 

It was a complete side swipe as I asked when I went in there if I was in any trouble and they guaranteed I was not. I’m just at a loss for words and don’t know what to do. They didn’t give me my whole paycheck by check form that day and they won’t give me a copy of the termination papers as I have requested. 

I signed a paper at the end of the investigation (I was very distressed as I was more confused and shocked than anything) and frankly idk what I signed but my manager told me I had no choice but to sign. I thought she was in my corner but it’s clear that she is not. Hopefully someone has some advice. Thank you in advance.",11Jun2020,1
107,"I was responsible for collaborating on tasks, communicating with, and essentially leading the work of this intern. 

I want my boss to feel good in having hired a good employee, and since I was responsible for giving him work to do and lead him, I feel like my own leadership qualities would look bad if I was honest about this intern’s poor performance.

My boss wants a bulleted list of topics/attributes to aid him in writing a recommendation letter, and I’m facing an ethical dilemma whether I should just BS these or actually be candid about how this intern did very little actual work. 

He would be helpful in brainstorming, always had a good attitude and was a smart kid, but he never actually *did* anything I asked him to do. He was certainly capable, and he had taught me a couple of things when I got hired (2 months after him).",11Jun2020,1

111,"Best I can describe it.
I've been playing guitar for 12 years, singing for 5, and since quarantine started I've got the hang of bass guitar. Songwriting and performing has been my dream since I found it was something you could actually do for a living.

So I got ordered a great laptop, some microphones, interface and DAW. Couple things I'm still waiting on, shipping confusion and stuff. But I could record with the way it is now.

But struggling to learn the programs used for music production has thrown my whole attitude towards music out of whack. Guitars and stringed instruments in general are so intuitive for me now, I could play pretty well blindfolded. But translating that to software feels so alien, it doesn't even look RELATED to music.

Started doubting myself, my writing, kinda just spiraled. I have a lot of anxiety at all times (pot helps a lot), but especially when performing. Probably related.",11Jun2020,1

We are paid by the job and not by the hour and I feel that this really hurts my productivity. Any ideas to help me from second guessing myself?

113,"My best friend's been dating this guy for 3 years--she talks about marrying him a lot. I've been friends with her since we were in 2nd grade. We're 22 now, and she met this guy back in high school when they were just friends. 

I never liked the guy. He's a know-it-all who talks down to you and refuses to believe he could be wrong, sort of a 'my way or the highway' kind of guy. He's also lived a very sheltered, privileged life, and most his life ideals just come from things his father's told him--so he doesn't really think for himself too well. We all grew up pretty sheltered in a very discriminatory smaller town, predominantly white. I went off to college and got exposed to a bunch of stuff, realized how horribly sheltered we were and how racist our town is, he didn't. 

We've always clashed, due to me just not liking his attitude. But our biggest conflict: he's Blue Lives Matter and I am absolutely not. In fact, he wants to be a cop and would be a 3rd generation police officer (his dad and grandfather are/were both cops as well). I'm a pretty hard supporter of acab... I've spent years highly deliberating the police brutality debate, getting exposed to it first hand from events in college and what not. We've gotten into 2 rather large 'fights' about this. The first started when I tried to explain the racism behind Blue Lives Matter--because he's ignorant, not blatantly white supremacist. He told me I was threatening his family and ideals and actually threatened me. And then again, with all the protesting, I tried to explain my views on why I supported the protests and the demand for change, and he basically just told me I was wrong, and once again, attacking him. He;s just not in the right place to talk to about these things because of his 'his way or bust' attitude, like he just won't listen to any points I have to say and acts really immature about it. 

I only tolerate him because he's dating my best friend, but this last fight pretty much ended it for me. I don't want someone like that in my life, and I told my friend exactly that. But then she got really mad at me and said I didn't trust her judgement in picking a good partner and I didn't care about her because I wasn't willing to further get to know the boyfriend and care about him as a person. 

I'm very conflicted about all this. My friend is like a sister to me, I don't want to lose her, but I can't stand her boyfriend and I don't want to be his friend or support his ideals, because they're racist and wrong, even if he claims they aren't. But they're both always telling me I only ever attack him and refuse to see things from his perspective. My friend always says he's working on communicating better and working on his know-it-all, better-than-you attitude, but I've known him for years and honestly haven't seen any change. Essentially, she's all excuses for him, and neither of them have had the exposure to police brutality that I have, but are very set in their ways. (He supports cops because he's from a cop family and wants to become one, and she supports her boyfriend, no matter what he says). 

Am I a bad person for not wanting to try and work things out with him? Has my not really liking him from the start given me a prejudice against him so I really haven't given him a fair chance? Or have the 7 years I've known him been plenty of time to judge his character and see that he's not changing? And even if I try to cut him out of my life, can I even do that without also cutting my best friend out of my life?",11Jun2020,1

116,"Greetings everyone. I am in a dilemma. I recently bought a vehicle from a person in my town during quarantine. This person gave me a pink slip (title) and she gave me a bill of sale from the person who she bought it from. She bought this vehicle from a person during quarantine as well and since all the DMV offices were closed she could not put vehicle in her name. so now I bought this vehicle and I have the pink slip and I have her bill of sale but unfortunately the bill of sale says $0 as of the man gave it to her as a gift and she did not have a Gift Affidavit document. The DMV will not accept this bill of sale without a notarized gift affidavit and I cannot get ahold of the original owner. The car is still in this man's name and I have tried getting ahold of him, and he does not respond. So I am not sure what to do. the girl who sold me the car can't me give me my money back because she spent it on a new car.

I could've never gone to the school trips my friends went to and I couldn't stay outside for many hours. I also have never stayed over at a friend's house.

So to start from the beginning. I'd like to say that I'm a decent person, but lately I'm starting to doubt that. I am aware of the fact that I'm not the nicest person on this planet, because I believe that not every person deserves compassion and should be treated as well as others. I'm also not a very emotional person in most situations which is why I often lack the ability to help my friends with emotional problems, not that I don't care I just can't seem to give helpfull advice.

The doubt however started 3 months ago. In the town I live had been a shooting where a man killed 6 people due to racist beliefs. They held a ceremony for the victims where they would light a candle, pray for them and collected donations for the families. My girlfriend wanted to go with me but I said I wouldn't go because I have never known any of the victims and although I feel sorry for the victims I couldn't feel sad about the death of people I had no connection with, so I just gave her some money to give the families and thought that would be it.

However she started started calling me a heartless and cold person for saying what I said and went of without me. At first I didn't think much of it since we never talked about it again. But then I started to think about it and believe she could be right.

128,"Hello. So, I'm student of some university. Being chosen by the department headman I did a lot of work of spreading useful info among other students of all years and other usual work, everyone that made at least a year in higher education know how it works. More or less, all teachers were all the time ok with my work. Then I get a little sick leave for almost a month and one student started to do my work (and I'm grateful for that) so every student could be in touch with fresh information about seminars, lections, practice, exams, etc. Another things to do were keeping group's money bank (few hundred dollars) for different needs like papers, markers and more; keeping attendance journal and helping lecturers to prepare classrooms. So, with time that student figured somehow that she's now in great power and started to misinform all students. Somehow the student convinced a lot of teachers that they have to distribute most of duties from me to that student. I'm still the headman but now every time the department spreading some info it becomes a total circus that I'm waiting for official info and the student starts to misinform people for own purposes being helpful and needful. And then I need to do double work: giving right information and saying that the previous isn't right. So, the group themselves are same very annoyed with everything going on this way. What can I do? I'm not clinging to status of headman since there is no advantages. The only thing I want is to have properly explained information (so if I want to have clear info, I'd better do this by myself) and the straight contact to the department to solve issues.  


Extra info: there were a lot of problems, when the student took the attendance journal just to show everyone around that she has the journal (because journal is power in her mind, that's not true in real). Also, she troubled the amount of money in group bank and finally I needed to add a little from my own cash since it's my responsibility to keep that. There were problems with timetable because of her actions for five weeks (!). Gave some opportunities to her only friend before other students so they have advantage of participating in a limited event that is valuable for students. And so on, a lot of little things, that totally ruin students quality of life.

  
The other problem is that department and teachers don't do anything at all to help with the situation. Even after I show the long list of issues with that student. So, maybe any good advice to solve the thing? I'm planning to figure out the full list of issues and fill up with calls the department since it is summer vacation and they can freely change everything around.",11Jun2020,1

135,"What should I do about my mother? I am a 20 year old girl who still lives at home with my single mother. I do chores and fix almost everything around the house. My mom and her boyfriend don't do much physically, only financially. I don't have a job, even though I have applied to about 40-50 places in the past 4 months.

She is constantly putting me down for not having a job, but believe me I'm trying. She will make me call each place I apply at right in front of her, even though the ad on indeed/glassdoor/etc usually say not to call with a follow up. She only will let me apply to places that are minimum wage, and get really angry at me if I apply to a place I actually want to work at that will allow me to use my skills and make enough money to actually move out(marketing agencies, sales offices, etc). She also tells me I'm not ready to move out because I won't ever get a job that will pay enough, and that I am not mentally ready or smart enough to do so.

I have a girlfriend who stays over often, and I have told my mom to knock before she enters my room, in case me or my girlfriend are changing, or were being intimate. She refuses to do so. She often will walk into the bathroom while I am in there doing my business and it starts a fight whenever I tell her to get out. She always comes back with ""I changed your diapers and we're both girls anyways"".

She is always trying to fight with or about my girlfriend when she has done nothing wrong to her, and now my girlfriend is fighting back. My mom will ask me about what my girlfriends flaws are, and she tries to get me to complain about my gf to her.

And last but not least, she's constantly putting me down or starting a fight about whatever she can. She makes me feel bad for not vacuuming 3 times a week, or for asking for a doctor's appointment. She makes me feel bad about being autistic, and have a panic disorder and won't even accept my 2 diagnoses I've gotten for them and will often shred any mental health related paperwork about me. She pampers the dog and will take him to the groomers/vet whenever he needs it (they take him whenever he throws up even), but whenever I am severely hurt or have an illness like strep or mono, I usually have to beg her for a month until she will take me to the doctor.

She tracks everything that I do (my location 24/7, what i spend my money on, and she won't even let me go out with the friends that only she doesnt like) and then will get mad at me for wanting to stay in my room whenever I am home.

Am I being unreasonable or ungrateful? I know she pays for my housing and food, and I give her all my respect but I feel like I get none back. Is this how parents should act? Am I just being a bitch about it? Or is there something actually wrong with this situation?",11Jun2020,1

Not that I care anymore if she replies or not but I just find it really shitty...considering the situation the whole world is in right now. The least she could do was respond. I just don't understand how people are like this. One thing I've caught on to is the fact that she was truly never happy for me in high school and after.

I finally spoke up about it recently and he basically told me he doesn’t want anything serious and that he never really liked me which really hurt my feelings. so we’re basically just friends I guess which also hurts because I don’t see the point of me talking to him if it isn’t gonna go anywhere.

but it’s hard because I really like him and I’ve just been really alone during this quarantine, like I have maybe one or two friends but it’s not like I talk to them every single day. And he texts me every single day and its just nice to no someone wants to talk to u.

but lately it feels like I’m forcing some thing that’s going to fall apart. every time I reach out to him I feel like I’m just annoying him, like he always wants to play video games with his friends and he doesn’t want to call me anymore. 

I can feel us drifting apart and it makes me sad because we’re really close and I thought we could’ve been something more.

146,"In the beginning of this last school year I had to move from a public school to an online one because of grade reasons. I chose to go to an online school and at the time I was fully prepared to deal with not having any friends because I had my best friend (BF) who has always been there for me. I lost all of my friends except for her so she’s been all I have. At some point I started going into online communities and made friends there. I was so stoked about being able to talk to people and I started a semi close relationship with someone which recently ended.

I tried telling my BF about all this but she never seemed interested and it really hurt my feelings. We gradually stopped talking and it kind of turned into this whole misunderstanding. Eventually we talked again and made up for not reaching out to each other and agreed to not let things get like that again.

The problem comes with today. She was telling me this story of something that recently happened to her and she mentioned that she had been talking to a lot of other people for about a month or so now and I had no idea. Don’t get me wrong, I’m completely okay with her having other friends, I can’t control her and I would never try, but I was kind of hurt that she never told me any of this because I tell her everything still. I ask her everyday how she is and how her day has been but I never get further than a “good! How’re you?” So I thought everything was fine again, which now I think is ignorant of me. I also realized after the ghosting she unfollowed me on all my social media accounts despite me never even using them beyond texting her through them, to me this looks like she wasn’t thinking “I can’t bare to see her page,” and was actively trying to get rid of me or something. 

When we made up and started talking again, my mom told me that sometimes you drift apart and you’re not as close to someone as you once were. I figure that’s my problem, I’m just so miserable. I have no other friends, I don’t have a job, nor can I look for one due to the virus, and I have major anxiety that has ended a lot of friendships before they could start.

150,"So this girl I know is absolutely insufferable.

Backstory: 

She and my other friend was telling people to commit suicide and kill themselves which I do not condone. I made a post about how I don't think that sort of talk is emotionally mature and that if someone I know says that stuff around my child, I will have no problems cutting them out completely. She decided to comment trying to rationalize that ""if I did something so horrible that everyone hated me and told me to do it, then I would, so it's fine. That's how mental health works"" so I told her she was immature and blocked her on all accounts.

Thought that was done. Well, this chick has a bit of history of making bad choices. She put her son up for adoption after a month of having him because she decided she would rather party instead of care for him (thank god the child is in a better home now), and would constantly yell at him because she simply is not fit to be a mother. She accused an innocent black man of sexual assault to hide the fact she had decided to do outcalls despite advice telling her not to.(the whole story behind that is complicated, but i got screens of messages of him talking to her asking her why she told people he assaulted her and she said it was just a joke and her friends were blowing it out of proportion) and she was constantly in a Mom's group on facebook asking for free handouts (like a free iphone XR or anything free that she doesnt really need) despite not having her son any longer which she eventually got kicked from because it's a group for mothers to help mothers in need, not entitled young adults.

Soooo... my sister decided to call her out when this girl posted another message telling someone to kill themselves while pretending to support the BLM movement (despite being the kind of creepy racist that fetishizes black people, I'm still convinced she would have not adopted her son if he wasnt fully white) 

She blocks my sister, then asks my friends for my number who refuse to give it to her because they know what's going on already.

Well, she messages me after she finds my number in her contacts on her phone, (which I guess she forgot she had) telling me my son is better off without me because I'm fat??? Idk why that has to do with my parenting but whatever...  and I call her out about bitching at me for shit my sister said to her and then block her.

Well... NOW she is making fake accounts to message people I know trying to start shit by spreading fake stuff about me and it's getting kind of ridiculous.

I've thought of making a PSA or smth about her but I feel like that will bring me to her level.

What do I do to get her off of my back? How do I get rid of her? 

If anyone is skeptical of my story, I do have receipts I can share in DM but otherwise, I just want to know what the best course of action is.


TL;DR some chick got mad at me after my sister called her out on her bullshit and she is now making fake accounts to harrass me and my friends. How do I go about dealing with this?",11Jun2020,3
151,"I've been friends with this person for about 6 months. We got super close very quickly, and it seemed like a great friendship that would end up prospering. We created a bit of a mutual friend group and it was really cool to feel accepted. However, the amount of things they've been doing recently have made me want to cut ties with them, but I don't quite know if I should or how I should do it. Let me explain my reasoning:  


It started when they made a spam account (I know, already a questionable play). They started tweeting about their emotions, and me, being the ""dad friend"", would check up on them periodically and ask if they were alright. Never too often, just every couple weeks when I would see something a bit worrying. They removed me from their account the first time, I asked them about it, and they said they just freaked out, so I followed again. The same thing happened, and I asked again- I was met with the same answer. They then asked their mutuals on their main account to follow the account, so I did because I still care about them, and they removed me again today.  
On top of that, they've started indirecting people on their main account very often, never telling anyone what the actual situation was and deleting the post afterwords. It makes everyone involved upset, and my friends and I have seen that it seems to only stir up drama. We don't want to mention it to them, however, because they have a tendency to blow things out of proportion and cut contact as soon as you give them a bit of criticism.

Speaking of drama, this person gained a bit of a following recently on social media. My friends and I were and are still very proud of them for gaining the followers they have, but we all feel like they have just up and abandoned us. They haven't properly spoken to any of us in weeks. Usually, I would just attribute this to growing apart or just making new friends, but it happened to all of us at once. It was like they just packed up their things and left.  
I've tried talking with them about things and they've been ignoring my messages, but on public servers they'll respond or when we're in call in a public server they'll act fine.

TL;DR: a friend of mine has been subtweeting people, ignoring me, and being generally toxic, and I don't know whether to try and talk to them and keep them around or keep my distance.  


I still care about them and I feel like I might just be viewing the bad, but I don't know if I should keep them around because they're causing me large amounts of stress. Any advice/tips?",11Jun2020,2

I feel like this shouldn’t get to me as much as it does, because I’m a guy. But, it does. 


So, my girlfriend and I have been together a while (a year and a half, which is considered a while since we are both 16 I suppose) and I may be a guy, but I love feeling cared about in gentle ways. Being called sweetheart, baby, being the little spoon sometimes, getting my hair played with. You got it. 

My issue here is that my girlfriend for some reason absolutely won’t show me any affection like this. In fact, the things she calls me are starting to seriously agitate me. She calls me “handsome” instead of any other nickname. Which in theory is sweet, but it just loses all of its meaning when it’s every sentence. It starts to annoy me because she replaces normal nicknames for your partner with the word handsome (example: when I call her sweetheart, she’ll go “thank you... handsome...heart” or when I call her cutie pie she calls me “handsome....pie”) and I feel so bad for getting agitated but she gets PISSED whenever I even suggest slightly with body language that I want to be the one being held for once. It makes me really sad and upset. I’ve brought it up with her but she in so many words has told me that she thinks it’s weird to treat a bf like that. Now she even mocks me about it.

i'll keep it fairly simple; two months ago while i was still at college, i had a 2 week stint in the hospital and needed surgery (during that time i lost 35 lbs and 11% of my muscle mass, leaving me pretty weak, trust me this is important), drove home with my parents to recover and isolate myself as i have a compromised immune system, week after we got home my parents got drunk and kicked me out because i wasn't ""contributing to the family"", and i've been staying with my gf and her family since. i was pretty inconsiderate of my gf's feelings and failed to break out of a selfish pattern and now we're at kind of a stalemate. i've apologized and taken responsibility for my actions but i can't take any of them back. she's said nothing to me over the past few days other than i hate you and you don't care about me, etc. i'm afraid i don't know how to fix this problem, and afraid that i'm too late and broke her trust too many times. i can't keep living here, i want to repair our relationship but i feel that by living here i can't do that. i could go back home, i've talked to my parents and they've still been supporting me and they apologized for what happened but i know that if i go back i put myself at risk for more emotional abuse. i've hatched a plan but i can't decide a few things about it.

my family has a cabin that's about a two hour drive from here that's not visited too much, now, i don't have a car but i do have access to an electric bike which would get me there in 10 hours. it's a fairly safe ride (mostly trails) but i'm also still pretty weak. the cabin is also close to a small town where there's a market and a few jobs are open in that area as well. neither my parents or my gf or her family would let me go so i'd need to leave without them knowing. now here's the tricky part, this family has taken care of me and shown me so much love and support and it would be so shitty of me to leave unannounced (not to mention extremely worrying for all parties involved) but i feel like i don't have any other option. do i leave a note? do i talk to them? and about my gf, i don't want to leave her like this, i know i hurt her and she says she doesn't care about me anymore but i love her and that hasn't changed. i'm so insanely conflicted. please any advice is appreciated, i'm so fucking lost.",11Jun2020,1

A has had little to no luck with women, despite his best efforts, is very into internet culture, particularly when it comes to making offensive or racist jokes.

My SO and I have discussed moving out but it isn’t exactly realistic and seems like an overreaction.

None of us are very anti-gun or anything, but with our living situation there’s very little safety reason to own a gun. Aside from him suddenly developing an interest in firearms, we just don’t know why he would so quickly go from not caring about guns to owning one.

165,"So im currently in a dilemna and could use some advice. 

 On my familys property i built a very large garden (roughly an acre) to share with the other residents. I flattened the ground, built the fence, built a dozen or so raised beds, helped one of my tenets section off a place for chickens, installed irrigation and much more. 

When i first built it the plan was for everyone to share the garden, and any ideas / changes would be talked about as a group.

Well its year two after garden construction and things have started getting tense. Some of the tenets, my best friend and his wife, have started taking a lot of agency in the garden. To the point of removing plants from other tenets garden beds and replanting them with their own plants. 

Now, ill be the first to admit that my friend and his wife are EXCEPTIONAL gardners. But the goal was never to have them do all the gardening, but to share the space and do equal labor. The other tenets feel as though theyve been muscled out of the garden and recently one got reprimanded for inspecting some potatos prematurely by my friends wife. The wife said she felt ""disrespected"" because of all the effort she went through  in the garden and that the other tenet was out of line. 

Am i in the wrong for thinking that even though they could do all the gardening that they should curb their gardening enthusiasm and allow others to have a crack at it? Should i simply limit the amount of garden beds they would have access to and try to give everyone an equal amount of space to work with?

168,"I was told I was a level 1 hoarder because I have containers full of clothes, some slightly worn and some never worn with the tag still on them. The clothes I regularly wear (work or casual occasion) I keep in my closet and dresser which is also full.

The reason my clothes are in containers is because my previous apartment had a walk in closet so I had the space to store everything. I recently moved to another apartment with a smaller closet that has a washer and dryer so the usable space is even smaller. I just put my non seasonal and non casual clothes and shoes in the containers until a special occasion where I dress up. 

They are in nearly stacked containers, they dont take up space, not in the way of walking or blocking any exits or anything, not dirty, and the containers are air tight. The clothes still smell new.

I've never seen it as a issue because all the women I know have huge closets full of clothes, so to me this is normal. The only difference is they're not in a closet. Also when I buy new clothes, ex. bras and panties, i throw out some old ones that have ripped or worn down alot. My friend doesn't see that part though, they just see containers of semi new clothes that I ""never wear"". Keep in mind it's an epidemic and theres nowhere to go right now.

I'd love to settle this once and for all because I'm being told to donate my clothes and that's not f**king happening. I value my clothes too much and I never had enough clothes as a kid so this is one way I treat myself. They aren't expensive brands either.

176,"Hi! I am 23 years old and I came to United States a year ago. My English is not as good, as I need to. (you can see that:)) Now I'm feeling like I'm stuck. I have no friends, no job, no progress in my life. I don't know where should I start to rebuild myself in this country.

I finished my first semester at the community college with all A's, but I can't pass the placement test (now because of the quarantine) to take the ENG 101 class, and because of that I can't take any other classes in the next semester. I don't know what to do next. I want to find a job, but I'm too scared to work with people. Every job requires experience, excellent language and communication skills, but my English is not perfect, I still making a lot of mistakes..

177,"Hi Reddit,
So I‘ve finally gotten past the hurdles and matched with this awesome guy on Hinge! We’ve been writing to each other over the app for a few days, and I find I like him and really want to get to know him more and potentially meetup someday in the future :/
The problem is, he’s only temporarily staying in my state for a summertime job, and I’m stuck in a city two hours away without a car (I’m staying with my family currently for lockdown). 
He already asked me out on a date but I had to decline because I’m not able to come down to his city due to lockdown, and he would be gone back to the west coast by the time I returned to his city for the new college semester (i am in the Midwest coast).
Even so, we have still been writing to each other and I really enjoy the conversation, and would assume he feels the same way since he’s still responding and engaging in it. 
But I am really unsure of whether or not I should ask for his number. I just know that I likely won’t be visiting the west coast anytime soon because I’m broke, so it seems kind of silly to maintain conversation with him if I won’t be able to meet him soon. But at the same time, there’s always that 1% possibility that maybe he might want to keep talking and meet up in the future (and who knows, maybe long distance relationship). I really want to get to know him more and meet him live someday, but I don’t want to come off as desperate or clingy... what should I do?",11Jun2020,0

179,"Hi guys, 

My dad has been obese for as far back as I can remember. He is 200lbs, which doesn't sound like a lot except he's only 5'3. This puts his BMI at \~35. He also has high blood pressure (which he won't take his meds for), sciatic nerve problems, and probably an array of other unknown issues (he is very doctor averse and won't go to the doctor until an issue has exacerbated to the point that he cannot handle it). He has good health insurance, he is just afraid of doctors. His weight is getting to the point where he can't walk around a store and he pants when doing normal tasks like cutting vegetables. 

The thing is, he knows he has to lose weight and he knows what he needs to do to lose weight (diet + exercise). But he keeps getting stuck in this cycle: has some health scare/epiphany, goes on an insanely impractical crash diet (only eating boiled vegetables, only eating oatmeal, only drinking wheatgrass juice) which of course he doesn't stick with, then he breaks after 2-5 days of the diet, coming up with some excuse like ""I'm starting to feel weak from this diet"" or even using events like me taking my MCAT exam as a justification to order take-out. 

He also definitely has some sort of mental health problem, I'm really not sure what. But he behaves...very child-like. Like throwing tantrums when he doesn't get his way, like rolling on the floor and screaming, going outside and screaming at the sky, which I don't consider to be normal adult behaviors. There's no point in addressing this with him because he does not believe in mental health. But it is relevant to this situation, which is why I'm including it. 

My main problem here is that my mom and I have little to no authority, we are a traditional ethnic family where ""the man is in charge."" Any attempt my mom makes to control his diet for him (cooking healthy/low-salt, discouraging eating out, not buying junk food) results in him throwing a screaming fit. Of course, my mom can't put up with months and months of screaming, so she just doesn't try anymore. She has tried deception: lying and saying the food isn't low-salt or lying that restaurants are closed. But she can't stop him from cooking or buying his own food.

I've tried addressing this with him directly a while ago but of course, as the ""child"", my opinions are automatically invalid."" I've tried guilt-tripping like ""I want my dad to live to see me graduate med school/get married"" which just results in a crash diet which he gives up on after a few days. I don't live with them anymore and I've quite frankly given up. 

I feel like the only options are to wait until he's hospitalized and the hospital controls his diet for him (and of course no one would give in if he screamed at them) or to have him forcibly committed to some sort of institution/weight-loss camp thing where they won't tolerate his nonsense. I want to know if there's anything else my mom can do before it gets to that point though.",11Jun2020,0

190,"B - brother

JNSIL - just no sister in law

Obligatory English is not my first language.

Let me preface this with the fact that I (24F) live in a European country with universal healthcare, so there is no worries around finances when one gets health complications.

Now, I love my B (28M) to death and so does my husband. We both want the best for him and hope for his happiness in the future. The issue arises with his wife, JNSIL (29F). She is quite difficult, to say the least. We've known her for many years now and examples of her craziness include: condescension and mean-spirited comments directed at our child, a full blown tantrum in public over a minor disagreement (hitting the table with her fists in a restaurant and full on screaming to the dismay of other diners), her compulsive lying (will outright invent facts on the spot for her convenience), her jealousy over our biological older sister whom she sees as a *romantic* rival for some reason, her swearing and hitting B during a mood swing *in front of family*, and many more.

Let's just say that we've attempted to signal our worries to B even before he had committed to JNSIL, but that wasn't enough to deter him. We didn't want to loose him over her, so we've ultimately resigned to his decision.

Now, the reason why I'm considering speaking to him honestly about my feelings is because JNSIL has had major health problems in the past 5 years with increasing severity. She is diagnosed with a chronic condition and is at the point now where B is expected to become her caregiver. While her problems are legitimate, they are made worse by her unhealthy life choices which she refuses to change (she is morbidly obese, nearing 140kg). B has followed in her footsteps and is now suffering from cardiovascular complications due to his weight.

I fear for his life and future. I just can't imagine my big brother's slow descent into hell. He wanted kids, he wanted an active life (now made almost impossible in his condition) and a loving wife. What should I do? Is it right for me to talk to him? Won't I sound insensitive or even ableist if I voice my concerns? I'm not saying he shouldn't be with someone with a disability. Rather, I believe he should be with someone who loves him and gives back in other ways, which I haven't seen my JNSIL do. So yes... any advice would be greatly appreciated.",11Jun2020,2

194,"TL;DR:  
How can a skill-less, support-less, 18 year old survive in Hamilton with only the clothes that they're wearing, especially with the COVID-19 restrictions? 

Back story/Context:  
I've never had an excellent relationship with both my parents. My dad's essentially the living embodiment of the narcissist's prayer (particularly ""that never happened,"" and ""you deserved it""). My dad has a bunch of faults (mainly quick-to-anger, insults, hypocrisy), and he refuses to change the few he admits to having. My mother's a yes-woman (sometimes it works out in my favour, but in the end it doesn't). I don't have any negative feelings about her, but she's (almost) entirely dependent on my dad to survive in modern society (she works and cooks but that's about it - minimal financial nor legal).  
I won't pretend to have been a perfect kid. Do something stupid, get in trouble, get terrified of parents, avoid them as much as possible, do something even more stupid, and the cycle repeats, which has led to their poor image of me.

Main issue:  
Now that I'm 18, my dad has been much more persistent about the fact that he can legally kick me out. He hasn't yet but he's making life extra difficult to enjoy (eg have to wake up before a certain time, have to sleep at a certain time, have to leave the house for a certain amount of time at a certain amount of time, absolutely no gaming), to which quarantine has contributed.  
Now that I know his threats are more credible, I've started packing some essentials (clothes, ID, toiletries - other ideas are welcome) and assessing what I can leave behind. He says that I'm free to move out whenever I want and that he won't stop me, but he's handled a lot of my accounts (eg university funding) that I'm worried that any move ""against"" him could cause some serious issues (eg cancel funding which I need but don't know about, withholding money), which is problematic especially as he has most of my IDs locked away in a safe somewhere. I realise that this was a bad idea, and that, at the very least, I should've at least made note of the accounts. I've made a spreadsheet so I have a rough idea as to how much money I should have (at least 20k).  
A big contributor to the issue is my mental health since childhood because of my self isolation (which my parents refuse to note/help with). I like staying home and gaming, but he thinks that it's a complete waste of time and forbids it, which turned it into something even more desirable which caused me to shut out the outside world and basically have zero life skills outside of academics, basic retail customer service, and basic cooking (eg toasting bread, baking frozen pizzas) - I have no idea how stuff like taxes, renting, and driving works, because I didn't think I would live long enough to need them. For the same reason, my self isolation also led me to have zero support (eg relatives, friends). I realise that my addiction to gaming has also contributed to the issue.  
I want to be prepared to move out ASAP and become fully self sufficient so that I can fully cut myself off from my parents, but I have no idea where to begin. My dad says that I ""upset"" him with my ""negative energy"", even if he can't hear/see me, but he won't care once I move out. I also feel that being around him negatively affects me, even if he doesn't directly interact with me.  
I'm not sure if it's best to prepare myself and ride it out until he officially kicks me out (and have absolutely zero support) or move out ASAP and maybe have an emergency-emergency back up plan.  
Regardless, I think the first step would be to get a place to rent, but I'm not sure how (or how much it costs) - especially if I have to leave without any ID or money. I also don't want to sign a lease with a bad landlord and get stuck. I think that having roomates would help ease the costs, but I have no friends to share with and I'm worried about not getting along with them and having conflicts. I attend McMaster University, and think that completing my undergraduate degree will help me a lot even if it'll cause short term financial burdens - I would also like to stay in West Hamilton to minimise the need to commute.  
I think the second step would be to move the stuff I can and make the place as homely as possible (eg basic furniture, internet connection, food essentials).  
I think the third step would be to ""take back"" as much as I can (eg ID, account credentials) - I hope that my dad sticks to his word and gives it up easily and honestly but I don't have high hopes. Even if necessary, I would like to keep minimal legal involvement for the sake of my mom as anything I do to my dad would negative affect my mom financially/emotionally.  
I think the fourth step would be to switch as much of my information as possible to reflect my moving out (eg new job, change addresses, change passwords), and to start living independently (eg cooking my own meals, paying my own bills). I think the last step would be to move on from my past (eg therapy) and maintaining my health (eg exercising). I'm not as concerned about this step for this post, but I think that it's still relevant. 

  
I know of some relevant subreddits (mainly r/frugal), but otherwise I have no clue how any of this would be possible for me, which is made worse by the COVID-19 restrictions (ie I'm not sure what supports I have, especially with lots of things closed). I don't think my relationship with my dad can improve. I believe that my relationship with my mom is ok, but won't help me in the near future.

Overall, my main concern is finding a job which pays well enough, is close enough for me to continue attending McMaster University, and leaves me enough time to do well academically and care for myself.

ALL advice is appreciated. If anyone asks for any relevant information I have missed, I will update this post with it.",11Jun2020,1

196,"I’m a recently graduated high school senior (f), earlier this year I met this freshman girl I could tell didn’t have a lot of friends. She was pretty blunt (important) and could come off as rude, but I thought she was a nice kid. She would ask to hang out a lot, and I thought with our age difference it would be weird, but whatever, so I took her to a bookstore in our town.

To get to the point: on the drive home she opened up about her at-home-life, and admitted she lived with her grandparents because her mom was pretty abusive. Then she blurted out that her step-dad went to prison for murder, then bragged that while in prison, poisoned another inmate and killed him. Nobody found out.

I’ve been thinking a lot about this. 
1. Is this story true?
2. If it is, a man is dead and his family doesn’t know why/ have peace
3. What if she said this for attention?

197,"I have a great salary, and between my fiancé and I, we are working HARD to save the money we need to buy a house, start a family etc. With my current wage, we will get there in the next 12 months. 

...However.

The company I work for has a small sales force, and there is only one of us in each state. So I don’t have team meetings, I don’t have work friends, I don’t have Friday afternoon knock off drinks. Heck, I don’t even know what most of my team look like. 

I look after 600+ “customers”, so building genuine relationships is near impossible. Our interactions are all very transactional and the industry I work in is BUSY, so generally my customers are more annoyed to see me than pleased.  

I drive a minimum of 2 hours worth each day (covering different areas) and spend a lot of time alone in the car. 

My personal phone is my work phone (I get an allowance to cover the bills) so I can’t escape work; emails, WhatsApp, texts and calls are all RIGHT THERE. 

I have worked the whole way through Covid-19 (but my role changed a LOT, and not in a good way) so I’ve never actually been in isolation, yet somehow I have never felt more isolated and trapped in my life. 

My fiancé and I have moved cities a couple of times, and I always make friends quickly through work... But we’ve been here for 9 months and I could count on one hand the friends I’ve made (Corona obviously hasn’t helped that). Not having any “work people” has left me feeling so alone, all day every day (until I get home, I never feel alone with my SO). 

I cry most days now. Sometimes I drive an hour to my first customer, and then sit in my car for an hour just willing myself to get out and do my job... Sometimes I end up starting the car and driving home. 

My job is not difficult (I’ve got it pretty easy for the wage that I earn), but the complete lack of challenge and focus is somehow the MOST challenging thing I’ve had to. I know I should just get over it, but I think it’s gone behind just “not liking my job” and has become a much deeper issue.

199,Since the day I (M18) met her (F20) at the age of four I loved her. I was always fascinated by her personality and she had such an influence on me. I could outright resent a particular thing and if she enjoyed it I would give that thing a chance before eventually liking it as well. Her words were law to me. Admittedly I was kind of a jerk but when she talked back it was enough to make me cry. She has had an ultimately significant impact on my life. However when I was twelve and our friendship started getting a little repetitive I made the fatal mistake to stop spending time with her. Years later I realized this and fell into a depression and more years after that I’ve still barely made a dent in my effort to get her back because of my anxiety. She’s shy and she looks like she already moved on long ago so how should I try to get in touch with her?

208,"So I’ve been with him for a little over 2 years now and he’s 25 and jobless living with his parents still. He’s had a couple of jobs in the past but he quit them and he’s been unemployed for 6 months now and shows no signs of searching or wanting a new job. I gave him some leniency because of COVID, but this has been a consistent problem with him since we met. I have to be his mom and push him to look for a job only to have him tell me that he hates that I think he’s lazy and that I’m not supportive enough. He told me he applied for food stamps the other day which was very disappointing as he’s healthy, able bodied, and fully capable of getting a job, he just isn’t researching or trying or making sacrifices to make a job work for him. To me, it seems like he just wants handouts for the rest of his life. My parents really don’t approve of him because of this behavior and I don’t like his laziness, his messy room, or his desire to stay in his house all day unless I insist he go somewhere with me (which mostly stems from him being constantly broke). He’s a genuinely nice guy (which is hard to come by these days) and the one year we lived together was a really happy time for me.

213,  I don’t know what’s wrong with me! I am so fragile and vulnerable. I can take no critique whatsoever and exaggerate any small notice to maximum in my head. I can literally cry and lose my shit when people laughing at me.  I care what people think of me way too much. It’s so exhausting and I can’t socialize properly because of it.

215,"{I was and still am 16 years old}

So my old routine used to go

200 push ups

50 curls with 25lbs weights

50 pull ups

50 crunches

50 sit ups

4 30 second planks

And i did that for about 2 months during June and July after fasting and losing some weight and i had a decent diet usually only consisting of white chicken breast and rice and beans.Also i never took rest days. My biceps did get bigger not crazy but they did and my first two rows of abs would show in certain positions and especially flexing em. But before i was oblivious to the fact i had no leg or lower ab workouts. I went from 165lbs to 155lbs in those two months.

But it was to much for me because that was my first time committing to a workout routine and after a while it got boring and tiring and when sophomore year started i was in it on and off and around December i just said screw it and stopped completely. I started eating like a normal person again you know chips, soda etc.(not saying every normal person eats these like a lot)

I have adhd and so some things are really hard for me. Cleaning for one, personal grooming, remembering and keeping track of my own scedual is hard, let alone anyone else's! Picking out outfits, leaving time to do makeup, cooking, it all falls short in the end. If i do them at all, they are sub standard.

I was never actually that into it, but somehow ended up doing both a bachelor and masters degree after some pressure from my family. Once I realised it really wasnt for me I was already so far in with so much money invested in my education that I felt like I just had to continue. 

I rarely take any holidays, ever since I started my bachelor I was working during the summer break and similar for my masters. Im actually earning ok money right now, but I just feel very depressed and unmotivated. Going into work is an extreme strugge, Im always tired and have to push myself to do even simple things. I put on a brave face for my boss/colleagues, family and friends but Im really struggling. Im still doing what I need to workwise, but I can feel that it wont last much longer. I dont sleep well, get migraines and just dont want to be there at all. All I want to do outside of work atm is sleep and I didnt use to be like that at all. 

My question is what do you do when you have taken it this far and now in your late 20s is in the middle of a PhD you hate and feel like there is no way out? It just doesnt interest me anymore... I wish I could go back to uni and study to become a veterinarian (which was always my dream), but this would mean going back to student life for 6 years, with even more student loan to pay back and being like 34 when I start working.... It just seems like financial suicide atm and it would make it very difficult to start a family. Taking a longer break in the middle of a PhD isnt really an option either...

229,"      For the last 2 weeks I (M20) have been having multiple dreams a week about my significant other (M22) involving drugs. 

      I knew getting involved with him that he has a long time coke use problem (Involving relapses in our relationship) and at one point in our shared life together, years ago, I discovered he was taking un-prescribed Xanax without my knowledge. 

       This is something that we both have healed from and I 100% have seen a change in behavior and mindset coming from him. It’s not something that crosses my mind anymore. He seems happy without and I have learned to see the signs and I’m not seeing any. It’s been around a year and half clean for him. I couldn’t be happier.

        However recently, my subconscious has been playing a very weird game with me. In the last 2 weeks I have had (4) dreams involving him breaking my trust/or hurting himself.

1. I walk in on him cheating on me, drugs are involved

2. I go to use the bathroom and when I come out I just happen to see him sneakily popping pills into his mouth.

3. I surprise visit him and see coke lines on the table

4. He overdoses

 Every time I have a dream like this I wake up heavily breathing and extremely upset. It’s like reliving a scary past for me, even though everything’s okay now. 

     It’s starting to get to me however, as I’ve noticed on those days I’ve had to stop myself pretty constantly from making shitty comments about his past drug use and/or implying he was now. I do stop myself but it seems like the more I’m bothered about the dreams, the more I spiral into the past- and then the more I dream. I keep reminding myself that we’re fine now and he’s sober but it keeps reopening wounds.

    I just really want to know how to get out of this hole I’ve dug myself into absolutely randomly. And possibly if it’s possible to change the subject of my dreams so I don’t have to think about this very old sore subject. 

Note: I have discussed these dreams with him but not how they make me feel, he seems bothered that I’m having them. I really don’t want to make him feel like I’m accusing him of anything when he’s been on such a good streak so I’m leaning towards dealing with this on my own.",11Jun2020,1

I told my landlord I got this dog, after talking with the owner of the dog for about 3 hours earlier in the day. I was in the process of adopting the dog when I texted my landlord to make sure the dog was okay. Turns out the dog wasn't okay to have, but instead of acting like I didn't have the dog, **I said I had the dog for a week or so.** \*\*\*The landlord knows what the dog looks like\*\*\* I made up a bunch of stuff just to clear the suspicion of it being an undesirable dog.

After a little bit, the stupid owner said the dog got adopted, even though we arranged for me to pick up the dog. I was super frustrated. After learning this the Landlord said dog is okay if I get insurance. Now I am planning on getting a different dog but the Landlord will see the difference, and know something is up.

But it's not really the same as how it used to be. It's like he talks to this girl like 24/7. I hit him up saying ""Yo tryna play some games? Hop in discord?"" and he either replies with ""Can't, I'm in a call with (her name) sorry dude."" or ""Nah not feeling it"" (Which I understand. Games get boring, for sure. I'm cool with that.)

When I took that class my teacher liked my work because I would think outside the box in most of my assignments / projects. But now, I don’t have any form of creativity on me anymore.

Granted I don’t do image editing anymore and instead bought myself a pc to do video editing. I got my pc around November and when I started I was the same as before. Ecstatic with many ideas ready to go, but everything just flopped after a month. I made 1 edit and I kept rewatching it and telling myself that it was completely garbage compared to other editors. So I stopped editing for a couple of months, usually going back then and there to try out a transition I learned or something but I’ve lost the motivation to get anything done.

When quarantine started I thought this was the perfect opportunity to get back into video editing and so I gained some motivation to start editing again, but I had a problem. I couldn’t make anything new. I tried to, but after syncing clips to the song I picked I just felt like whatever I was going to make was terrible.

I have one group of friends (4 other dudes) who were the popular cool ones in high school. Two of them have regents scholarships similar to me and the other two got 2.5 GPAs in high school. The two that have regents I could see being lifelong friends, but the problem lies with the other two.  These guys would bring me a party experience and a lot of fun and all of them are attending the same college I am. 2 of these dudes are heavily into marijuana and do it on the daily and I’m worried this could stray me off my path of success. These dudes are cool but I don’t feel that I can have honest deep convos with them. Overall, these are good dudes and wouldn’t screw me over but I’m just a little worried.

On the other hand I have 2 friends who are much more responsible and I can have intimate convos with them and feel not judged when I share my emotions. These dudes are going to a close nearby college and one of them is heavily into lifting similar to me.

247,"Quick background:

My father and mother both came from mainland China. I don't know about my mom, but my Dad came from the poor countryside of China. (Hang on with me, this connects with my current problem). By being a perfect student in school, he was able to get into Beijing University through his own merit, passing the infamous gaokao with almost perfect scores. I mean, if you wanted the perfect student, he would be your guy, soaking up new information and taking notes in class. Through his own work and **merit,** he managed to raise himself up from the poverty line, all the way up to an upper middle class life in America (just imagine the perfect picture of the American Dream, and that's what my parents manged to achieve.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here comes the main problem. I **love** my parents for what they have given me in life, the opportunity to reach even higher. Hell, they display something rare for Asian parents: they' re relatively flexible. If I want to commit to writing or something in college, they will support me 100%, (though I'm currently going into the medical field though.) However, I've noticed in my teen years that my parents are EXTREMELY racist to black people, saying things like how because they're lazy, that's why many of them won't get out of poverty. How many of them need affirmative action to get into good colleges. In addition, they also lament how the SAT is being considered non-mandatory by a growing number of colleges due to, ""needing to allow Latino and Black students in.""  In a way, their viewpoint seems logical due to how they were shaped by the gao kao. Throughout all of these discussions, I try to suggest to them that maybe,  the reason why this is happening is how African-Americans and Latinos have been shafted by the system beginning at birth, since systemic racism is a thing. They just shut it down, saying would you rather trust a doctor who went to college by their own ""merit"" or through affirmative action. As a result of these talks, I have this subconscious biases that occur in my thoughts when reading about something along the lines of seeing #ShutDownStem, even though I know that those thoughts are wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that concludes my problem, how do I talk to my parents about racism in general, during these times, and how do I combat these subconscious thoughts?

tl:dr: My parents are extremely racist due to background of ""pulling themselves by their bootstraps"" and I don't know how to talk to them about systemic and general racism.",11Jun2020,3

255,"  

I am a western female who is in a de-facto relationship with a Persian man in LA. I mention their background in case anyone has any cultural insights. We will one day marry and are planning on buying our first home together and we currently live in a very small city studio apartment. My partner does not have family here, but have family friends who he visits and maintains a close relationship with. While my partner’s family in Iran are very modern and liberal (they have similar attitudes and values to most West Coasters), the family friends family are not. They are very conservative and old-fashioned Iranians despite living here for 30+ years. It’s a joint family where the 2 sons still live at home with their wives and children, two daughters  (one is a divorced mom) and another child living there so all in all you have 8 adults and 4 young children under 6 living in the same house together. It’s a very patriarchal set up where everyone does what the father wants and he even tried to control my partner in some ways. While we generally get along, its very difficult in dealing with them. Here are some of the issues: 

· The father has at times, refuses to speak English to me and expects me to speak Farsi. He speaks English well and has owned and operating businesses here so not understanding the language is not the problem. 

· We have tried to have the father and mother over for dinner at our place, but they refuse to come over without the whole family. We let them know that our place is very small and that we cannot accommodate more than 4 guests for dinner and over the phone agreed to having just them over, yet all 12 family members turn up without notice. We planned to have them over in separate little family groups so no one would miss out on an invitation and explained this. The children are also ill-behaved and extremely loud screaming all night, jumping on furniture, drawing on walls with pencil etc with little to no discipline. 

· We tried again, thinking that having seen how small our place is they would understand. Instead he wanted me to go to their house and cook for all 12 people (and anyone else who shows up). I wasn’t comfortable doing this and explained this and that we wanted to have a special night just for him and his wife so we could pamper them a bit. He ended up inviting his friend and two sons, his son, daughter  and small child anyway without letting us know. He told us refuses to go out without his family. His children are in their 30’s-40’s and have children of their own.

· Since then we organise day picnics and we never know who is coming or not coming as some RSVP and then not turn up, or random friends are invited without letting us know. With these, we don’t care about the numbers, but more so that we can be prepared for anyone they want to invite or not show up and adjust accordingly so we have appropriate entertainment, food and drinks. Every event is met with criticism and attempts to hijack or control everything. 

· The father attempted to invite himself and hijack our planned holiday overseas to visit his parents so that he could coerce us to get married and celebrate there (at the exclusion of my family and our friends here in US). 

I think all of the above actions are very rude, disrespectful, and inconsiderate given the lengths we have gone to try and accommodate them. They completely disregard us. We have decided not to host them over anymore or do picnics because its too hard and limit seeing them (from weekly to monthly). 

We are buying a house 4 hours away from our city and the best we can afford (if lucky) is a 3-bedroom home (we may have to settle for 2) with one bathroom. And they are already hinting at visiting us for weekends. I stated that they are welcome, but our house will not be able to accommodate everyone for overnight stays. Their reply is that they don’t mind sleeping on the couch/floor. My partner will talk to them and explain the limitations, but given past experience, do not think this will be successful. I also do not like and would never allow people to sleep on the couch/cot/floor of my house as I think it is distasteful. We are not a halfway house and our home should not be treated as such. Our home is our sanctuary that we are happy to share our space, but on our terms. Happy for all to visit, but not everyone to physically sleep in our house overnight.

261,"To me, what’s easiest for most human beings, as a timeline for life, is delving and focusing into a few select things. But as some point you should be old enough to have these steps of progression that lead you to avoid things, with good reason. Does a 35 year old, with no experience and no real talent, really need to pursue standup? Yet is it a wrong path for that person because it seems so out of line?

Not my specific path, but there’s many things I feel I need to open myself up to right now. To almost suspend belief within my brain of what I do know. Things I feel a 22 year old should seek, not a 30 year old like me, essentially. I’ve had very difficult jobs, I’ve lead small teams for a few years, I know work stress for sure.

I have all this supplementary and synthetic knowledge, but the experience is entirely different. I have the years, but they’re not as filled in as they should be. Yet my brain works just fine at my age, I can handle the normal vulnerability we all go through to earn enough money/survive/friends/family, but it creates defense mechanisms to avoid these more unknown vulnerable experiences that are necessary to take in the full picture. I think things like standup are a good example because there’s absolutely no guarantee of a path or strict rules to follow. Or a friend I have who did all these odd jobs in nature, for parks, animal rights, and so on, paths that you sort of make up by seeing what’s out there for you.

I get stuck in that feeling of, you’re 30, that means things need to go a separate way now. You need to start slowing down, yadda, yadda, when I have more focus and energy than I did all through my 20s now. I more see it as a expenditure of the body, and a desk job, for me, is a path a few decades away. However you get there, who knows, but that’s how I see it. Follow the decline of the body.

I’m ready and absolutely willing to let go of these ideas of have about my life and what to expect. But it’s almost like you need to drop everything within reason to get toward that next point, because the habits are so ingrained within the mind that want to stop you from taking a path that is mysterious and out of the ordinary.",11Jun2020,1
264,"Our talk commonly started kinky and lighthearted, I can confirm that she is a real person so CatFish doubters please go, she used to send suggestive pictures of herself, she used to use a lot of emojis a lot and she calls me bb or love. I don't know what I did to mess up but now after talking to her a month she's less flirty with me but still initiates talking to me, sends me a picture once in a while, and she would only attempt to flirt with me when I flirt with her and she uses less emojis. We have also confessed that we like each other, I think she became less flirty when I confessed that I had feelings for her because I could tell she had feelings for me too. 


I don't know maybe, I am just overthinking guys. When I do flirt with her, she would usually reciprocate but there's a rare frequency where she just lets it slide. She also told me that she's afraid of losing me and that she loves me, what I am sure of is that she's afraid of losing me and she has told me that she has never loved someone like me(which I don't know if it's true). Anyways, obviously we have been talking for quite a while so maybe there's a shift of mood but the mood has been so consistent that I am unsure whether or not this will be the mood for weeks and months to come. I also sometimes help her when she needs my help and I ask help from her as well.

So the night comes she comes over to my place and she brought her wax pen too and she kinda kept pushing it in my face until I hit it even tho she only took like one and I took a lot and I was kinda gone from smoking so much. I don’t remember much from the night but I just know some how we start cuddling and she rubbing me and I forgot what I even said then kisses both of my cheeks and almost kisses me but doesn’t. I was so gone that night I didn’t even know what was happening half the time. My whole dilemma with this is I have a slight feeling that she took advantage of me. Like if the we were both high in this situation I would’ve just brushed it off to that but it’s the fact she was mostly sober and I wasn’t. I’m mostly just confused on how to feel about this.,11Jun2020,1

My friend since third grade has recently questioning her sexual orientation. She was for a while claiming to be bisexual but now she says she is lesbian. She lives in a Christian home and has a brother and dad and mom. I’m asking this without her knowledge. 

So recently me her and another friend we’ll call Sofia and we’ll call my gay friend Jordan made a group chat on snap where we talk and share memes and just generally chill. So she has come out to ya and we support and love her and are always with her. But she has been rlly hesitant to come out to her mom. Because she comes from a heavy prodistant (idk how to spell it) family she’s worried they will tell her it’s a phase, not accept her, or just straight out tell her she isn’t.

270,"There was this girl I knew. She moved to my elementary school in 5th grade and when I started middle school in 6th grade we happened to got to the same school there too. Instantly, she didn't fit in. She had a mental disability and she got bullied alot because she had big lips that looked severely swollen but they weren't. We became friends not because I felt bad for her but because her personality was awesome and we shared the same interests. But things got worse in 6th grade.

She started following me home and popping up at my house at random times asking for stuff. People at my school would start making fun of me and not wanna hang around me because I was friends with her, so I started being rude to her. One day after school I talked shit about her so bad and she left crying. After that I never saw her again and she moved schools. I felt like a horrible person. After 6th grade I moved out of state so I never got the chance to see her or apologize.



It's been maybe five or six years now. Just last year in October she went missing. I still have some of my old classmates from my hometown/old middle school on my Facebook page so I saw a news article. Thankfully she was found alright but I wish I could find her and apologize for the horrible shit I said. I'm a changed person and when I changed schools I got bullied terribly so I got a taste of my own medicine.

I worked hard to get close to her too, hell I even had to sacrifice a relationship with a close friend just so I can help her get over her first ex. It was tough for me to stop thinking about what just happened to the point where I stopped texting people(TL;DR I was quiet in middle school so I wanted to try and be popular person in school and being more sociable) I stopped doing my streaks, I stopped socializing with most of my class and only socialized with my small circle of friends, and it just sucked.

 I put on headphones at night so I can watch my show without disturbing him and his snore is louder than my blasting earphones. 

 he knows this too as I make it clear that he wakes me up multiple times because of it.

We've tried nose strips, nose spray, elevating pillows, he doesn't drink, he also snores in any position he lays in.hes even lost weight to try and help it (20lbs)
I've also tried earplugs

No matter what we do it DOESN'T STOP. To make it even more annoying he wakes himself up or startles himself so he kicks his legs alot and tosses all night to go along with it. It may be a mix of startling himself or he's not getting enough air because his snoring makes it hard to breathe im not sure.

279,"This is a complicated situation so Im going to try and keep it as brief as possible. Slightly over a year ago I was driving home from the grocery store and a woman ran out into traffic and I hit her with my car. I had a green light, she had a dont-cross signal, she just sprinted out and I didn’t see her until it was too late. I will say for the record I was going less than 5 miles over the speed limit, it was a 35mph road and it was 11 PM. I was speeding a little but not recklessly, this woman was not just meandering across the road when I hit her, she fully ran out into traffic and was at fault. Anyways, flash forward through a trip to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, a move back to my parents home and several court appearances later, I am ready to move on with my life. My plan right now is to join the marines because I have no real skills to fall back on despite having gone to a great college. But I cannot enlist until my court case is closed and here is the problem. The court is demanding I pay restitution in the amount of $2500. Now there is a possibility that my insurance company will pay out 10x this amount to the family but the family has been almost completely unresponsive to my claims adjustors attempts to communicate. And while this might not seem like a lot of money to some of you, I currently have a $10/hr job, and I have lost everything from this accident. I lost my apartment, I lost my job (80k/year), I lost my car and I lost my savings (about 5k). I am very done paying for expenses because of this situation as it has already cost me so much, not just financially but mentally as well, it fucked me up for a very long time. So I ask for advice Reddit, should I just shut up and pay the $2500 and be done with it again and move on with my life? Or wait it out and see if my insurance will pay it out eventually, which could be months from now? If anyone would like more info I’d be happy to provide it, I am feeling very, very lost right now.",11Jun2020,2

286,"This post is about a very sensitive topic that I do not know how to deal with. I just learned today that a friend of my friend (someone who I only met once very briefly) has an emotionally and physically abusive mother. There are countless incidents of the mother beating her kids over small things such as spilling nail polish remover. I asked how long this has been going on for and apparently ever since she could remember. For example, she broke her crib when she was only a toddler, and her mother beat her for it. And on top of all of that, after a beating, she tells her kids it's THEIR fault. Not to mention the constant barrages of insults, telling her kids they are always wrong and she is always right, they don't respect her, etc. Even worse she has many siblings who are also abused, some still very young. They have a father who is NOT abusive, but in my opinion, he is still apart of the problem because he doesn't do anything about his clearly abusive wife. Anyways, I want to help her, but I do not know how to go about doing it. Should I tell my own parents, or contact any services that deal with this, or is there a better way to go about it? It does not seem as though the victim wants her own mother to go to prison, and also keep in mind I do not know her really, so I do not know if it's my place to make any decisions for her. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Edit: I am a 16-year-old male living in the US if for any reason that is relevant. The victim is a 17-year-old female, but she has many younger siblings who deal with the issue as well.

However, I never followed through with it or even tried because I was afraid of the idea of death. It took me a long time, but I finally got over feeling depressed and I didn’t think like this anymore.

After years of building myself up, I find that I’m not happy again. So many bad things have happened since coronavirus started, whether it be in the world in general or my personal life. I was doing so well before all of this and now it feels like I’ve lost everything. I don’t get along with my family anymore and they’re at their wits end with me (I’m constantly irritated and taking my frustrations and anger out on them), I can’t see my friends because I’m quarantined and I have been for months straight, and I probably won’t be able to go back to work or school until August if I’m lucky. I feel like I can’t take it anymore. 

I find myself thinking about dying and I wonder what things would be like for everyone if I wasn’t here. I think if I wasn’t, things would be easier for everyone that I know. My family doesn’t want to be around me anymore, but that’s because it’s all my fault. I’ve said and done many mean things to them and when I finally get the courage to apologize, they don’t want to hear it and I can’t say I blame them. My friends wouldn’t have to worry about seeing me anymore because they keep asking when I can hang out and I just don’t have an answer since I’m stuck here. I have to be under strict quarantine due to medical reasons and they know that, but they “miss” me and that’s why they ask. I just don’t want to be around anymore, but I know that if I were to go away, I wouldn’t have a second chance. Any time I get any ideas, I get scared from thinking about the afterwards too much and I panic a little bit. That’s what stops me from it.

I’m in therapy, but I’m afraid that if I tell my doctor this, she’ll have to tell my parents and I don’t really want to be sent to a mental institution or something. I’ve never been to one and I don’t know what would happen to me if I went. I’m just so sad and tired and I probably would have been gone sooner, but I’m too afraid of what happens after that, if anything at all. I’m too afraid to tell any friends because I don’t want them to worry about me and I don’t want to feel like a burden on anyone. 

What do I do to stop this? Please help. I’m desperate at this point and I don’t want to lose anymore hope.

I myself have depression and anxiety and have been on antidepressants for a decade, and I am trying to convince him to see a different psychiatrist or therapist or psychologist or absolutely anything, or that there are clearly better options than hard felony drugs. I’m also trying to get it through his head that there is absolutely NO guarantee he won’t be caught and that what he’s doing is 200% stupid. That he’s feeling good and optimistic right now because the money and drugs are literally pouring endorphins into his brain. But because of this, there’s this wall up that’s deflecting everything I’m trying to say, and instead he’s trying to convince ME that what he’s doing is great and foolproof.

I’m at a loss. He asked me not to tell our family and I gave him my word, but this seems like an absolute emergency. I’m just afraid that if I tell our family or someone that could directly interject that he’ll do something incredibly stupid, i.e. kill himself. I don’t know what to do if he won’t listen to reason. I don’t want to see him in jail or dead.",11Jun2020,3
306,"Yo so I really enjoy HEARING what I'm listening to. I'm not really someone who likes listening to stuff without headphones, even like, when home alone. I think driving, concerts, music playing at work, &amp; parties are the only time I listen to music out loud. So I take my headphones seriously lol. 

I've been using the Beats Solos for a while. However, both pairs I've had have broken FAST. My last pair just straight up stopped charging, and this pair the glue came away from the fabric and now the sound is all weird unless I use the cord. I don't want corded headphones at all, under any circumstances so this is annoying af for $200+ headphones. I walk around a lot &amp; like, if I want to get up to take a piss while my show is still playing (so hearing the dialogue but temporarily not seeing what's happening on screen). 

I've had knockoff $30 airpods but I found the battery life to be quite dismal and I spent more time charging them than using them. Unlike the Beats Solos, which one charge could easily last me a week. Like, I've left those things accidentally turned on overnight &amp; still had an insane battery amount left. 

So I'm just curious... Are airpods worth it at all? Is the battery life killer? Do they break easily? Etc.?",11Jun2020,1
307,"Hello Reddit! My one-year anniversary with my (23F) husband (28M) is coming up! I know the first anniversary present is traditionally paper, so I made some wall art involving our vows to each other (18x24 personalized prints that I designed) but I wanted to give him something that he would personally appreciate. Problem is, I don’t know SQUAT about grills. My budget is pretty slim.. probably nothing over $150 or $200 MAX (and even that’s a hard stretch). It’s just something that he’s always commented on wanting and something that I’ve been thinking about getting him for awhile so I’ll dish out the moolah if I have to.

If any of you have suggestions for grills that would be efficient for a beginner then please let me know! And please let me know if you have any suggestions on whether or not to get propane or charcoal!

I feel super uncomfortable by it, but I'm one of his only friends and I feel bad to do anything about it like tell him to stop or block him or anything like that. Whenever I don't respond to a text, he gets annoyed and sometimes texts me about how he cries about it. It makes me feel super guilty and I don't know what to do.

309,"So between the ages of 9 and 12, my mother’s boyfriend molested me, my mother was a nurse and worked long hours, often night shifts and I don’t blame her at all, I was scared of him and he acted like a completely normal person around adults. 

Several years ago he was caught with indecent images of minors, Class A, which in the UK is the most severe, causing my mother to leave him and him to be imprisoned for 8 years. I never spoke up, I thought I was the only one he molested and I tried to not let it bother me, but I was wrong. 

Recently, my brother, who is three years younger than me, told me that he was molested, without knowing I was. I could bottle up my issues with myself at ages 9-12 but the thought of my brother age 6-9 really got to me. Everything my brother said he did mirrored what he did to me, so I knew he couldn’t have been lying, and I told him the same thing happened to me, I couldn’t let him think he was alone. 

We decided to tell our mother, and she became distraught, she blamed herself for it, which we tried to reason with her, there was no way she could’ve known. 

Anyway, I visited her yesterday and found that she had hanged herself, and wrote in the suicide note that she was sorry and couldn’t cope with the guilt. When the police came, I told them mine and my brother’s stories, which they believed fully, I went to the station with them and they told my brother and I that due to the timeframe, the most they could get this guy if found guilty was 20 years, and at that moment I just snapped.

He molested me. He molested my brother. My mother is dead. Nothing else in my life has been affected as greatly as this. And I want him dead. I know I shouldn’t want him dead but I do. Since this is the UK though, there is no death sentence. I can’t help but think how much time would they give me for killing a convicted paedophile, especially since I’m a victim.",11Jun2020,3
311,"I don't know how to start this. I have lost so many friends this year that it isn't hitting me as hard as it should. I thought that graduating from school would be when i lost all of my friends. Going to different schools. Little did i know graduation wouldn't be when i lost my friends. Graduation isn't for another 18 days. I lost all but 2 friends and who knows how long those will last. This all happened like 20 minutes ago. I've been trying to cheer myself up but I'm not gonna lie, it's 12 AM, and I'm having a hell of a start to my day. I don't know what to do, so let me explain what happened.

I've had history with this kid. Let's call him Jake. Despite our ups and downs, we were good friends. Key word, *were*. When I was having troubles controlling my anger cause of another problem I was having, he listened and helped me manage my anger, and deal with the situation. Now that's all gone to utter shit. He never was the best in class, he'd hand in assignments late, and when he gets mad he could and would lash out, get physical, or, just walk straight out of school. That's right. Multiple times he's just walked right out of the whole school, not just the class, the fucking school building. Online learning has been a struggle for him and he stopped working on things entirely. This has put a massive strain on our friendship. Like, our friendship is a rope, online learning is a butter knife trying to cut through it. It's not fast, but surely and slowly, the rope was cut. That was today.

He's been asking for answers, i don't give them to him. I try to give him instructions instead. He never said anything about not understanding. I would give instructions, he would say ""okay"" and then not push the subject further. If i knew he didn't understand i would've tried to help more. I should've asked if he understood but i thought he did cause he accepted the instructions and never pushed it. I was wrong and that's on me. He keeps blowing up on me. His dad and him, well let's just say he hates his dad. His dad is emotionally abusive (if that makes sense) and Jake believes everything his dad says about him. I've tried to make him think better of himself but Jake doesn't listen to me. He hasn't for a while. Every now and then we argue about the answers cause he wants me to give them to him.

This all exploded today. This moment was the rope finally snapping after months of being cut. His dad blocked everything. YouTube included. Jake was happy not doing the work because he had YouTube. His dad blocked YouTube. He came to me to ask for answers. He needs YouTube. I am willing to help him do the work. He doesn't listen to me. He doesn't trust me anymore because i don't give him answers and i don't help him when he doesn't understand (even though he doesn't tell me he doesn't.) He says I'm causing him great amounts of pain. I'm kinda pissed off by this cause all I've tried to do is help him. I say ""I'm not the one not doing work"" implying that he's hurting himself. He takes this as me not caring. I tell him that I'm still willing to help but he lets me know he doesn't trust me. He keeps telling me to give him the answers and that it'll help him, i say no. He freaks out even more. We argue. I mean full argue. I am pretty pissed cause he's turning me trying to help on me by saying ""you don't try hard enough"" ""you're hurting me by not giving me the answers"" and after so many fucking times of hearing this, I'm pissed. We argue. I start throwing a bit of shade that he's just hurting himself. He himself admitted that he pushes the work back until he doesn't do it. He is to lazy. Words he has actually said to me. I have the texts to prove it. 

So when i say ""being lazy isn't gonna get you anywhere"" he says ""I'm not being lazy. Give me the answers. Let me be done with this."" I say I'm not going to. He spams ""iM nOt GiViNg yOu tHe aNsWeRs"" making fun of me. He blocks me, unblocks me, says ""FUCK OFF! STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO"" (but i didn't in the first place) and then he blocked me again. I'm at a total loss. I am gonna tell a teacher at my next online class on Friday, but that's in another day and I'm scared something else will happen before i get the chance to talk to my teacher. What do i do?",11Jun2020,1
312,"I am an Engineering student who works at Makerspace on campus. I as an Engineering intern, we also help prototype as well as creating an efficient CAM path and as well as machining, and create CAD design that can be fixed simply by having a mechanical part. Also, I get to work with circuit stuff ( I am not too good at it, but I learning as I go).

I am getting 12 dollars (US). I live in a small city in Utah and the city I live is kinda sucks for low wages. For example, my brother's wages double as soon as he moves from the city (he is an accountant).

Also, I maintain the shop as well, which is important, and teach people how to use them as well.

Because COVID-19, our campus got less funding from the government, decided to reduce the hours of an intern working there. I really did not think a lot about it, but I can smell BS because they recently hire new interns with the same policy.

Also, I found out Dean decide to cut our hours, and meanwhile, he gets paid 60 dollars per hour and work 40 hours per week, and get to work at home.

Because of this BS and cutting hours, one of coworker quits. Meanwhile, they still want an intern to not work too long. Also, we get the same hourly rate from a girl who does a social media intern.

I am tired of fucking answering all the emails from members outside of working hours. Am I not getting enough money for working at Makerspace? If, so how much should I ask for, and then how to ask politely as possibly can?

PS: also is Makerspace intern good engineering intern? I get help to a prototype which is definitely engineering but mainly I maintain the shop and create a CAM path.",11Jun2020,1

But the thing is I realized I was being abused by them, we'll not my dad but he's never done anything to stop it he actually encourages it and sometimes he doesn't. My mom on the other hand is the one that I fear and hate the most, she always insults me and hits me if I don't do something she likes and I used to think that was normal until at school they taught me about abuse and it still took me years to realize I was a victim.

317,"Hello! So I’ve been having a lot of trouble finding athletic leggings that fit well. I am 5’2 and 120lbs. I have a smaller waist, and I carry most of my weight in my butt and thighs. I’m pretty self-conscious about my legs (and prone to chafing) so leggings are the most comfortable bottoms for me to exercise in. However, I have been STRUGGLING trying to find some athletic leggings that fit properly. For a while I was buying high-waisted mediums. I had gaping in the waist and they fell down constantly. Overall, they just looked and felt ill-fitting. So I bought a few pairs of high-waisted smalls from Old Navy. They are just slightly tighter than I’d like them to be, but they stay in place and I can finally workout without yanking my pants up every three seconds. The other day, I looked in the mirror and realized they give me THE WORST camel toe. The seam running down the front pulls the leggings right up where I don’t want them to go.

321,"First, I’ll say the whole story. 

Bunch of buddies went to my friends place and they took liquor shots off her body and what not when they probably knew I wouldn’t be okay with it. One guy for sure knew because he was interested in dating my ex (that I always made clearly I did not want to ever see or hear about her, that much is at least certain. They all knew this) and one of the guys even lied to my face, blew me off, and went to this guys house anyways. ( the guy who ended up dating her)
Therefore I ended relations with all of them immediately, ghosting them, blocking them, etc. 

Okay so fast forward to today, I saw the brother of the guy who dated her pass by my restaurant window while I was working and ran out to say Hi. We chatted for a bit, then his brother, the NOW ex of my ex, came with the buddy who blew me off to say hi. We chatted, hugged it out, he even said sorry about what happened but was not sorry that he dated her. (which is perfectly fine) 

Now, after we hugged it out and all, the ex of the ex told me they broke up a couple weeks ago. One of them jokingly asked me to come back to the group but said the ex girl will still be around the group (which is my one rule about me coming back to the group, as I texted one of them about it somewhat recently) 

They asked if that’s okay, and if I would be okay with being around her etc and I said “honestly” probably not”

I really do care about these guys. Yea sure they pissed me the fuck off, but I know some of them didn’t really know and the one who actually dated her did apologize. I know him, and know it was sincere, hence why we hugged it out. 

My question to y’all is this tho... 

Should I suck it up, be somewhat chummy chummy with this ex who I’ve never wanted to be friends with, or even in the same room with, or have friends date, to get back in this friend group which I did, at one point (up to around a year ago) hold quite dearly and love?",11Jun2020,1

326,"Recently my best friend did something that has indefinitely altered the trust I had for them. Confidentially within my friendships is VERY crucial, if I tell you a secret it's meant to be kept between us.

So this person told 3 people a secret I was very ashamed of.  (I know all 3) 1 person made fun of me for it, and the other two were people told me in secret that person had told me. This made something in my snap. Because this hadn't been the first time they've done this. Over the course of these months they've done this a few times and I dont understand why. I've obviously confronted them and told them to stop, their initial reaction was saying that I would have told people anyway. Then they said next time they would ask when they wanna tell someone my secret (and they were serious about it!). Now we're here. And I no longer want to be friends. What we have is a great friendship it truly is. But I have so much anger. I dont understand why they did that. You have so many other topics why gossip about my life. I've never done something like that to them so why did they do that.

Though that's not the toxic part.

The toxic part is that I stopped talking to this person for 2-3 weeks because of this issue. But not only because of that but because I want them to stop being close to me. They have this friend who shares a similar friend position in persons life and personally I don't like them that much. So I took this opportunity to give person to them. And I told person. (To clarify person is my friend haha) person said that I'm irreplaceable that there is no competition and correct. There is none because I'm no longer in the equation, I want them to ignore the fact that I ever existed in their life and go off and be with that other friend. Because clearly their gonna be gossiping about my life to one another so why dont I take myself out that way there's nothing in between them. Clearly persons hurt by this. But I just dont understand. If losing me is hurting you. Then why didnt you take an extra second to rethink the words that came out of your mouth. Knowing damn well I told you not to tell anyone. See my problem..I know I'm being toxic..but Idk where to go from this. I'm so angry at what they did, I dont deserve it. So why am I the bad guy for wanting out of this friendship.",11Jun2020,1

329,"Good time of day, Reddit.

So, here is a little background information: I have a girlfriend. I am a 17 year old male (had a birthday last month), she is a 16 year old female, 8 months younger than me. We chatted every day from March, 12th to yesterday. We have simmilar issues in our lives, like bullying, depression, and so on. Because of this, we usually calm down each other when someone has a tantrum. Also, (she admitted sevetal times all that I say here, so I just write facts) we are both egoists and we both sometimes lose temper on our families and loved ones.

Yesterday, I asked her how she was doing, and she answered ""really good"", or something like that. I asked her, what was the happy moment, and she said that she was sarcastic, and everything was bad. Turns out, there was some story, where she did something, and, maybe, enraged some people, she was in a moral pain. This whole thing seems rather shady to me, because she may have done something very bad, that I wouldn't want to spend my time and money on her anymore. Also, turns out that she was hiding this story from me for a long time.  So, we argued for a hour or so, I insisted on her telling the story, I even called her by her full name (e.g. if her name was Liz, I would have called her Elizabeth, you get it). She said that ""it was in the past"", so I started suspecting something even more.  In the end, she told me that she would ignore my messages about it, and I told her that I probably wouldn't write her until I get a story.

So, what should I do? Am I wrong here? Should we break up? I am really worried about our relationship. 

English is not my mother tongue, so I may have spelled or written something wrong or unclear. If you want, I can paraphrase it. Also, I can translate our yesterday's chat, so you could see the whole story better.",11Jun2020,2

334,"   Hi. I'm am an eldest brother who had to move home due to COVID-19. My little sister was 11 when I left and over the three years I've been at school she's gone through a period of being an absolutely awful person. I know it's part of growing up, and she's put a lot of effort into becoming a person who is genuinely someone I can respect. Unfortunately, it's a long road there but fortunately she is still putting up the good fight.
   This means that she can be really awful sometimes. She has a tendency to lash out and is rude whenever people try to reach out. She hides in her room and yells at my parents when they want any help or ask her to join in family activities. This isn't a condemnation, I've been there, heck, I still like being in my room and I'm not totally emotionally mature enough to not get annoyed at my parents, it's just acknowledging where she's at in her life right now.
   She has a lot of friends, is involved in sports, is big into church, is in girl scouts and leads an active life. She is generally a nice person when out and about and bottles up a lot of her hostility, anger, and other emotions which are very strong and takes them out on us at home. I don't want to say this is inherently a bad thing, it is part of growing up and I want to support her as she grows in her emotional maturity. That said, she can be really hurtful and angry, and sometimes it's hard to get over her tantrums and the mean things she says and ways she acts.
   Summer workouts started recently and she's been in a lot of pain, so today I went to help her with her chore of unloading the dishwasher after she asked me. She got upset because while unloading silverware it blocked her access to a cabinet she need in and was just very aggressive. I told her that is she wanted to act that way  I wouldn't help her and it devolved into a huge fight in which I told her she was nasty to all of us. 
   Of course, it was cathartic getting these emotions out after years of her being really mean to everyone at home, but the way I acted wasn't helpful. There are things which, though true, aren't constructive, and lashing out angrily and calling her names is not helpful, reguardless of if their accurate. 
   So I came here looking for advice. How do I act constructively to help her grow through these trying times in her life without being hurtful? How do I say ""hey, you're being rude and I don't feel like helping you"" without her feeling like it's a personal attack? I need help learning how to navigate this, and any advice would be appreciated.

342,"TLDR: I have GAD. I was following company policy when it came to dealing with a guest, but he thought I was a racist because of it, and the resulting anxiety attack made it worse. 

I have GAD and something that helped was getting a job as a receptionist at an apartment. I still get panic attacks from doing something as mundane as talking to my boss about the weather, but I have been getting better. And I will admit I was kind of ignorant, but because of going to college at an open place and meeting so many people, I have become more open minded. Even Reddit has helped in that regard. 

Because of covid, we aren’t able to print stuff out for the guests or residents, only our bosses. Doesn’t matter if they want their lease printed out or they want a copy of the cure for cancer printed out, we can’t do it. I’ve told most everybody and they don’t care all that much. If they need it printed out today, I’ll just try to find some spot for them, like a printing store or a post office. 

There’s a few sister buildings in the area. Today, a man (I’ll call him guy) came to the front desk and asked to have something printed. For the record, guy is African American, if it helps the post. At first I couldn’t understand him because he was talking way too low, but I eventually got that he wanted to print out an important document to give to management about his lease. I told him I couldn’t and told him maybe to go to the post office, as they were still open. 

He got mad and yelled at me over this. And by yell, I mean raised his voice, not screamed. He said there was a man here who printed out his documents for him, and I had to explain the guy was a substitute who didn’t fully get the policy for obvious reasons, as he was just filling in for a little bit so he obviously didn’t get all the rules. 

I feel like he thought I was being a racist, but I was just following policy: I’m not allowed to print things out anymore. Sorry. He’s probably the first person who has had a fit over this, since most everybody either will get mad until I’ll explain why or just not care. 

He even tried to get my boss, but I told him he was at a meeting (which was a half lie, he was just really busy and didn’t want anybody to disturb him). He was mad at me since I was getting agitated (I was because I didn’t understand what was going on and I was getting yelled at) so I had to explain to him I had GAD and the job helped me. He offered some advice on dealing with anxiety and left. 

Any advice? Did I do something wrong? Should I improve? All I know is I had the worst anxiety attack of my life: sweating, felt like I couldn’t move, my left arm got numb.",11Jun2020,1
343,"My SO and I are in our thirties. We have the kind of love that only comes once in a lifetime. We've both been married before and came into this thing in the most honest way I've ever experienced. Before we blended our family (5 kids in total, none together) and moved in together things were perfect. Even after the bumps of that craziness, we are still at in love as ever. The problem is I am having trouble showing it.

I've lost what little zest for life I had before quarantine (which wasn't much). Everything revolves around the kids and I am never apart from them. SO is still gainfully employed full time. He gets to miss me when he's gone and admittedly he does! I've been working part time but mostly from home since March.

Months of being an unqualified teacher while working and barely leaving the house are taking their toll. By the time he gets home I am burned out. I can't seem to get out of ""mom"" mode (or sweatpants) and be his partner anymore. Date nights have been almost non existent for months and as you can imagine with 5 kids there's rarely quiet alone moments at home.

He has recently expressed concern that I don't ""like him"" anymore, meaning I don't take the same time I used to to show him. I just don't have the energy. I want to give him that because it's honestly how I feel. 

How do I get myself out of this rut?",11Jun2020,8

349,"I’m 16 and queer. I like my life, I don’t see people often but I’m trying my best. I feel like everyone around me is having so much fun and experiencing these emotional experiences and all I do is chill at home and take care of my plants. 

Guys don’t really talk to me, and I get that it’s mostly cause most of them don’t understand me or themselves but it still hurts. I have a 4.5 GPA, I’m on the budgeting council and principles panel and I’m the president of a club and I really have faith in myself successfully but I’m not sure if I’ll ever experience fun. 

I really just wanna have fun. I haven’t felt like I’ve had fun since when I was around 12. My brother always tells me how when he’s with his friends or around girls he feels happy but even when I’m with my friends it really hurts to be alive. Sometimes I’m not really sure if it’s cause I am trans, or cause I don’t know myself or what it is but it’s really tiring just sitting and waiting for things to happen. 

I haven’t ever had a crush on a guy, and I’ve only ever kissed one guy and it wasn’t even good. I don’t really picture myself with a guy I’m attracted to and I don’t really know why cause I want a boyfriend so badly.

So I’m staying with my fiancé and his family during this whole COVID time and I am about to be at my wits end. They’ve been kind to me and they are good people but the way they treat my fiancé has my blood boiling. I get that I’m not a parent but they don’t treat him like an adult they treat him like he’s twelve. They limit him because they need a babysitter for his 7 year old sister. He’s responsible and does the majority of the chores in the house (I help as well) and when he points out that he’s doing something correctly he gets told he’s being a dick. It’s infuriating to watch and I want to give them a piece of my mind so badly because just watching leaves me shaking and pissed off. It can be the smallest misunderstanding and yet somehow it’s his fault. When he apologizes he gets told to stop acting like the victim. It’s impacting our relationship cause we’re both angry over this and yet we’re both powerless with nowhere else to go. We can’t exactly leave the situation. I wanna yell at them so bad because I was treated how he’s being treated and I know how badly it hurts and how it impacts relationships with family. I feel like I can’t say anything to his parents cause I could get kicked out for it. I’m trying to give my fiancé all the support I can and trying to help as much as possible. I just feel stuck and I hate it. Is there anything I can do?

Edit: sorry on mobile, also if it helps I’m F(20) and fiancé is M(19)

Edit 2: thanks for the great advice! I wrote this when I was angry and I know that confrontation will just lead to more problems. I just wish they’d lay off him but I know it’s not my place to say anything. While I’m here, any advice on how to be as supportive to my fiancé as I can during this whole situation?",11Jun2020,3
352,"Hey.

I'm 28, my mom isn't even 50 yet. 

She cheated on my dad with this guy C and ended her marriage with my dad to be with C for the last 10-15 years. C molested my sister growing up and my mom stayed with him. My mom has relied on him financially since they've been together. She's never held a job, always has an excuse, and literally won't do anything to help herself. 

Last year C overdosed on heroin in his car and my mom found him. She's lucky as FUCK to have gotten a life support payment and a house out of the deal, but..  For the least year she has been absolutely a mess. She got her ""dream job"" and lost it two weeks later. She won't get a therapist and blames it on the quarantine.. 

I can't handle it anymore. I just don't have it in me to listen to her on the phone and I try to distance.. I just don't know what to do..

354,"recently it has come to my attention that my cishet brother has been asking many of my friends for nudes, which for one thing is illegal because we are all minors, and for another thing is creepy as hell. he also describes how much he loves things about them, like their boobs and shit. he even talks about masturbation with them. three of the friends are girls and one is a boy who my brother confessed to questioning his sexuality over. i first found out through my male friend, and that prompted us to ask my three female friends. i am disgusted that he has been doing it for as long as he has without me knowing. it makes me uncomfortable just being in the same house with him knowing he is doing this. i don't even know if there are other girls he is doing this to. it obviously makes my friends extremely uncomfortable as well.

i've talked to him about this twice, but i can't seem to get him to stop completely. i've debated getting my mother or authority involved, but idk what the rational decision is. my friends have told me that i shouldn't tell someone and that he is just going through a phase, but i honestly feel like some phases are still too fucking creepy to ignore. i've gotten to the point where i'm concerned that once school starts up and we all see each other again, he will sexually assault one of my friends. all of my specified friends have been sexually assaulted in the past, and of my female friends is going to court with her rapist currently, so i can't imagine the kind of stress she and my other friends are going through. i don't know what to do. i feel sick to my stomach. please help me.",11Jun2020,4

363,"Obligatory ""this is on mobile"" so please forgive any typos or formatting issues.

It's a little complicated, but I'll do my best to explain it here. We've been friends for a few years. I was in a committed relationship when we met, but that didn't stop him from developing a crush on me and ultimately telling me. I appreciated the upfront honesty, but made it known that the feelings aren't reciprocated (relationship or not). I find him decently attractive physically, but there's no emotional/romantic attraction.

Fast forward a bit and my S/O hits me with the worst news I've ever received - he wants to end things. So, I naturally turn to my best friend to be my shoulder to cry on. Suffice to say, we grew a lot closer (I kind of kept him at arm's length because I think my ex was jealous) and... Well, we agreed to a *super* casual NSA kind of situation. I made it very clear and he agreed that this was a no strings attached arrangement. I even asked if it was okay considering he had had a crush in the past and he admitted that it never truly died off. He assured me that he understood the terms and that either party could break it off at any time at his/her discretion.

Fast forward again, I've been healing from my break up for about 9-10 months now. I decided to get on Bumble to see what's out there. I've gone on one date so far (nothing came of it), but it's making me realize that I'll probably need to start the ""we have to be just friends again"" conversation. Now, I know his life and choices and mental health etc. are not my problem, for lack of a better phrase, but I still care about him a lot and want to do this in the least damaging and hurtful way possible.

He's confided in me that he's at the absolute lowest point in his depression, he's about to lose his car, his roommate and he keep getting into bad fights, and he is unemployed. I feel like telling him that I'm starting to put myself out in the dating world again is going to be yet another shitty thing in his life and going to hurt. A lot. Granted, this was/is inevitable and he knows that. It just feels like really shit timing. But I also don't want to hide it from him like it's a dirty secret, as if I'm ""cheating"" on him.

How do I let him down gently, or at least bring it to his attention in the least harmful way possible? Should I wait a little longer until I'm firmly dating someone? Should I tell him now? How?

I've been put in a predicament, I have had a relationship with my current gf (F20) for 3 years now however a past friend I had when I was a lot younger recently messaged me asking to hang out.


She continues to insist on hanging out, although there's nothing to do in our neighborhood and I believe she's trying to start dating me. She's admitted to having a crush on me, and still having one.


I also know she's friends with my father on FB and the relationship I'm currently in isn't well received by either of my parents so I don't want to risk her getting angry and telling them I'm still talking to my current SO. (It's an LDR)


I also don't feel comfortable dating a girl underage, it just doesn't sit well with me. I wouldn't ever do anything but I don't like that she wants this, knowing I'm 20 and she's 16.


I don't want to hurt her feelings by being upfront and telling her I'm not interested, but I also don't want to lead her on.


TL;DR: Girl I haven't talked to in 7+ years wants to date, she's underage, I am in a LDR and my parents don't approve.

The only time I've ever owned a more was when I was a little girl. But even then, the bird I had, it shared me. Note me till I bled and that memory stuck with me. And from there I didn't really like taking care of birds. I thought they were cute and funny. Just watching videos of birds were cute. 

Though I never wanted birds ever again. Look, I know they deserve a better home, better than me. But my bf doesn't want them gone and I don't want to give up on them. 

One if them bites the hell out of me and the other is shy. If they stay in the same cage, one will make the other bleed. So we have them in separate cages but close to another. Like neighbors. 

I know I'm a horrible person, but I need help. What can I do to gain their trust? I've tried countless stupid videos that don't explain anything and just fucking ramble on about nonsense. I want them to be able to fly freely and enjoy the house, ((but I have cats so it's a little hard))

With covid, my husband is not even allowed in the hospital. I have to be dropped off and picked up. I... have cried about this. I’m scared. I’ve never had this kind of thing happen and my husband has always made me feel safe. Not having him there at all is going to be really hard on me.

After that, I’m supposed to have someone available to help me for the first 24 hours but the only person I really have is my husband. He works in a startup gourmet donut shop and they have their first news feature the next day, so his boss is making him come in to work ...which means my husband has to be in bed by 3:00 pm to work that night.

help, boyfriend angry and over reacting towards me only? explain?

I had just spent the last two days writing a 5400 word report for my boyfriend while he sat and played fortnite talking to his friends, while putting my own report off thats worth 30% only to finish it tonight 3am with a final exam at 9am. He doesn’t appreciate it whatsoever as he couldnt even do the dishes for me after i finished his report two days ago, instead he played fortnite and messaged a girl i spoke about in my previous posts which angered me because it wouldn’t of been so hard to show appreciation by simply doing the dishes, and he barred me out of the room with the dresser across the door and proceeded to text her playing chess til 2:53am while i was on the couch sobbing unable to get in bed with him. This is one example but in the last four years theres been multiple times ive exhausted myself to help him only for nothing in return. He looked at me earlier while i was scrambling to finish my own report and got half crooked because i didnt have time to finish his powerpoint slides that he was fully capable of doing and sitting there bored on the couch but refused to touch, full knowing my report was due asap and i was rushed with an exam at 9am. 

Then we get in bed after i make him a snack and get him a drink and his blankets ready etc. (typical daily things bc i do everything) and he noticed i had the straightener left on from 5 hours ago. I immediately realized and apologized and felt like a total idiot and he definitely had the right to be upset with me about it i told him, however he took it way too far. He told me to get out of bed and go to the couch and he was going to “punish me” and proceeded to take my straightener and throw it in the spare room and told me if he wakes up and im in the bed in the morning next to him i wont see him for 3 weeks because he will leave. He then came out to the couch where i am knowing i have an exam 9am in four hours, and told me he feels like snapping my $300 straightener in half and repeated this three or four times with pure anger in his voice talking through his teeth he was so enraged. I was lid here being silent after trying to tell him theres nothing else to be done besides be thankful nothing bad happened and i reminded him i felt like an idiot and lesson learned. He then said “im not gonna break it but if i did i wouldnt give u a fu**ing cent of it back because youre childish and need to grow the f*ck up” he then hid my straightener and told me im only allowed to have it back when i ask his permission , reminder this has never happened before its the first time and i learned my lesson, and i didnt say a word to this i let him hide it. 

He then came out to throw words down my throat about how irresponsible i am etc. and told me he might leave me soon and find someone who doesnt do stupid things like that, and i said i might leave too because im tired of the manipulation and anger towards me bc its constantly happening even over minor things like spilt or melted icecream (true story btw). He looked at me and said “good luck finding another guy whos in school and had a car and has his head on his shoulders and smart, youll NEVER find someone.” which i think is a mentally fucked thing to say to somebody. I said maybe i should go find someone to appreciate me and not scare me with their constant anger, which he replied “im never going to change for you ive just made up my mind, instead of working on my anger and hurtful words in the near future im going to keep unleashing them becuase you are no better and need to grow up you’re irresponsible” I should also add i loaned him $350 today of money i barely have for myself so he can buy a new RC truck to add to his collection that he blew $14,000 on during his workterm while i was home paying the bills for myself in our apartment with our dog that he didnt send me money for one bag of food bc “i didnt ask” but i shouldnt of had to in my opinion. He is clearly irresponsible and im not denying what i did today with the straightener was dumb but he intended to punish me and said so many hurtful things as if hes my dad and im really unsure if this is normal or he had a right to say all that with his anger. I believe he takes any chance he can to drag me through the mud because hes usually at fault so it makes him feel great when he finds something to blame me for. Advice??",11Jun2020,1

So this has been happening to a friend of mine a while back, maybe for like a year now, she constantly gets blackmailed by some dude using her face to get invited to a chatroom (basically he's hated) he's also leaked a dick pic of a 14 yr old too and everytime he gets banned by reddit or from our chatroom, he comes back with another alt.

387,"So some backstory first: 

I’m 20 years old, still live at home and am my parents’ youngest daughter. My whole life, I’ve always been goody two shoes in the honor roll. I’ve never been drunk/ on drugs, never been home past my curfew (My curfew is 10 pm btw), never failed a class in school, never talked back, never dated anyone until last month, never snuck out or gone to parties, I always make lunch and dinner on time for the family and clean the kitchen afterwards and make sure the bathrooms and patio are cleaned. 

On May 2019, I began A job at an event company bc it paid more, so I was able to quit the two jobs I was previously working (I’ve been saving up for an apartment for a while but since I started working, my parents have been throwing a lot of new expenses at me so it’s been hard to save a lot). Well, since this meant I was coming home from work past 10 pm (usually home by 11:30pm and the place was about 10 minutes away), my parents continuously tried to get me to quit my job, which I refused and it caused a lot of issues. Adding on that, when they found out I was saving for an apartment (which is when they started to throw more expenses at me), they both told me firmly that I was not allowed to move out. 

Last week, I asked permission to go to a sleepover at my good friends house (I’ve stayed at her house once before and my parents know her) and both my parents refused and said I’m not allowed to go to sleepovers because they don’t like me staying at people’s houses. I gently tried to push the subject more, saying that I understood that I wasn’t allowed to go often but since I’ve stayed at her house before, I just wanted a reason as to why they didn’t want me staying there again (when I stayed at her house, they had me send selfies, my location and I had to be back home by 9 am the next day). My father was furious (he gets angry very very easily and fast) and threatened to kick me out. 


Now, usually when they threaten to kick me out and it makes me back down. However, this time I told them to go ahead, that I had a fair amount saved up (not exactly true, I only have around $4k saved up) and I’d leave out of my own will so they wouldn’t have to kick me out. My father ended up screaming things that I won’t repeat at me and I had to leave the house and go for a drive until he calmed down in order to de-escalate the situation. The whole time, my mother did nothing but sit there and let him yell at me, which she always does because she “doesn’t want her marriage to suffer because of fights between us”. While I was out, neither of them texted to see if I was okay. The only text I got from my father was a recipe he wanted me to make for lunch the next day. 

After I came back (before my curfew, of course) , my mother tried to interrogate me (who, where, what and why, pretty much) and I told her I was serious about moving out and that I’d be gone before 2020 ended. She looked extremely shocked and began to basically beg me to stay and to keep putting up with my father and teared up. 

Despite everything that’s happened, I love my parents, especially my mom, and it really made me feel like the bad guy to see her like that. The next day, she told me to give her a year and then she would convince my father that both of them should move to another house they own and they would leave the current house we live in to me. When I said I really couldn’t wait a year, she was very sad and began to tear up again and said she didn’t want me to leave like this and to just put up with my father for a little longer. I couldn’t take it to see her like that and ended up saying I’d stay in order to comfort her. 

Ever since then, I’ve been extremely miserable and I don’t know how to get better. I’ve lost my appetite, been sleeping at most 3 hours a night, I feel like I literally can’t breathe in the house, all I want to do is lay in bed, I am crying very very easily at things and my father isn’t helping, since he keeps yelling at me for things that I haven’t done. My mother has taken to tell him to calm down and takes him away when he gets too angry but I’m still really really unmotivated to do anything and feel really sad at all times. 

I really don’t know what to do. I definitely don’t have enough saved up for more than a month, maybe two at most to cover living expenses where I live. My older sister wants to help me but she just recently got divorced so she told me she won’t be stable enough economically until she sells her current home (where she lived with her ex) and then can have money for an apartment; she’s said it will be around 3-4 months before We can move in together. Even then, my father has told her that she’s absolutely not taking me to move out with her when she gets settled and I’m not allowed to stay with her because my father says she’s a bad influence (as a teenager, she would sneak out, get drunk, got arrested, etc). My boyfriend said he’ll find a way to make ends meet so that he can help me get an apartment but I know he’s already struggling financially and I feel extremely guilty thinking that he’ll struggle more because of me. I’ve expressed that to him and he’s said we can get married (he’s in the army so he’d get BAH) and we can move out together but we’ve been dating a little over a month so I don’t feel comfortable with marrying him right now. 

Any advice on the best way to deal with this? I really do not know what to do anymore. I just want to stop crying every night.",11Jun2020,2
388,"So, long story short is that I have feelings for someone and I was getting overly attached to them. So I decided I need a break to figure out these feelings and sort things out. Throughout the whole thing, I told them it wasn’t their fault. I was straight up about my feelings for them but I want time to figure things out cause I realized I’m not ready for a relationship (had a really bad breakdown a few weeks ago) and I need to focus on myself for a bit. They took it well but I could hear them being sad about it.

390,"Hi fellow redditors. As from the title I seek help and advice from this community.

TL;DR My best friend is jobless and penniless because of her husband and needs to hire a divorce lawyer to settle her case ASAP but I can only afford to help pay half her upfront fees.

---------------

Just for context and some backstory, my best friend and I are from Singapore. She needs to hire a lawyer to help her with her divorce, but she can't rely on pro bono lawyers as they will take time to process her case and she only has til the end of the month before she has to re-file the case in syariah court (we're Muslim)

Frustratingly for her, her family is reluctant to even help her financially especially as she's out of a job and is without savings thanks to her soon to be ex husband. She only has a small circle of friends including me, and none of them are able to help her financially. That's understandable especially in this pandemic situation, however what's even more frustrating for her is that everyone's just asking her to do it herself as if she hasn't been trying.

She's at her wits end and I can only afford to help pay 4/5 of her fees as I myself have only just started working and barely have any savings of my own. Neither of us qualify for loans or credit cards as we don't earn the minimum per annum.

The lawyer quoted her a sum of SGD2500 in total and can start work on her case with SGD500 upfront which I have, but he needs another payment of SGD500 the following week and I don't have that money now as my pay only comes in on the 30th this month. The remaining SGD1500 will be paid by me in the following three months.

Right now we need that $500 and we don't know where we can find that money that doesn't involve loansharks, friends or family. Neither of us own anything valuable that we can sell for short term funding too so that kinda sucks. 

Can anyone give us advice?",11Jun2020,1

392,"Hey everyone! One of my bad qualities and symptoms of anxiety disorder is that I am NOT trusting at all. For example, I always seek approval from others, even if I already know something is true of confirmed. I have recently been worried constantly about an event that happened in 2019-2020 revolving a relationship, but I checked and it was actually in 2017.  My anxiety made me feel hopeless as hell before discovering that it wasn’t even 2019-20 as I feared In the first place!

Any reccomenations? This always happens to me with everything! Doubt, doubt, and doubt. Would you recommend to give myself time to believe?

394,"
A friend of mine occasionally jokes about suicide.  Not just the usual, hyperbolic, “Oh, if [blank] happens, I’m gonna f*cking kill myself,”, he gets kind of specific.  Like we’ll be talking about how he gets tired driving sometimes and he’ll say, “I wouldn’t mind going that way one day, it would probably be quick,”.  Most of these “jokes” are about killing himself when he’s older and is “done with life”, but recently when he said something (and I said not to do that because I’d miss him too much) he said something like, “I’m not saying now, it could be two weeks or 40 years, who knows?”.  I’ve never liked him talking about it, because I do care about him, but I understand some people just have a dark sense of humor, but that comment made me worry a bit more than normal.  So my question is, should I be worried?  Should I say anything to him about it?  Typically when the topic arises, I always say everyone (including myself) would miss him too much if he did that, so he shouldn’t.  Is there anything else that would be better to say?

400,"Hi Reddit, I'm having a bit of a dilemma at work with a coworker, whom I was in a way responsible for bringing them back from being furloughed. This coworker is an excellent employee and gets the job done, which is why I lobbied to them return. However, I didn't learn this employee was a conspiracy theorist and very vocal about it to the couple of us that are working from the office until they returned.

Firstly, they like to claim that COVID-19 is not real and that it was a hoax by the government. I try to ignore it, but when I bring up the confirmed cases and deaths amongst the elderly, they counter with, ”The government wants the elderly dead so that they won't receive retirement or social security.”

I have friends and family who are diagnosed with COVID-19, but I don't bring that up because I'm not trying to get into an argument and, honestly, I don't want to talk about it in the workplace.

Another theory they throw out is that the COVID-19 deaths are skewed, saying that doctors will say that someone passed away due to COVID-19 even if they didn't have it. They also said that if someone died because of a heart problem, the doctors would classify as a COVID-19 death.

I mean, any COVID-19 theory, they’ve brought it up. But, what is getting me even more frustrated is that they are now spreading conspiracy theories about the protests and looting that has been happening. I try to change the subject or ignore it, but it's frustrating to me. We are going through difficult times this year, and I don't want to hear some bullshit conspiracy theories any longer!

My question is how I should approach this where it doesn't become evident that I'm the one bringing it up? I thought about reaching to HR and telling them if they can put a policy in place where discussion of current events should not be allowed in the workplace, but without me naming any individuals. I don't mind legit conversations; I want to eliminate the spread of conspiracy theories, but I can't do that without singling this employee out.

Any advice?",11Jun2020,2

409,"My best friend \[22F\] who i've known since high school has been dealing with Anxiety Disorder for some years now. We became really strong friends in early highschool and would do everything together and I really enjoyed her company. She always had my back and I had hers. Since the final years of high school, her anxiety became increasingly worse and I became a key support for her. She has seeked professional help and has just recently found a therapist that she connects with. However, over the past 18 months I've been struggling supporting her as I feel extremely emotionally burnt out. As her anxiety got worse and her family issues got worse I feel like all we do is talk about her mental health and I'm beginning to grow resentful. I've began trying to avoid hanging out with her one and one and avoiding her calls and texts. She will often snapchat me 2-5 times a day, with most of them being videos or pictures of her crying, or telling me about how sad she is. I feel like I take on others emotions when talking to them so I feel responsible for her problems. I also deal with more mild anxiety and recently any time i see that she has contacted me I feel sad and anxious and just want to go to sleep so I don't have to deal with it. I got so bad today that I started pulling out my hair to feel some relief. She recently said she no longer wants me to give her advice, but she also doesn't really know how I can help her.

423,"So firstly I’m sorry if my grammar or formatting is bad. I’m a phone. 

Well now before I can say what I need advice on, I need to give you guys some background involving some personal relationships with my dad, grandma, and girl friend. Or ex girlfriend now. Also on how I’m feeling and what’s to come in my life.

So let’s start with my relationships, first will be my grandma so some context that will help with understanding her and my dad. So my situation growing up wasn’t pretty, constantly moving and so on. But here’s the big one, my dad never really took care of me, I lived with him for maybe 1 months in my whole life combined. Like an example would be I lived with him when I was 9 for about 3 months, then at 12 again for another 3 months. Like that. Now while when I wasn’t living with him I’d be living with my grandma. So my grandma basically raised me. Now onto more serious background info, me and her got into a fight about 4-3 months again and it ended up with me being told to go live with my dad or mother. I chose my mother but before I went and lived with her I’d like to see my dad because well when I move I won’t be able to see much of this side of the family till a year or two later. 

So me and my grandma got into this fight that escalated. It was stupid how the fight happened but more stupid on how she overacted to me being a little moody on that day. Well I got told to move out and really so on. Then I got to my dads house because well I’d like to see him before I went and lived with my mom. Well I stayed their for about a 2 weeks then we got into a fight which involved him saying things and putting his hands on me. So I was beaten, I’m not really big guy compared to my dad. So after I kinda just packed up afterwards since he told me to leave and wondered the stress for a few days. I slept outside with my bags which thankfully weren’t stolen. I also ended up staying at a friends house for a few night too. While all of this went on my dad didn’t bother to tell anyone, so none of my siblings or grandma or mother. But My grandma found out and then asked where I was and so on and asked why he’d kick me out. I was meant to stay there for a month and he’d pay my plane ticket to where my mother lives since they live in different provinces. (I live in Canada) So my grandma ended up picking me and everything while I was staying at a house and got mad at my dad. When she picked me up, we both talked about our feelings towards the fight. I decided at the very least I should forgive her. The fight was a lot bigger than I described but I decided to forgive her. Because even though my dad isn’t the best father, she raised me and was expecting me to stay there for a month and then get a ticket and go to my moms. Well we both talked and we ended forgiving each other. But we’re not exactly on we were before. I mostly just hide in the room I was given. So more context but my grandma is also taking care of my sister, and my sister is meant to go and love with mom too before the next school year starts up so sometime in summer. My grandma said she’ll drive both of us when the times comes. 

So now onto my ex girlfriend. So we had our issues and problems but we worked though them. Since we’d be in different provinces and since I’m moving with mom. We decided that a break was maybe what we needed, since I was toxic. She also said that the break should be a time where I figure out what I want to be since I have no idea or at least get a plan figured out. We also decided that while all this happening we’d keep in touch and still be exclusive to each other. So we still plan on talking, so like a long distance relationship but not focus on romantic feelings. She wishes for me to grow as person, and hopefully in a year we’ll be able to date again because she doesn’t wish to date me while I’m toxic or rather while I’m not in the best position I can be in. She plans on moving to city where I’ll be living with my mother for school after high school. Which I’m perfectly fine with. 

So I guess the big take away from this is me and my father fought and he reached out to me awhile ago saying hey. I’ve decided that I don’t really want to keep contact with him. Because of what he said and did, and I don’t know if that right. To give my grandma a chance but not my father. Also that me and my grandma situation also girlfriend situation.

So that’s that. Now lately I’ve been feeling weird. Like I’ve been feeling well quite negative. The fights with both of them has been on my mind for days now or rather weeks. I also feel down, and really not that motivated for what’s coming. In the beginning I was because hey being a rebellious teenager and moving to a new place but not so much. Because for me to have a relationship with my girlfriend, I’ve got to grow and stop thinking so negative all the time but also letting my emotions control me. I guess I just miss her my girlfriend because well we had some really good times, and she’s also really mature and great person overall. She deals with her problems a lot for efficient than I do.  That’s gust of it. Oh wiat one more piece, now my girlfriend has been messaging me a lot less, usually we’d talk and have phone call pretty often. But having a really stressful time right she also broke her phone if works sometimes but not all the time. And well lately I haven’t really heard form her or if I did she sends a simple message but not about her day. I guess I just miss talking to someone.

Okay maybe I’m getting side tracked so I’m sorry and that there’s a lot of information there. But now onto the next thingy. So when I move in with my mom. I want a job, and to finish school but I know for me personally that going to be a lot. The job is so I can save money to rent a place for when I turn 18 or finish school. The plan is rent a place once school is finished and it’s for a place for both me and my girlfriend to stay at, since I still wish to be with her. But all of the stuff that’s gone on with corona even has made me feel really drained the passed few months, and that I’m also not motivated to do all the stuff I plan to do once I move with my mom. 

So I end part of all this is I feel drained, I’m overthink everything, I have negative thoughts such as “can I really do all of this?”, “is it worth it?”, I’ve also just feel strained and tired all the time. Oh one last thing I never told my grandma or girlfriend what really went down with my dad since it’s something I don’t really want to talk about. 

So I know it’s a lot, I’m sorry. I don’t really know what to do with all of this, my situation. Any advice would really be helpful even if it’s small.",11Jun2020,1

Some of my high school colleagues are now models and some are famous on TV and have their independent work as well . 

Some got married and have a beautiful family while others opened businesses and are successful.
Other friends have found tremendous success on social media marketing their own crafts and artwork from a very young age...
I feel like i must be doing something wrong as I have been present everywhere online since 2012 trying to market what i do and maybe talk to somebody so I don’t feel so lonely...
Also , i failed the last job interview I had...

So I decided to go on and get a graduate degree 
I am half way through but my advisors call me a “ waste of time” and that they keep comparing me to other successful students they have .

I am very depressed and I constantly cry myself to sleep... thinking maybe I am just born to be defective at everything and ruin everything...

If i had someone to talk to about this and discuss it I wouldn’t go to the length of making a throwaway account to ask for advice but I don’t.
I have always been on the listening side but
the last time i talked to my friends about what was bothering me , they called me crazy and sent me threats that if they ever see my face again they’ll make sure i never get to see the light of day ever again ... ( quoting them ) 
That was years ago and I have made new friends ever since . Last week one of them told me that she is not as stupid as I am and that my presence causes her stress and a few other degrading terms I won’t post here ...

And I didn’t say anything back because I don’t want to lose more people in my life ...
I am always the person who doesn’t see the results of their efforts not in anything 
I always ask people “ how did you do that and how do you get here “ they say “ it just happened “ 
Personally i get jealous from people who get everything on a silver plate ...
No effort no all nighters no crying 😔 

Long story short it is a bunch of factors eating away at what is supposed to be the best years of my life ...

I am not trying to victimize myself , I just want a rational explanation, even i lost my relative and they cut ties with me ...


Some of you will probably say it is my attitude but how will i stay positive if I give my 100% to everything and fail to get 1% back...
I have no income as well and my parents aend me food taper wares to where i live

I need some friendship advice. 

I have a big group of friends that I’ve known for a long time. Two people in my group have been dating for about 4 years ( Ben and Victoria) and they just broke up for various reasons. One of the reasons was because of jealously. Ben was a little jealous of a new friend, Ryan, that was sort of introduced into the group and Ryan hung out more with Victoria then everyone else. After Ben and Victoria broke up Victoria started hooking up with Ryan (even though she told everyone that that would never happen). I am friends with both Ben and Victoria equally but it’s killing me that I know what Vitoria did and I don’t want to keep it from Ben but I know if I tell him he will never be able to trust anyone again and I’ll lose my friendship with both of them. I don’t know what to do.",11Jun2020,2
432,"Edit: I am 16 yo female

Let me preface with this: I am a teenager and do not have a job. The person the ""bet"" is with, is a friend of a friend who's like, 21 or something (maybe older) and have only seen in person twice. So, pretty unfamiliar to me at least personally

I was playing Minecraft with this guy (lets call him Jeff) on his Bedrock Realm, and we were voice chatting over discord. The conversation basically went like this

Jeff: \*tells me about thing that exists in Minecraft\*

Me ""No way, that's not real.""

Jeff: ""dude, I bet you 50 bucks its real""

Me: ""Alright, bet. I'll look it up""

Jeff: ""for real?""

Me: ""sure""

\*clarification on what he meant\*

\*I was wrong\*

Joking ensues, I kinda play into the ""oh shit, i owe him 50 bucks ahaha what a big mistake"" and joke with a couple friends about it in a different voice chat. Then I DM him. Like, dude, i dont wanna be scummy or anything but do I really owe you? He says yeah. I tell him, what about, like, 10 bucks? 50 bucks is kinda a lot for me, I dunno if i even have that to spare. He says, what about 25 now, 25 later?

**\*\*\*MORE DETAILS THAT ARE POSSIBLY IRRELEVANT BELOW\*\*\***

He also is super passive aggressive the next day in chat and makes an announcement about ""Not taking shot from other peoples chests without permission (understandable) and not editing builds without permission, even if their public builds"" (like the villager breeder). We were the only ones on the previous day, and i had expanded and added stuff to the build to make room for more villagers and make it look nicer. I also renamed the Mending villager to ""Mending"" so it was easier to find. He gets pissy about renaming the villager in different chat with me because, guess what, he had already named him ""Jeff"". But here's the kicker, later, he posts a picture of ***MY*** CHEST INSIDES going ""haha woah look at this wild enchanted book"" (because it had like 8 different things on it) and then like 30 minutes later asking if he could have some sand. From *my* chest. Which is fine with me, but he literally disobeyed his own rule that we never had a problem about in the first place.

TL;DR of this section, does some passive aggressive shady stuff that makes me want to give him money even *less.*

So, do I need to suck it up, take this as a big ol' lesson and give him the money? Give him half maybe?Or is he just being a dick?",11Jun2020,1

434,"Long post but please bear with me, I really really need help...

My best friend (let's call her Sam) and I have a really complicated history. We became extremely close in our freshman year of high school, which is when I realized I was bi because I caught feelings for her.  Turns out she was straight, and the type of girl that every guy falls for. Our relationship became pretty bumpy because I'm the kind of person that has problems concealing their emotions when it comes to jealousy, and I would often blow up at her and be unable to explain why (since she wasn't supposed to know that a) I wasn't straight and b) I had feelings for her). I confessed over the summer with a 13-page letter, and she couldn't have been nicer about it. However, she was getting into a relationship with another guy and I couldn't accept that, so we mutually agreed that I needed some space. Which led to me blocking all of her social media, deleting our pictures together, etc etc. I'm pretty sure it hit her as hard as it did me, and while I felt like my anger was justified at the time, looking back I was definitely a shitty best friend. 

Over the years, we slowly mended our friendship. I found my own group of friends that accepted me for who I was, and Sam and I became good friends again. It just never really felt right until senior year,  when I was sleeping over at her house and we finally talked about what went wrong with our previous friendship. She told me she felt alienated, replaced even, that she couldn't find anyone to talk to without outing me, and that even though she was dating someone, she'd never felt more alone during that time. About that...I've apologized countless times about what happened, and ever since we've been closer than ever before. 

After we fully mended our relationship during the first semester of senior year, COVID-19 hit us like a truck. She ran into some relationship troubles again, and asked me to set her up with another guy (let's call him Matt) to get her out of a complicated situation (long story). So I did, and somewhere in February I caught feelings for her again. At the beginning, she told me that there was no chance of her catching feelings for Matt, but we've just graduated high school recently and it turns out she did. But she doesn't want a long-distance relationship either, so they're currently in this weird place right now where they're flirting but not really. We recently went on a senior vacation hosted by our school (we're not under lockdown anymore) and I had to see them interact for a whole week, and it really just tore me in two. 

I just feel like history is repeating itself. I thought I'd grown and matured as a person to deal with all of this. For starters, I listen to her talk about her relationship troubles, when in freshman year I'd just push her away when she tried to talk about it. She's also a really private person and trusts really few people (around 2 including me I guess), and I feel like I'd betray her trust if I told her I have feelings for her again. 

Second chances are rare to come by, and she's already trusted me again. I feel like if I tell her, I'd be ruining our friendship for the second time, and I don't know if she'll give me a third chance. On the other hand, I've been feeling so heavy for such a long time about concealing my feelings. Occasionally I still take out my anger on her and am still unable to explain why. Since we've graduated and are heading to college (hopefully) in the fall, I don't know if I should go ahead and tell her (in a mature way, that I'm still hoping to stay friends and all that) or keep it to myself since she's already dealing with so much. I don't think I can go on with this any longer. Please help. 

I'm not asking for her to date me — I wouldn't expect that of her. I just want to be 100% honest about why I've been acting the way I did and hopefully talk it out like adults.",11Jun2020,1
435,"A lot of this deals with talks we've had about racial issues and a mutual friend of ours so for clarification I'm a white girl, our mutual friend is a white girl (A) and the friend I'm not sure if I want to talk to anymore is a black girl (B).

For context we all used to live together for about half a year, until B moved out because of tension between her and A. They had a fight because A's little sister (10) said B's skin was weird because she's black and A didn't step in to correct anything for a few days. A also has a boyfriend who would make racist jokes whenever he was in the apartment. Their friendship wasn't strong to begin with and I had been stuck in the middle for all of it. B ended up moving back in with her dad after a big blow out fight where she believed I was on As side when I was only trying to keep things civil. B and I had a very long talk that started with her screaming at me for also being racist by association, but in the end she was okay with me again and admitted she has started to ruin things around the apartment before leaving to try to get back at us.

Fast forward to yesterday, A and B dont talk because B has A blocked on all social media, and occassionally unblocks her to send her links to black lives matter news or just tell her she's a terrible person. B and I still talk, but she doesn't like that I also talk to A. She said she's racist and just using me and I had to lie about my own thoughts towards the situation because if I explained that I don't believe A is racist I would be yelled at. B has never admitted she was wrong in my entire friendship with her. It took about 4 hours to explain why I won't kick A out of our apartment and still have her in my life.

Today I got another message from B asking why I stopped posting about BLM on social media and I said it was because my life is falling apart and I need to be mentally stable before I can comprehend the news. She left me on read and it hit me that any time she sends me a message I'm anxious. I feel like I'm constantly being tested. She has been sending me links to news articles about police brutality and the injustice in the world for months now because I said I want to be aware and I want to educate myself. But every time I give a response it seems like she twists it in a way I don't mean or just flat out tells me I'm not doing enough. I dread each message I get from her. ""Do you think you're racist?"" Seems like a simple question but if I say something she doesn't like its going to be an argument I can't win.

I dont want to just drop her out of my life because I know she's a good person who's just been hurt a lot in her life, and I also still have things that belong to her since she couldn't take everything from the apartment when she left. But I also can't talk to her about these issues I'm having because she isn't self aware.",11Jun2020,1

437,"I'm currently a 22 yo American guy, and throughout childhood, I've had a pretty limited palette of foods I would readily eat, compared to the average person. Not to a far extent -- I don't only eat like 1 kind of food, but I am that guy who asks for plain burgers with just ketchup when getting a burger.

I would describe my issue as having a really terrible gag reflex, or something. Sometimes if I were to try something unfamiliar, I could start gagging it out as soon as it's just being chewed in my mouth -- in younger childhood, it was truly a nightmare when green beans were for dinner. I got fed up with this reaction and ended up just very rarely trying new things, because that fight was just dreadful and I didn't want to have to put up with it if I could avoid it. I don't exactly know if it's a physiological or psychological thing, a texture or taste aversion, etc.

Nowadays, though, I feel like I'm really missing out on a lot of nice foods -- and I feel like I'm being a weirdo, getting plain burgers with just ketchup, for example. A worst-case-scenario for me is being in a setting like a gathering of some sort where most or all the available food aren't things I find easily acceptable. I'm reminded of a time near the end of high school where we were eating fancy food at some place; I didn't end up eating very much. Despite my desires to try more things, I am afraid of fighting that terrible gag reflex thing.

It really scares me how fast time has gone by. I remember being in 6th grade and thinking that I'm halfway through. I feel like my middle school/8th grade graduation wasnt that long ago, but it was 4 years ago now. I'm feeling really melancholy/bittersweet about graduation tomorrow. Of course I'm really excited, but it is a really big step as college is a very new chapter of life. My boyfriend and I are getting our own place. I just feel like time is flying by. I dont want to be older and think that I didnt enjoy my life enough. 

I am the youngest in my family (my stepsister is 27, my brother is 31, my cousins are all in their 30s), and I always wanted to be included in family activities but, I wasnt. I had to go to bed at 10 while everyone else stayed up and partied, or had to share a room with my mom while my sister got to stay with her friends whenever we went on vacation. Or, I just stayed by myself with no one to talk to. I wasnt allowed to watch all of the movies my family watched because they were too mature, and all of this is understandable and normal for a young child because they cant be shown too much. But I always wished and wanted to be older because I was so excluded from life. And I was always told to cherish being a kid because time flies by so fast, and kid-time went by extremely slow. Then it started to pick up the pace, and now I'm graduating high school. 

Is it normal to feel this way? I'll be paying my own bills within the next 6 months, and have my career starting in the fall with college (nursing). I just feel alone all over again like I did when I was a child and even though I rationally know I have friends, my boyfriend, and my family here, i just am struggling. My best friend of 11 years and i had a falling out in January and dont really talk anymore. She is going to an amazing school for an amazing career which I'm really excited about for her and let her know I was proud of her. I'm going to a 2-year community college because I'm scared to be away from everyone I know. I just feel like I'm missing out on something and I dont know what it is. My days now, since coronavirus restrictions started, are filled with DoorDash (I'm a driver), saving money, watching TV, and going to bed at 12. I'll online-shop and treat myself to a new outfit every so often, I go to the shore every weekend for a day trip or one night, I just dont know what I'm missing. I really just want to pack my bags and explore Vermont, or go back to South Carolina (my favorite vacation spot), but both of those are hours away (I live in PA), and both of those would cost money, while I'm trying to save for an apartment.

So, from people who have experienced life more than I have, what are some good ways to enjoy it?

Recently I needed to check something on facebook and came across their profiles and lead my thoughts to keep getting deeper and deeper. This thought happens from time to time from sadness and anger at myself. But after all this time all I could feel is anger towards them, especially the one person who made it all open.

Part of my wants to know why no one else in the group reached out to me after all this time while giving them a piece of my mind.

So I keep on texting her to just let her know I’m here because she has often said I’m literally the only person who texts her and all of her other friends just act like she doesn’t exist except when they meet up irl. But it just feels weird I text and text and text and she answers like a whole 4 days later. I check up on her to make sure but idk. I’m not sure if she wants to be left alone because these are honestly complicated times and maybe she’s going through something. Or if maybe I should keep texting her to know I’m still here. Because if she is sad maybe I should just text like I usually do to let her know I’m there.

454,"Long story short, my sister(24F)has accused my(28F) dad of sexual abuse when she was a child. As far as im aware she doesnt remember details, only a very negative feeling towards him her whole life, as well as bad dreams about him for a long time. (however i havent been able to speak to her about it in detail because it is very upsetting). she has also only been aware of this for the past 3 months or so, as she thinks she repressed the memories. there have been times over this period where she said to me she didnt think dad did it and she was confused, but now she is completely adamant it was him. She has also had mental health problems her whole adult life and i guess abuse in childhood is often associated with these sort of problems, so that fits. 

I am struggling because I just cant believe it as hard as i try. There is just no part of me that believes my dad could have done this. When she told me it was a COMPLETE shock, i never had any funny feelings towards him or a sensation of things ""finally making sense"" when she told me. I know it is awful to not believe a victim and i always feel so sorry for those victims who were not believed, especially in cases like the catholic church. this situation makes me feel so awful.on the other hand, my dad has completely denied everything and is so upset that someone, especially his daughter, could think he is capable of something like that. i know obviously an abuser would be likely to deny what they have done. 

this whole situation is tearing our family apart. my sister has basically distanced herself from us (me, my mum, my other sister). we are going on like normal because we dont really know what else to do, but my sister says this is so upsetting to her. that we are just playing happy family with the person who (allegedly) abused her. i can understand why she feels like this. basically someone is lying and i don't know how to decide who. I know people say it is always the person they least expect. I dont know what to think and i feel like i have to choose a side because my sister wont talk to me if i keep talking to my dad.

Everything changed when we had some trivial fights over controversial topics or they hiding things from me. One example would be ,let's say politics, they couldn't just take my point and they just parted friendship over meager things. Slowly slowly, I lost these seven people.

Around midnight I heard my dog barking in my balcony. So, I go to check on the dog outside and I see an explosion. It sounded like a firework going off. Frightened, I quickly run to pick up my dog and run away from the balcony. The explosion quickly went away but the smoke-like smell prompted me to go outside my apartment quickly. The explosion also caused the living room electricity go out. My initial thought was that the air conditioner unit exploded in some way. Subsequently, I called my manager to have him check the balcony. The manager said it smelled like gun power and that the air conditioner worked fine. He thought it might of been someone throwing a firework at our balcony. The weird thing is there isn't any firework debris outside the balcony. I guess my question is, is there a firework such that when it explode it won't leave any debris. Or, is there something wrong with my AC unit because seems to be working fine after the explosion, but I'm still confused how my apartment living room light could've turned off.

A couple of months ago, my boss asked me to put together a short guide of the admin processes and procedures, which I did without really questioning why.  I guess I thought maybe he'd hire someone to cover admin at some point and it would be a useful handover document. Now all of a sudden, he's making me turn it into a full-on, in-depth book of everything I do. So far it's about 40 pages and counting. It contains absolutely everything I do and how it's done. It's broken down so simply and concisely that anyone over the age of 10 could probably walk in and take over my job without having any prior experience and never having to think for themself. 

With this guide, my boss could probably fire me, replace me someone cheaper (although I already earn peanuts) and never have to train them, since it's all there.

480,"Ever since the pandemic I’ve had a lot of time and isolation for pervasive thoughts to resurface and I don’t know how to deal with them.   I would also like to acknowledge my own biases since I am the one telling my own story.

Long story short, my dad is a piece of shit but I made a realization that he could be an even worse guy than I imagined.  I think he may have had something to do with the death of his business partner, and my mother’s suicide(gas lighting).  I also have reason to believe that he is incahoots with his landlord when it comes to some of the shady things that I think they’ve been involved in.

After my mother’s passing my father manipulated me in a lot of ways, pretty much hinting that if I didn’t help him that he might commit suicide.   He would never let me out of his sight, and was asking me to take over the family business so that he could move to korea (which he never did), but I think he realized that I wasn’t the kind of person he hoped I’d become.  We fought over a lot of things and he eventually kicked me out of both the house and the business.  Overnight I had no income, and nowhere to sleep.

It’s been three years since then and luckily, I had a lot of good friends who helped me get back on my feet.   During that time I’ve just been focusing on healing and moving forward, but the COVID situation has proven to be quite the obstacle to maintaining peace.  I keep telling myself that my father’s deeds will eventually catch up to him, that there’s no way he could just get away with all the things I believe him to be responsible for.  However, with how crazy the world is becoming, I think that maybe it’s not that far fetched to think he could be just that lucky.

I tried reaching out to him about a couple years ago, trying to reconnect.  We had lunch once and I had brought up things I usually wouldn’t dare bring up when i was younger.  Things like when he used to beat me and my mom, how angry I was at how he handled my mom’s mental health issues, etc.  He pretty much denied everything and that was the last time we spoke.

I have a lot of anger and resentment towards him and I’m not sure exactly how to move on.  The thought of making him pay for the pain he’s caused me is something that I’m not proud of having, but it is very pervasive and it’s hard not to dwell when COVID is keeping me from resuming the kind of life I’ve built after separating from father that helped to keep my mind off the past.",11Jun2020,1

 English is not my native language, so please disregard any wrong grammar and stuff.

I'm a student from the Philippines, and will be starting online classes at August. I've been dreading the shift from classroom to online, and worry how it will affect my retention of facts.

Please keep in mind therapy and mental health resources are scarce in my country, and there is a stigma against depression with older generations here. They say it's all in your head and you're just lazy.

Thing is, I've been depressed since 2017. 

I was really great in 2016, I was the top 1 in my class. Even in my worst subject, mathematics, I was able to get a grade above the bare minimum. Teachers noted my enthusiasm and I won awards. I entered writing competitions and won.

After that year, I became isolated and depressed due to personal circumstances, and my grades plummeted to barely passing. My teachers were worried, but I was too pissed and tired of life to care. My parents worried too, and they worked with me to help improve my mental health.

I'm in a better place now. I'm no longer pissed and tired of living, I distanced myself from toxic people and decided to focus on my hobbies instead. 

But I'm still struggling with motivation and attention-span. I have trouble with discouragement and feeling like it's too late.

I asked the teacher if she could come to the iss room to tell the iss teacher that I'm inno  and says what happend and I'm let off but my friend recorded our talking fight and asked if she could use it first more convincing and it put more fule on the fire that he him and Hus friend want to hurt me it worked and I was told that because they know this that I would have to stay over in school because he would try to target me in a fight and then I was scared. 

2-3 weeks later I forgot that I was suppose to stay over I'm school and they where right that he was going to trybto pick a fight with me and then the next day I over heard a group of kids saying that the kid was gouing to bring a knife to school I imidealty tiled the pricapal and my parents and had 911 on speed dial because I was really scared  

Go to present day the kid contact me on social media and I fought fire with fire by screen shooting  every thing a d posting it to facebook he quickly stpoed a d it spread throu my town like wild fire and with the death threats and racial slurs it put him in juvilal jail with poroal of 2 years of community  servis but I want to k ow how to deal with something better that what I did because it all started out as his jokes being said around the wrong person and I want to make sure that I don't snao the way I did",11Jun2020,1
491,"i’m 17, female i have a boyfriend who’s 19 we’ve been dating almost 8 months. 

so me and my mom aren’t the best of friends we used to talk and keep up with each other but this last year especially we’ve drifted due to her drug testing me and lots of drama surrounding that...at the beginning of my relationship probably in december she took my car away cos of positive drug tests, so i was driven everywhere by my bf. i don’t know how she feels about my bf because i spend every single day with him and i never see my mom. i wake up and i’m usually at his house by noon and my curfew is 1130-1230. anyways eventually things died down got my car back but we still don’t talk ever. i don’t make any effort to have conversations with her because i simply don’t want to talk to her. our beliefs differ a lot. she was raised catholic, raised a christian family but our family kinda fell apart and in middle school i stopped going to church. i was brought up taught to wait until marriage to have sex and i believed that i would wait, probably until 9th grade i realized that idea was trash and lost my virginity the next year. my mom never let me hang with boys and when i finally asked to it was a difficult debate. but here i am dating a 19 year old....i never in a million years would have believed she would let me be with someone two years older than me i really don’t know what’s up with her....she’s so confusing!!!! 

recently she revealed to me she knows we have sex! (apparently she found a condominium wrapper in my car but i don’t really believe that cos haven’t had car sex since....november?!??!??) and fuck did my heart dropppp when she told me i thought she was going to stop allowing me to see him or send me to Fiji or something but she just tried telling me what i cant do with my body i said i can do what i want with my body because it’s mine end of conversation then tried to walk away because i was upset and uncomfortable and she called me immature....wtf....i feel so trapped. and alone. my friends moms take them to get birth control or get an IUD but mine makes my life hell over sex. i just want out of her house so i can do whatever i want. 

all this effects my bf too. he’s always been convinced she hates him or at least doesn’t like him and it makes him feel like shit. i feel so bad that i brought that sadness onto him cos it really brings him down. whenever we start dreaming out loud of the adventures we want to go on we get interrupted with the realization that my mom is crazy and wont let us share the same blanket. yea that’s why we NEVER hang at my house anymore. she wonders why i don’t want to be around her and why i don’t bring my bf around ?!?! it’s cos your crazy bitch !!! it makes me so depressed...my friends get to go camping, road trips, vacations with their boyfriends. my mom said i’m not allowed to spend the night with my boyfriend ever for any reason because it’s not appropriate, spending the night would be giving us the okay to have sex apparently ? WHY IS SHE LITERALLY INSANE. we can have sex anywhere anytime we want. it’s too fucking late. what do i do?? i wish she’d just realize were too different snd i am who i am. i’m her last kid of three i wish she’d LET ME GO and just forget about me. fuck. 

but honestly i’m lucky she still let’s me out of the house. i’ve been caught with the devils lettuce, a 2yr long nicotine addiction, and now it’s been revealed that i have a sex life and i’m still breathing!!! THANK U GOD. but please help me out of this house!! 

I WANT TO LEAVE THIS SUMMER 

i want to just get in my bf’s car and drive....to cali or something anywhere and just be with my boyfriend and be alone. but if we ever were to do something like that we’d come back and she’d have our heads cut off. i’m so impatient i want to be 18 so i can leave and do whatever i want and start the rest of my life. 

i think i might be crazy cause i have to wait til i’m 18 to do whatever i want so i’m just a stupid kid right now. pls help me. i feel so trapped. this is rushing me to grow up because i’ve never wanted to move out more i’ve never wanted to get away more. i talk about leaving w my bf EVERY SINGLE DAY. and i catch myself seeing far away vacations, places, schools on instagram or something and i just long to get away. my bf says i talk about leaving so much hes genuinely worried i might run away by myself some day and not tell him. i feel so bad for making him think that and it’s not true i want him to be with me where ever i go. but i have to admit in my head it’s just me. i just think about myself packing my bags and leaving on my own. how has it come to this 

sry this was so long, probably didn’t make sense and don’t even know what advice i’m looking for",11Jun2020,1
492,"So the story goes. I move out of state and carry some of my belongings for a job opportunity. I leave my heavy desktop behind and think nothing of it.

2 month had gone by and he had it shipped to me. i was happy.

However when i accessed my computer i notice a strange Bluetooth device had tried to pair with my computer. WD Cloud. I search online and it appears to be a cloud base storage that can access all of your linked Apple products.

I have had 4 devices saved and linked. He gained access to my emails texts logins pictures contacts.. you name it. For well over a month or two I’m betting.

I honestly don’t know what to do since i like my father. I guess he is trying to be nosey and controlling. He even saved my Robin Hood trades (stocks) in my google drive. This angered me the most because i know he has always been curious about my trading.

Asking for your advice reddit. i know if i bring it up he will play stupid. How should i go about this . Thank you",11Jun2020,1
493,"I am hoping for a little help understanding the situation I'm in to keep any form of self confidence I have left. I have been living in the smallish town I'm in for over a year now, and despite submitting countless applications to anyone that is hiring I have not gotten a job. Mind, these are all entry level jobs I would expect anyone able to do. I have never even gotten a call back from a single employer I've given an application to. In the previous city I lived in I was able to get a job in no time at all, with the same application I'm currently using. I was never a bad employee either.

I initially moved here because I wanted to save some money, thanks to the situation I've been afforded, but it turns out I've just lost a year of my life and there is no end in sight. I wanted to save, go back to college, and just make real progress in my life. Now I feel I'm a completely different person. I can't grapple with the situation I'm in in a healthy manner and it's only making things worse. I still submit application, wholly expecting to be ignored every time, and I'm right. Every time it hurts more and more and it feels like I'm just going to end up homeless and useless since I can't seem to find any way to break out into the real world again. I try to keep my mind working and keep myself from getting lazy, but I have no motivation. Everything is just a reminder that I'm currently useless and trying to escape being a potato. I just talked to an employer the other day and they said they were going to hire me and give me the necessary paperwork to get me working within three days, but now they haven't called me back in over a week. 

I feel alienated. My family thinks I'm not even trying. When I talk to them about it, within days they keep going on like I never confided to them that I'm losing my mind over all of this. It's like everyone knows something about me that I don't. So desperately I want to get my life back on track before I lose all confidence and give up completely, but it feels like im fighting a battle I have no choices in. I don't know what to do.",11Jun2020,1
494,"I've realized something about me. I've been like this since my conception. The thing that triggered me was this: I've noticed something about me when I was taking a driving lesson today. The driving session was 1.5 hours. I've noticed that I can control the car pretty well for like 30 minutes. Then my driving instructor corrected me about my clutch/acceleration control. It's perfectly normal, it's his job. The real problem with me is that when I take criticism I always seem to lose my control and my brain completely shuts down. It feels like a fog up there. I can't seem to think properly. My vision is getting way smaller. I immediately feel some sort of strange anger for him (I absolutely don't understand this...he's just doing what he's supposed to do). I seriously think it might just be my extreme ambition or i'm just a typical narcissist. And this is not the only example I can give. I've failed plenty of exams in college because I couldn't take criticism from my teachers. I begin to talk about the given subject and when he corrects me I completely lose (again, brain fog) my ideas and fail to remember what I've studied for this exam. My girlfriend left me a year ago for something similar. I haven't gotten in any relationship since I know that I'm not normal, psychologically speaking. Strange enough, I don't lose control or temper or get angry when someone corrected my lat pulldown form at the gym. It might just be that I get really fired up in a stressful environment?

I've come to realize that my childhood might have something to do with this. I was raised by my grandparents until I turned 7 because my parents we're working on their careers. My grandfather also had this strange temperament issue and was sort of abusive to my grandmother...and a bit misogynistic might I add. Didn't really had any bonding moments with my father even though I still live under his roof at 23. My mind...somehow made grandpa a bigger father figure than my father. I fear that I might have gotten those horrible attributes from him.

Reddit, how do I control my temper and take criticism in a healthy way? I seriously consider to get a therapist. Also, what do you guys think about this context? Sorry for the wall of text and my broken english.

tl.dr - losing temper over minute things and fearing it might just be because of my upbringing.

edit: i've messed up the title of this post lol",11Jun2020,1
497,"My dad had always been physically abusive. It was always sort of bad. 

I've had to go to hospital a couple of times in my childhood because of a strained wrist or ankle. I have a history of buying knives and what not to keep him off me. My mom is financially dependent on him and she never really had a family growing up so she is also kind of emotionally dependent on him. She used to try to get him to not hit me but she was never really much of a mom. I've been dragged by my hair on the floor, been hit with various objects around the house and all this time my mom could only give me pathetic excuses like ""at least he is not a drink"" or ""at least he doesn't gamble"" to me as consolation.

My father had systematically taunted away any passion I had for anything in my life, broke my confidence and esteem completely and left me completely incapable of fending for myself or even understanding my feelings.
And where my dad killed my esteem my mom simply did not care. She never came and talked to me after a wrestling match with my dad because of whatever shit she has locked up in her brain. She has some childhood trauma as well and well whatever be the reason, I was in a situation where I didn't understand what my likes and dislikes were, I had normalised physical abuse, I had no emotional support and I have done some stuff I really regret it. 
This has been my lot in life.
Last year in August it all came to a head when my dad twisted my thumb such that it caused a crack in my bone. It caused a huge commotion where I involved my friends and threatened my dad and my mom too.
My dad apologised and so did my mom though not at first and after a LOT of trash talk.

These past few months have been excruciating as I came to realise the emotional damage that was done to me along with all the physical abuse. My parents apologise to me and tell me they never realised that them being that way is actually physically abusive and what not. 

I've been a fairly good student and before last year I was in the final stage of a professional accountancy degree which requires a three year work experience to be eligible for the final exam. The fact that I made it till the finals is a sort of a mini feat in itself but to be honest I never had much interest in it. 
I was a lost kid who was pushed into this stream as a seventeen year old girl by my dad and I did my best in the field because I didn't know any better. 

Now as a 21 year old I don't fucking know what the hell am I supposed to do. I absolutely can not deny the fact that I have no interest in finishing my degree but I'm still working for the three year work experience requirement currently. I'm not able to sort out my thoughts whatsoever to reach to a conclusion of whether or not I should finish my degree or just give up. I feel scared at the prospect of losing the safety of a professional degree like this but I can't bring myself to care for the work I do.

Then there's my mental health. I tried talking to a therapist but she was kind of a dick to me and I simply don't have the courage to find another. Even writing down this post took so much energy out of me. I'm in a limbo. I tried journalling, I tried reading, I tried talking to a camera to articulate the trauma and the hurt to be able to process it some how but I just always end up sleeping/scrolling/crying and then avoiding.

I hate my parents for doing this to me. They have so many issues themselves, why did they bother having a child? I didn't ask to be born! Why bring to this world to neglect and abuse me like this?
I hate myself for the fact that I didn't have enough confidence in school. That I didn't know how to make friends, to have fun. I didn't know how to recognise shitty people who take advantage and was fucking treated like absolute trash. I hate myself for being 21 and cussing my parents for my short comings. I hate how I could have been a better functioning adult with just a little, just a LITTLE bit of effort and attention from my parents. 

What do I do? How do I make a decision about my career? How do I sort my feelings out? How do I stop blaming my parents?


I apologise for the long post. It was really difficult for me to articulate my feelings over the past one year so it ended up a long post.",11Jun2020,1
498,"I (24M) have been living at my parents home for the past few months due to Covid, as has my brother (21M), but we are normally at University. Ever since the protests have started, he has become more aggressive towards the rest of the family. We are in support of the protests, but are not super politically engaged. He goes into a full on rage when talking about the inciting incidents with George Floyd and others and often screams that the protests that turn into destructive riots are justified. He is actively looking for ways to cause arguments, even over things like the rest of us not going into a full rage when talking about the events as well.

This question is not about the politics (since we mostly agree), but how to deal with someone who is using recent events to lash out with hostility at the others in the household? The rest of the family are also getting fed up, but are unsure of how we should act.

I also mention the thing about the riots as I am also concerned he may get drunk and snap, destroying something important in the house and feel justified about it.",11Jun2020,1

Ok so I’ve developed this huge fear of gore and I really want to get over it because when I was like 12, I used to watch really gory movies but now I just can’t.

It’s really annoying because I can’t watch ANYTHING with a little blood and there’s so many things I want to watch but I can’t because they have gore. For example, The Strangers. I wanna watch it but I can’t because it has gore. My friends and family get so annoyed because I can’t watch anything with them because of gore. I also love horror movies but again I can’t watch them so I just stick to the paranormal ones which are really hard to find. Don’t get me wrong, the paranormal ones are my favourite.

But the problem is I don’t know who the kids are but this kid that I’m kind of close too won’t tell me who but told me they were kids from school  how can I get that kid to tell me who it was or is there some way to stop this I’m not seeing? cuz this is just not right And I feel like I embarrassed my family because of this.",11Jun2020,3
503,"People around me always decide that they will take their lives. They treat me like I am the only thing to save them and they can't make their own decisions whenever I tell them to get some proffessional help they shrug it off and insist I be the only person who can help an example of this was 2 weeks ago.

A  Mutual friend of mine had left a suicide note we found it and everyone was counting on me to stop it my only choice was to attempt to nagotiate with her it was either refuse and be seen as a monster or accept and throw away your own mental health for someone else you barely know and have never really met because none else has the guts to do it but even if you try to make a point to excuse yourself you're a horrible person.

After listening over call at 6 people crying and begging for me to sort this I ended up finding out if I didn't teach her cousin to pick a lock she would've successfully hung herself.

But this is just an example suicides come to me all the time when I some one comes to me over suicide and it frustraights I can't cry over any death if the person dies, about 1 person suspectedly took their life but I wont go into detail, I just ended up sighing and thinking ""Great .."" and then I go back on my normal day, it's not the death itself that effects me it's being the last resort before death that hurts.

Imagine looking at a fly just drop dead you wouldn't really care you'd just carry on with your day that's how the death itself feels. But it's when you feel like you're the cause of their death.

I've been able to relate to some people on this and I've spoken to people about it. Were all stuck in the same boat I'm 14 and one of them is 16 we all vary in ages but all stuck being Suicide watchers for people.

I'm fed up of being a last resort before death it makes me angry and isolated I'm actually a really talkative and sociable and soft realiable person but I've turned into an isolated insider blocking the outside out how can I cope or get people to go and get proffessional help?  I need to work on finding my missing peice not other people's missing peice I've had a rough past and I'm still looking to peice the puzzle together but I can't do that if I'm too busy finding other people's  peices.",11Jun2020,1
505,"I’m new to Reddit and don’t know if I’m doing this right. I’m just looking for kind words, encouragement, advice, and maybe some talking down. Thanks!

My step Father has always been someone I’ve never liked or could get along with. Ever since he started hanging around right before my parents got divorce when I was 15. As of late 2019 my mother has finally come to the conclusion on her own that he’s a toxic waste in her and my half sister’s life (she’s 5) and has been trying to divorce him. My mother and father did split time so they’ve been doing that since this whole thing started. He gets the kiddo Sunday morning through Wednesday afternoon and my mother gets the rest of the week. It’s all part of the agreement they both came up with their lawyers and signed legal documents with all the rules. Most rule breaking would lead to forfeiting visitation rights to the child. 

To get to my point here I’m the kind of person to give people the benefit of the doubt and I really gave him a chance to be a decent step dad to my sisters and I. He’s a narcissist so of course it’s not going well for my family and I. He thinks he can walk all over us and bully us just because he’s physically bigger than any of us in the house. He’s legally not supposed to be on my moms property but he does it anyway. He’s told my mother that he’s wasted his money on the lawyer and legal documents they signed and it’s no better than “toilet paper to wipe his @ss” ....

A lot of shit has gone down and it’s not even close to being the end of it. I’ve moved back in with my mom recently and it’s been really stressful. I know way to much personal info that nobody should ever hear their mother tell them. 


My step father has recently moved in with this woman he plans on marrying after a short period of time mind you. I know it sounds like he’s moved on but he’s doing this to punish my mother. He hasn’t known this new woman long and he’s moved himself and my sister in. This woman has two kids already (same age my older sister and I were when he came ruining our lives) he’s literally (and he said this to my mom) “replaced us” and got my little sister a “new and better mommy”.... yeah.. All while still SPAMMING my mother with sexual and lovey messages still... He literally is begging my mom to f/ck him while he’s LIVING AND F/CK THIS OTHER WOMAN. 


Did I mention they are still legally married... 


Last week we had an incident, my mother (not her best plan but she’s trying to get rid of him) decided to MEET the woman. You know, because if this woman is going to be co-parenting then she needs to meet her for my sisters sake. Totally understandable.. except they are not divorced yet.. And in the legal documents they are not suppose to be staying anywhere with anyone and yet he’s moved them in with this woman. 
Anyway the deal was she’d meet the woman alone with out the @sshole and long story short she came home drunk and he was here. 

I was hanging out with my boyfriend some at home, We had babysat my sister together and already put her to bed when the door flew open with mom’s key in the door and no one came in. I quickly went to the door and saw her hunched over puking with guess who’s hand on her back... I instantly came out and was like “you need to leave” and instantly he got offended. He was yelling at me to shut my whore mouth and he pushed me in the chest a little. My boyfriend who was standing next to me DID NOT stand for that and yelled at him not to talk to me like that and not to touch me. Then they started arguing and @sshole made the mistake to push my 23 year old boyfriend and they started fighting in the yard. My drunk mom pulled my step dads shirt screaming at him to stop while I was pulling my boyfriend away from him screaming at the top of my lungs at the @sshole to stay the f/ck always from us. The woman who was in the car the whole time came out to help stop it and police were called by neighbors. They made sure my mom was in bed safely and escorted @sshole off the property. On his way out he tried to insult my boyfriend and I more but we talked over him telling him to f/ck off. 


I’m so sorry for the rant but I just couldn’t sleep and it’s all my mind could think about.
My boyfriend, mom, and I are just fine. I think it was finally the last straw for my mom, finally she’s realizing that she needs to take this more seriously.",11Jun2020,1
506,"So I'm moving in with a friend and her child, when first talking about rent I thought that I would be happy to pay 50% of the rent per week but with some thinking I realised that it wouldn't be great financially on my behalf if I'm putting money towards a room and areas that I technically wouldn't be using.

I have enough confidence issues but they just seem to add more since they always expect me to bring straight A's and do all the chores too while my sister can just stay in her room and isnt being told to do anything they always barge in to my room when I told them to knock.
I almost broke my door a couple of days before my sister barged in to my room so I told her to get out she didn't listen so I tried to close it but she kept pushing to put it into perspective she did this 2 times and both times I got yelled at and since the door didnt break they didnt scold her or anything.

On the other hand, I really want to marry him, because despite all that, he's the best man I've ever met and feel like he's the one for me. I didn't talk to him about it and don't want to hurt him, but he notices that something is going on because sometimes I just can't control myself  and look upset. What would you do? How to get over it?",11Jun2020,15
518,"My [19M] gf [20F] need to always be right, I have anger issues

PLEASE READ

A little background. I’ve been dating this girl for over two years and we’ve had to be in a long distance relationship for some time because she was a year ahead of me and we attend different colleges. Thanks to COVID I haven’t seen her in over 3 months. 
So today we were talking about weight loss. Keep in mind part of my childhood was spent obese. Before I got herniated discs I was a huge exercise fanatic. She had said her weight dropped 2.2 lbs in 5 days.  Now she’s light (125-130 lbs) and I told her that it was most likely water weight that she lost, as that is what causes weight fluctuations like that. She asked me what water weight was and I explained water weight loss and told her that the best indicator of weight loss (fat loss, her goal) is the mirror. then she proceeded to ask why I’m doubting she lost weight, then I told her that I wasn’t doubting but simply saying that the weight loss could be water weight because the numbers don’t lie. She said “Right numbers don’t lie and the scale says I lost weight.”

I explained to her that 1 pound of fat is ~3500 calories, 2 pounds is 7000 calories, so losing 2 pounds of fat over 5 days would imply a 1400 calorie deficit each of the five days, which would , because of her estimated BMR, be equivalent to not eating anything for 5 days and and walking or running two miles each of the five days on top of it. I told her that a 1400 calorie deficit is huge, to which she replied “Not really.”

She said “I haven’t even been eating that much and the food that I’ve been eating wasn’t high in calories.” I told her even still that she ate SOMETHING, and that the weight she loss was probably just water weight.

She then says, “ Okay (my name). You clearly know exactly why I lost weight by no visual evidence of your own and your claims are clearly infallible without qualitative data to back it up.”

I told her that the numbers check out, and she asked what I meant by that, and I explained to her again the caloric breakdown of the fat, and said “You don’t think I know what I’m talking about lol.”

She then said, “Yes you’re clearly infallible in everything you say with no visual evidence.”

I told her that that’s no what I was saying, and then she said (sarcastically), “Obviously the only way someone could lose 2 pounds in about 3 days is by it being water weight. Metabolism and reduction in food and calorie consumption plays absolutely no factor.”

I told her that boxers and athletes restrict their sodium all the time to lose water weight to get under their goal weight for a match, and explained to her that what I said previously is saying that caloric consumption plays a role in weight loss. I had just told her the numbers.

Then she was like, “Okay. Obviously you know everything.”

Then I asked her, “Do you actually read what I say or do you get mad because you think I think I know everything?” 

Then she said, “Nobody’s mad. You’re the one trying so hard to prove to me that I didn’t just lose regular weight and it was water weight. When you have no way of knowing.”

Then I said, “I’m just explaining why I said what I said. I do have a way of knowing—it’s the numbers. Thermodynamic laws.”

Then she said, “So you know this 100% with no room to be wrong.”

Then I said, “I know it’s mostly water weight.”

Then she said, “You don’t but okay.”

This is when I started to get irritated. 

I told her, “I do know. If you were in a deficit you may have lost some fat. To lose that much fat in that amount of time you’d have to be in a deficit of 7000 calories. 7000 calories is like 70 miles of running give or take a few miles.

Then she told me, “You don’t know. Because you obviously don’t know that’s it’s always been easy for me to lose weight but hard to gain weight. I can lose weight no problem without doing anything different at all. 2 pounds is not a lot. It’s never been hard for me to lose 2 pounds. It’s been hard for me to gain 2 pounds, but never losing it.”

I told her, “All I’m saying is it’s mostly water weight that you’ve lost in that timeframe. As you lose more weight it will be fat.”

Then she said, “You don’t know and it’s no reason to even say that anyway.”

I told her once again that I did know, and she said, “You don’t, but you can tell yourself that, since you clearly know everything.”

I got more frustrated and told her, “You just want to say that I don’t know.”

Then she said, “You actually don’t know, which is why you think losing 2 pounds is a lot when it isn’t at all. That has never been an issue for me.”

I told her that it was a lot for that time frame.

Then she once again said that it wasn’t a lot.

Sometimes people have inaccurate perceptions of time. You might think you lost weight super-fast but it might have been over a few months, just felt fast, and in an argument people tend to say what time intervals best fit their argument. So I asked her, “Have you ever actually kept track of how much you lost per day? No. Have you actually used a calculator and calculated every day? No.” 

Then she said, “How would you know? Once again you clearly believe you know everything with no visual evidence.”

Counting calories is not something most people just do, especially if you’re not a fitness junky (she isn’t). 

I told her, “The amount of time you imagine it’s taken you to lose weight in the past is only how YOU remember it. There’s no record or track that you kept. You say you lose weight fast which can very well be because of your metabolism, causing a higher basal metabolic rate. But you never actually kept track of it so YOU don’t know how long it usually takes you to lose weight.”

Then she said, “First off I literally have checked how much weight I’ve lost or gained before. Daily. That’s how I know this. We always had a scale and I would check.  You just think you know what I’m doing without actually seeing what I’m doing. You literally assumed I’ve never checked my weight daily to see how much weight I would lose with absolutely no evidence to support that claim. You just threw it out on a whim expecting it to be true when it isn’t true.” 

I can smell the BS from a mile away. I started to get more frustrated here. 

I told her, “Weight fluctuations of 2 to 5 pounds between days like that happen all the time. Do you understand basic physical laws? You can’t just lose fat out of nowhere, the energy has to come from somewhere. To lose that much FAT in that amount of time would mean you didn’t eat anything for 5 days and ran two miles each day.”

Then she said, “You just feel like you have to correct anyone on any health related topic even when I didn’t ask you anything. You feel the need to correct me when you don’t even know for a fact that what you’re saying is even true. Like, regardless if it was water weight or regular weight I still lost weight. Which is what I stated. You felt the need to interject some other stuff that I didn’t ask for in the need to feel you know more about health. Which is why you constantly tell me to lose weight you have to be in a caloric deficit even tho I already knew that and been knew that before you told me.” 

She most likely didn’t know that, as most people don’t know that, and I can tell from things she’s said in the past that she didn’t know that.

I said, “The first thing I said was some (of the weight lost) can be water weight. You asked me to explain myself and I did. But whatever. I won’t say anything more.”

She said, “You said it could be water weight and I asked what you meant because I didn’t know what water weight was. I didn’t ask you to give me a dissertation on weight loss. I literally said what is water weight loss.”

I said, “I explained to you what water weight loss was. Then you said the weight you lost wasn’t water weight. Then I explained my point.”

Then she said, “The thing is I never asked you that [to explain your point] but you seem to think I did. I was stating I lost weight. And you said it might’ve been water weight and when you told me what it was I said it wasn’t water weight. 

Then I asked, “You never asked me what?”

Then she said, “I never asked you to explain your point of why it was water weight but you think I did.”

Then I said, “Thing is you yourself don’t know what weight you lost.”

Then she said, “I do. First off I would know more than you. You’re not even here to see. Either way it was no reason to even say that.”

This is when my blood started boiling. I was trying to keep back from saying some horrible things. My gf has something about her where she can’t lose an argument and will somehow twist things around to make it as if she’s correct even if what I said was logical and what she said illogical. I guess that’s why she’s majoring in law. But it pains me and I hate going through it and I hate it so much. She does it ALL the time. 

So Then I said, “You always have to be right.”
Then she said, “No, you always have to be right.”

Then I said, “I don’t want to talk to you. Just fuck off. You always have to be right.”

What I said was harsh but it’s a culmination of what she does. I can’t have conversations with her because of this. I believe she takes things to the extreme sometimes as well. Like once she got angry and thought I was cheating because I told her I accidentally swiped on my iMessage and deleted a conversation between me and my brother. She has trust issues with me because I once said something I shouldn’t have because she asked me to open up to her more (something I don’t really like doing because she tends to take the things I say and use them against me.) 

After I said fuck off, she said, “You started this for no reason. And now you’re mad and want to curse me out because you’re immature.”

I told her, “You never even want to hear what I say to be honest. I always let you get in my head instead of just shutting my mouth. It’s not even worth explaining shit to you. You’re gonna try to disprove it anyway. I’m not immature either. I’m just tired of not being taken seriously. I just don’t feel like talking no more. I’m not immature either.”

She said, “You started this. Don’t delude yourself. And you’re definitely immature. Because why would you tell me to fuck off when you started it. You’re really disrespectful for that and you do that a lot. There was no reason to say that. I never curse at you but you always find some way to squeeze that in when talking to me and try make it seem like I’m wrong.”

Now look. I don’t curse at her a lot. She’s making it worse than what it seems. I often bite my tongue and don’t say anything. She has her fair share of equally painful things she said that I refuse to let go. In reality, I feel sad sometimes. I’ve been through some disappointments in life and had to grow up and throw away some old dreams, something that everyone goes through, but I always have a feeling that I haven’t accepted the reality of that. Back on topic, I don’t even curse at my gf much, I only do it admittedly every now and then when she does shit like this. I don’t just do it out of the blue. 

I told her, “I can explain something to you logically and you can still find a way to make it not make sense. It frustrates me. Talking to you frustrates me. So I won’t explain myself anymore.”

She said, “I didn’t ask for an explanation that’s what you don’t get. You frustrated yourself by trying to prove to me something you don’t even know for sure yourself. And I didn’t even ask for it. You just felt the need to disprove what I said for no reason.”

I said, “I do know for sure. And I see you keep trying to squeeze that “you don’t know” in there too. I’m just saying that it was probably water weight.”

She said, “Even if it was water weight what does that matter? You don’t know. You have no qualitative data to back that up. If you’re saying “probably “ then that means you don’t know.”

I said, “I guess I can’t voice any thoughts then. You have numbers and basic math to back up what I’m saying. It IS water weight then. I only said “probably” so you wouldn’t feel offended. Because if I said that it was definitely water weight you’d feel like I think I know everything even more.”

Then she said, “Oh so suddenly you’re 100% sure again. You obviously think you do because why are you trying to disprove something I said when I didn’t ask you anything. You didn’t even have to say it was water weight actually. Because either way it goes I still lost weight so what does it matter.”

I said, “I didn’t have to say anything for that matter.”

She said, “You’re just immature. And always cursing at me for no reason because you’re mad about something you started.”

I said, “I’m not immature. You want me to get upset. You’d still think I was immature if I hadn’t cursed anyway. You don’t understand how it feels to be me. You don’t understand what it’s like talking to you. You will disagree just because. Even in the face of facts. You just have to be right all the time. You don’t actually listen to what I have to say. This happens a lot too. And it makes me frustrated. I wasn’t trying to start an argument. I said the weight you lost was water weight. You asked what that was which implies you wanted to know. You’re just constantly trying to invalidate what I’m saying.”

Then she said, “Right out the gate you were trying to disprove my statement, when there was no reason to. You just were trying to disprove what I said and act as if you know how my body functions more than I do”

I told her to stop trying to make it as if I was trying to attack her.

She said, “How was I making seem like you were attacking me when you were? You were trying to accuse me of never tracking my weight daily as if you knew when you didn’t know. You were trying to attack me. I know how my own body works more than you. But I’ll go fuck off like you said.”

You dan tell by how long this post is how much this means to me. Things between us are usually smooth but it’s times like these that make me unsure. It’s not the topic that we were arguing about, it’s the traits that she displays that I can’t stand. Can someone help me out with this. Am I really immature? Am I being walked on?",11Jun2020,0

522,"I'm currently flatting with a bunch of other people. I have one housemate where if I make some smalltalk with them, they will find some small piece of what I've said and take offence to it.

For example, just minutes ago, they asked how my day was. I said something along the lines of ""Really good, I think I might have a job opportunity coming up. My friend at company xyz said that they may need my specialist knowledge for a project coming up, so I'm really excited to work with them to help on that"". The housemate immediately exploded and said that I am doing something illegal because friends aren't allowed to hire friends at companies. I explained that firstly, that isn't illegal, and secondly, my friend would not be directly managing the hiring and interview process, so therefore I don't see how this is morally wrong.

I found the interaction quite unpleasant. I was really surprised and caught off-guard that this intense criticism could erupt out of a simple question of how my day was.

I feel like I constantly have to justify myself against their accusations of wrongdoing, even though I am very certain that I act in an ethical way.

541,"So before we dig into this, my Brother-in-law fully knows how dumb he was despite sound logic and has admitted it. 

My brother-in-law is 21 and a sophomore at an out of state school for a highly specialized engineering degree. This kid is wicked smart and incredibly disciplined. His logic was that he did not have the time, money, or energy to waste on a “girlfriend” so he started an online relationship with a girl from a few states away. They would meet once a semester for a long weekend. Get whatever they needed to out of their system, so sorry, truly no pun intended., and go back to school (she has told us that she is in medical school and that’s one of the only true things we now about her). 

Well, she had told him that she was on birth control and that there wouldn’t be any “consequences” ...everyone sees where this was going already... and it turns out that she came to see him back in late February (pre-quarantine) and she was not on her birth control. She is now pregnant with possibly his child (get to that in a minute).  My brother-in-law has known about this since mid-March and just told my in-laws about 3 weeks ago which is when my wife and I come into the picture. 

They met on pornhub (didn’t know that was a thing until recently) and she would fly out on her parents dime to meet with him, but I’m going over her pornhub profile, she stated in a post that she had received 28 different hookup requests and was picking 5 to fly around the country and visit. My wife and I make no judgements still to this day on anyone. It is what it is. It’s not our lifestyle, but it is for some people. She came back to our state about 2.5 weeks ago just as all the protests were starting to see my brother-in-law(she was coming to town under the pretense that she had already had a procedure to terminate the pregnancy 2 weeks prior (again, regardless of your personal feelings about abortion, it is a free choice, and I’m just trying to get advice on how to help these two), but upon him seeing her in town they spent another night together and then after he had gone to work, sent him a message saying she had NOT had the procedure and was now much farther along. She basically told him that if he didn’t go to his parents then and there that she would just show up and “poison the well so that his parents heard it first from her and not him” (I changed the pronouns to make it readable, but that is a quote). 

So my brother-in-law got up the nerve to finally tell his parents and he told them EVERYTHING. This dude had the balls to tell his Christian, about this and that they met on a porn site, about their relationship, everything, and they could only see the “where did we go wrong?” “Where did fail our kids?” That kinda stuff. My wife and I have a more traditional relationship, but having been through our own fair share of relationships throughout the years, we seem to be the only ones trying to help or capable of helping. His parents are high school sweethearts and have no concept of what online relationships are or how these purely physical relationships work. 

So this girl (25) and my brother-in-law (21) are pregnant and she has told him over phone (I’ve heard the voicemail, and seen the text) that the only reason she is keeping the child is to have a piece of him and keep him in her life as long as possible. Literally “if I can’t have you I will make you miserable”. She is laser focused on social media and making posts about her pregnancy, but when he attempts to have a conversation about the health of the baby, she redirects to a question about “why he won’t be in a relationship with her” “why he won’t add her on Instagram”  (seriously, I can’t make this up) she has given us a fake name, fake information. Her family is supposedly very very strict because of their cultural heritage and she did not want to tell her family about the pregnancy, but when she flew home, we tried to get in touch with her to discuss with her family like we did ours, but she keeps insisting her family knows, but yet her 60+ year old parents are only willing to text my brother-in-law (she told us her parents are researchers and academics in California for a major institution in science and engineering). We believe that the phone number she has is the only thing she has really been honest with us about and we only want to do what’s best for the child and her at this point. My wife has struggled with mental illness in the past and we have been looking at the conversation my brother-in-law and she are having and something is very wrong with this girl and she needs help or support and we cannot reach her family to fill them in. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. Myself, my wife, my brother-in-law, and his family are just trying to make sure this baby is healthy and so is she. I have tried to not make judgements on anyone for anything, during this whole process, but I’m seriously concerned for the health of the baby and her at this point. Everything she has done points to her not having discussed anything with her family and we believe she is hiding the pregnancy from them as long as possible. Thank you",11Jun2020,4

A few days ago my ex messaged me out of the blue after being completely silent for almost 2 years. I had blocked her phone number and any social media accounts she could use to get in touch with me after finding out that she had cheated on me only a day or two after my birthday. She was using her cousins phone and said she really wanted to talk to me. I was wanting to talk to her about some stuff as well so I didn't decide to immediately block her. She then started telling me a ton of fucked up stuff that had happened to her while we've been apart, along with a lot of apologies and praise for how much I seemed to care for her when we were together. Apparently she had gotten with this asshole who would beat her, she had lost a couple of family members who were really important to her, and she supposedly even got pregnant and then miscarried after getting into a bad car crash. She sent me pictures of bruises and scratches she had from her ex beating her, and even if some of what she said may or may not have been true I felt bad for her. She understood that I was not going to take her back or anything, instead all she seemed to want was someone to talk to.

I made sure to try and help her as best as I could, letting her know how I felt about everything that had happened between us and how sorry I felt for all of the bad things that had happened to her since we split. Still, I made it clear to her that I was still going to block her after we got finished talking. She got angry, trying to make it seem as though I hate her or that I never cared because of how I felt. I explained to her that as much as I do care, and even after all she did in a way I still loved her, I could not have her messaging me. I moved on, I was not exactly happy without her, but I had grown used to it. She meant a lot to me, and no matter what I feel that having her talk to me after everything that had happened would not be good for either of us. I didn't want to develop feelings for her again, having the temptation that she was single and trying to talk to me cloud my mind and make me go after her again. I also knew that our relationship was not a healthy one, we constantly argued and had so many conflicting interests that no relationship we made would ever last. I just wanted to have things remain the way they had been for the last 2 years before she messaged me again, 2 years of silence and blissful ignorance to what she may be doing.

After blocking her numerous times the last few days I've started to worry that something awful might happen to her. As much as I cannot have her in my life again I'm worried that maybe me blocking her out may lead to her doing something stupid or dangerous. She said all she wanted was to talk to someone who cared for her more than anyone else ever did, so now I'm scared that she might hurt herself or even kill herself because I refused to talk to her when she needed me. I've talked about it with various friends and family members and they all seem to agree that what I did was good for the both of us in the long run, but I still can't shake the feeling that something terrible might happen to her because I was too scared to talk to her anymore. Even though I don't want her to be in my life anymore that doesn't mean I would ever wish for her to die because nobody was there for her when she needed help the most. Am I an awful person? Should I have done something differently? Sorry for this being so long and full of rambling, I really could use some sleep.",11Jun2020,1

546,"So I'm 22 and I'm currently sitting at my job in a factory on a fifteen minute break and I need real help. No not like emergency I'm in an immediate life threatening situation kind of help but more existential ""midlife"" crisis panicking because I feel I'm wasting my life away type of thing. I'm probably going to go on a rant here because I really have a lot to say and nobody really to say it to which I've felt has been the case for many years now, so I'll probably be on my second break from work or maybe even at home by the time I'm done writing this. 
But anyway, to actually get to the point, I feel like I'm stuck in my life and I'm wasting my valuable time and potential doing nothing at all when I could so easily be spending my time furthering myself, my life, and possibly even humanity in general in some way shape or form. I apologize if any of this sounds arrogant, I promise I'm not but things tend to come across differently over text so bare with me. I have always been a very smart person- I have an IQ two points below super-genius, and I have always had such an easy time learning new things. I have extensive knowledge of math and literature as well as science and history subjects among others, and when it comes to more practical, less scholarly matters, I excel as well. I have good judgement, critical thinking skills, wisdom beyond my young years, problem solving talents, creativity, and much much more to offer.
And I'm not just hyping myself up; I can back up any of these things with countless examples- in school I almost never got below a 95 on any test, even subjects I wasnt extremely good with; I've never made a stupid thoughtless mistake like gotten a tattoo I regretted, or driven drunk, or done hard drugs, or made friends with the wrong people; I can recite facts and answer trivia about countless subjects, and I've been known to draw and write some very compelling material from time to time. Hell, my personality isnt even so bad- back when I used to have friends I would make people roll on the floor- literally- from laughing so hard. And I'm not super out of shape or disabled or anything crazy like that. 
My only real limitations in fact (or at least the biggest), are an overwhelming lethargy and lack of motivation which may stem from an undiagnosed case of mild depression. Despite the fact that I could ace any test a teacher could throw at me, I never got good grades in school. I knew the material and learned what I needed to and more, but I just couldn't bring myself to complete assignments. All the way up until high school I would procrastinate, turn in late, and often miss entirely big projects, almost all homework, and especially long essays. It never helped that in elementary school i got into trouble for causing disturbances in class (I guess to get attention) and in middle school I had to deal with hostile peers because my school was a bit ghetto and I was a bit ""strange"" to a lot of the other kids. I was held back in 8th grade despite achieving extremely high scores on my sats and fcats (big end of year tests for those not familiar) every time I took them. High school was a bit better, and I made friends and tried a little more in school, but I still didnt excel. I ended up going to summer school and failed many classes including History which I had to repeat three times and still didnt bother to get good grades in. 
Oh and I failed to mention that despite my general likeability (I made friends easy enough) I never had long term companions, inside or out of school, because I ended up moving three or four times, and went to two each of elementary, middle, and high schools. And I have 5 older siblings various members of whom have shared a home with me throughout my life, yet I often felt like an only child because my next oldest brother was 6 years ahead of me, and he hated my guts. I tended to avoid the rest of my family for similar reasons, and my single mother was almost never around because she was a nurse and worked all hours of the day and night to take care of us. Overall i was a pretty lonely kid, even up until high school when I made real friends that I actually hung out with outside of school for once. This was pretty much fine with me (I think?) Because I was used to keeping to myself anyway. I passed time reading books, playing games and with toys when i was a kid, collecting things I thought were cool, keeping my room organized, and creating things from my imagination, like a card game I invented in middle school much like the battling card games yu-gi-oh or magic the gathering (which I now play a lot of, incidentally). 
I guess my point here is not to elicit sympathy or anything for my seemingly shitty upbringing- actually I know a lot of people who have had it much worse- but instead I guess I'm just looking for a new perspective, and maybe I'm tired of trying to face all my issues alone. My real purpose in writing this is, well, to get advice. And to ask for help. Because right now I cant afford to go back to college. Much like grade school, I failed to complete more than 3 semesters of community college for the same reasons- I simply could not do the work for the life of me. And in college it gets hard- you have to really study, and write multi page papers. They wanted me to read an entire book in a few months or something- and I couldn't do it. Obviously I regret it now, and I'm starting to grow out of that depression or laziness or whatever you want to call it; in fact I'm practically losing my mind while I anxiously await an opportunity to actually DO something meaningful that will help secure my future. Of course I should have listened and done my work and be diligent but I feel like I was a different person back then. And now I'm suffering from someone else's mistakes. They're mine of course, I just dont think I would have done what I did knowing how desperate I would be to be on the right track and in a good place right now.

So the TLDR of this post is something like: hey, I'm a lost but smart guy/kid (I dont even know what to call myself at this age) with a lot of potential in a lot of different areas, and I am in desperate need of a good opportunity to advance my life in a positive direction. If you have an idea of something like a website I can look at, or someone I can talk to, or maybe if you or someone you know is willing to try me out at doing some creative or intelligent work or really anything less miserable than working in a factory pushing plastic pieces of medical syringes into boxes for 8 hours, or even if you just have some sound advice, please PLEASE just comment it for me to read. I will take almost anything I can get that has any kind of potential. Also I dont post much so I'm sorry if this was hard to read. I dont expect many people to read all of it. Thank you anyway.",11Jun2020,1

552," (A bit of context for people who are not in the UK- college in the UK is a 2 year period where you select 3 subjects to study in the short amount of time, do the tests, pass- hopefully- and then move up to university.)

Hi there.

So, as the title says, I am completely undecided as to what i should choose for my upcoming A-levels and even for university. A little bit of background from me: Im Polish and have been livivng in the UK for 10+ years, and have always had a passion for history. So its obvious that Ive chosen history as one of my A levels. Sadly, I need to do 3 of them, and apart from history, I dont have an interest in any subject. I was always good at English (got a grade 8 in my mocks this year) , but Im not sure if I should choose it because i dont want to have a future with it. Same with history honestly, I chose it because I enjoy it and I know Ill do well in it as I will be very motivated. I dont really want to be a teacher though, so in kind of cautious to include English alongside History. My way of thinking was to pick a subject i really enjoy, and 2 subjects that are useful, practical, and good for the future. Im also going to do a Polish A level as my 4th A level in college, as that wont require much effort from me, given its my mother tounge. So far Ive listed 3 A levels, but I highly doubt they would let me do Polish as a 3rd instead of an additional 4th one. So that leaves an empty space (or 2- I really dont want to do English, Ive never enjoyed it) for my A level options. As i said, nothing really interests me apart from those, and Im freaking out because I know it will have an influence on university as well. The scary part is that college only lasts 2 years, and its apparently so hard. I guess I can work hard , the hard part doesnt really deter me, but the 2 years part? I basically have a couple of months until I have to decide my future. I know many of you might suggest me to do something maths-related but i never enjoyed maths, and was average at it. Dont think I could last. The sciences? Thats out of the question, I developed a strong dislike for them. If you have any advice regarding A levels I would be extremely grateful, maybe it would be even better if someone who has experienced this could make a comment, as I would feel really reasured by someone who can relate to me on this level. Im sort of lucky this coronavirus thing happened, as my mock results were especially good this term. But this much free time has gotten to my head, and i keep stressing about the future.

Also, I would like to make a quick question regarding university. Im considering to go to a Polish univeristy after my A levels, but im undecided. Maybe Ill stay in the Uk, maybe I wont. Anyway, say if I pick some subjects from my A levels, 2 years later I pass them , but then suddenly I have a change of mind, and now have a clear vision for what I want to do in the future. My A levels are not linked to the course I want to do. Would I still be able to do the course? I know that this obviously excludes subjects such as medicine, maths ect. as you need to have some background first. But do most courses accept you based on UCAS points? If so, then that would be nice, as I have previously done community work rewarding these points, and an extra A level in Polish will grant me 57 points for an A\*, which I can get. Does anyone know if this is the case worldwide? (Ofc, Im talking more about Poland than other countries here in my case) If not it sucks to be someone in this situation. I just dont understand how I can shape my future in this short amount of time. Again, if you can speak from experience, I would appreciate it if you could share your story.

It would also be reasuring to know if Im not the only one in this. Maybe theres a couple, maybe theres thousands. But, Im just more worried than others, I guess.",11Jun2020,1

i haven’t left my house more than a handful of times in over 15 months. i live with my mom (no dad, no extended family, only child) who’s schizophrenic and an alcoholic. she refused to let me attend college, said teaching me to drive was never her responsibility, and that i shouldn’t grow up because then she’ll be alone and that she never wants me to leave her. i don’t really have any opportunities to drive or go to school or to do much, but i want to. i’m so tired of not being allowed to leave the house or have a chance at being an adult. 

i don’t even know where to start at this point. talking to my mom about any of this is out of the question, she gets hysterical. i don’t have anybody else to talk to, and i don’t know what to do. i want to go outside, i want to be normal. i want to move on grow up, to start working and learn responsibly and independence, but i don’t know how to do it alone with my mom forcing and manipulating me back.

560,"My name's Joe and it's pretty much obvious because of my username. Anyways, jokes aside...

I'm 26 years old so far and I've completely messed up my life. It really has to do with gaming addiction and just not doing shit in general. 

Back in school, I've always realized that I was the shy and awkward type of person. I didn't seem to fit in the crowd and yeah I barely tried when it came with my grades and then that's when it took a dive. On the bright side, I did graduate though and didn't drop out which is a plus.

With my gaming addiction, it all started back in 2011 when I first got the PS3. It wasn't as bad but it got real bad when 2013 came and then that's when I played Black Ops 2. The game was sooo good though and I've made so many amazing friends on there. The bad side of it was that I was avoiding reality and not content with my life situation. I was 19 at the time and didn't really have my first real job until I turned 20 and yep....it was McDonald's during 2014. It's not that big of a deal because at least I had one but it didn't last too long and I was so not used too the fast pace and I was let go 2 weeks after. And wanna know what happened? Yep... I wasted months and months playing video games and till I got another job and that was until near the end of that year. It was at a supermarket at a Deli and now 2015 came around, I was 21 at this point. That lasted till the beginning of 2016 and I was fired from that job from my own dumb actions. Had a couple other jobs after later that year but then didn't get another one till I turned 23 and that was at Wendy's. That was the very first job that I really liked and I only lasted 2 1/2 years there. Now I have another job but I can go on and on about my situation.

The main point is..here I am now...so disappointed in myself with my life. Yeah I still game but now I just feel burnt out and I'll probably tell myself the same ol story on how I'll ""take a break from gaming"" and then just proceed to waste my life on doing pointless shit like watching videos on YouTube and browsing the internet. I'm stuck in this loop and I really need to break it. Right now with the way the world is, yeah it's bad. But I can't let that be an excuse to stop me from just pulling the trigger to get the basic stuff like getting my license and possibly a way better job. No one isn't going to come save me and I know I have to do this on my own but sometimes it's okay to ask help from others because I shouldn't bottle up these feelings forever. 

I'm not gonna lie, if I do keep continuing the same destructive path that I'm in, it's possible that I can get depressed which is what I'm feeling right now. I haven't hungout with anyone in months and especially since this pandemic really distant myself with a couple close friends that I would always hangout with.

I never been in a real relationship at all and it does get lonely but fuck all of that right now. I have to worry about me first before I love someone else. No one will ever want to date a loser like me at this situation I'm in. And I can talk to people with confidence fine but with me being the way I am for so long, it dumbed me down. I have to catch back up again.


Tl;dr: Basically my life has gone to shit and I've wasted years on years doing shit like constant video games to avoid reality. Went through jobs here and there but I'm stuck in this loop. 26 who still lives at home and I have no license at all, who really needs to wake the fuck up before it's too late and face my damn fears..",11Jun2020,1

Hi!
I want to get rats in the near future and I have the opportunity to make them office rats as well as my boss and coworkers would be ok with having some furry friends around :) 

I would of course make a complete cage setup in work  for them as well and make sure they are all nice and comfy.

My question is though if the commute to work would bother the rats in any way? I would carry them in a bigger bag thing for pets filled with a blanket and some small toys.

582,"Hi, all.

Nightmares have been something I've dealt with for years, but they finally started dying down about a year ago. Even when I had them, it wasn't anything that kept me up, just something that jolted me awake.

In March, I went through a traumatic experience and for obvious reasons, the nightmares have picked up, but they are much worse. I always lose about an hour or two of sleep because I'm scared to go back to sleep. Now, it's gotten to where I finally fall asleep, and then I have another nightmare. I have probably gotten five hours of sleep in the past three days because I'm terrified to sleep at night.

I think the reason why is because I've been stressed lately, but I can't seem to calm down. Things that used to calm me aren't working anymore and I feel at a bit of a loss on what to do from here.

I just need to know ways I can relax before bedtime. Things that will calm my mind. I'm not looking for how to stop nightmares, I am seeking therapy for that.

Thanks for the help, reddit.",11Jun2020,1

587,"So it's bigger than my title, so I'll explain.  Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

30, F.  My husbands father was accidentally killed in December, leaving his elderly mother by herself for the first time in a LONG time.  My husband had a terrible relationship with his father, so this has been a chance for us to catch up, and rebuild that relationship.  She has some other family in the state, but by and large to burden of taking care of her has fallen on us.  We lived with her for a while, and then bought a house and just recently moved out.

In the middle of all of this, COVID happened.  Literally the worst timing.

I am normally VERY close with my parents.  I call my mom several times a day, I work with my dad.  We have different political beliefs, which hasn't been toooooo much of an issue (until now) because we agreed to just not talk about it.  I will say my mom reacts very poorly to anything that isn't her idea, or in her favor.  Until now at least.

Because my husband has one parent left, we have been EXTRA cautious with COVID to ensure that we cannot give it to her.  The way my husband puts it, he doesn't even want to take a 1% chance that she could possibly get it because there is a good chance she could die if she does.  My mother in law has been great about being cautious herself, but we are all getting burnt out.

I have only seen my parents a couple of times in the last 3 months.  We had to move into our house alone (which SUCKED), and they haven't even seen the inside of our house yet.  I (stupidly) asked them to come over on Mother's day and said they could see the house and have a little cookout, which my husband wasn't SUPER happy about, but whatever.  I ended up calling my mom that morning and saying that I thought it would be better if we just hung out outside, didn't go inside, and didn't have a cookout.  The reason I changed my mind was because I didn't feel like they would actually respect boundaries.  If we had them inside, they would be touching everything and we would have to take off our masks to eat.  This seemed extremely paranoid to them, but I thought they would at least come over.  OH NO.  My mom was (understandably) very hurt, and went on a HUGE tirade, calling me names, accusing my husband of being just like his father (who abused the heck out of his family), accusing him of controlling my life, of trying to keep me only to himself.  I tried to explain that it's because we have to be able to help my mother in law at a moment's notice, and she has NO ONE ELSE, but that didn't go over well either.

Later that week, she came over to see the yard and garden, and we talked about masks and 6ft away.  She literally CHASED me around, and kept taking her mask off.  I didn't say anything at the time because I was too afraid.  The next day, she asked if she could come over to help with the garden and I said ""yes, as long as we are 6 ft away"" - she responded with ""WHAT?! Wasn't I 6 ft away yesterday?!"" and went on another tantrum. I KNOW she is stress, I am too!!!!!!  But SERIOUSLY.

My parents are now back to life as normal.  It doesn't help that my extended family is as well.  Even my had who has had cancer TWICE is seeing ALL her friends, and doing hair for the elderly.  I WISH I could go back to ""normal life"", but I can't.  They LITERALLY think that the virus is done, and that everything is politically motivated right now to ""keep it going as long as possible."" My mom said ""what if they send something else?!"" meaning what if CHINA SENDS ANOTHER VIRUS.  They think Trump is the best and most amazing president that we have ever had and that I'm brainwashed and abused.

My dad also claims that he already had it in November, and so did my brother, and our coworker, and so did my mom so we can't get it from them and they can't get it.  But they have never been actually TESTED!

I was planning to have them over this weekend, and we are going to quarantine ourselves away from my MIL for 2 wks.  My dad called me this morning and said that my excuses aren't good enough, and that ""protecting 1 life isn't worth throwing away 6 others.  You have to live your life, you can't live in fear - the numbers are DRASTICALLY DROPPING.""  He said that my mom cries for an hour every day and that when I call in the morning it's like I died and she is getting a call from the grave, and if I don't figure something out, my mom's mental health is at stake and she is headed for the mental hospital.

I'm at my wit's end here.  I KNOW we are being more cautious than the general population right now - I KNOW things have opened up, but that doesn't mean that COVID is gone!  Am I being too cautious?  I thought so at first, but I also agree with protecting my husbands mom as much as possible.  My mom works in health care, my sister works in customer service. They have been seeing ALL their friends and family for WEEKS now.  They say they won't be governed by fear.

I am currently working on getting set up with a counselor to help with stress, but I'm at a loss here.  I guess I'm asking for advice on how to deal with my parent's first as far as trying to have a somewhat ""normal"" relationship, whatever that means.  What would you do?

TLDR: My parent's think COVID is done but I'm trying to protect my vulnerable MIL, who has no one else to lean on right now.  Halp.",11Jun2020,1

590,"So I’ve (19 F) been stuck with the decision to either go to uni in Spain (Valencia) or in England (London). In both cases I’m assuming I will have to get student loans and grants, and the only difference would be the living costs. I’m so worried about getting student and maintenance loans in London as maybe things would not work out and I will suddenly have to survive with no money or financial support whereas in Valencia my mum who’s got a narcissistic personality disorder would drain my emotional stability and confidence. I lived in Spain for six years up until I finished baccalaureate and have been doing a gap year in London for almost a year now. Never have I ever been this genuinely happy and alone doing my own thing but my parents seem to be very against my decision to study in London. I don’t even want to ask for any financial support from them as I’m guessing I’ll be getting it from the government. I really don’t know what to do. 

Fyi I’ve got a dutch nationality therefore I’m entitled to have the same fees as the british do, although I haven’t lived here for more than one year. 

People keep on saying “do what makes you happy”. I think I’d be happier living in London to study but my parents wouldn’t stop scaring me about the debt I will be in by the time uni finishes. But at the same time, so many people my age are in debt due to university attendance. I wouldn’t be the only one. 

If you’ve studied within the UK, could you please tell me some details about the loans and how secure you felt throughout the years financially, without having to depend on anyone? Does the government give you sufficient maintenance funds?

591,"First of all, I apologize for format and any other errors. I am on mobile and haven’t ever learned if I’m posting things correctly on here.

 My niece M has lived with my parents her entire life. My mom has been there without hesitation since M was born prematurely. My mom was 
granted guardianship until M turns 18. My brother B is not on the birth certificate. He has lived with my parents his entire life but my mom did everything for M and B just popped in and out whenever he liked and never did any of the hard stuff that comes with having a child or being an adult but that is another story. B has robbed my parents multiple times, taken out credit cards in their names, ruined their credit, caused them to lose their home and tons more... he’s a compulsive liar who talks in circles and has a false sense of reality. Fast forward to November 2019 he meets a girl who has quite a few kids of her own and within a month they start talking about moving in together, getting married, etc. They decide her and her troop of kids will move into my parents house they are renting and my parents will move out (which they are onboard with because they don’t want to live with this woman they barely know and her kids) They decided to allow Madison to stay with B under the impression that my parents would have visitation and M would stay with them on weekends or every other week. 

So the move happened like a week before lockdown because of Covid and B and his gf C used that as an excuse to why Madison was not allowed to come around for the last 3 months and every time B said my mom could see her, my mom would end up going there and knocking on their door for with either no answer or C coming out and screaming that Madison isn’t going anywhere. C hates my entire family for reasons we can’t comprehend and has blocked us all from social media and will not even acknowledge any of us. She has shown nothing but hate, disrespect, and disgust towards everyone of B’s family members. All of us. She obviously has mental and psychological problems of her own. 

So yesterday we finally had to call the cops to assist us in getting M . M told the officers she wanted to go with us after acting very afraid to answer and being asked 4 times (she kept looking up at B to see his reaction and he was pissed and being very rude to the officers) So we get her and even though I advised my mom to not bring her back last night, she did anyways and now I’m afraid we won’t see her again or for a very long time at least... The second we pulled up to bring her back the gf C was outside waiting and dragged Madison in the house without us hardly getting to tell her bye. 

So my question is, I know that B and C are going to try and get full custody of M and i want to know what your opinion is on whether they will succeed or not? 

The real kicker in this whole situation is that there’s a good chance that M isn’t even B’s biological daughter but I don’t know if my parents could ever admit that or bring it up in court because even after everything my brother B has done to them they still help him and cater to his every whim. It’s beyond frustrating trying to get anything though any of their heads.

Any advice, legal or otherwise and opinions on this is greatly appreciated!",11Jun2020,3
592,"I feel very stuck in life right now. At the moment I’m working a dead-end minimum wage job that is eliminating my happiness and I really wish I could pursue a life of being an animator or cartoonist or a comic creator. I want to live as an artist, that would make me the most happy and content with life. But doing some research on the subject, from what I’ve understood from people getting an art degree will have you laughed right out of an interview as most companies will not accept that as valid education. It’s also very hard to make money as an artist and not worth it, and it’s not going to support a family (according to my boyfriend). Small groups for animators and artists are basically non-existent so I shouldn’t even bother. Friends and family have told me that that’s just not a realistic path in life and that I need to get something else and put art to the side.

I’ve thought so hard what my second major skill should be. I’ve thought about being an astronomer, but I’m terrible at math. I’m really stuck in life and I constantly think about how I probably will never live the dream I want so bad, and it makes me feel terrible. Am I doomed to retail forever? I’m really scared of dying and never living up to my potential. I love art so much and I love making it. I’m determined to start my own cartoons and comics, and I want to go to a school to get education on making even better stuff. I want to be featured on channels like Cartoon Network or maybe Nickelodeon. Is it all really a pipe dream at the end of the day? I really want to get out there and prove everyone wrong.

595,"My partner is attending a university here in the UK, the course name I guess isn't Important, during the lockdown my partner has been given a number of assessments, with her dyslexia, and a lack of any support, I have been doing my bit to proof read and help where I can, all of the assessments have been completed on time ect ect, the issues lies in the grading, a couple months ago we had an issue where the tutor gave my partner the wrong feedback(meant for another person and their work) but insisted the grades were correct, then correcting only the feedback and any negative points in her areas to improve were either a total reach (commenting on the phrasing of a couple of things) while giving high marks to another person who's work is to a visibly lower standard, coincidentally the person who's feedback was issued to my partner.

So grades came in today for the next lot of assignments, feedback for the other person again on one assignment and on another there were ""areas to improve"" which stated things were not included which actually were. And when called on this the tutor removed the comment and claims to have added a point for it(no point was added as of yet)

What do we do reddit, something seems to be wrong here to me, the tutor I question is also dyslexic which in some way excuses a mistake here if there but Im at a loose end and my partners confidence is suffering because of this, if I hadn't read the feedback myself today we definitely wouldn't have even picked up on the fact the feedback was for someone else.

Please excuse the formatting I'm on mobile. Thankyou in advance for any help or advice.

601,"Hi everyone, we recently hired someone to manage the Instagram page for our restaurant. I personally had no problem doing it, but we had many other things going on. We are planning on renovating the whole interior of the restaurant, (it’s been here for 17 years) creating a whole new website and new menu copies because the other ones are old and outdated. The old restaurant is a bit out of touch with today’s world, hasn’t been renovated for over 10 years. So anyways, we hired someone for our Instagram page, for an hour a day to engage with other account, post photos,stories,. etc. 

We have had him for about 3-4 weeks now. 

This account is our account, not the persons account who we hired. 

He is getting very confused with the photo quality that we want, and the new atmosphere we would like to set with the photos that we are giving him. (Since we are completely renovating everything about the restaurant itself) The problem is, he over exposes the photos and makes them look nothing like the original photos that we took. we have tried talking to him about dialing down his editing but he doesn’t seem to understand what we mean. 
So, we insisted, just post the photos that we send him. He wasn’t able to upload the daily special so I logged on to the account and went to post it. 

I was getting many many messages on the restaurant account and looked at the messages and he is basically criticizing our photos (with his personal food blog account) with a group of close friends that follow each other on the account he is compared to his, saying that “he likes brighter photos, that he’s just in it for the money, he can’t put his heart into something he doesn’t care about, these are ‘foodie’ photos and they can’t look like that” “I’ll just sit back and worry about my own pages” “they’re pushing this dark look versus something that’s eye popping”

We both have a very different views on exactly what we want out of the Instagram page and he doesn’t understand. 

I spoke to him about a few restaurant pages on Instagram after he sent them to me, and tried to see the exact look that we’re going for. As we told him that we like, this, or that, or this account he says “well that’s nothing like you talked about, those are light photos, they are not dark and how you want them” 

I never said that I wanted dark photos, I just don’t want over exposed photos. 
He doesn’t understand the difference between brightness in a photo and over exposure and extreme saturation to the point where it doesn’t look anything like the original photo at all, or even the meal? 

He is comparing his photos to other restaurant pages that take photos like how we do, and how we want to post. 

We don’t want to let him go because he has many connections and a good amount of followers. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you.

Edit: we also have a professional camera, he uses his iPhone camera (which is no problem), but he also uses a light box that shows every single detail of the photo and creates awkward lighting where it’s not necessary. 

In the photos that he edits instead of multiple pasta noodles it just looks like one because of how over exposed it is. No shadows, no depth, no texture.",11Jun2020,3
602,"For anyone not from the UK, A-levels are a type of exam you sit near the end of sixth form in the UK. 

At the start of my time in sixth form I picked three subjects; Psychology, History and English Literature. 

I hate History and English. They’re both so dull and boring and are only necessary if you’re looking at going into a career where you specialise, which I’m not. 

I want to be a police officer, have wanted to be one for as long as I can remember, and for that I only need one a level. 

I hate my other lessons, the teachers are terrible and the subjects are so much harder and less interesting than they were at GCSE level. 

Top that all off with the fact that I don’t even need these qualifications to do what I want I really want to drop these subjects, it’d allow me to focus all my effort on the one A-level because at the level I’m at currently I’m concerned I won’t pass any of them (English and History set WAY too much work for quarantine self teaching and it’s getting in the way of me doing my psychology work).

603,"Quick backstory: my wife, 30, has a bit of an alcohol abuse issue (in my opinion) that has caused a rift between us. I wouldnt call her a full blown alcoholic, but she has a hard time stopping until there is nothing left to drink once she starts. This leads to 2-4 nights a week of her getting legally impaired. I've come to loathe seeing her with alcohol in her hand because I know how the night will go most of the time. She is very aggressive and gravitates toward arguments and starting fights and is generally unpleasant to be around. Also, she is very close with her grandparents and spent much of her childhood at their house so this loss was a big one. 

That said, I made a mistake and bought a bottle of rum over the weekend so we could enjoy drinks by the pool. I typically don't buy alcohol, especially not liquor as I feel I'm enabling if I'm the one bringing it in the house, but I hadn't had a cocktail in a while and thought if I set expectations up front (I told her I bought this for us to share on the weekends and wanted it to last more than a couple of days. She got a bit defensive but ultimately agreed), we could manage. I was wrong and before I knew it she was visibly drunk from taking shots by herself while I wasn't around, sometimes stumbling and being her loud, drunken self (while our 9 year old son is home). I ignored her as best I could to avoid confrontation with her that would inevitably turn into a fight, and eventually went to bed while she stayed up on the couch, drinking more. We never talked about it because it feels like beating a dead horse at this point since we've had the drunken night follow up conversation countless times. She just gets defensive when I bring up alcohol, swears off alcohol because it's not worth getting ""harassed"" about and the cycle starts over. 

Fast forward a couple of days, her grandmother died. She's been on hospice for months. We knew it was coming, but it doesn't change the grief for my wife and her mother. She got the call at 6am as I was getting ready for work and then went back to sleep. I left work early so she could go to her grandparents house to see her grandfather. When I got home, she was just about polishing off the bottle of rum while drinking beers and talking to a friend. It sent a fire of irritation through me as she'd agreed to not drink the rum without me. I suppressed it as best I could, knowing her emotions were high, and logged into work to join a meeting from home. Shortly after, she left to see her grandfather as her friend left. 

Fast forward again to that night, she comes home more drunk; slurring words stumbling and clearly emotional from crying all day. I sit down with her while she eats some takeout and attempt a conversation with her. She's constantly distracted, repeatedly telling our son to take a shower so he can go to bed (an hour before his bed time) despite me telling her every time that he's already showered. This ends up making her mad so she storms out and says she's going to bed. I don't say anything and eventually go to the garage to collect my thoughts while working on a project. She comes out to the garage later and sits down saying she's showered and is cool now. 5 minutes later, she's mad at me again for not engaging in conversation with her and storms off saying she's going to bed. I give her a couple of minutes and then go in the house to go to bed myself. This leads to her confronting me about not being supportive of her when she needed me on one of the hardest days of my life and wants an explanation. I don't know what to tell her. I'd seen her less than an hour, collectively, throughout the day and the whole time she was drinking or drunk. I obviously don't want to bring that up at the end of a hard day for her (while she's drunk especially) so I just tell her I don't know what to say. She goes to bed in the guest room and I fall asleep in bed. 

I'm completely lost here. I feel like I can't explain myself without being insensitive but can't properly console her because I'm just so worn down by this constant issue of alcohol. It's wearing our relationship down, and I'm finding myself being apathetic about things and giving up on us.",11Jun2020,1
604,"We live in New York. Before COVID, I was readying to move into my new apartment- my mother and 2 sisters are disabled and my father is an essential worker who works long hours. When the lockdown began, I stopped going to work, stopped seeing my girlfriend, and complied to their demand that I no longer go on walks or leave the house under any circumstances. It's been 4 months since then.

I am now at a breaking point. I clean, cook, and take care of my mother and four sisters with the help of a live in home attendant. My two adult brothers who live in the house as well as my father (when he's home) do nothing. I haven't seen beyond their four walls in 120+ days.  I have lost weight, struggle to sleep, am having panic attacks and frankly ... have been thinking about how much easier my life would be if i were dead. My parents acknowledge I need to go back to work and I need to finally move into my apartment. The tension came when they made clear I still ""need"" to be in their home and they expect me to do this same level of house work even as I work my job. My family told me that if I decide to see my girlfriend, it's clear I don't care if my mother lives or dies. They told me I have to choose: either be with them and be part of the family or choose to live how I want and never be allowed into their lives again until a vaccine is possible.

I don't know what to do.

Title sums it up but here’s some details. I grew up in a household with a very strict father when it came to academics, and now I feel like that might’ve ruined my life. It took all joy out of learning. I always did well at school, until I started university. I’ve always wanted to study psychology. Not only because it’s something that I find interesting and that I know I’d truly enjoy studying, but also because I believe I’d really be able to excel in the field. However my father shut that idea down immediately, labeling it as “not a real major”. I’ve been in university for 3 years now. First year I did Civil Engineering, but I ended up hating it and leaving my university to study law (my dad’s a lawyer and so I knew some stuff about the field, didn’t think it was that bad). I did my first year of law in my home city, and then moved last year out to a different city to a far better university. A very expensive private one. In all my father has payed for 3 years of my university education. I’m about to turn 21 now, and the more I think about it the more sure I am that I don’t want to pursue a career in law. I have no motivation to study, I’m failing my finals, and already I feel that traumatic fear of telling my dad that I did. When studying law I feel like my dad’s shadow (he studied in the same university and got the best possible grades throughout). He pressures me (I don’t think he does it on purpose) to follow in his steps and inherit his firm. I don’t want that. 
I’m not sure what my options are. I’m currently not financially independent, although I’d probably be able to land a job. I just want to start my own life already. I want to be independent. I’ll be 21 in just about a month and I still don’t feel like I have control over my life. I don’t know what to do, although I can think of many things I’d rather do than study law or pursue a career in it. I’ve even considered joining the military as a way out. 
Here’s some information about me, it might be helpful:
- I’m a 20-21 year old guy living in Spain. I’ve spent most of my life here, lived abroad a few years. 
- I speak English and Spanish fluently, as well as conversational German and French. 
- I have an American nationality as well as a Spanish one. 

In conclusion I just want to be free. To be able to decide my own fate and lead my own life without being threatened by my father whenever I don’t conform to his ideas of what leads to a successful life. (He threatens to stop paying for my tuition, to kick me out of the house, to write me off of his will, etc.) any and all advice is greatly appreciated. I don’t know how to move on from this, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to start my own life already. I don’t want to keep wasting my dad’s money. I don’t want to be reliant on my parents anymore. Thank you in advance to any advice givers.",11Jun2020,1

Guys don’t see me as someone worth the ‘competition’ and when I’m talking with a guy, they always check out other females in the room...

She keeps on telling me everyday that I started losing weight in the beginning of my vegan ""diet"" but now I'm gaining weight. To clarify, I never went into veganism for weight loss. If I did, I wouldn't be vegan right now. I am happy that my lifestyle aligns with my beliefs but my mother fails to understand this since all she focuses on are looks.

626,"Hi all.

So everybody rich and famous seems to be around my age, when they first reached the pinnacle they so craved. I am in my early thirties (gasp).

For years I have invested all of my time into work and  study. I went so far as not do do any sports and sleep little, in order  to be able to study more. The sports part is now reversed under the cost of constant pain in the knees.

But apart from that, I feel like a  big waste. I am not an outlandishly beautiful person - otherwise some talent scout might have picked me up - , but I might just  fit in somehow as not ""the ugly one"". I have a distinctive face and profile and I am usually very quiet. I can adapt to other situations though, as long as I  know, what I am supposed to do or say. I have a hard time getting to know new people, understanding them or making myself understood. This is why I usually stick to very few - and usually the wrong ones, as it turns out.

I chose a career path,  which was ""sure"" to be a ""safe"" thing instead of following my actual  interests - always I kept these in the back of my head and sometimes I  allowed myself to work on them a little bit. But of course one cannot  count on becoming the very expert on a field which explodes from competition and subjectivism. The creative business - however greatly  talented I think or at least thought myself to be - is in my view the  hardest to get on top. And I do not want to be anywhere else - at least  in something.

Earlier in my life I was pretty sure to be a creative success and, therefore, to be able to do my ""safe"" job easily. I did not want to count on it though - because everybody most certainly thinks that of themeselves. 

It just now  so happens, that what I get most critizised about in my ""safe"" job is  exactly what I think of as creative - and which is far apart from many of my colleagues and superiors. They do not understand my thinking and I  do not understand them - although I am able to copy their style and ideas. It just pains me a lot to do so and I hate the work.

I feel stupid for not just having done what everybody else seems to be doing - doing what they want. And now it seems to be too late to attain anything of significance, because I am supposed to run a clean act. Which I also fail at great lengths. I just lost one of my jobs instead of getting a promotion, because I haven't qualified as requested fast enough.

I tried to stay  away from relationships - because I am really bad at judging people - , but still had recurring weaknesses. I ended up with  one person who had borderline, one person who was together with me out  of convenience and one person who was bulimic (and not intending to give  it up) and a little bit crazy. Very crazy.

I lost around 30 years doing nothing significant. I am  considered a total idiot by my surroundings - even of course they do not  openly admit so. I am so tired everyday I start falling asleep right after the lunchbreak, although I have a lot to do.

I fear to die  with having more plans than I ever imagined and having succeeded at  nothing - because I just am not good enough for anything.

627,"I was vegetarian and have been vegan for some time, without any support from my parents whatsoever (still living with them). I mostly do it for the general reasons: I love animals and do not support violence of any kind, the environment, and ""health"".
However, my medical tests came back with really worrisome results. Now I'm ordered by my doctors to eat meat for my health because I'm borderline X (sparing the details irrelevant to the following questions). 
How do I explain to my parents (not vegan)- who will surely have a hoot saying I told you so- that being vegan has deteriorated my health and that I now have to eat meat? 
I've been trying so hard for so long to convince them and they've always said it would affect my health negatively (which it did). 
It makes me angry that they're not the type of people that would worry about the news about my health, they would only focus on being right and saying that I was dumb for even doing it in the first place.
I don't know how to deal with this because I have to change my whole mindset, which I worked so hard on (turning vegan slowly) and now I have to completely change my lifestyle (eating meat and other things). On the other hand, I don't want them to think it was just a phase, and give them the satisfaction of saying that they were right about all the negative things they used say throughout the years.

630,"So basically I cheated on a final exam. I know its bad but life got in the way and I crumbled under pressure. The only thing I can do now is figure a way out. Our professor emailed the exam questions to us and basically we had to finish it and turn it in by a certain time. Now I'm not dumb and I didn't just copy and paste the questions on chegg. Instead I used the chegg tutoring tool to get a person to come to my aid right away and basically I just played as if I needed help and they just helped me work through the problem. However I also posted some of the questions on coursehero's 24/7 homework help since they have a 50 minute response time just in case the tutoring tool didn't work or took too long. Even then I left a few of the answers blank. I got an email from the professor saying he knows people cheated and basically if we confess then they will mitigate the damage but if they then he will report. Now I even went back and checked to see if my questions could be found online and I copy and pasted them and they didnt show. I also used another account with the chegg and coursehero accounts with different names and I also used a really old email of mine but the only thing is is the email does have a few of the same characters in the same order that could link me back if they did suspect. I know teachers pull this scam to try and get students to confess, and I'm sure other students cheated and they probably weren't as smart about it. So basically I'm wondering what are my chances that I am caught and should I confess. I don't think my answers or questions were posted online since even i cant find them through google and I can only see them when I log back into the account and look at my history.

657,"I work at a movie theater, and we've just been cleaning the whole place from top to bottom for the past few months since we are not allowed to be open. I hadn't realized that we are now scheduled to open next week, as we now move into ""phase 3"" of reopening with the rest of California. My general manager and the owners of the company have incredibly poor communication skills, so none of us were aware until recently. I'm still pretty sure most of the other employees have no clue, but also don't care.

Aside from having the general lack of enthusiasm from working at any job for a period of 3 years (""I get treated like dirt"", ""there's no communication"", ""I hate working for minimum wage"", ""retail sucks"", etc.), I have two other, more concerning problems weighing on my shoulders. I live with my mother, who recently finished chemotherapy and surgery in her fight against breast cancer. She still has to do some radiation, and so her immune system is not running at 100%. At this point I don't know if we can afford for me to be this publicly exposed in the middle of a pandemic. My other problem is that I am transferring to a four year in the fall now that I have finished my general ed classes, and I can't keep up with working, essentially, full-time hours while also taking classes at a pace that actually let's me graduate in the near future.

Don't get me wrong, while I hate this job, it definitely has perks that I would be sad to see go. The one thing that this company does extremely well is work around your hours. At the same time, I feel like I would have the same lack of drive no matter which job I went to because that's just how jobs (especially minimum wage, part time jobs) are. And, of course, I am also worried about quitting because then I won't be eligible to get unemployment until I find a new job, IF I CAN even find a new job during this craziness.

I don't mean to sound entitled or anything, but because I live with my mother still, my paycheck is pretty much just extra money for me. It wouldn't really be THAT major of a deal if I didn't have an income for a little, but I would rather still be saving up for my future while I can.

Finally discontinued life support when brain scans showed severe trauma in all areas of brain &amp; he wasn't improving. 

6 months later the BF &amp; I aren't getting along.
Last night he broke up with me &amp; kicked my son &amp; I out.... 
I yelled at him ""it's your fault my dad died"" 
And tore the thermostat off the wall &amp; took it with me... (I had bought it, was acting out, wasn't thinking)

Anyways.
Idk what to do.
There are so many more details that play into this.

Bottom line tho,  I  want this to work out.
I don't know how to fix it.

663,"So. I’ve been unemployed for almost 3 months because of COVID until yesterday, well I requested my vacation dates off In December and was of course given the okay, however this week is our first week reopening and only 2 servers are coming back to work, I’m a pastry chef normally so I went into work yesterday to clean my area and make some desserts, my boss told me in addition to making pastries (hourly wage) I will also be waiting tables since we’re so short staffed. She didn’t even ask me, but told me. I told her (despite not wanting to) I would wait tables this week to help out but for her not to forget that I’m out of town all next week for vacation/ apartment hunting as my bf plans to go to grad school where we’re visiting to which she replied “I forgot all about that! Can’t you cancel?” I am known for letting this woman walk all over me and giving in to her wishes despite her being terrible to me and not respecting me. I don’t know what to do. I’m also very mad that I’m serving and working hourly because In the states that means taxes will eat all of my hourly so I’m basically working for free when I make pastries. I also never wanted to be a server, I haven’t waited tables in over 2 years. I know tough times call for tough decisions but this is totally not fair to me I feel like. (Sorry this post is all over the place my emotions are just a mess right now) any advice would be very appreciated. Thanks!",11Jun2020,151

668,"My (20F) best friend since i was a kid was my next door neighbor, let’s call him Michael (22M). We are going to be roommates this fall. He’s gay and I’m a straight girl dating my partner (19M).
Michael is a really good friend but has been drinking a lot lately. I know he’s going through a lot right now as he has a big medical condition he won’t tell me or anyone about, I’m the only one that knows it exists actually, I’m unsure of what it is though, I just know “it’s serious, I think I’ll be ok, I can’t tell anyone.” Strange, unsettling. He even has a serious boyfriend he hasn’t told and has always been really close to his parents.
Anyways, anytime my boyfriend and I hang out with Michael, just the three of us, or with Michael’s boyfriend too, Michael gets really touchy on my boyfriend to the point that my boyfriend is really uncomfortable.
We were all going to go skinny dipping last night on a whim and Michael is itching for my boyfriend to get his clothes off. We ended up not going and just went home. He comments on his ass all the time and how attractive he is, but only when drunk, which happens to be all the time now. My boyfriend has told my that when i leave the room Michael tries to make moves or looks at him sexually, and asked that i don’t leave them alone ever. 
This is not ok and i need to talk to Michael but I’m also worried that it’s gonna make things really uncomfortable telling him to stop assaulting my boyfriend... esp when we’re going to live together.
how should I talk to him to get most effective, non awkward results? Should i be disappointed that my friend did this? Or can it be excuses because of what he’s going through? Im so grossed out and feel like i don’t even know my best friend. Never expected this from him.

676,"I’m a guy, 20 years old, halfway through college.  My girlfriend and I have been together for two years.  The thing is, I go to college about 700 miles away so we have been long distance for most of the two years.  I like to consider myself pretty self aware and I don’t feel like this is a whipped situation or anything; I truly love this girl, she’s my best friend, we get long great and I love her family.

So anyways, my guy best friend (since 7th grade) and I planned to live and work at the beach this summer.  We like to surf and thought it’d be great fun.  However, I ended up getting a concussion so he went out to the apartment we planned to rent 3 weeks ago because I’ve been injured this whole time.  Now, I’m better, and about to be able to go.  The problem is that in this time I’ve fallen in love with my girlfriend in a new way.  I was kind of depressed at one point in the last year and now I feel happier and more confident than ever.  We laugh and have an amazing time every time we hang out.  And so now I’m picturing what would happen if I don’t go to the beach, as I feel I’ve been finding myself and really growing as a person being with her.

I will have fun either way, and I’m not exactly concerned about us breaking up, but if I stay it could be really refreshing to not just be visiting from long distance for once.  It really feels like she’s my girlfriend for the first time.  She’s understanding that this is something I want to do but wishes i could stay as well.  I’m talking to my best friend later today to be honest with him and see what he says, he knows what’s going on and understands we (my gf and I) haven’t had much time together in the two years we have had.  I would say I’m about 60% would rather stay, 40% would rather go.  Any advice?

677,"My background is that I always had an idea of what I wanted but because of depression it took quite a bit longer to get a degree.  Therefore the job I landed in, wasn't really the job I wanted but it's all I could get and was just in the right ballpark.

After finishing a degree I've had several conversations where I've spoken to my manager about my career objectives, he did throw a few things my way but then he suddenly stopped. I've became aware (reading between the lines) that a number of people have blocked me from progressing my career in this direction, perhaps they felt it was a perceived risk as I don't think these people are otherwise malicious. Last time I spoke to my manager he told me I was ""too old"" to make career changes (I'm 37).

Then a number of times since then he's told me he's going to promote me to management for the role I already do and I can build up my own team. Since the 'too old' comment I've kind of gone silent on my career plans because I feel like if I don't toe the line, I will appear disinterested in my job.  But I've been working on self-development in my own time, and started applying for jobs.

He keeps saying a 'promotion' will be coming up for me soon and I try to be neutral.  I don't want to agree for promotion for a job I don't want and I don't want to refuse and appear subordinate. People might say, it's more money so take it. But it's more responsibility giving me less free time to work on the career I want, by studying, etc. and also puts a clause in my contract that makes my notice period 3 months essentially locking me into my current role (who wants to hire someone that can't start for 3 months especially when they don't have real experience?). I'm thinking I just have to keep putting it off until I either find a job or a contract is put in front of me and I refuse to sign it.

Now my manager has asked me to put together a 5 year career plan. I don't know what to put, if I put what he has told me my career plan should be, that doesn't feel good and I'll be shooting myself in the food. But the alternative is to put forward an honest career plan where I'm clearly looking to get another job since I'm being blocked from doing that within my current employer. Although it does give me a way of escaping the promotion I don't want as I can say ""this doesn't fit the career plan I gave you"" and maybe putting my true goals in writing might help make it clear I'm serious and maybe something will come up.",11Jun2020,1

680,"I finally snapped at him so bad I scared him, I feel so horrible for it too. I ended up breaking down, he felt so bad because I'm sure he blames himself.

And other shit, but I cant do it anymore.


Today, my brother adam threw a giant fit, I was already in a horrible mood because i had a trashed house to clean, and my other brother JR was fighting me to get up and at least clean his room. I tried standing him in the corner for a 2 minute time out but he just screamed and fell down, I tried getting him to face the wall but he wouldn't stop screaming, it got so fucking loud, I snapped, I picked him up and sat him down on the bed and just fucking broke down, I regret what I did because he started crying more and the look of guilt on his face when i started crying hurt. It hurt so much, I apologized so much to him, I told him I did love him so much, I hugged him so tight, but I still feel super guilty, I want to get better for him, if I'm gonna be helping my mom raise him, I want to be a good person towards him. 



I've been through a lot, the house hold chores are on me, dishes, sweeping, counters and stove top, I watch adam for over 9 hours a day, even when my mom is home he comes to me, only me, for food and a bath and other stuff, it doesn't help that I've been in a mentally abusive friendship for multiple years, I tried telling my mom and all she fucking said to me is ""well you needed to go through something like that.""

686,"Hey everyone! I really need some advice. I’m going to try to make this as short as possible.  I’m nearly 30, a few years ago I figured it was time for me to start looking toward the future, so I purchased a two story home, Hoping, one day I can grow into with a family. Right now I currently have a serious girlfriend but am not married. One of my best friends was looking for a place to live, and since we’ve been best friends since freshman year of high school, I thought we would mesh well as roommates. We’ve never lived together before and overall he’s a pretty great roommate. 

The second floor of the house has three bedrooms, a bathroom and it’s own a/c system, one of the bedrooms has temporarily been transformed into its own little front room area. It’s kind of like it’s own little house up there. 
I typically just stay on the bottom floor and don’t go up there.

When my buddy asked to move in I decided to only charge him a flat rate of $550, which is like 1/3 of the mortgage. I pay for the utilities, water, garbage and internet, mow the yard and even do the dishes. He doesn’t make that much so I thought it was pretty fair.

Everything was going great until the RONA hit. After the quarantine we were at home constantly. He started using dating apps and was doing a great job of cleaning up on them. All of the sudden all these different girls started coming over constantly. It didn’t really bother me because he had his own space and it’s his right to have people over. 

However, this new girl is driving me nuts. A month and a half ago, he met this girl on tinder. They hooked up and for the next 3 days, 72 hours she lived here. First time ever meeting and she practically moves in. I was a little taken back by this, but I figured he’d take care of it.

Two weeks into her her pretty much living at my house for 12 out of the 14 days. I hear a knock on the door, I answer and the man asks for my roommate by name. I assume it’s a work friend or something so I run upstairs to let him know he has a visitor. I come to find out, that the new “visitor” is the new girls baby daddy. He apparently, found my address on her Snapchat a drive 45 minute to my house to confront my roommate that the new girlfriend was cheating on both of them. He then proceeded to stand at my front porch for the next 30 minute and tell as about his problems and his drug addiction. 

After the guy left, I had to have a talk about this with my roommate. I let him know that this was going to far and that this had to stop. Apparently, the girlfriend says that her and the baby daddy are finished and he’s crazy, but my roommate assures me that he will stop seeing her. 3 days later and they get back together. 

It’s been over 2 months now. And she has spent the night well over 40 days. It seems like she never leaves. She’s honestly constantly here. There has been multiple times where my roommates left for work and she stays here until he comes home and she stays the night again. It’s driving me up the walls. She doesn’t have her own place, she lives with her mother and daughter. I’ve brought it up on two serious talks, but I don’t think he understands what im trying to say. I’ve also found out that the crazy baby daddy has drove by the house on two other occasions to creep on my house. I personally feel like she should only be staying the night on the weekends. I also feel like he doesn’t pay enough to bring in another person to practically live here. How do I handle this situation?

687,"I (28F) was in the same school district k-12, and had a lot of the same kids in my classes in elementary school. One of them in particular was Alex (name changed). We were in the same class in Kindergarten, first grade, second grade, and third grade. 

I was a shy, reserved, and kind kid, and so was Alex. I honestly don’t remember much about those years of my life, but I remember being his desk partner for months in second grade. I remember having a huge crush on him (my first crush) and how kind and generous he was. 

After third grade, we weren’t in any of the same classes anymore through high school. We had a graduating class of 500 students, so it was pretty normal to not run into a lot of fellow students in your grade. 

Fast forward to 2014, and I was in my senior year of college living a few hours away from our home town. I heard through social media that Alex had taken his own life on my Birthday. I was saddened, but wasn’t apart of his friend group, so I didn’t hear many details or attend his funeral. 

Fast forward to now. For the last 3 nights, Alex has shown up in my dreams. He is always early 20’s (the age he was when he died). The first two nights were just random occurrences. One of them being that he showed up to my house and wanted to play Fortnite with my son and I. In my dreams I don’t acknowledge or realize that he is dead in real life. 

Then to last night’s dream. He again showed up for casual reasons, and was hanging out for a while. Then at the end of the dream he stared straight into my eyes. I felt like I was connecting with him. I don’t know if this is normal, but I don’t often feel like I make eye contact or connect with people in my dreams very deeply, but this was different. It felt like he was staring into my soul. He told me that he had to go, but to “please tell my family that I am sorry”. I woke up gasping like I was falling off the edge of my bed. 

Side note, I am an atheist, but occasionally believe in paranormal situations or the possibility of an after life. I don’t know if that makes me agnostic, but not really the point of the story. 

Anyways, here’s where I need advice. I occasionally talk to a friend who also committed suicide’s Mom. He died 10 years ago, but his Mom still enjoys knowing that his old friends are thinking of him, and enjoys when we reach out to her. 

Now I don’t know Alex’s parents. I remember them and his sister from elementary school events, but nothing beyond that. I know that they still live in the town I grew up in. 


I’m feeling compelled to write them a letter about how kind their son was in grade school, and include a picture of us together in 2nd grade that I have. I never expressed my condolences to them when he passed, so I would do that in this letter also. Here’s my question, should I include what Alex told me in my dreams? That he is doing okay and that he is sorry? I know they are fairly religious, so I don’t know if this would grant them some sort of peace? It doesn’t really feel like my place, but the randomness and vividness of my dream is making me question my own beliefs and reality. Like I am somehow being chosen to pass his message?

Anyways I try to be friendly and pleasant to everyone that I speak to. That often means I end up showing way more interest in things than I really do &amp; being as agreeable as I can just to get through the encounter with most people.

I’ve been trying my absolute hardest to avoid anything more than a work relationship with this guy because it’s just all I want, and a non-tense one at that. He’s been lowkey trying to get me to hangout for a few weeks and I’ve been able to quickly steer the convo into another direction but it won’t work much longer. I don’t want to be rude and tell this guy no and ruin our relationship but I’m  not interested in him the way he is interested in me. 

I’m a straight guy. I’m trying not to sound like a pompous ass, I promise. I get 10x more attention from gay men than I ever have from women. I hate being rude to people and run into situations with men a lot more often than I’d like. I just want to be friends with everyone. I can’t handle the bad vibes when I finally have to put my foot down with some guys. 

He’s not going to just ask me on a date they never do. It’s gonna be to “hang out” and I don’t want be a jerk sounding like I don’t want to hang out, which I don’t, but I know that it’s going to turn into a “touchy feely”  interest/endeavor for him.

I just want him to remain the cool guy I politic with at work sometimes, nothing more. I’m really not trying to talk myself up or anything I’m genuinely asking for advice. I’ve had this issue since middle school with guys and it never seems to get easier. There’s been times things have gone way too far because I was afraid to upset someone. 

I don’t want to have to quit another job due to the uncomfortable after effects of telling him I’m not interested. I like going to the convenience store in my building, I don’t want to have to avoid it.

My girlfriend and I both got new jobs in NYC mid 2019. Since moving halfway across the country and away from our friends and families she's been constantly bored. Typically, she'd go out with friends. Brunch, movies, bowling. The usual hanging out stuff. Making friends hasn't been easy since moving, and what progress was being made halted when the pandemic started. She likes dancing, but we can't really afford the ~$200 per lesson for her to do it as often as she'd like. I try to get her to take interest in my hobbies, but nothing sticks. She works in a non-essential laboratory position, and thus has very little work to do now. I'm still working from home full time.

700,"So I am in high school and throughout my life, I have worked hard to get to where I am today. I have gotten high grades and never gotten into trouble. With coronavirus, I had to get used to school online and found it every easy. I was given the invitation to national honors society, which would pave the road for me to get many scholarships so I could get a free ride in college. I filled out the forum and thats all I had to do. I sent it (or so I thought) and I never heard anything back (which is normal). All I had to do was wait till June 9th and I would know if I made it.

Turns out, I didn't. My parents freaked. In a panic, I sent emails to both leaders of the NHS, the NHS email for my school, my counselor, and an administrator. The day after, only my counselor and the administrator had gotten back and they concluded that I didn't even send the forum. They said they were going to look into it and that they would get back ASAP. Its a day later and nothing. Not even from the two heads of the NHS (from my school) who now haven't responded in two days. Now, these people should because they are teachers and the rest of my teachers during this time have almost responded instantly. My parents are now sending another email to the head principle of my school for help because we haven't heard anything.

I don't know what to do and I want to do more. Sending emails doesn't feel like I am doing anything.

TL;DR - My application for National Honors Society never went through and I wasn't accepted. This is a big deal for my family and I don't know what to do.

Edit: The reason I am so urgent is that the end of the school year is tomorrow.

701,"Basically the title. We lost my dad a few months ago. I don't think my fiance gets how hard it's going to be. Every time I bring it up, he barely replies. I'm anxious about it and it's still two weeks away. My younger siblings love him, especially my 9 year old brother, and I know they'll be disappointed he's not there.

He's never been big on family events, it's always been a source of conflict in our relationship because my family hangs out every weekend. I realize this is a lot and have gotten him out of many family events over the years but he has admittedly probably compromised more than me on this subject. However, he would always spend Father's/Mother's Day with his parents, totally fine by me because I was also not willing to give up time with my parents on those days. So that was never an issue.

I guess I hoped he wouldn't make me ask and just be thoughtful enough for just this one year to maybe hang out with his Dad on Saturday and come be with my family on what is going to be a super hard day. He's been very helpful otherwise so then it just makes me feel like I'm asking/expecting too much. But then the other part of me is like I wouldn't hesitate one second to do the same for him. But maybe that's only hindsight after experiencing losing a parent. So what do you all think?

703,So growing up Muslim I've always had to control anytime I was upset. Any action I take represented Muslims as a whole (post 2001 attack if you know you know) so while I was about the age of 8 all the kids started calling me Osama and terrorist. I didnt make many real friends until Jr. High and even then only 1 who was a snake in High School. I'm now turning 21 in July. I'm entering my last year for undergrad and I think holding all my anger and desire for revenge on those who were mean to me has made me a bitter person when I was 8 years old it was this older girl who was probs 10 or something saw my overbite and called me donkey I was so sad and upset I decided to never let anything hurt me ever again. Now I find myself distant and apathetic to others and havent made any friends in college. Or maybe they are my friends but I dont feel any kind of way. I dont know how to undo the bitterness of a 95 year old man in my 21 year old heart. Any advice at all is appreciated. Now I try to feel better but it's mostly my foundations that stop me from feeling despite my efforts.,11Jun2020,1

I don’t slack, I do my job well, and I have a solid track record to prove it.

My co-worker (in a different department) is always asking questions about how I do my job (ultimately so he can try to suggest ways for me to do my job ‘better’) He has an understanding of how my job works, but doesn’t have hands-on experience doing it. 

This bugs the shit out of me, as it feels he’s trying to downplay my years of experience. I was working in this industry before him and have way more hands-on experience. I have a solid understanding about how to do my job, and I know that I’m doing the best practices to keep our clients as happy as possible.

The job is a straightforward one, and really just requires someone to press the buttons, but does require a little bit of knowledge and know-how. To assume I’m not capable of applying my knowledge to my job, or that my knowledge is insufficient to optimize my impact is insulting to me.

I don’t know how to handle this. It drives me up the fucking wall.

725,"As a sane, normal American person, scrolling through Twitter in the last couple weeks has become this horrible, eroding exercise in anger and despair. I use Twitter for news because it seems to be the only place where center or conservative voices are even allowed to speak on issues (besides the progogandish Fox News). 

But on Twitter, I keep seeing endless tweets from endless leftist ""activists"" about how every single cop is a bloodthirsty murderer, and every person who doesn't want to burn the country to the ground is part of the giant, racist system called America. Insane people constantly screaming ""RACIST!"" at the well-adjusted members of society. The worst part of it is, that these tweets get hundreds of thousands, if not millions of likes. 

For this reason, I keep having this urge to continue scrolling through comments until I find a fellow sane person telling this person off. But of course, if that happens, the sane person is ratio-ed to death. It's all so hopelessly upsetting. I don't know why Twitter is a hotbed for these radical left wing psychopaths, but seeing the mob actively celebrate destruction, book-burning, and canceling normal people for normal behavior is driving me insane. 

I've tried to quit Twitter cold turkey for a few days, but I always come back and do the same thing all over again. I would hope that Twitter is not real life, and I could just ignore the burning hate raging through that Godforsaken app, but the sheer numbers of white/cop/America hating bigots have almost completely broken my spirit.

My stepfather (father of my 3 siblings) works a lot and is usually only home for lunch and in the morning/evening.    
    
My siblings are 3 months, 6years and 9 years old, so we got a baby, a kindergarden-child and a schoolchild.     
I'm babysitting them up to 5hours a day and also often pretty suddenly because my mom forgot about some appointment or anything else.     
Usually I babysit them 2-4 hours a day.    

The point is, that I also often cook lunch besides and clean the house.    
I do almost as much as my mom does and I'm totally fine with that, but sometimes I'm thinking about that some people get payed for this.

My parents seem to expect that I’m going to become some crazy athlete. They get angry if I try to take a rest day. They get angry if I don’t train every single day. 

They constantly talk about how I used to train multiple times a day without any rest days. They want me to go back to that. When I remember those days, the main thing I remember is always having some part of me that hurt to move.

They’re also controlling my diet. They get angry if I eat anything remotely unhealthy. They get upset if I gain weight, or if I lose weight. They have very specific times for eating.

Working out used to be something I really enjoy. But now, when I think of working out I just get this massive feeling of dread. I’ve had panic attacks before because I’m not keeping up with adults, or lifting as much as adults.

I want to enjoy working out, but with the pressure I feel, I can’t. I’ve gotten in so many fights with my parents over this, but they don’t listen to me about it. I don’t know what to do.

733,"I'm not usually a political person, but I thought i'd say my piece about a political topic two of my (in their own words) ""very left wing"" friends were discussing. We seem to agree for the most part, but I do disagree in some areas which they support; such is politics after all. From what I understand: since I don't belong to a political party (again, not usually political), i'm a centrist; which apparently is a dirty word to some?

I discussed it with one friend at first and then he suggested I talk about it with the other friend because ""he'd do a better job explaining it than \[he\] would"". So I wrote a couple paragraphs to him and said feel free to get back to me whenever because there was a lot to digest there. He responded saying he'll take a look at it and we seemed to agree that we'd probably agree to disagree in some areas.

Here's what bothers me:

While we were on discord playing games, the first friend asks the second what he thought of my argument? To which he responds ""didn't read it"" and then the first friend takes snippets from my argument and the other friend throws 1 sentence replies.  This is where I considered fighting back; but  at this point I just didn't care; I just wanted to play games with friends. I did take in some of the other friend's replies and while it does add a new perspective, it doesn't change my view on the topic.

I think this annoys me because the second friend takes such pride in ""being great at arguments"" and probably considers that moment a victory. Much how I don't see my mind changing anytime soon, I probably waste my breath trying to explain it to them. (sounded very egotistical, but hopefully you get what i mean).

There's this issue where I do not seem to emit enough assertiveness or social skills which leads to lack of respect from my peers. 

If I say something against something they call a joke, I'm a prude who doesn't understand fun. If I don't say anything, my name gets tossed around like a punching back. When I leave the conversation I get told I'm acting fragile and should grow tougher skin and man up because they don't take it seriously.

736,"For context, this guy we'll call Sam, doesn't plainly care about anyone and anything. He has so many double standards and based on that is hypocritical in many situations. So obviously with that he's hard to deal with. But, recently we've broken it off as friends and decided to fuck off as of earlier that day there was a falling out for no reason. As in a joke about their status on discord was made (status read: text me or call me and I'll remove you) and I made a joke and then was then removed. I'm not saying that's his fault. I got what I asked. But my anxiety spiked and I got worried he didn't get the joke. So Sam, in his state of mind, decides to add me back and start acting that adding me back is a luxury to me. Like his company is like meeting the king. He gets pissed at me for making the joke (understandable) and then it continues into different conversation. One asking me why I didn't ask another friend, let's call Josh, about one of his problems which I had heard from Sam. I respond with because he didn't personally tell me so I'm not gonna bring it up. He continues to push the problem and I start to get annoyed as he questions the way I think. Like he doesn't realize there's more than just his personality. And then I state it in a more harsh tone and he starts acting like those entitled parents of ""You can't speak to me like that"" or ""Do not ever talk to me in that way."" And just plainly starts being a downright dick. Given he basically states he is a dick and doesn't care but at the same time, and I hate being like this but I feel this will be said just personally to him, if you act like a dick and hypothetically speaking start complaining about being lonely and that no one is hanging out with you, don't even attempt to come and complain to me. (the previous sentence was just for scenario and me talking to Sam). Moving on, we join a call with Josh and every time he brings up something, Sam has something to say against it and Josh and I were messaging back and forth secretly as Sam took up all the time for conversation as we listened to his life problems and didn't let us speak at all other than in response to him. And when Josh comes to my rescue when Sam criticizes something of my actions (putting my Animal Crossing house on the top of the island) saying that ""She can do whatever she wants"", Sam gets pissed. So like, when you (Sam) get criticized you hate it but when you get stood up to for criticizing others you get pissed? Also, Josh mentioned a problem his friend had but just simplified it and I won't lie I wanted to know along with Sam but I didn't want to invade any privacy of his friend as said previously I'd rather they tell me personally so I stopped. But Sam proceeded to push until I had to shut him up with as you guessed, he got pissed at. Later on in conversation, we had some questions and they all pissed him off. And then that's when we decided ""fuck this I'm out of this."" and cut it off. Before that though, he proceeds to exclaim how HIS advice to me about not taking shit from others is working finally. And adds a SO SWEET ""for once"" at the end. He tells me I was only there to fill his time and then eventually in that night, we stopped and I blocked him. So moving on to my question. I am close to two moderators of the server both he and I are in. He's not as prominent with them as I am but I so badly want to tell them and get him kicked and booted before he starts up any shit. Should I abuse my relationship with the mods to kick the one guy I hate the most or should I just let it go?",11Jun2020,2
737,"For a little background, I made my first mom friend almost 2 years ago now and I have been so thankful for her as it’s hard to find friends as a young mom (I’m 22 and most girls my age are well, being 22 year olds). I realized that it’s also the first friendship I’ve had that hasn’t felt one sided, so it’s been nice.

A few months ago she told me that her and her fiancé were separating as he was starting to form a drinking habit and had apparently gotten physical with her. I consoled her and assured her that I was here for her and her son whenever they needed me. After she explained the situation, she told me she was actually more relieved and happy to be away from him (as opposed to hurting and stressed) and that she would be moving back in with her mom. Her mom lives close to my house so I assumed I would be seeing her more again once she got settled (she moved 30 minutes away about a year ago so her fiancé could be closer to his work, and this put a strain on seeing her on a regular basis). 

Anyway, last time I actually spent time with her was on her 21st birthday celebration in May (it was just dinner with her mom and her son, nothing crazy), but since then I have bumped into her at her work twice (local grocery store near my house). I’ve texted her twice since her birthday to make sure she was okay and that I was worried about her because we hadn’t been talking much. She never responds but when I see her in person, she acts like everything is normal between us. I was skeptical but was trying not to take it personal as I know she was going through a lot as far as moving back in with her mom and working with all this Covid-19 craziness going on (I figured maybe she just forgot to text back). Although now I am beginning to wonder if I did do something wrong because she’s been on Instagram, viewing my stories and posting pictures with other friends since my last text I sent to her, so she’s obviously ignoring my texts, right? I’m wondering if I should text her a third time... 

The last text I sent said this:

“Hey, are we okay? I haven't really heard from you since your birthday and I can't help but feel like it's personal, like something I did or said? I've just been wondering how you're doing because I miss you and been wondering if you're okay, so I thought I would reach out again”.

I can't come close to understanding the things he's studying so I can't help there, so I was thinking about doing something else like maybe putting together a care package with some caffeine drinks and snackies and such.

748,"Hi guys, I work for a coffee shop and have so since September. Beforehand, I used to work at an indoor trampoline park. Whenever I had free time, like now in the summer, I work more hours because I need the money for college. 

However, whenever I work more hours I feel like shit all the time. I don't work 40 hours, more like 20-30 hours a week now for summer, but I feel tired and emotionally numb after a few hours into my shift or even after work. 

Its usually because talking to customers for hours on end while finishing transactions is socially exhausting. If I do bar (making drinks) my carpal tunnel acts up and my arms and hands hurt. I feel physically exhausted and a weekend doesn't help how tired I feel. 

I get upset when Im trying my best at work but I'm told I should put more effort to do better. (Like quicken drive thru times, or to sound more enthusiastic.) It makes me feel more worthless and sad because I'm already trying my best and I get stressed very easily multitasking.

Than her gf who was a the short lady with bleached blond hair said we want you to give us a baby. I laughed it off and ask what are they really here for thinking I may have been pranked. At this time I also had a gf. The blonde lady said no we realy want a baby and she put the manila folder on the counter and told me to count it and while I was counting it she said all of that can be yours there was 6gs in the folder.

Basically my mom is doing this candida diet thingy and I figured I might as well do it with her. I’ve basically only been eating one or two light salads a day this whole week. Right now it’s been 22ish hours since I’ve eaten and I love how it feels? Like I’m kinda spacey and am having trouble reading books but I can read fine on my phone.

I know it’s unhealthy but I feel so proud of myself for not eating, I’ve never felt this way before. 

My heart is racing and I sat down a while ago and my legs went immediately numb so I realize I should probably eat soon but should I like talk to my therapist about this?

758,"So earlier today me and my best friend were hanging out at her house, when we decided to go outside and enjoy the nice weather. On our way out my friend got her bike from the shed where her parents keep all their supplies and stuff like that. Me being the ADHD ridden person I am, I noticed a spray paint like bottle with a long straw nib. I asked her if it was spray paint and she said no. Then i asked if I could spray it somewhere to find out what it was. We sprayed a tiny bit on the concrete in the shed.

A couple hours later we came back to the shed to keep and bike and we noticed that the mark had disappeared so we assumed it was just a water based thing. She said it might be bicycle oil and that it was probably harmless. 

I decided to try and be “funny”, so i took it and wrote in big letters “Suck My Balls” on the driveway in front of the house, thinking that  it would melt away in an hour or the rain would wash it away (we live in Norway so it rains every other day). We both had a good laugh about it and went inside.

When I was already home my friend called me frantically saying that the neighbors were very upset about the vandalism and that when they had tried to remove it, it didn’t work. We were both stressed out and for around 4 hours after that I had to talk her and her parents into not contacting my mom. We agreed on me cleaning it up after school tomorrow, and that if I didn’t manage, my mom would be contacted.

They said that if she were contacted she would have to pay for the damage, which is from 300,000kr to 500,000kr ($31 000 to $52 000). My mom is a single mother who can not afford to pay for this. If she finds out she will sell all my devices and I will be forced to quit all my after school activities to be able to afford it. I’m also starting what you would call High School after break, so without any activities or devices at a new school I will probably be socially isolated.


How will I be able to remove the stain from the asphalt before tomorrow, and how will I stop my mom from doing all of those things if she finds out?

Usually dinner is done or almost done by the time the men get home. I am employed full time but am on paid leave because our 3 children are out of school. All that is important to the story... 
Anyways, my sister decided she wanted the kitchen as her daily responsibility. However, she wouldn’t clean the kitchen until 11am then wouldn’t touch it again before work and I would end up doing. I had a long talk and told her if she doesn’t want to clean the kitchen every day then she can pay for a maid cuz I’m not one. She then told me she was going to pay $50 a week to me if she doesn’t have to clean the kitchen every day. Fine! I told her. A month went by and I realized that yes, she’s paying $50 a week but she leaves her laundry (which she washes separately) in the washer n dryer until I finish it because I have mine and my children’s and husbands laundry to do.

763,"Trigger warning: this post may upset some people (I don’t think it will but still)
(15f)

I think I’ve always had a problem with eating, when I was little I used to barely eat but that was just because I thought eating was boring. I was a very hyper child. 

But since then, I’ve grown and eaten better. But that just caused issues with my head about my weight and my figure and that sort of stuff. 

Since the school closures due to the whole pandemic, I’ve had to spend most of my days in my room doing the work I would’ve been doing at school. This has caused me to forget about eating, which honestly I’m not bothered about. 

I have been eating, just snacks and that, it’s just that my parents don’t see me eating them because they don’t really check up on me in my room. 

However, my parents have started to notice that I’m not eating as much and they bring me up meals now. This is fine and I appreciate that they care but it’s making me put on weight. I can’t push a plate away because I feel it’s disrespectful, but on the other hand I can’t keep eating like this.

I realise how I’m writing it makes it sound like I’m ungrateful for my family caring, but it’s also affecting my mental health. 

It’s affecting my head in that I’ve started doing things I’m not proud of, in the toilet.

I don’t know what kind of advice I’m asking for but I need consolidation that I’m in the right and that them forcing me to eat is gonna affect me more than just letting me eat when I’m hungry.",11Jun2020,0

776,"I (22F) graduated from college last year. I was doing a pretty niche degree so the class was small and I was close with one of my professors Rick (39M). I had a tiny crush on him but it was never anything more than a bit of light flirting between us that I thought was all in my own head - I felt like he’d always make eye contact with me quite intensely and one time a classmate said he sensed some sexual tension between us, but that’s it. 

Anyway, shortly after graduation he happened to add me on a few social medias (he didn’t add any other classmates) and initiated meeting up for coffee a few times. He asked for my number and we began texting. It was really informal and sometimes I thought it could be borderline flirty, like not really inappropriate but I couldn’t imagine him showing them to his wife you know? It was mostly a few negging comments and suggestive emojis from him. 

I’ve been dating my boyfriend Jack (30M) for a few months now and Jack is super critical of Rick and thinks I’m being groomed, as (in his words) I’m “super conventionally attractive”. I’ve never felt uncomfortable with Rick and he’s got a wife and kid so I really don’t think he’s trying to initiate anything but maybe I’m wrong? 

I don’t know what to do - Jack wants me to cut him out completely but in my mind I don’t really see anything that warrants cutting him out, and if I did I just know it’d be awkward because Rick would eventually ask why I was ghosting him/removing him from social media and the thought of having to insinuate it’s because of something inappropriate between us is just super embarrassing. He’d think I was delusional.

I’ve just got to a point where I don’t know what’s weird and what’s not weird. I don’t speak to Rick regularly at all but he’ll occasionally text me if something reminds him of me. So it’s not like we interact that often. Can anyone shed some light on if this situation with Rick is kinda sus or if Jack is being irrational?",11Jun2020,0

Yet, I made the big mistake for thinking transferring is the only option to have a fresh start. I was planning to meet new people and make new friends. It was such a great idea but later my mother had told me that the school's doesn't allow the graduating students to transfer anymore since they will have a hard time processing my papers due to Covid. I understand that and they say they will also be online schooling for the whole year (Which is eh? Not fine.) I hate online schooling because I can't interact with class's group chat or projects. I never talk to them in chat, ever! And I guess they know that too and will think of me as a hindrance because I don't cooperate well.

795,"Hi, everyone. Apologies if this is a bit long or if the formatting isn't great - I'm on mobile.

Okay so my sister (29 F) ended an engagement almost a year ago with someone who was lazy, had no motivation, and generally just wasn't going anywhere in life and had no desire to. After having fun for a little while and seeing a couple different people she got together with her current boyfriend (33 M). They've been together for about 6 months now and she recently moved in with him.

She seems very happy with him and my fiancé (30 M) and myself (24 F) go over every weekend to spend time with them. It's been such a refreshing change to see her happy with someone who has treated her like a queen. I noticed that every time we came over he was consuming very large quantities of alcohol. He would pour himself a vodka and Powerade and the glass would be half full with vodka. I said something to her about 2 months ago mostly out of concern. She told me that before they met he used to have a painkiller addiction and is now sober from that, but he's been drinking a decent amount because he's depressed. His mom is slowly dying from terminal cancer.

She had a discussion with him about it and he agreed to slow down. He hasn't. Over quarantine his drinking has gotten heavier and heavier. He was supposed to return to work this past Monday and couldn't due to my sister having to bring him to the emergency room for dehydration from said alcohol consumption.

He hasn't had a drink since Sunday because he wants to stop and is supposed to return to work this upcoming Monday. None of us were aware of the extreme amount he was consuming because my sister is out of the house about 10 hours a day for work. We did know that it was a lot, but we've now found out it was upwards of 50 shots per day. He is in withdrawals which is to be expected.

My sister doesn't know much about withdrawals, etc. I told her that she needs to keep a very close eye on him because alcohol withdrawals are extremely dangerous (and potentially deadly) and that he should wean off instead of going cold turkey. I also brought up the possibility of detox which he doesn't want to go to. Since Monday his withdrawals have gotten much worse. It started with restlessness and generally feeling sick. It then went to constant shaking. He is now having full blown paranoid hallucinations.

He is texting her (she's at work) about how people are in his house hiding and want to punish him in some way as karma. None of it makes any sense. She called me asking for advice and I said he needs to get to the hospital but she needs to be extremely careful because he could get violent. She's leaving work right now to deal with it. I'm waiting to see what happens and offered to come over to assist and told her that if she needs to call 911 that she should.

I guess I'm just asking for advice on how I can help her and be there for her to guide her through the journey to come. I also would love some advice on how to try to help him - he's a grown adult and can refuse treatment. I think he is just now starting to see just how bad his problem is. This entire situation sucks. He's such a genuinely great guy. What can I do to encourage him to get help? How can I help her get through this? It's consuming her and she's extremely worried, rightfully so. It's preventing her from doing what she needs to do on a daily basis. I hate to see them feeling this way. Thank you for reading this far and for any and all help that I receive.",11Jun2020,1
797,"Many of these stem from my father and while I have recently started to become firm with him by saying ""don't yell at me or speak to me that way,"" ""otherwise I won't do xyz youre asking me to do,"" his other commentary towards me is very diminishing.

He can never do wrong, though.

For example they will say ""I like this idea but I don't understand how this element will work"", whereas this particular individual instead types paragraphs of ""we shouldn't do this because x,y,z and it won't work. We should avoid this"". 

If this were a once in a while thing, I'd be fine with it, but his constant conscientiousness, particularly the way he words it, slows down processes to a grinding halt.   


Now, I know a key to leadership is being open to these questions and to conversations I'd rather not have. I get that, I want to be able to do that, but this is the third year in a row I'm dealing with it (second as his superior), and I'm starting to lose my mind a little.

Any advice?",11Jun2020,1
800,"I just passed all of my classes last month at community college and my grandma just told me that if I am not going to continue my education, then I must get a job. I really dont want to go to a university as I don't want to take out student loans and be in student debt, as that is one of my biggest fears. So, the only option is to get a job but that is not a good idea considering the Coronavirus thing and I live in Chicago, so....yeah. She has given me plenty of time to decide and she will let me know, but I still don't know what to do.

Happened 2 days ago after my shift. I work as a chef at a pub and have felt I am over worked and underappreciated for years.

It felt unfair as all my coworkers are making more money then me by being able to stay on CERB and only working a shift or two a week. I eventually snapped and rage quit. Am I fucked?

807,"Hi, so I have some really good internet friends. Ironically we met on a roblox game a couple years ago, and since then we’ve been pretty inseparable. People have come and gone but me, this girl and two other guys have always stayed close. I know what all of them look like and where they live, how old they are- (the biggest age gap is 2 1/2 years so no big age difference) and we call so much. It honestly makes me so grateful that I have a really good friend group that I’m 100% comfortable with, and they’re also the ones that I came out to as bisexual first. They remember my birthday when irl friends don’t, you catch my drift? my point is that we’re crazy close, but all this time their parents have been fine with it and seen pictures of us but my parents refuse to believe anyone on the internet isn’t a rapist. I understand that they want to keep me safe, but as a teenager that is (what i would consider) decently mature, and know about these risks, it’s quite frustrating to know that they don’t trust me online. I’m tired of pretending they’re people they’re not to my parents, and I feel bad lying to them about who they are. How can I sit them down and introduce my internet friends without them getting angry? I was thinking I could call them and they could say hi, but what do you think?",11Jun2020,1
808,"As the title says, I am fairly confident, but not 100% certain, that my aunt (my mums sister) is my biological mother. I won’t bore you all with too much detail, but I’ll try to summarise, as I really need some input on this. 

I’ve probably thought this for about 10 years, my aunt and I are very similar, almost scarily, yet I’m nothing like my mum. I know with genes sometimes it just works that way but there are other factors too. For example, she left town just after I was born, and she’s never returned here, the tag they put on a babies wrist at birth has her family )my mums maiden) name and not my mums, even though my mum was married to my dad at the time and normally its the mother admitted hospital name. There are so many more peculiar instances, examples or stories that I could share but this next thing is what’s pushed me over the edge...

I recently got given free access to a birth registry and there’s register of a birth a few days before mine with my first name spelt incorrectly but with our family name. my first name is unusual in the UK and my family name is rare. It’s so rare, that I know every person on the list with that surname born in the last 50 years, so I would know if there was another person born the same age as me. 

Here lies my problem; I don’t want to outright ask my mum or my aunt. The upset that may cause is too much for them to take. I don’t mind causing that once I know for sure, but what if I’m wrong. So, what do I do? I could do a DNA test, but I’d need my aunts consent. I can’t do it without her knowledge that’s unethical and illegal apparently. But should I do that? 
I’ve always though maybe one of them will tell me as the years pass by. But now I’m getting to the point of frustration. What do I do? You know when you’re so far in a situation you can’t see it for what it is, well I’m not seeing it, please help me.",11Jun2020,6
810,"it's been almost a year since he broke up with me. throughout the months, we've talked occasionally about things and it's my understanding that he felt like our relationship was just taking a toll on him emotionally and it wasn't where he wanted to be in life. he finished off by saying that he didn't want to talk anymore because he wanted to forget about us, and then a few months later he was in a relationship. i didn't find out about this till a few months ago when we started talking again. he said that we needed time apart to move on, but that he's glad now we can be friends, he only wants to talk once in a while and not very often. 

i'm having a lot of trouble coming to terms with this. i've played the role of a friend because i don't want him to think i'm still hung up on him because it seems like he's moved on, but i just hate hearing that he's happier with her. the most he said in favour of me was that i was the most attractive girlfriend he's had and that he never opened up to anyone as much as to me, but i just hate thinking about how he once loved me and now he doesn't, and he loves her more. He introduced her to his friends, he makes playlists for her, he talks about how he's so excited to do all these things with and for her, how he loves her, and i just hate that he never made such a commitment to me, he always held back a little, i feel like i wasn't good enough to be loved fully by him. I want to be happy for him, he should be with whoever he wants to be with, but i'm just angry. i'm angry that he seemed to move on so easily and that i can't stop thinking about him. 

how do i move on? how do i stop comparing myself to her and how i wasn't enough for him but she is? why am i still thinking about him? i have moments where i'm not thinking of him at all, but then sometimes i can't help myself but check up on him and remember how he's happier without me",11Jun2020,1

Couple of months later, she asks him a favor to buy something, in which in return he asked that she would pay with a makeout session.

I am having a baby with my boyfriend of three years, and we plan to spend our lives together.
However, engagement now is on his mind, and on the line. As a kid, I knew I never wanted to get married, because I learned people can have the greatest relationship and suddenly when they get married, its like “nope!” And they leave eachother. I never seen one good marriage in my life. Even my parents, still together after marriage 8 years now, but my mom just recently told me shes been having an affair for 5 years..... on the other hand, my boyfriend always wanted to be married, and now that we are having a baby, and all of his brothers as well, and they all plan to get engaged by next year. Im so afraid of marriage and what it will do to us. I dont want marriage and never have, I never imagined myself walking down an aisle or ever looked at dresses. Im not afraid of the commitment, I’m afraid of him leaving me after marriage because theres so reason where people have great relationships then shitty marriages. 
Im in love with my boyfriend, and all my friends are at the stage of engagement and its scaring me. I dont want my boyfriend breaking up with me because I wont marry, and I dont wanna talk to him about it because I am afraid he will break up with me. Or, I dont want him to think I dont love him, hes the greatest person in my life and I love him with my whole heart.

They can't seem to understand why I don't meet my friends which I supposedly have. I never mention my friends and never invite them over because.... well, I don't have any. I had a friend a year and a half ago but it ended because he made other friends and started to gradually ignore me for them. The same has happened with previous friendships and I've been lonely for the past year and a bit. What they don't seem to understand is that I don't have any friends despite it being very explicit. I want to tell them that but based on how their current attitude, they will say that it is because I was antisocial with them and they stopped being friends with me because of that, or that I am not being social enough to make friends, niether of which is not the case. My brother has loads of friends, does really well in school and has a girlfriend and he chooses to completely ignore me but when my mum is criticising me for not having a social life, he is right by her side ready to agree with her.

I’m also immune compromised and the majority of my house is at risk of catching COVID.

818,"Some intro about my mother; she is narcissistic, emotionally manipulate, a true definition of a Bitch, she lies so much yet she loves to call me the lying one and always says how she ""has zero trust for me"", she gaslights me a lot, she deflects responsibility and deflects blame on me for everything, she plays the victim card the second she gets the chance to, and I am starting to get extremely tired of all of her bullshit.

My mother has been acting this way for as long as I really remember, but it got even worse when my dad passed away, but the best part is, I didn't even know that her behavior was ""bad"" or ""abusive"" until I met my boyfriend around 5 months ago, and he just opened my eyes about everything because he himself experienced something similar with his mother although even her case isn't as bad as mine. 

So far I'm just planning on trying or starting a more independent lifestyle while still living with her until I can pack my bags and move to live with my boyfriend, though I'm having a hard time with it because of my severe social anxiety, on top of a lot of other things that are currently undiagnosed and untreated because of my mothers lack of understanding the importance of mental health. I've have self harmed in the past and the reason I started to is because for at least 2 years in a row I would tell my mother about my struggles and issues and of course she told me to brush it off because I'm young and I can't be depressed or ""crazy"" (her words), and it really had to get to the point of her finding out about my scars for her to say that she will 'eventually' take me to a therapist [which to that, I asked her if she could take me to a psychiatrist but she said those doctors are for ""crazy people"" and not for me] and before someone says ""oh, she actually said that she will get you help"", no she won't, what she does now is she just uses this as a way to pressure me into doing things the way she wants them done and if I don't listen to her then ""youre not getting any help"". 

It got even worse when I kinda told her about my boyfriend [ I lied and said it was a female friend that I met online for my and my boyfriend's sake, I had to tell her because she heard me talk with someone all the time and thought I was insane] because now she blames him for literally anything that I do, which to be fair, I know I've changed after I met him but in a good way, because I've learnt how my mother actually is, I've matured a lot, and of course my mother wouldn't like it because now I know what kind of piece of shit of a person she is and I actively go against her and do as I want, but to her its the classic ""that person changed you for the worst"" which I've even heard her say about my friends before but she says she ""never said that"". I can see how she is becoming very jealous of my boyfriend in the sense that I pay waaay less attention to her and I make it very obvious, and she loves attention, and its getting to the point of where she is threatening to cut off my WiFi in my room so that I wouldn't ""have fun"". 

She's also threatening to sell my cat, going off on her excuse, how I'm too insane to handle a cat, she has threatened to kick me out or make me move to live with my grandad who is also abusive, told me to never eat anything because she is the one paying for the food etc etc.

My biggest problem is the fact that I still love her [I don't mean respect, I have no respect for her because she doesn't for me] and I feel guilty quite often even though I know I shouldn't because I don't do anything wrong. She doesn't realize she is manipulative or abusive, she is so oblivious to it because no one taught her any better and no one probably ever will. She has this dumb complex in her mind that makes her think that she deserves more respect because she is older and is my mother, which also includes how she can curse me out and I ""shouldn't be mad because she's my mother and she is allowed to"" but when I do the same she cries and yells and etc. 

Either way, the jist of it is I have no clue how to deal with her. Boyfriend constantly tells me to not pay attention to her cries, but its hard because I feel trapped both mentally and physically by her, she can do some petty shit to me, which includes not buying food or giving me money to get food or constantly threatening me and all of that stuff.

823,"so its a bit of a long story, my brother is 17 I'm 23f, I moved across the country from my family but close to my grandparents. I'm not perfectly mentally healthy but I've been working on it, going to a psych once a week and I have grown immensely, I'm doing really good. although I do have a host of issues including depression, mild autism, a heart problem, and a degenerative genetic physical problem that isn't bad now but could get really bad at any time impeding my ability to walk/function

&amp;#x200B;

my brother is pretty depressed/suicidal (has been since he was 2) and mildly autistic. he's a good kid and I love him a lot. he loves chickens, being outside, old music, and he's a real clothes horse lol. he just got kicked out of his special boarding school and I'm thinking of offering for him to come live here. its a 15-minute bike ride or a 7-minute drive to a high school, a 15-minute drive to a good psych and a good college, an hour and a half to my grandparent's farm, and an hour and a half drive to a city that would have good doctors/support.

I figure if he comes live with me instead of my parents he would have enough time to qualify for in-state tuition for the college that I go to, would be able to bond with our elderly grandparents before its too late/ work on the farm (he enjoys that kind of stuff) and have access to good doctors plus I have chickens and he is like the chicken king he loves chickens. also living here has really helped my mental health a lot and I figure it would help him. and of course, I really miss the brat

if I offer it first I would get my parents and him to visit and see my set up before asking the question.

&amp;#x200B;

now the downsides, I worry that taking care of a special needs/rambunctious teenager might be too much for my mental health and I might backslide or he could backslide and I'm not sure I'm physically strong enough to stop him if he tries to kill himself again. also, money is tight and I would have to ask my parents for financial help for him if I take him in, I don't really want that because they tend to take that as ownership and I don't want anyone but me to have a claim to my space/life. I would get a job since I have to skip next semester anyway but I do need to go back to college at some point and that might be tricky with him. also, I want to make sure this is the best thing for both of us before I offer it. he lived with my sister a bit to be closer to a good school and it was an unmitigated disaster and wound up with him being so suicidal that he had to go to a special school that he is now getting kicked out of. and I'm not sure my mom will want to let him go again. also, my mom is mildly homophobic and he is pan, so it might be good for him to live somewhere more accepting.

I'm compiling a list of resources (my psych is asking around) and looking into schools to make sure this is a good idea and thinking really hard about it and I'm not mentioning it to my parents or anyone (i talked to my psych about it and I'm making this post but other than that no one knows I'm thinking about it) till I'm sure I can handle it but I think it would be good for him, plus the cheaper tuition when he goes to college, he wants to be an engineer. I was planning on offering to let him live with me if he wanted to go to my college or just live with me for a few months and chill when he turned eighteen and got out of his school  to figure out what he wanted to do with his life but now I'm thinking about this plan

Now my Cat, Thor he's one of the older ones and he's kinda the alpha of the other cats. At first he didn't car about this new cat but I think he is trying to establish some sort of control over her. But she's an outside cat who doesn't take any shit so she'll set herself up in a corner and make a stand there. On three separate occasions she has scratched his face. Twice on his nose and now right underneath his eye. Thankfully his nose doesn't look that scarred but this last one right under his eye really got me pissed off.

Each time my mom just says ""Oh well he was probably doing something to her so he deserved it"". But you know what he doesn't deserve to have his fucking eye taken out by this damn cat. I told her this and she just kinda took it in silence and kept doing what she was doing. But she's probably going to wait until im not upset anymore and push it under the rug. The cat loves my mom and she's a sweety and get's along well enough with the other cats except Thor. But I just want this damn cat gone before she does some permenent damage.

828,"Skip to the final paragraph if you don't feel like reading.

Backstory: While raising my sister (F24) and I (M22), my dad always did his best to make sure we were smart and interested in science. On long car rides he would talk to us about things like space and quantum physics and over the years we learned countless little bits from various fields of science from him. He would even read us stories from a mythology book before we went to bed, showing us that there exist and existed multiple religions which ultimately resulted in my becoming an atheist at a very young age.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout school I had always planned on pursuing science into university and then the rest of my life but things didn't turn out that way. Since I became an atheist around let's say age 10 I developed a horrible fear of death. Throughout my whole life since then I've gone through periods of depression and anxiety where I'd have regular panic attacks whenever I'd think of death. At the end of 11th grade and into 12th grade it got the worst it had ever been.

&amp;#x200B;

Half way through my senior year of high school it got so bad that I was having panic attacks every day. Even just seeing old people at the mall triggered me because it reminded me that I was going to get old as well. I only had two states: feeling nothing at all and being absolutely terrified. This all lead to a complete lack of motivation and effort in school. Most of my math and science courses were in the second semester but I dropped them all in favour of easy classes that I could cruise through despite my lack of motivation and effort. Eventually, I had an episode during an assembly for prom, a teacher followed me into the bathroom and it all spilled out. They told all my teachers, my parents (they kind of knew but not really since they were always at work when I got home from school) and I got the help I needed. I still have small panic attacks every so often but for the most part I'm fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my sister and I are both finished university. She's a chemical engineer and I'm... working in a factory with a degree in French that I don't want to do anything with. After abandoning math and science in high school I thought that was it for me. I screwed it up. This is my life now. I've always been jealous of my sister and my friends in science programs, I have tremendous respect for all of them. I kept telling myself ""you'll go back to school when you're stable"" but I've always known that I didn't want to wait that long. I've realized recently that if I want to lead a life I'm proud of I need to get it done now. I've decided I want to go back to school for engineering but here are some issues I need help with:

&amp;#x200B;

First, my dad paid for my tuition in university so I couldn't possibly ask him to help with a program that's practically twice as expensive. What are some ways I can pay for things myself? I know people have done this on their own before and I'm not worried. Second, how do I even bring this up to my dad? I changed programs in university three times and my plans for when I leave my factory job are constantly changing as well. How do I get him to believe that this really is what I want to do?  Third, In high school I only completed grade 11 bio, physics, and math and grade 12 chemistry. Are there any resources I can use to refresh my knowledge from high school math and science? Do I have to catch up on grade 12 math and physics or are there schools that will take me regardless (I'm in Canada and staying here)? 

Any help you guys can offer is so helpful and I'm very appreciative.",11Jun2020,2
829,"so I've had this online friend for 2 months now and we've grown pretty close, at some point I left the group that I met her in because they kept making me mad and sad and I was done with their bs, now I only talk to the online friend (let's call her Anne) and she keeps reminding me of them and that's also making me kinda sad, then we have no time to talk and she keeps being dry and I don't know if I'm being selfish or something, it's not like we're dating or something I don't edate but like I don't like it whenever she's with them, and that makes me mad so I was thinking of blocking her just to leave them all, and I asked her if she'll be sad and she said yes and I asked how sad she kept ignoring the question so now I'm confused, I don't wanna do this because it'll make her sad but she makes me sad, what do I do",11Jun2020,1

831,"I live in the USA, me and my friend are both 17 year old. (age doesnt matter in friendships tho im sure all ages have ran into issues and i need advice from everyone)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My friend said he did not want to be friends anymore cuz a fight so we went a month without talking and he apologized and we made up. Then i got scammed and as i was freaking out he was just laughing at me making fun of me, and also, he was talking to me about this one girl and made it seem like she was talking crap about me so then i was talking crap about her, 

then he got mad because there friends, when me and her have known each other longer and use to be friends, and defended her, but me and him are bros, and he told her what i said, and she hit me up saying ""whatcha gotta say about me"" so i was just honest because i dont like drama and cutt him off for being fake and doing that, if were both friends with him he shouldve just stayed out of it. Then he calls me and i didnt see if so i ignored it, next day he calls me again, and we talked and it seemed normal so i was nice, i only anwsered becuase i thought he wanted to talk to me about it so i wanted to tell him, 

&amp;#x200B;

but he was just talking and telling me he was grinding on a game, so i was just being nice helping him before i went to do my workouts and mod him money and he found out i blocked him, i never blocked his number just incase something happened. But is it really my fault? he told me he just told her i was salty, and when i asked her if it was about him she said it wasnt, when i know its him because i never talked bad about her.

&amp;#x200B;

 I just feel bad because he randomly hits me up to get on and play with him but also i sell social media growth and for his birthday i have him aton of views like 200k for free, and he was going to post me on snapchat to get me attention and sales, but never did, which i agree with because people mightve known he botted, but then he goes on saying i bot for clout and acting like hes better than me which i dont bot for clout everyone knows i bot i dont hide it, and i told him that and he still didnt believe me, so i ignored him and he apolozied. But what do you guys think? Am I in the wrong? (sorry for all the spelling and grammar errors IK)",11Jun2020,1

834,"A total stranger messaged me over facebook the other day and is threatening to come perform a citizen's arrest on me, kill me, literally shoot me full of drugs and kidnap me, and plenty of other threats. He is 100% not all there mentally, and his own facebook page is full of the same deranged language. I thought he was just mentally handicapped and harmless at first, but I did some research, and it turns out his ex girlfriend says he dangerous and she had to run away from him and needed to involve the law to stop him from hunting her and their child down. He's been arrested twice for criminal trespass, and he's had three separate no-contact orders issued to him. From what I've seen, he is a violent stalker and I believe he will at least try to find me and hurt me. He doesn't have my address though. I feel silly for getting ahold of his police department and essentially saying ""this guy is saying mean things on facebook,"" but he's demonstrated that he means what he says and will follow up. I've called the non-emergency police line before and they kind of just blew me off, probably because it did sound silly. What do I do?",11Jun2020,1
836,"So there are a lot of factors at play here. The gist is this: I'm pregnant and living in a group home for pregnant and parenting young adults. There are 2 other people living here and employees that work here and watch the house.

We are currently on lockdown, but the employees are still able to cycle in and out everyday, and are able to go anywhere they want. Most of them have second jobs that they go to.  But the clients aren't allowed to leave.

My birthday is on Sunday, so for the past few days I have been thinking of a way to ask to let my mom take me for the weekend. She is driving 5 hours to be here for my birthday, I haven't seen her in 3 months, and I won't see her again until she comes up to prepare for labor. I told them today that she is coming up from San Antonio (I'm in Dallas) and they immediately replied ""She can sit on the porch."" I had a few points I was going to use to convince them to let me go but after she said that I started crying and couldn't speak.

So the B-plot here is that today they called me down and told me one of the moms is going to be staying in her room all weekend, and we are not allowed to use the same bathroom as her or go near her. I also saw her sanitizing all of her stuff and she was walking around the house with a face mask. They also called her daughter's daycare and asked them to take her temperature. So you can see what's happening here. This same girl has been going to work for the last few weeks, while the other two of us have been staying inside.

The past week my chronic rhinitis has been acting up and I've been having trouble breathing and coughing up blood (this is something I've experienced in the past but has been happening more frequently. the shortness of breath is because my uterus is pushing up against my lungs.) They know that I've been experiencing this. 

So I think this is completely unreasonable. I KNOW my mom has been quarantining because she is cautious of COVID too. I think if they are quarantining this girl until she gets tested, I should have the right to leave until I know it's safe to be here. All of the other reasons I wanted to leave on top of that.

I'm not planning on going out anywhere, and I'm planning to be cautious because as I said, I'm 7 months pregnant and the last thing I want is to catch a virus, especially when I'm already having respiratory problems.

Shortly after our ""conversation"" the lady came and told me that after my mom comes (to sit on the porch after driving for 5 hours) that I can't have any visitors at all.

What should I do?! I need to see my mom, I've had a horrible few months and I just want to get away from this place (there are a LOT of reasons I can't stand to be here. I'm treated like dog shit by some of the staff.) I know that they have rules in place for COVID but I think all of this is completely unreasonable. I thought it was dangerous to send that girl back to work in the first place, and I turned out to be right about that. Help!",11Jun2020,1

838,"So I applied for an internship this summer that would be done remotely and I got a call on Tuesday night. I wasn’t able to take it so the person (let’s name her Kelly) left a voice message to call back to see if I was still interested in taking the internship. It was so late at night that I found out she left a message so I didn’t call back because obviously, no one would be around to pick up the phone. 

The next day on Wednesday, I called back and asked for the specific person who called me. Unfortunately, it wasn’t her who picked up the phone but I guess a co-worker who said that Kelly was in a meeting at that moment. The co-worker asked for my phone number and would let Kelly know. I was going to ask what time should I expect Kelly’s phone call but I realized that it was rude for an applicant to ask that. 

I waited all day. Six hours later, no one called back. I called again using Kelly’s extension but no one picked up so I left a voice message, saying that this is about the internship and that she called last Tuesday night and to call me back on Thursday and that I would be available all day. 

Now it’s Thursday and I am awaiting their phone call. It’s so infuriating that they are doing this. First, they call me, instructing me to call back. Then I did the following day, and the specific person wasn’t available cuz she was in a meeting. I was expecting her to call me later that day but the phone didn’t ring. Like for heaven’s sake, if you call somebody and you tell them to call back and they do the next day but you weren’t available, then call them ASAP. Don’t make them goddamn wait for a day. 

Should I continue to wait or should I call one more time? Cuz I am getting impatient.",11Jun2020,1

Looking for help with a future MA in mental health counselling. I'm to create a piece of literature / resource around mental health and want to create a somewhat journal with anecdotes of peoples mental health experiences, as you know this can come in any shape and size.  
Alot of people feel they're the only one going through their circumstances and makes them feel entrapped but I know it helped for me knowing I'm not alone and people are out there who've had similar experiences. 

This 'journal' is aiming to be around 50 - 100 stories of peoples different experiences with 1/2/3 pictures that relate to the story or what helped you get through those tough times. I know this won't be for everyone and people can be self-conscious around opening up so it will be completely anonymous (with the photos being reproduced in a minimalist style with no facial features) and me and a team will keep you constantly updated. 

If you're interested in helping please email my team:  
letstalkaboutthatinfo@gmail.com  
include a description of your experiences (a short story if possible) and attach photos that are connected, again anonymity is my main priority and I don't want anyone to be out of their comfort zone. 

Your help would be massively appreciated, please share this around if possible and the more stories we can share the more we can possibly help. Any more questions please ask! I look forward to working with you.

845,"For context, I (15f) had a fight with my friend/crush (16m). Let's call him Tom. Tom rejected me a few nights ago and told me that he had a crush on another girl that lives very far away from our city. He asked me to keep it secret, but if I were to vent to someone, I had to make sure they didn't know the girl/they weren't directly involved with the situation and that I obscured as much information as possible.

I did those things, but unbeknownst to me, while I was texting a good friend about how I was a bit upset about the situation with Tom, apparently they were doing something with someone who knew the girl I was talking about. We will call this new person Alex. Even if I changed names and obscured as much information as possible, anyone who knew the girl and Tom would likely be able to put 2-and-2 together.

Fast forward to last night. I was very frustrated with Tom, and eventually I boiled over. I sent him a few messages expressing how upset I was with the situation. I was absolutely in the wrong there. Like, thirteen year old having a temper tantrum wrong. I realized it pretty much right after I let it all out, so I apologized to Tom. It didn't seem like he wanted to hear it, so we just decided to leave it be for the night.

A few minutes later I got messaged again by Tom, who asked me, ""So you told Alex?"". Obviously I was confused because I knew that I didn't say anything to Alex, but after a few minutes of me thinking it over, I started realizing how it could've happened. I knew that the friend I had vented to hung out with Alex often, and even though my friend had told me the secret was safe with her, it was still a possibility, so I brought that up to Tom as a possible explanation of how it happened. Tom told me that Alex said he learned of the whole shibang from the friend I was venting to.

I want to apologize to Tom about randomly provoking him and for not being more careful with the information he gave me, but I don't know how long I should wait before trying to apologize to him. Sometimes stuff like this moves at light speed and other times it takes a while. I just want to make sure he knows that I'm sorry. I really fucked up, and even if he likes this other girl instead of me, that's not his fault or mine, that's just how it is. I shouldn't have attacked him for that because he can't control it and I know damn well he wouldn't have simply done that to make me upset.

So, thanks for reading.",11Jun2020,1
846,"My (21F) sister (19, though she acts like she’s 5) decided to film me while I was eating the other day. She said she was going to post it on TikTok with some caption like ‘depression meal amirite’. I haven’t seen the video fully but I caught a glimpse when she turned her phone at me kinda soon after she recorded it. I demanded that she doesn’t post it, and that she delete it immediately. She said she deleted it. Then a few minutes later she said it was in her ‘recently deleted’, which I told her to delete from there too. I then messaged my other sister (16) and asked if she could check TikTok to see if 19F had posted it (because I don’t have TikTok), and she hadn’t.

Fast forward to now, my sister unprovokedly (!!!) started saying some really horrible stuff to me, like ‘Azodene’s a fat slag’ repeatedly, and I told her she must be pretty insecure about herself to be making such nasty comments at other people. She threatens to post the video if I keep being horrible to her (???). I just say that it’s kind of sad she has to go and make other people feel like shit to make her feel better about herself.

852,"So, I've had my phone number for 6-7 years now. For the first year or so of having it, I got fairly consistent calls, texts, and photos from debt collectors, friends, contractors she's getting bids from, different stores, etc. It went away for the most part, but I'd occasionally still receive a random rash of calls from different places. It hasn't really been that big of a deal, even though it's annoying. 

In the last 6 months or so, I've been receiving a ridiculous amount of spam calls, more contractors, and other random places. It had died down to basically nothing for about 12-14 months before, so I'm sure she's giving my number out again (I don't give my number out except to friends, family, and banking/health related business). Just recently, I received a call from a pharmacy regarding her child's prescription as well as a collection call from the hospital for a visit within the last few weeks. The woman on the phone said that she gave this number to them as her ""new"" number. 

Now, the kicker is that I know of this woman. She lives in a nearby town, I have mutual friends with her family members, we're in a lot of the same local interest groups. We live in a place where everyone knows everyone. 

Is it worth contacting her and telling her to knock it off? I'd rather not go through the hassle of changing all my info again at this point, but I'm getting sometimes 6-7 calls A DAY for this chick. 😫",11Jun2020,1

854,"So I (F19)was talking to this guy (23M) for about 6 months and In the beginning things were great and he was great. We would talk everyday, call each other every night. I was comfortable and could be myself with no judgment, we just clicked instantly. We both felt the same way about each other supposedly. The last month had been rough, I sweep some red flags under the rug but those red flags were all I was seeing, he barely text and he doesn’t call anymore. We ended up having sec got the first time and it was great but he was still acting weird. So I ended up confronting him about it and I told him that it wasn’t gonna work because of the lack of communication and bad habits that he has. Later texted him regretting saying that to him because he was all I wanted couldn’t imagine my life without him. Things sort of go back to normal but then he starts acting weird again. I’m mad at him and he’s mad at me and we’re not talking. He wants to have a serious conversation so we can put this all behind us and I said I need you to be honest with me and tell me what it is you want because I know what i want. 

He tells me he doesn’t know what he wants, but he has feelings for me. He’s been hurt once before and he can’t get hurt again he scared of making him so vulnerable. Which I completely understand but I feel like he used me, there is no doubt in my mind that he had these feelings when we had sex. And if he was feeling this way all this time why was he acting and treating me the way he was. I feel like it’s not okay to ignore someone messages and go all day without talking to them, especially a girl you really have feelings for. I told him that he could’ve told me this before and I wouldn’t have had sex with him. His response was “Why it doesn’t change anything I still have feelings for you.” My response was “it changes everything because you took advantage of me.” My question is am I overreacting, did I take the situation a little too far. I made myself vulnerable by having sex with him which he knows my past and what I’ve been through concerning that. Maybe I was just too upset? It’s been a week and he hasn’t said a word.

855,"So, I'm a gay guy, I'm 18. I had a boyfriend, but we recently broke up. I have a younger brother, he's 11, and since my parents left town for several weeks, they decided to hire a nanny that would stay home most of the day. Shes a woman in her late 40s, the day she arrived, she started flirting with me. She winked at me, and so on. 

I took it playfully cause I didn't think she was actually serious. I'm used to girls just flirting with me, so I just ignored it. Anyways, the days started going by, and her intentions became clear. She kissed my cheek, whispered next to my ear and at first I let her, because I thought it was fun. However, one day, things went a lot further than that. I was under the sun, laying on a chair. My brother was taking his afternoon nap, and I saw the nanny (let's call her Samantha) walk into the garden. She sat on my lap, and she immediately took off her bikini. 

So I basically had this topless woman in front of me. She didn't say anything, she just gave me a side smirk. I was kind of shocked, didn't know how to react. And... (this hurts to say) I realised I had gotten a boner. Obviously she noticed too and started touching me... down there. At first I told her I was gay, but my erection didn't really let her believe that. She started kissing me, and I got so horny that I didn't even try to resist her. I kissed her back, things escalated quickly and uh yeah, we ended up finishing right then and there. 

I had never kissed or had sex with a woman before. But for some reason, seeing her almost naked made me extremely horny (even if I didn't want to feel that way).


This woman is still in my house and she's been trying to get in my pants, since this happened just a few days ago (on Saturday).

859,"I don't know why I'm writing this but I need to get it out. Hopefully as I write, it will become clearer to me.
 


I love my spouse. They're non binary. This was only revealed to me recently as I don't think they even realised it themself until now. I want to be as supportive as possible. I try to be as supportive as possible.

 

We both struggle with mental health problems. At the beginning of the relationship, we were both healthy but as time went on, it was like a series of unfortunate incidents that culminated in us both developing mental health issues and realising that we were never all that mentally healthy to begin with. We just had better coping skills that allowed us to pretend.

 

I find it incredibly hard to open up, even to my partner. They, on the other hand, seem to wear their heart, and all other emotions, on their sleeve. This means that I will regularly ignore my own mental health in a bid to try and help them. It never seems to work. Honestly, I'm not even sure they notice most of the time. I can say that with quite a bit of confidence because their therapist said whenever they feel like they're going to explode from emotion, they should write it down so they're not shouting unfair things at me. I only know this because I came across one by accident. I didn't tell them at first, I was ridiculously hurt. They only know I found it (therefore explaining that their therapist recommended it) because they had made a note about something else that they expected me to read and action, and I didn't so they asked why. I told them what I found. The fact that they kept them in the same place makes me feel that they wanted me to see. 

 

Apparently I'm a sadist because I took a picture and saved it (though they don't know that). It read 

 

*""Sometimes you're so fucking dense. All I need is some emotional support - saying you understand, showing me love, distracting me with other things. Fucking hell! How can you be so fucking thick?! All it takes is to think for one second what it might feel like to have a swelling rage and anger inside you and ask yourself what you might need or what would help. It's not fucking hard. Anytime you show any sort of obvious discomfort them I try to help, even if it makes it worse.,that still let's you know how to help. Fuck me. It's like you don't even care.""*

 

Honestly, since then, I've looked again and there are others. That one seems kinda tame by comparison. Basically they all talk about how I'm failing them. I don't vent like that, or even have thoughts like that about them so I don't know if this is normal.

 

They have angry outbursts which I don't know how to handle. I have CPTSD due to past trauma that I have in no way addressed. As a result, any form of anger makes me freeze. My brain just stops working. I don't know what to do, what to think. All I know is I'm not doing good enough. So when they get angry, seemingly out of nowhere, I don't know what to do or how to help. I tend to flinch (involuntarily) which just makes it worse.

 

I guess I write this to ask for advice on how to help them cope with their anger and how to be a better partner to them.

 

I'm sorry this is all over the place. I tried to make it a stream of consciousness and not edit too much because I know I will take stuff out if I do that.

861,"So I'm home from college for the summer and while I love my family, there is this whole long term struggle of my mom being like ""Everyone is just SO MESSY and LAZY and nobody ever cleans so the house is going to absolute shit"". We are a family of four, my parents my sister (15) and I (20). We also have two cats and a dog. We have just a lot of stuff, everywhere. The kitchen isn't super small, but there are also cabinets that once were organized, but now also have random things put in there because there isn't a place for them. We have a lot of places for storage but they're just full of old crap nobody uses. I personally feel like we need to just go through all of the rooms and like throw/ donate a bunch of stuff, but whenever I mention this, it gets turned into ""okay if you think that's what we need, you can do it"". The kitchen is always a mess (its like the middle of our house) there's always a bunch of random mail, and papers and wrappers and stuff all over the counters. I don't know how to fix this. Some of the problem is people just don't clean up after themselves, but also a lot of the stuff in there is there because it doesn't really have a place to go. There is like a front living room with two couches, one of the couches one of our cats has pissed all over and nobody has done anything in the last 2 years to do anything to it. Nobody has attempted to clean it or throw it away, so it just sits there. My piano is in there and people just stack up a bunch of stuff on the bench like random clothes to return, important paperwork, the family laptop etc. The family room isn't like too bad, but nobody seems to ever like dust it or vacuum more than once a month. The bathrooms also only get deep cleaned about once a year, with a little spray down about once every month or two. Before I left for college none of this really got to me, but after living on my own, its just really starting to affect me mentally.

There are a lot of sides to all of this so I'm going to kind of break down what I see from each person. I just want advice on how to try to fix things

Before I start analyzing everyone and exposing them, I'll expose myself. I just finished my second year of college and have been bouncing back and fourth between my campus housing and home for the summer the last two years. My room at this point is in a constant state of mess because I've got so much shit in boxes and I can't bother myself to clean it because I will be moving at the end of August so I can't really find the point in putting anything away right now. When it comes to cleaning the house I try to go from the living room and the family room and pick up all the clutter and put it on people's place at the kitchen table so they can put it away properly. I also will wipe down the kitchen counters.

My sister cleans the bathrooms, but does it really half assed. She also makes huge mess out of them, especially the one we share. She leaves food (like chicken nuggets on a plate with ketchup, and cookies, and boxes of cereal) all over the bathroom. Every room she occupies seems to be covered in crumbs. She does struggle with depression and I do understand that maybe her room is partially such a mess because of this, but her room has been in like a hoarders style mess since she was a toddler (I'm talking about loaves of bread, legos all over the floor, pictures in frames buried under clothes, like not even a pathway to walk through, just stepping on top of piles of dolls and broken toys to get to her bed that was also covered with crumbs and more random sharp items), and my parents once a year helped her clean it, but never enforced any kind of weekly cleaning schedule which I think has really lead to it being the way it is. We did a big cleanup this last fall and actually repainted, got her new furniture and new flooring , and she has sort of learned to clean it herself, but it is currently A HUGE mess again. She'll go down to clean the common rooms with me, but will disappear up to her room within five minutes or start making snacks.

I honestly don't know exactly what my mom does to clean. She hovers around the kitchen the whole time, seeming to be busy, but its never really clean? She'll do the dishes and clear off the center island, but it feels to me like all she really does is pace around and look busy. I understand she might be overwhelmed but when I clear out the kitchen counter,  it doesn't take me more than a couple of hours max.

Basically my dad grew up in the middle of nowhere and at the beginning of my parent's marriage, he and my mom began to have a struggle with who was expected to clean. He's a lot better now, but he still thinks doing like two things is doing more than anyone. He does the yard work, but he only mows and hardly does any trimming, doesn't maintain any of the bushes or anything, so its really just like he mows, he'll vacuum the living room once every three weeks, and then he'll vacuum the hardwood floor when my mom asks him to clean it.

The house is getting to be 25 years old so there are some repairs that need to be made (or there are some that should have been proactively made a while ago) but nobody is doing anything. We're not broke or anything but my dad isn't very handy and also gives us no resources to find a reputable repair person. Things just seem to be falling apart (for example no rooms have been repainted EVER except my room and my sister's room, and we have peeling wallpaper in the downstairs bathroom and fancy front room).

I just want to know what I can do. I don't want to spend my entire summer organizing the laundry room and the cabinets and don't even get me started on the basement, but there is so much SHIT in this house and it just feels like there is no place to put anything in a semi-organized way. I just need help because my family constantly fights over cleaning and I know I'm not like an innocent bystander, but nobody seems to be able to take initiative to FIX any of this.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My family home is EXREMELY cluttered and messy, and everybody fights about cleaning. I just want to try to make some kind of long lasting fixes so that people have an easier time staying organized and keeping things clean. ",11Jun2020,1
862,"Hello smart people,

There is a tree next to my balcony where fruit flies live, and breed, and swarm.   Even if I open the door for just a minute, a good few come inside.  Is there anything that is pet safe that I could put on the balcony to keep them away?  Thanks all!",11Jun2020,1
863,"So I (19 F Canada) got my G1 a few months after I turned 16, like most teens do. I did lessons on and off and practiced for 2.5 years and finally got my G2 last September after failing once in August. I don't consider myself a bad driver, I just get nervous sometimes and am always super cautious.

 After I got my licence I was at uni and not driving so when I came home in April I felt I should practice with my Dad a little until i'm comfortable on my own. We've practiced for probably around 25-30 hours for 2 months and I was starting to feel ready to drive on my own until a few weeks ago someone ran a red and nearly hit me. After that I needed a break for a few days because me being as nervous as I am, the incident really shook me up.

My Dad was angry I stopped and would say stuff like ""what's the point, you're never going to be able to drive by yourself"" and then a few minutes later apologise and say we should drive but i'm just in too poor of a mood. Now every time we plan on driving he finds a way to yell at me or make me feel bad and then I don't want to drive. I haven't practiced in over a week now and every time I ask to practice he finds a way to make me so upset I can't drive and it is really starting to hurt me.

 So many people my age can drive on their own just fine and all I want is to be able to do the same. Even without the incident of the person running the red light I seem to be taking a very long time to be comfortable driving on my own. I know I just have to work hard and practice more but at this point every time I think of driving I just get upset and scared, and now I'm unsure of what to do to get over this fear. 

Info: My mother doesn't drive (also too scared, has never had her licence) and I'm an only child, but perhaps finding a friend to help me practice would be a good idea?",11Jun2020,1
864,"Hello. I recently took a job at a grocery store and I work with a lot of teenagers. I am in my early 20’s. I was an only child and I do not have any experience being around kids or teenagers often. 

One teenager I work with really pushes my buttons. He is very disrespectful to me. He makes jokes at my expense, he talks back when I ask him to do something and he has a really shitty attitude with me. He is really lazy and doesn’t like doing his work. 

Any advice on how I can maintain my professionalism, but still get my point across? I don’t want to report his behavior yet. I want to try to set firm boundaries and still be able to get my job done.

I am a cashier and he is a bagger. I am responsible for delegating certain tasks to him, but I am not his supervisor.

He reminds me of a terrible “friend” I had for many years who would constantly belittle me and put me down.",11Jun2020,1

And he had already expressed that he’s not interested in being fwb or dating. We spent a bit of time apart and eventually came back to talking again, trying to start on a clean slate; slowly rebuilding things.

I’ve been doing more of the initiating and I’m realizing that I still want more out of this than he does. I’m not even sure if he’d notice if I disappeared completely. He says he appreciates the friendship but I feel that I’ve been putting in more of the work and I don’t want to go back to the awkwardness again. Should I block him completely? Should I address that I still have the feels for him? Not sure how to do the latter without making it awkward.",11Jun2020,1
866,"I know siblings annoy each other. Me and my brother have always been like that but, he’s getting worse. 

It started years ago when he found this stupid KFC conspiracy theory video. My probably around 11 year old brain thought that it was pretty funny at first. Somehow he memorized the entire script for that video and every time someone would mention fried chicken or KFC, he would recite the entire thing off the top of his head. It got really annoying especially when we were just riding down the road and he would start screaming about the Illuminati every time we passed a KFC.

After a while he just stopped doing that until years later now. Apparently he’s discovered the true beauty of internet memes. I think his obsession started when I showed him a video about Elmo dancing to hardbass a while ago. Every 5 minutes he manages to quote a meme without context. He doesn’t even do it correctly though. Sometimes he’ll randomly say “What would you do if there was a child right in front of you?” and then he’ll do this weird motion with his hands and say “FLAMINGO *kicks*”

He also says “Yeet” and dabs. One time he found this funny video about a post by the onion about Putin. This time he didn’t memorize it though so now he goes around saying “and Putin gave orders to Putin to kill Putin and Putin Putin Putin shhheufudueihf Putin Putin.” He won’t stop ruining perfectly good memes and videos.

Sometimes he makes this really disgusting noise with his mouth and when I ask him to stop he just says “But it’s the pufferfish eating a carrot!1!!1!1” I don’t care about a fucking pufferfish eating a carrot I’m just trying to eat my lunch. He thinks big chunges and “uh oh stinky uh oh poopy” are just the most hilarious things on the planet.

I’m convinced that his favorite word is “bruh.” He says it every chance he gets and when he’s playing video games he’ll just start repeating “bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh” over and over again. He uses other annoying words as well. One time I heard him talking with my dad about this new weapon that they were going to get on a game and he said “Bro das gonna be so op!” To our DAD. 

Somehow, that’s still not all of the annoying things he does. He constantly ignores people and then interrupts them while they are speaking. The other day I was in the middle of a sentence talking to him and he just cut me off to talk about something completely unrelated. When I told him to stop interrupting me, he says “Well I was about to talk before you started talking so that means that I should talk first!” He also watches Flamingo without headphones right across from my bedroom.

One time him and I were talking with our family at the table and I said “burn the witch.” I can’t really remember what happened but then, every since that night, he wouldn’t stop repeating it as much as possible.

If you wanted to describe how annoying he is, take the average Redditor and multiply it by 100.

I don’t know what to do anymore. All he does is interrupt me and ruin good memes. How do I make him shut up or at least be annoying somewhere far away from me?",11Jun2020,3
867,"I just heard about this situation today and it infuriated me and I figured there must be something we can do about it. My grandmother hired a service to clean out her septic tank. My mother used this company before for herself and recommended it so we figured it would be fine.

The serviceman came while she was out of the house, but her son was there. The man explained that there was so much in the tank, he would have to make two trips. We figured that was fine so her son paid the man and he did his work. When she got home, she realized that they charged almost double for the one trip than they told her over the phone (just for the one trip, saying that my grandmother would have to pay again the same price when they came back).

Apparently, my grandmother was alone when they came back because her sons were out doing something. She went out and told the man that she couldn't afford to make two payments that big because it wasn't what she was expecting and just told him that he should leave.

The man started YELLING at my grandmother about how she still has to pay him because he made the second trip out there and any time my grandmother tried to argue, the man got louder and more forceful until my grandmother caved. So the man took the payment for the second trip and just left, without even taking the rest of the material from the tank, claiming that she didn't want the service anymore.

After the fact, my grandmother was visibly and audibly shaking from how the man had yelled at her and me and my mother both told her she shouldn't have paid them a dime, and probably should have tried to fight for the price back from the first trip.

This is clearly a company, or at least a serviceman, taking advantage of someone elderly who was home alone without anyone to turn to. Is there anything we can do to resolve this? My grandmother just wishes to let it go because ""God will take care of me"", but nobody else is satisfied with that. My mother called the business, but they've been ignoring her messages.

I just can't believe this happened. I hear about this kind of thing on those news ""gotcha"" stories where they investigate businesses, but I would never have expected it to happen to our family. It's disgusting.",11Jun2020,1

869,"Semi-thowaway account.
I need some advice. I don't know how to handle empathy. As a kid and teenager I've never had empathy (at least that's what I think it is). I don't feel bad for anyone and I could never really understand or force myself to care for others problems or how it affects them. I couldn't form bonds with anyone and I've been a loner most of my life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I haven't been taken to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. 
Recently though, starting a few months ago I've been feeling feelings I don't know how to handle. I drive to a pet store to get ferret food and other places. On the way there is a corner where you'll usually see people standing with cardboard signs that all say something along the lines of ""Will work for food"" ""Veteran. Please help."" and to be completely honest I never gave a shit. Who was I to know if they were telling the truth? What their life was is their own problem.
 But now every single time I drive by my heart feels weird. I feel bad for them. I feel like they deserve better. I give them money when I can and now when I can't and I am forced to drive past I feel awful and selfish and I hate it. I'll think of them for months. When it rains I'll wonder if they're in shelter. If they have food. I hate feeling for other people, strangers at that. It's not even just them. I've got some people I chat with and I've started to care about them more than I used to. I don't know what to do. I'm not used to actually wanting to be around people. Wanting to talk to them. 
How do I handle all these new feelings? Is it normal to feel this much sadness for others? What can I do to get used to this?

875," For  context, i am 18, male, i knew this neighbor of mine who went to the  same school as me, we had a thing for each other, it was however over  the internet, i was kind of to much of a coward to ask her out, she for  the record moved schools and i changed housing before we got to like  each other so i didnt get to see her anymore.

anyway  it was stupid i agree, i ended the relationship like 8 months ago now,  two weeks after her birthday,not sure if its relevant tho, today she  texted me, i panicked and since i dont want to let her down if she asked  to talk to me again, i still am trying to get her out of mind, i mean  we talked for a year and we liked each other for 2 years, she was my  only friend( for the record she is the closest thing to a freind that i  had in the last year or so) anyway i was midway through a post here  asking what to do when i said fuck it and just texted back, things went  pretty good, she said she just wants to make sure we are on good terms,  and forget what happened.

i was  pretty cool with this, i dont hate her, infact i still think about her  daily, i still feel bad for leaving her, i have to convince myself not  to stalk her social media accounts every single night for the last  month.

i am not sure if this means  that she wants us to talk on again or go no contact but on good terms,  but for a weird reason i dont care, i just feel...happy? like i am  validated again? to know that someone have been thinking about me? i am  getting depressed day by day for the last like 4 months, this is the  first time that i feel this, is this okay? do i just need company? i  have always had problems organizing my thoughts and i wish i can see  someone to help me think straight but i cant, because i still live with  my parents ( i just turned 18 last month tho so dont be hard on me) when  i lieave for my unis ill hopefully see one off the books to help me.

she  have always been a good person, she played a huge part in who i am  today, the reason i broke things off was because i asked her like for 4  or 5 weeks to start actually hang out and she would always come out with  an excuse, the thing is we planned for that day for like 4 months when  we were both travelling tho, thats not what i told her anway, i told her  that i cant do this anyway, i said some stuff that were true but not  the actual reason and since it was on chat, it was easy to do i admit  that but i am not proud of it, i said that i just didnt feel good rnough  anf that she deserved better then that.

i  also forgot an important part, she said that she just wants us to stay  as friends like 2 weeks before we broke up, which kind of made me feel  like an idiot for not being a man enough and ask her out before then.

878,"The thing is, I don't know where to find these communities to join, and I don't know how to socialise *at all*. I can't start conversations (I can't come up with anything to say for the life of me, and when I come up with something situational it always fizzles out), make appropriate comments or be likeable. I always get ignored on Reddit when I try to interact socially (this of course is my alt, I don't want to scare people off on my main), so forums are likely a no go. 

My interests are really vague and limited and I can't really find any communities with people I share common interests with because of them (gaming/anime/books), and I am absolutely terrible at coming up with what I've heard and seen to be the most important thing for making conversation, questions and small talk. I just can't do it, and I see other people succeed with it.

I used to have a friend who was similar but made loads of friends on Twitter all of a sudden, because according to them it just kind of happened.

I really want to meet new people and form connections with them, but when I can't socialise, and the pure hatred I feel for myself when I ssee and hear other people online with their own friends, making them without a problem, socialising, having people to talk to, it makes me feel like crap, and I have no motivation to do anything becausr I'm naturally extroverted, I gain my energy from socialising. Just my luck that I also happen to suck at socialising and have Aspergers.

TL;DR The only way I can get through this is following my therapists advice and making friends online, throughout Discord or Twitter. I just cn't seem to find communities on there that apply to me or even feel welcome or socialise in those places successfully.

Is it possible to like someone only for the sexual aspect of it? It doesn't seem fair for him because he seem to genuinely have interest in me.

884,"
I just want to say that it’s not like I was never happy with my best friend, our friendship has always been an awkward one but slowly, we started to get a little more comfortable, though we had more arguments too. But I think the fact that it wasn’t all bad is what has me conflicted. 
Basically I have a lot of energy at home, but with anyone else I’m very soft spoken and keep things that I should share to myself because I don’t want to offend or hurt anyone. It’s like that for my best friend. She has a temper and a pretty bad attitude when it comes to small mishaps with any friends, which meant not many people got close with her. She used to get upset that people “like me more than her” (I feel bad saying that) and brought it up a lot, which is why I’ve always been determined to try to accept and understand her, but that meant I never told her when she was wrong and now she’s gotten used to it. I made a new friend just over half a year ago who started to raise my confidence, and my best friend got jealous (which is natural) but she talked about it a LOT and talked bad about that friend, even when she seemed to have nothing against her before, and I never knew how to respond. It made me feel really bad but since I’m bad with words and discussing problems, I don’t think any comfort I offered ever worked. But at that time, when I was gaining confidence, she argued that I was being too “sassy”. It blew over but It stuck with me, so I started becoming more introverted and careful again. I didn’t realise it might have affected me until now. 
Since then I’ve developed this paranoid habit - the whole reason we’ve argued this time - which is me asking her if she’s mad when I do something so little. It’s just that she gets mad over everything so I always check, especially since she sounds mad, and when I ask she sounds even madder. It’s clear it annoys her so I told her I’d try to stop just before our current argument, but I couldn’t help it and did it again. She didn’t talk to me for a while and when I texted, it eventually came out that she was mad BECAUSE of that habit, because I asked. Usually I don’t let down until it seems to be “okay” again, I “crawl” back to her, as that other friend put it, but all this time I’ve seen it as me trying to understand her stubborn nature, and I still see it that way because I feel bad. But I did tell her to text me when she wasn’t going to be mad and that she was being difficult and unreasonable. I wondered if she was maybe mad at me for something else but she said that was why she was mad. I keep freaking out that I didn’t actually ask but 1) I was too scared to 2) I just didn’t want to put up with her harsh words and heavy sarcasm anymore when I was trying so hard to be nice, and all she did was say she didn’t want my pity. Even if she didn’t mean it, I can’t keep not having a reaction and this time I guess I snapped. I feel bad but I couldn’t help it. 
I had faith that she would text back eventually if she valued our friendship as much as I did, and try to put in effort like I tried to when we argued. She did say she wasn’t going to, and that I should say what I wanted to them or she wouldn’t talk to me again, but I still believed she would realise she went too far and that she cared enough. But it’s been two weeks since and nothing, it’s been almost three weeks since it all started as well. 
My friend told me I was doing the right thing and that if she cared enough she would take the initiative to come back for once, but I can’t help but feel like I should have kept accepting and understanding, that it was my fault for not ever telling her she was wrong and allowing her to get used to it and that it was my fault for not communicating well.

So! I am a mid 20s female and I work all the time. Usually six days per week with long hours most days. I work in a retail sales environment and spend my days talking with clients. I live with my SO of 6 years (this is relevant). My days are usually spent working, actively working on a hobby of mine I'm trying to make a side hustle, and training for a 5k. My SO works a schedule almost the opposite of mine, and although we live together I rarely see them for more than a late dinner and then bed. 

Over the years my SO and I have had issues that recently led to us taking a bit of a break, but things have been EXPONENTIALLY better than they've ever been. We just recently took a trip together and it was the most fun I've had in so long. No negativity, lots of love. 

Now back to my pressing issue. I am not an overly social person at heart, but with my job draining me of what socializing I do care for, I just don't like to text/call much. I prefer to chat in person with people, but I hardly have the time. When I get my day off, I like to just spend time quietly at home not worrying about much other than laundry. I didn't think this was an issue until I didn't reply to my two best friends while I was on vacation and they've both laid into me. They think I'm focusing on the wrong things and I'm creating an unhealthy environment for myself. They have both cited my relationship as the ""reason"" but in reality that has nothing to do with it. My SO has never tried to stop me from talking to my friends. I just don't really want to? But also I want friends, I just don't have it in me to be connected and talking to people all of the time. I feel bad for not talking to them, but I'm also frustrated with the whole thing. They're mad I didn't tell them I was going out of town, but I don't feel like I have to report to them/anyone, and that feeling is making me want to talk to them less. 

They're basically demanding I make time more regularly, and everything in me is resisting this for some reason. Can you guys offer me any guidance in how to find some mid ground between their demands and my own wants? Thanks in advance!",11Jun2020,1

Hello Adultier Adults. Thanks for checking out my post.

This is my first recession while being in the workforce and I have started being more financially affected by it at my employer University. My work did not give us our typical 2% pay raise this year and just recently they have cut our 8% retirement match, which I take full advantage of.

Obviously, this sucks a lot but I understand why it is being done. Either way, I personally see that as a 10% salary cut to myself, even though it wasn't really cut from my direct salary. On top of it, I haven't been able to use my vacation days for months and have now maxed out due to that (I had a 2+ week vacation planned in May that couldn't happen due to Covid). My future accrued vacation days will effectively start turning to dust next month as I have maxed out my employer's cap. I've tried to bring up using one here and there to stay under with my boss/boss' boss but with us only operating at 50% staff due to keeping distancing, that was met with some ungratefulness/hostility. Yesterday we learned that furloughs will be occurring so at this moment in time I will be keeping my mouth shut as to not stir the pot.

To others that have gone through similar recessions- How long do these types of cuts tend to stay in place? Years? Do they tend to make up for some of it later or no?

I don't want to sound like a money hog but our retirement matching has been an incredibly HUGE factor as to why I have stayed in this job for as long as I have. Without it, I would have left 2.5 years ago. If it might be years and years before I get to see the same match then perhaps it's time to look into something that fits my soul better. Thankfully, I am vested at this point.",11Jun2020,1
888,"(UK DRIVER) 

I'm 22 and I have my first car, which for all intents and purposes is a decent car 

It is a Vauxhall Corsa 1.3 cdti (diesel) with 81,000 miles on the clock 

which since it was bought for me by my grandparents has needed repairs, it essentially has a whole new engine now and has new tires and breaks, it's a nice looking car.

But now it needs a replacement rear light and a fix for an oil leak which may cost upwards of £200 as well as an MOT and Service.

My insurance is up soon and with this car being a turbo and being my first car the insurance is quite high. (Looking at near 1000 fully comp)

However I do have the money to fix.

The family side that have invested in the car already, think I'd be dumb to trade in my car as I've invested to have it fixed in all essences making it a running newish old car and buy a car of the same year which isnt as good as my current car. Taking the risk on a new car which I could buy and it could fuck up and then i have no repair money (As my budget of £2000 doesn't really cover much value) I am also not keen on any of the cars I have looked at yet.

I can see their point of view for keeping it.


But the family side that didn't invest in the car believe I should get rid as they think my car has been nothing but problems and will be nothing but more problems further down the line. 

Pros and Cons of the new car I've looked at and consider to be the best option (Chevrolet aveo 1.2 60k miles )

Cheaper to run (petrol £1,  Diesel £1.14)
Cheaper insurance (£750&gt; £950)
6 months warranty if it does break 
Car has had a new clutch and new tires
Will be MOT'ed for a year
Serviced
Don't need have to have a black box

Cons

I don't like it because it feels of cheap quality and doesnt drive very nicely (could be because I'm used to my car but possibly not )

Overall the cost to buy a new car and insure it will work out roughly the same of my own car to insure and repair.",11Jun2020,2
889,"I (20F) had a best friend (20F) for 4 years. We were basically inseparable and talked all the time since high school. The moment she got a boyfriend though (3 months ago), she completely changed. I always had to reach out if we talked, if we ever hung out it was me or her bf saying “i thought it would be good for her to see you”, she ditched my bday because she was “sick” but was posting pics of them together at the lake the next day, they both said the reason i left a long term toxic relationship was because “i had them to look at as an example”, she rolled my eyes if i called, etc. I told her multiple times I felt left out and used by her, but she would just say i’m not happy for her or supportive. After my birthday I stopped talking to her and she didn’t reach out, so I texted her one more time to try to fix things. I explained in depth how I felt, so we decided to talk in person and everything she said was just excuses. According to her: he is her priority now, she wouldn’t react this way or honestly care if I stopped talking to her like she did to me, that she knew i wasn’t talking to her because she hurt my feelings and still didn’t reach out, she doesn’t need me anymore, he’s the rest of her life i was just temporary fun, just so much stuff that honestly hurt. Not once did she even say sorry. I feel so hurt, sad and used. Am i overreacting? Should i try to fix the friendship? Because now i really don’t know if i’m just unsupportive.",11Jun2020,3

892,"I (white 31/f) dont even remember what exactly i said. I thought about it as i was walking up but got nervous, but the girl was counting out change, which gave me a second to muster up the courage. I asked the cashier if I could get it for her (which was my first mistake, I should have asked the girl herself) and they were understandably confused, and I said something like 'I just wanted to get this for you, because, you know,'
Cringe. I cant even articulate, trying to imply that I'm showing support for the black movements. (I've gone to protests, donated, and supported online. I just wanted to do something nice but I feel like it looked more condescending. It was only like 2.50, I thought it'd be more, so it make me feel even more silly when I saw the amount. Im not sure i even made eye contact with her, I was so embarassed.
My checkout guy said how nice that was, and I hope he wasn't just trying to make me feel better because after she left, I said 'was that wierd? I was just trying to be nice' (I've met this cashier before and he's very friendly). But he insisted that my intention came accross.

I was hanging out with a black friend later and told him the story and how I hope it didn't seem like I was trying to pay for her because she was counting change and I may have looked like i didn't thinks he could pay for it so I did. He asked 'did you pay for her because she's black?' I nervously said 'yes' and he fist bumped me. So that made me me feel a bit better, but I still just hope that the girl at the gas statembarrassed.

Was that nice or should I refrain from trying to do things like that if im so awkward about it?

Edit: I'm not saying that im doing this instead of other things. I've marched, donated, been vocal and supportive online, and offered my time (I haven't found anywhere that has taken it, my city is being overwhelmingly helpful which is great.) I just want to one thing every day to try to help or show support, even something as little as having a good conversation about it.",11Jun2020,0
893,"Hi, I am 15 and since I was pretty young I've always felt very bad about aging I really don't want to grow up and now I am nearing my 16 birthday and I am really getting stressed. I feel that my parents are going to stop looking out for me, absolutely no reason to feel this way nobody is going kick me out, and that I've had a very shitty live unworthy of remembering and that now I'll have no opportunity of living life and telling stories. During my early teen years I became extremely fearsome of rejection and avoided putting myself out there and so I haven't really hanged out with many people except ocasionally with my childhood friend, who is a wonderful dude and probably the reason I am still here, I would also talk to people in school and such but would only talk to them when we had to a project or something together and although I enjoyed it I would never try to hang out with them after. And after talking with them I would obsess and think about our conversations all afternoon. During my early teens I also decided that the best thing I could do was learn a lot of things, learn new languages, read divulgative science stuff and watch videos online about physics... The result is that now I am very very very behind socially in respect to my peers and I don't know how to catch up and everything is way more scary than before. I really don't want to be 16 cause I feel that will make me an adult, which again I know is not true, and confirm my complete failure on the social front. A few months ago before the Corona stuff I hanged out with some people from school for the first time and I saw just how ahead of me they are and I think that turning 16 will confirm my failure as a person.

• I’m 18 years old
• I’m a female
• I graduated in 2019
• I did one semester of college and then moved back home
• I was going to join the Navy but then backed out due to personal reasons &amp; covid pushing my date back multiple times 
• I live in a trailer on my parents property for free
• I have less than $500 to my name
• I don’t have a vehicle

Here’s my dilemma:
My parents have decided to stop giving me choices. It’s either join the Air Force or leave and I’m genuinely conflicted on what to do. When I think of the military I have no passion or drive. I don’t get excited. I can’t tell if it’s because I really don’t want to go, or if I’ve just grown content with where I’m at. I have a place to go rent free where I could find a job and see what life is like away from my parents, but I don’t want to hurt them. I feel as though I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. They want me to make these huge life decisions when they don’t even consider me an adult.

Well, it’s not the best job obviously but most of our coworkers are fair and cordial... except one. She’s a bitch. She’s a coworker like us but she tries to give us commands. Long story short we don’t talk for obvious reasons. She has attitudes, she’s thrown fits if we don’t listen to her, etc. 

Well... I’m worried I’ll be scheduled with her more often. And a weird thing is my manager doesn’t give her a list of things to do but me and my friend have one? 

She just kinda stands at the counter all day and occasionally stocks. Thankfully we stopped listening to this bitchy coworker. I’m concerned the days will be long working with her. 

Another guy put in his application but I don’t know him. And it’s weird... this friend was just talking my ear off the other day but I’m worried I might not see him much anymore especially since he’s quitting. 


Long story short, this is one of the only jobs around me right now, and I don’t have a car, and trying to save money.


I’m worried. I wish he gave me notice? Well... maybe there’s a chance he’ll come back? I say this because today he was an hour and a half late. He’s late on a consistent basis... admittedly so am I, and our boss is usually understanding... but 1.5-2 hours late is kinda bad. I usually try to get in within 30 or so, maybe 45.

916,"So I've been friends with this girl I met online for a while now. Since she lives in Canada, and I in texas, our friendship was purely online, but that didn't stop us from becoming best friends over the course of about 5 years. 

Halfway between that time I found that I genuinely liked this girl a lot more than just a friend, however through random conversations with some other friends, she stated she had no interests in online/long distance relationships. That being said I held my toungue and kept my feelings to myself. I didn't want to make things weird, also I saw no reason to take a shot where i knew I'd miss.

Fast forward to a few days ago, she said that she was getting kind of serious with someone that she met online, that wasn't me. My heart sunk when she said it, and was easily the worst heartache I've ever felt. I want so bad to tell her how I feel now, even knowing full well that it's too late. But no way I look at it I know I can't and shouldn't. Because if it goes one way, and she had no interest in me whatsoever, that makes the friendship weird, but on the other hand, if she did have interest in me (probably giving myself too much credit) that gives her an ultimatum in a sort of ""him or me"" situation. And I care for her too much to put that on her. 

All that being said, I'd welcome any advice on a way I could get through this or if I should say anything. Because the only way i see out of this is getting over her, and I don't know how long Itll take or how long I can keep up an act around her.

Part of my job is to order furniture for the new place. We needed 10 desks so I called around and found ones that worked. When ordering the sales guy told me to check and see if our new building accepted a ""freight shipment"" because some buildings do not, and in that case, there would be no point in ordering. So, I called and they said they do but we had to be there - all good.

Then, I get a call from my boss today pretty upset that I called and asked about a freight shipment with desks.

He was upset and mad that I had alerted them of our office set up.

I had NO IDEA that we weren't supposed to. The guy who showed us around raised zero concern, but I guess he was an agent and not with the apartment place, so he was trying to sell. Anyways, I apologized to my boss many times but he is still mad and I feel terrible.

Only Reddit, I have a very hard time talking about how I feel. But for the past 4 months theses things have been getting worse and worse. Now they are the worse right now, which I will explain the things because I do not understand why this is happening. When I was 7 I was diagnosed with “trauma induced anxiety” But I never talked about it,
The only reason my family noticed was because of the panic attacks. My anxiety has gotten tons and tons better, I didn’t have a panicked attack in 2 years. but the past 4-3 months, I’ve been having panic attacks often and just feeling very anxious. Along with feeling very guilty over very small things, which is something I used to struggle with but it’s “came back”.

I’ve never had sleep problems but for 3-4 months I won’t be able to sleep for a couple days at a time no matter how hard I try. When I’m up I “breakdown” and cry, I just feel overwhelming sad. After I’m done crying I just feel numb (that’s the best way to describe it) it feels like nothing, no excitement. 

This may be not a big deal to some but to me it is because this has never happened to me. For a cluster of days I will completely lose my appetite. The littles thing will make me feel more than full. Then some days I eat everything, so much food. I’ve never been a big eater at all, this is very different to me. I’ve also never just lost my appetite either.

I worked in retail making $8.25 while being a full time student and she brings up all the time that I could make more money if I would just join. I know the path I want to take doesn't have that much pay but I dont want to be in the military. For me it sounds depressing. And I've been trying to explain that the career path I'm working towards its safe and secure. Even during this pandemic teachers are still working and getting paid. It may not be a life that provides luxury but I know will have all of my needs and a good chunk of my wants met. I guess what I'm looking for is advice on how to get my mother to stop embarrassing me, belittling my choices, and accepting my ideas of success arent necessarily tied to  financial benefits. 

Any help is appreciated",11Jun2020,1
931,"There's not really a polite way to put this. My brother (25) and I (22) have had a very strained relationship. We've always kind of been at each others throats for reasons of wildly varying validity, and even stopped talking to one another altogether for about 2 years after a heated argument. 

We recently started trying to mend our relationship, and it's in a kind of awkward place right now. Moreso adding onto the problem was him asking me to be his Best Man at his wedding. I'm bringing up our relationship to show that theres really only 1 person i would invite to the the Bachelor party-- our Grandfather, who's in his 70s, so i can't really make the party anything too physical. I'm thinking maybe 3 different stops, but classic things like strip clubs and high cost parties are out of the question, since I have a pretty restricted budget. He's not really a party guy either, and hasn't been super helpful with ideas for what he wants.

Anyways, can y'all help me out here? What are some fun and meaningful things i can do for him?",11Jun2020,2

 For the past 3 years I have learned a lot about myself and realized I got what I deserved. I have done some soul searching and I have realized i dated jerks because I was afraid of falling in love. I am not afraid anymore and recently began dating again. Nice guys. I am done dating jerks.

947,"I(16f) have little to no relationship experience with my last relationship only lasting three months and the relationship I'm in right now only lasting 4 so I haven't got alot under my belt . My gf (17f) goes through long periods of time of not texting me , I'm talking texting me every 5 days for ten minutes and then disappearing again . She says this is because her messenger and Snapchat aren't working but she barely even texts me on normal messaging and when she does it's stuff like I'll text you again on Wednesday or something like that . The thing is if your apps are crashing you can't pick and choose what day to respond on and she texts her friends during this time period when she's not online . I can't get credit so I can't message her back . This whole thing is making me feel so emotionally drained and let down and the real kicker is that I actually really fell for them .

 I have such strong feelings for them and would do just about anything to make them smile but they can't even be bothered to text me until around every 4-7 days for longer than five minutes . I also asked if we could meet up just the two of us a couple times but she always refused and only meets in group settings . I talked to her about how this makes me feel but she didn't even care about how hurt I was and changed the subject really quickly saying she'd change but she didn't and this has been going on for ages . I now can't even stand the thought of being in the same room as her because of how hurt I am and I can't talk to her about anything because like I said she isn't online . I don't feel like our relationship has any trust and especially communication which are basically the foundations for any relationship . 

Also I can tell that she definitely doesn't like me as much as I like her if she even likes me at all at this point . It's basically just a sinking ship at this point but because of my feelings I'm hoping she'd change . I don't want a relationship like this where I can't even talk about how hurt I am because they don't either care enough to listen if they're even going to be online . I'm just so tired all the time and I feel like this relationship is taking up all of my energy . Tbh I always said ""Why do people stay in toxic relationships if they're being hurt "" but now that I'm in one I totally understand .

 I don't think I can give her another chance because I'm too hurt at this . It takes alot to make me cry but I completely broke down yesterday even though nothing even happened . She invited me , my best friend and her best friend down to her house for a sleepover tomorrow but I don't think I can go physically and I'll be emotionally out of it .But I realised if I do go I could break up with her in person but I don't want to stay at her house for that long and then drop the news nor do I want to ruin the sleepover if I break up with her before . My plan is either to talk to her a bit before and break up and go home and ditch the sleepover or go to the sleepover and break up afterwards which I don't think is a good idea now that I have it written out . I can't keep doing this to myself and it's so damaging to me but at the same time I like her so much and I just don't know why I fell so hard for someone like her .

 Do you guys think I should break up and if yeah how do you suggest I go about it and if you think I should talk to her about it and express my feelings how do you think I should go about that ? I have no experience about what to do with this relationship at all so could someone shed some light down in the comment section .",11Jun2020,1

I got too drunk to realize it, but me and my friend both thought she wanted to hook up with me.

Now that this is on the table, I’m worried that I’m going to blow it. Also, it’s tough for me to have casual encounters because I have to excuse myself and time the injection just right in order to preform well, and I’m really not super sexually experienced, and she is.

Today he was repeating the N-word in front of my mom so I told him to ""please stop saying that, it's not funny"". This triggered my brother so he held his middle fingers up at me and wouldn't put them down. I told him to ""quit acting childish"" and he replied with ""shut up faggot"", so my mom told me I need to be nicer to him and stop acting so rude. I got angry and told her she needs to enforce rules and punish him, to which she told me she's the parent and if I tell her what to do or say another word then she will ground me.

This happens on a daily basis, and at one point in my life I had an issue with drugs. So almost every day I hear the words ""drug addict"" or ""junkie"", from either my brothers or my dad. There's an entire list of words that my dad says that he knows make me really angry or emotional so that every time I get angry and say anything back he can always tell me he'll ground me, give me loads of manual labor, or call the police because I'm being ""hostile"" or out of control.

I've thought about getting a dog so many times, but because my depression is as bad as they get, think 4-8 weeks of barely being able to move, not having energy to speak or take care of myself, I haven't.

There are theories stating a dog can help when depressed, but I'm afraid if it doesn't help it'll just be an extra burden.

960,"This is my first post on Reddit.

I’m still shaking writing this but I need some advice and I need it ASAP, please.

Warning: this might be a long one. Summary at the end.

There’s a small strip of forest behind my house. I’m an A-Level student so buckets of free time plus my neighbour getting rid of excess wooden planks and partly-rusted nails meant I built a hut behind my house in a small clearing. It has a roof and chairs and is generally swell. This beauty (if I do say so myself) took me weeks to make with a little help from my dad. It’s sturdy as heck.

For the last few weeks I’ve been scavenging behind houses for cool stuff that got thrown out.  I’ve found a china cup, a glass coke bottle, a silver dish, a frisbee and a cherub that I hung by a rope.

We’re the only house on the street with a gate opening up to the little forest behind us. About 10 other houses on my side of the street back on to it. We live towards one end, where it cuts off in an impassable clump of trees, brambles and a river. On the other end, going along the backs of the houses, the forest opens up to a tiny field and then a park followed by a massive field and a massive forest detached from the one by my house. It’s accessible this way but you have to clamber over barbed wire and heaps of wood with nails dangling out, but it is accessible.

It’s also accessible by coming across the river, but that way you have to wade through a sea of brambles up to your waste before you get to a patch of grass and a road.

These are the only ways it can be accessed aside from my house and back gate. I thought it was impenetrable.

Around midday today my dad heard noise back there. 3 people, roughly my age, hanging out. Not drinking. Not smoking. Just hanging. I wasn’t home.

My dad told/asked them to leave in the passive-aggressive British tone. Then after walking away he realised they could trash the place so he went back and said they could hang out as long as they were respectful because “my son” put a lot of time and effort in to it.

They left half an hour later.

I came home a few hours later and he told me. I ran out. Here’s what I saw.

The frisbee was gone. The silver plate was gone. The sign I made and painted was gone, ripped out of the ground. The cherub and the rope it hung on was gone... until I found it, shattered on the floor. The main structure was still intact aside from one tiny panel being ripped from the nail.

I spent so long on this place and it feels like a second bedroom to me. I built it to chill with my mates. I can see it from my window and now it gives me chills every time I look down at it. I might be overreacting, it’s obviously public land. I just need some advice on where to go from here to... hide it better? Let go and accept that it could get trashed any day? I’m freaking out bad. Thank you so much if you read the long version, you’ve made my day a little better.

I've been feeling very strange lately, as if I've forgotten how to act around my friends. I feel self conscious around them and I'm aware of it but can't seem to shake it off. I've been friends with these guys literally all my life and I know we all care for each other but I can't seem to shake off this insecurity whenever I meet them or talk to them and it's getting really concerning. Everytime I'm think of saying something I sscond guess myself and either end up staying shut or saying it while stuttering and stammering throughout. It's embarassing that this is happening with people who I would trust with my life. Weirdly, when I'm on video call with them, I feel some semblance of ""normal"", but when I met them in person twice, it was both times extremely awkward and I constantly found myself thinking about how I'm being perceived, something I've not felt much around strangers either.

Along with this, I also don't remember what I used to be like around them. I went through some videos on my phone and seeing myself laughing along with them and cracking jokes feels like I'm watching someone else. It's like I've forgotten who I was and am just a shell of what my personality used to be.

A point to add, I've been living with my parents over quarantine and I've always behaved differently around them to avoid conflict, and am just two very different people around them and my friends. I don't always get along with my mother, and usually just stay shut to avoid conflict until it reaches a breaking point. I'm 21, but they still treat me like a child, and while I usually fight it off or ignore it without any problems (since I'm not with them more than 1.5 months at a stretch and that too with all of us outside the house during working hours) during quarantine they're pretty much the only people I've interacted with, so maybe that's just altered my personality and now I am the me that has pretended to be someone around them and not who is actually the real me?

Then about 6 months before we got engaged I accidentally found out that his brother and sister and him were all adopted at birth. Just an omission, but wait there is more...

1. When were first started dating he told me he lost a testicle while in the army during a blast. I found out when we were going through fertility treatments that it was due to an accident as a child.

2. He told me he was 3 credits short of his masters degree in English. Later I would realise the lie because he can barely read, and barely graduated high school due to being diagnosed with dyslexia in HS.

3. He just lies about stuff that he doesnt need to lie about. Stupid crap and he hates it when I call him out.

4. He said he was in the army. But he has no GI benefits. He told me that they discharged him and made it seem like he was never there.  He has no army buddies he is friends with on social media or any that he speaks to ever and  his family has never mentioned him being in the service. He said he had major knee Injuries when he left. But then I hear him talk about major knee injuries during football in HS.

It has gotten to the point where I do not believe anything he says and I am nearing the end of my rope. I love him, but I'm not even sure I really know him.

986,"This is my first Reddit post ever, and I decided to create a throwaway just in case someone could see it, sorry for any mistakes! Also TLDR at the bottom, and excuse me for my grammar, English isn't my first language!


Two years ago my dad told me about his girlfriend. My parents have been divorced for about 8 years, and well I could say I accepted it and moved on. I freaked out a little bit when I found out, but took it pretty well, since my mom had done the same thing, introducing her boyfriend into my sibling's (13F &amp; 10M) and my (16F) lives. 

But then he told me about her son, who is the same age as me. That freaked me out completely and I was petrified! 

I would consider myself a pretty calm person, but lately (the past 2 years) I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety, and hearing those news sent me into an overthinking spiral, worrying and stressing the hell out.

When I met them, I think I was so scared that I didn't really talk, but eventually pulled through. I don't remember much since I blocked it out due to embarrassment, fear and cringe, and have moved on

Buuut last year they got engaged, and last week my dad called me to visit him (he lives in my hometown) and his now wife, his family (m grandma, aunt, cousins) and go to a field trip (to ""see the beauty of nature""). 

I immediately declined. Last year when visiting them, I felt extremely uncomfortable and tense and just super anxious staying with them, I couldn't relax, and I felt almost trapped, and kept making excuses to not stay with them but with my grandma instead.

I don't know why I reacted the way I did, maybe it's just a teen thing that I'm not that self aware yet to see, or maybe I just don't think I'm ""there yet"" to be that comfortable with them, or some other reason

I also don't like visiting my dad or his side of the family in general, since they're not that great of people, and I would say even toxic in a way

Me and my sister declined, we have similar reasons and (I think) didn't really feel comfortable with them, but my brother wants to go. I understand he want to see his dad, and I guess me and my sister are just used to being without him, but the problem is, my brother wants us to come with him, since he's so young. Me and my siblings kind of always do things together, and I don't want to leave anyone behind.

I kind of want to go, don't get me wrong, I miss them and I'd love to go to like a natural resort or something, but my sister doesn't want to, and also, the cons kind of outweigh the pros. 

I don't know what to do! 


TLDR: Dad wants me and my siblings to visit him and his now wife and her son (+his family), my brother(10) wants to go, while my sister (13) doesn't, I'm not sure since I don't really find myself comfortable there win them",11Jun2020,1

So just today I stumbled across a job offering, it was for House Keeping, exact same location, same management, all that. Previously when I quit I asked about other positions, I was told of one of the HK positions being open, but I was told it could be a bit too hard, so I declined, worried I'd make an ass about myself, so I declined, but I applied for it, and because my boss loved me for my previous post, I was hired immediately. But now that I'm back home I can't help but worry, worry about if I'll oversleep on the first day (beginning of next week at 8:00 in the morning), or if I truly can't handle it and need to bow out, the fact that I was told these jobs don't pay well and depend on rooms, or the fact that I completely forgot to explain this was a temporary hire, because I plan on moving out when this is all over and it's safe to do so. Is this just me being anxious over being back on a job or is it as bad as I feel like it's going to be?

989,"First, some Background about my parents-- 

My mom is narcissistic.  My dad was strict and went  away on business trips for most of my childhood to get away from my mother.  

When my parents were married neither parent spent much time with me.  On to more recent times--
After my parents divorced 4 years ago, my dad became a lot nicer.  He spent time with me, and it turned out we have things in common.

My dad met E and started dating E about two years ago, and proposed to her about a year ago.  At the time, I knew he was dating her, and was fine w/ it, because  he seemed happy.
However, he waited to tell me he had proposed to her.  It was when the two of us were driving to the airport for our  vacation together that he told me she was now his fiancee.

While we were going to the airport I also found out that E and her kids were going on the vacation w/ us.  
 I can count the times I've seen her and her kids on one hand and don't know them much at all.
I had looked forward to a vacation full of me and my dad spending time together.  My dad didn't ditch me for E exactly, but he hung out with her, and E's daughters hung out with each other.  E's daughters and I didn't talk or anything.

I felt like an awkward 5th wheel.
That was bad enough, but the other part of it was that my dad and i go on vacation to the same place every year-- a cottage on the beach, and have been doing that for the past fourteen years.  The trip was extremely special to me but that year it lost its specialness.   Before my parents divorced, my mom used to go with us to the cottage too.  It was the memories of my mom being there that bothered me a lot. 

 When I saw E in the house I'd think of how my mother used to be there.  Every time I saw D and K (E's daughters) staying in the room next to mine I'd think about how I used to stay in their room. 
Another reason I was uncomfortable with E being on vacation with us is cuz she's a good mom and a nice person.  She loves her kids D and K.  I wish she'd been my mom growing up. When I see her hug her kids with love , it reminds me my mom isn't like that.

Overall,  I was sad about the vacation.  I didn't let my dad know  because I wanted him to be happy,  so I acted like I was fine with it.  
Also, I thought I could address E and the vacation with my dad in the future, but things happened with my mom that made me decide not to.  I thought my mom knew about E.  Nope.

In January, she demanded whether my dad was seeing someone (keep in mind they had been divorced for 4 yrs at this point) and he told her about E.  My mom asked if E had gone on vacation with us, and my dad said yes.   My mom was angry about this since she still has feelings for my dad.   

She believed my dad and I had worked together to keep E secret from her.  Mom decided every thing she didn't like about me, real and imagined, must be because of E going on vacation with us.  She was mad at my dad for months about E going to the cottage

 Finally,  a year has passed and she's no longer mad,  things have settled down.  My dad heard enough about that vacation from my mom for the rest of his life. I decided not to bring up the vacation and E to my dad because my mom had been so pissed about it.  
  

This year's vacation:

 I'm going back to the cottage again this year with my dad, E, and her daughters one month from now.  (I don't know when they'll get married.  Thats been suspended indefinitely)

Here's my dilemma:

I still feel sad about the last vacation from last year, so I'm not exactly looking forward to the next one.  Knowing that I'm going back to the cottage with all of them in a month has made a lot of compartmentalized feelings resurface for me.  I'm upset because I know that E and her daughters are now permanent additions to the trip, and still will be year after year.

Do you have any advice that could make accepting E and her daughters as part of my dad and I's vacation and family easier??
Thank you !!",11Jun2020,2

1000,"My family, my friends and the aquaintances have fought with me over the most trivial shit. Until I fought with my best friend today,  I thought it was everyone around me that was wrong and I was right and they couldn't understand my point of view. In general I am a lazy guy who likes to know why a person is doing an activity before indulging in it himself. When I dont understand why I should do something or why we shouldn't do something in a different way, I do one of two things.

Ask why we shouldn't do something.

Or try it on my own time and suggest we should do my method.

For some reason every time I do one of the two things listed above people take it the wrong way and assume I just dont want to listen to them, and this is me being arrogant. My best friend and I had a difference in opinion of how I do a certain activity and I thought I was trying to implement everything he adviced me to do so. But it didn't bear fruit for a long time and he snapped at me saying u don't learn from ur mistakes u just do it over and over again despite my best attempts. He says this when he doesn't listen to any of the advice I give him. But I dont want to just say I am in the right I shouldn't apologize, because he is my best and only friend and I find it hard to make friends who I can talk to.

1003,"I got a job promotion in April of last year. It bumped me up from the $11 per hour I was making to $15.25 per hour. It also turned my 10-15 minute commute into 45 minutes on a good day and as much as an hour plus with traffic. I had been working for the company for about 1 1/2 years at that point and was already a bit burnt out but the promotion seemed like a good opportunity to try something new. I quickly realized that among other things at the new job the daily commute was very taxing. I told my manager that I would stay on for a year and would probably leave after that, she thought that was a good plan and even made sense because I would earn a bonus come the end of the fiscal year which would be around the next April, though I wasn’t given any indication as to how much the bonus would be. Some days were much better than others but I stayed for a year and kept my promise. Then COVID hit. My manager contacted me while I was away and said that our corporate office had decided to withhold all bonuses until January 2021 so I would have to wait an additional 7 months for the bonus. I’m really not a fan of my job anymore or my commute so I told my manager I would be leaving even though I wouldn’t get the bonus. I said I would stay until August to give them enough time to find a replacement. Then it crossed my mind that maybe I would just stay until October which would be my 3 year anniversary of working with the company and that would be a nice round way to end it. Then it occurred to me that if I was willing to stay until October why wouldn’t I just stay an additional 3 months until January and get the bonus? I really don’t enjoy my job anymore, I know my work ethic has decreased and I’m not proud of it but I just can’t decide if it’s worth staying for the money even though I don’t know how much it is. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.

a) be super supportive for her in this tough time, and 
b) not lose my mind in all of this.

I have no children, and am not maternal at all but I know she will need all the help she can get and honestly her kids are super sweet.

1007,"I want to start by saying my mother isn't intentionally trying to starve us or something. But she has a lot of mental health issues that effect my siblings and I. She's not diagnosed, but I am 90% sure she has anorexia, and I guess that is effecting how much food she thinks we need. 

Usually she comes home, says she doesn't feel like cooking and has us find something in the kitchen to eat. Sometimes she'll bring home some fries or Mac and cheese and say that's my dinner. Sometimes I just skip meals, because asking for food makes her annoyed at best, irrationally angry at worst. She complains that all we do is eat and she goes to the store ""three times a day"" though all she brings back is eggs and bread and milk, cans of soup the better things that she wants us to eat. 

Our dad isn't around at the moment, and we're pretty much cut off from other family. I love my mom and I don't think she's intentionally trying to abusive us, but I think she's so used to skipping meals herself that she thinks that's how we should live. It doesn't help that I'm underweight and have been making an effect to try and eat more, but it's impossible when we legitimately don't have food. 

I'm 16F if that matters, my younger sister is 8 and my older is 18, but she doesn't have a job or car yet. I've been applying places to work, partly so I can just buy my own food.

1022,"My(M36) wife(F35) and I are the parents of two boys (7) and (9). For as long as they have been old enough to understand speech I’ve told my boys the importance of exercising. I encourage them to do simple things like push-ups, pull ups, sit ups, bodyweight squats and the like. Things you can do at home without much equipment. This is something they see me doing every day and want to emulate anyway. My wife didn’t think it was a big deal, just a dad encouraging his boys to be healthy. Because they’ve been doing this for a few years they are relatively strong for their age. We’ve also gotten lucky that they are some of the sweetest kids. 

Recently with our state opening back up, we’ve had some relatives visit. My brother visited with his wife and two kids (13m) (6f). For whatever reason my nephew decided to pick on my oldest boy, taking his things, and pushing him. My wife wanted me to say something to my brother but I told her it was important for our son to figure out how to stand up for himself. Eventually my son had had enough and when my nephew pushed him he pushed him back, knocking him over. When he got up the two boys began to fight, with my son over-powering his cousin fairly quickly. Both my brother and I at this point did step in and separated the boys. We talked to them about the importance of not fighting with family and treating each other kindly so it doesn’t lead to a fight. But neither of us really were too harsh on our boys. Lord knows my brother and I fought each other a lot when we were kids. 

After it was settled we made them hug it out and it seem to resolve the issue. Later when it was just my wife and I she let me know how bothered she was our son had reacted that way. She wanted me to teach him to just ignore instead of fighting. I tried to tell her that was a dangerous lesson because sometimes you do need to fight. This led to an argument with her using an example of why her brother growing up never needed to fight anyone, telling me he could always just make his enemies into a friend. I countered with my telling her of almost always having to fight growing up because some kids have a predatory nature. We ended up not seeing eye to eye but I agreed to talk to our son after my brother’s family left. 

When they did I talked to both of my boys about the fight. I asked my son why he pushed his cousin and fought with him, and he told me he just wanted him to leave him alone. I asked if he meant to hurt him and he said no, he just wouldn’t listen when he told him to stop. I told him he didn’t do anything wrong in my opinion, and that I would rather he stood up for himself, even if it takes a fight to do that. My youngest spoke up and said something like “but mom says we’re not supposed to hit”. I told him she was right, most of the time. I tried to explain the difference between attacking someone for no reason and defending yourself. They seemed to understand what I was saying. 

My wife caught the tail end of our talk but waited for me to finish. When I sent the boys up to their room for the night she and I had another argument. She said I was teaching our boys to be violent, and was being a bad father. I told her that as our boys become men they’re going to deal with people that try to hurt them and fight them, and that they would have to understand how to defend themselves. I told her part of the reason I’ve always encouraged them to exercise is so that when that happens they have an edge, giving the example of how our nine-year-old boy was beating his larger 13-year-old cousin when they fought. Finding out this is why I was always so adamant about them exercising infuriated her and she accused me of going behind her back to encourage them to be violent. We argued for another while, until eventually she went to sleep on the couch. 

We still haven’t resolved this, but I wholeheartedly believe that my boys should know how to be violent if they need to be. I also want to start enrolling them in wrestling when they are able to because I want them to be as effective as they can be when they fight. Am I being unreasonable?

TL;DR: I encourage my sons to exercise so they can be strong, and tell them it’s OK to fight if they need to, and my wife says I’m encouraging violence and being a bad father.",11Jun2020,2
1023,"Last Friday I hung out with a guy friend. My guy friend had hung out with a girl who had covid the night before (he didn’t know she had Covid at the time). she tested positive the other day so I went out and got tested this morning since I was with my guy friend last Friday. I have no symptoms.

I got the rapid test this morning and it’s negative. My question is even tho I could possibly have been exposed last week, I know it can take up to 14 days to show symptoms. Is my test 100% accurate or could I develop the virus still?

1024,"So when I was in highschool this guy had a crush on me. We would talk and I started to like him. As the years went by I realized that I didn’t like him, I only liked the attention I got from him. Plus I didn’t really like his personality, he was kind of mean and awkward to talk to. He got a girlfriend and at first I was hurt bc I was considering giving him a shot. Then I realized well I don’t like him and of course I don’t expect him to stay around. So after a while I was cool with it until she left school and he started talking to me again. At this point I was like wow you forgot about her real quick huh and I didn’t want to talk to him anymore. He asked to kiss me and I was like uh no. He left school and I was kind of relieved bc I just didn’t want to talk to him. He was not good at having conversations.

Fast forward a couple years and he still tries to talk to me. He txt me on my birthday and tries to talk to me through social media. I’ve ignored him. I know what your thinking wow your are really mean. And you are probably right. Although wouldn’t you think after all these years he would just stop? Now my question is do I continue to ignore him or do I tell him to stop? From his perspective he is trying to talk to an old friend/crush. From mine its some ( I apologize for the rudeness but I’m trying to be honest) creepy, mean, awkward guy who does not get the hint, trying to talk to me. If I do tell him to stop what is the most polite way I can do this? Thanks for the help!",11Jun2020,0

1027,"long story short, I ended a friendship with a close friend by reducing communication with her because she was really lazy/ unmotivated/ negative even though I tried my absolute best to help her and I felt like it was taking a toll on me and affecting me in a negative way. I feel really bad now though so I think it would be mature/ kind of me to reach out and just provide some closure and let her know why I ended it because I don’t want her to feel confused/ sad. But how do I tell her in a kind way? “I didn’t want to be friends with you because of your lack of motivation/ laziness/ negative thinking was taking a toll on me” sounds kind of mean.

Me and my good friend since we were like 12 both 21M.  We’ve always been into fishing and picked back up with the spring bass fishing. Long story short we end up looking for a boat to buy together. My dad knows a guy with a beater for 500. We go buy it and he tells me he’ll give me the cash on his payday ( no big deal). We buy it and I clean it up,fix the motor, and get it registered. We go to Walmart he buys a fishing rod and some tackle because he’s going with some friends fishing this weekend. I buy fire extinguisher, air horn, life jackets, throwable device and a trolling motor. All the time he’s saying my bad bro I still need to pay you. We go out again I but lights and black lights for the boat, he bought a reel. Then yesterday, he came over as I was testing the boat for leeks, he helps me flip it over and sand the bottom to apply adhesive to fix a few drips.  We get done and he’s on my porch scrolling through marketplace looking for boats. Then apparently he’s had an old boat at his house the whole time, and LEAVES my house and goes home and starts sanding the bottom of his boat and sending me videos of him working on it, when I’ve done everything to this one and he’s hasn’t bothered to buy a thing or help once.

Extra info I’m currently unemployed right now from the COVID stuff so I “should be working on the boat” which I get but shouldn’t be an excuse to not help. 

He also convinced me to let him go in half on this one by Saying “you know how motivated i am dude I’ll keep you focused.”

Also I didn’t intend to have this much money in this project and time.

1031,"I was in a relationship from the age of 16 up until January this year. We were together 7-8 years. I've now realised we were both not great for each other at all. And it's helped stop missing her as such. She broke it off with me and I was destroyed at first. We went through a FWB phase after the breakup then a phase of a toxic relationship for a couple months until 2-3 weeks ago she ended it with me and wanted to stay friends. Then last week I told her I didn't want to talk anymore.

I know everyone just says work on yourself, go to the gym etc etc. Atm we're on lockdown, mentally I haven't been great since it started and when me and her were FWB it helped me get by, having her stay the night and semi regular sex. I just kinda miss having someone there. Holding them at night. Holding her breasts. Having sex regularly. Lying in bed cuddling all day. Massages. Making her breakfast in bed etc. I don't miss her, I just miss being in a relationship. I've only really been single 2-3 weeks of my entire adulthood and it just feels like I'm missing a big part of my happiness and what I enjoy.

Any tips for being single at this time? I've literally never been single my whole adulthood and now the one time I am, we're locked down. I hate to think it, but I'll probably be single for another year atleast and probably won't be hooking up with anyone in that time with the way lockdown is in the UK.

1035,"I got a request for a meeting with my boss yesterday. Not unusual, I meet with them often, especially since the US has gone to shit. When I log on, it's not just my boss, it's half a dozen other people. They explain that after a year, they don't think I'm a good fit, and in light of budget cuts they're letting me go. This was my first big-girl job out of grad school. 

I know it's probably childish, but I didn't know what to say so I just kept saying ""okay"" and trying not to cry until it was over. They never really explained why they were letting me go, and honestly I kind of don't want to know. I know I shouldn't take it personally, but it's hard to when I threw myself into this job so completely. I cared about it a lot. The environment was so toxic at time, but I had good friends there, and I felt like I was making a difference in the world. I genuinely tried my best, but my best wasn't good enough, something I've been told over and over again my whole life due to my multiple learning disabilities. I feel like absolute garbage. I feel like I scarified so much of my own well-being for this, and in the end I got thrown away like garbage. They never even expressed that they were displeased with me, and up until a few weeks ago they were actively praising me. This feels like it came out of nowhere. 

I know there's a lot of problems going on in the world rn, and that I'm just one of a million people suffering right now, but it feels like my whole world has just come crashing down on me. I know it's only been a day, but I'm afraid of not finding another job because of corona. I'm scared of having to move away from the life I established here, back to my parents house. I'm scared if I do find a job it'll make me miserable. Just a few weeks ago I was saying how lucky I was to still have a job, how grateful I was, and was trying to help others who weren't so lucky. I felt like my mental health was starting to get better for the first time in years. I'm so tired of trying to do the right thing and having it blow up in my face. I'm tired of giving something my all only for people who don't care to understand me to accuse me of not caring when I care so much it hurts.

I absolutely do not intend to marry or have kids. I despise children, i am in no shape way or form able to look after one. 


Here's the thing, my parents are very insisting on me not moving out because they want me to take care of them as they age. But not only them, they also want me to babysit my sister's future kids, as she just got hitched last month.


I absolutely dread the idea of my family trapping me like this. I no longer think they see me as an independent woman but only as a care taker. Something i never was and never will be. 


I don't have a healthy relationship with my family. My plans were to move out and cut contact for personal reasons. I don't want to get into detail, but my family is not nice and they have a tendency to prioritize ""family"" no matter what happens for better or worse. 


I am latin American, this is a culture that is unfortunately very family oriented. Every time i am forced to spend time with my family there's a sense of dread due to past trauma. 


I hate my sister and her entitled personality. ""It's the duty of the youngest kid to take care of the family"".

I'm a foreign worker in the UK in the past 3 years(working in hospitality) . Now due to pandemic, I've been furlough since 1st of April until 31 May which got extended to end of July . We all know how quarantine was and etc. Don't have to explain. But I've decided to return to my home country since hotels are not really opening for another 2 months(nearly). I closed my tenancy with my landlord cuz I didn't want to pay 2months (maybe even more) rent for no reason. But I still have some credit cards that I haven't paid and overdraft. Total value ~£1500-2000. In case they make me redundant I'm thinking to stay home for real. I live in a rural area and jobs here aren't that many and they pay around £300-400(I'll survive after my home improvements). I won't be able to pay any of that debt to banks 🤔. I might sound like a piece of sh*t, but I don't want to pay the credit cards with the furlough salary. I want to use that salary for home improvements (as now I have a long holiday to say so).
I'm still paying minimum amount for credit cards, but in case I'll be redundant and I won't have any money in that accounts, what will happen?

I met with the director she told me that she was really interested by me and that I would fit in the job. She didn’t do an interview but asked me to give her my references and she called them. She told me to tell her If I would have other offers because she still has other interviews of other candidates... what does that mean ? I still haven’t got a response and it’s been almost a week. Thanks,11Jun2020,2
1066,"I have a specific type of inaomnia where once I wake up its impossible to fall asleep again, and so i set it up so I would tire myself out by 12 and hopefully fall asleep tired enough to not somehow for whatever reason wake up, and its worked most days the past month. Now its the night before the most important exam of my life and I got woken up by my brother and his friends screaming and laughing right outside the house and not only am I pissed, I'm also well aware of how much this impacts my exam. I'm pissed because while he was in my place taking these exams, I was not allowed to bring anyone home or make any sort of noise, I did not play any music and gave up on guitar for over a month and now because he's an adult and he's independent he's being inconsiderate like this.

And now, I have to deal with laying awake in bed for several hours only to wake up drained of all mental energy for my exam. So please, if you have any advice you think can help please let me know

1067,"Hi, I'm currently stuck in a rut. I've been in this rut for a long time since around October 2018. I started my A levels in September of that year. I didn't do amazing at the end of that year or anything but it wasn't that bad in hindsight. Due to my emotional state at the time however I decided to change school and course entirely. That was the worst decision I've ever made.

Fast forward to now and I'm doing A levels again in September. Problem is, I have no friends... Literally no one my age, I've pushed them all away, and now they're all off to uni soon while I'm stuck here feeling sorry for myself. Especially since if I had stuck with it I would have 3 free A levels because of corona.

I don't know what to do. I don't think I know how to socialise with people that are my own age. I'm not even convinced that's my problem, I just feel shit all the time :(. I really want to be happy and I'm trying to do several hours of A levels while looking after my fitness each day but I'm not sure if it's worth it if I feel like this all the time. 

I'm wasting what's supposed to be the best years of my life.

There's alot more to my story so please ask questions if you need context. I'm really in dire need for some help, advice or something. Thank you.",11Jun2020,1
1068,"Hey guys, need personal relationship advice and suggestions.

I am a married guy (32) away from my wife during the lockdown. I have been hanging out with a girl (27 ish), who is pretty cool, knows that I am married, and I think she is also in a relationship which I do not think is going to work out. We flirt a lot. I get the feeling that she is interested in me.
She will leave soon back to her home country, and I am ready to ask her out, even though we have a little time left together.

1074,"My boyfriend passed away unexpectedly last year and I had moved with him prior to another state we were living here for about 8-9 months before he died. When I had announced to my friends I was moving with him they didn’t seem too happy for me, they made me feel like I was making a stupid mistake. I just felt their energy and backed off a bit, we still remained in contact but the only time we ever spoke was when I would contact them first. Well after he passed away, you would think with them being my best friends for over 10-15+ years they would reach out to me and see if I’m okay considering I’m alone in a different state. It’s like they completely ghosted me, I contact them first, they never reach out me. It’s like after I lost him I lost my friends too. What did I do to them? Ever since I found happiness with my boyfriend before I moved they started to leave me out of stuff and not invite me anywhere. 

I personally thought that they were jealous that I was escaping our small town and moving to a big city and starting my life.

So, through the help of an egg donor and a fertility clinic, my parents were able to use my dad’s sperm and have us! 
We didn’t know this information until December of 2019, and since then I’ve been trying to find my bio mother and siblings. The problem is I only have her first name and the name of the clinic (which has since changed because this happened over 21 years ago).

My parents have no other information and from what I’ve read on the paperwork, they aren’t withholding anything from me. I want a relationship with my siblings (assuming that’s what they want too) but I also want some medical background from my bio mother. I want to know what I can expect as I get older.

i posted a picture a couple hours before and didnt tag her, but her bestfriend that i became friends with, through her and we have been talking a bit during quarantine 

the old friend said that she didnt understand why i didnt tag her, but her bestfriend who i apparently dont even talk to, eventho weve been caling eachother once like every two weeks and texted idk its not too much but more than me and my old friend have. and she was clearly texting in a mad kind of tone and said she thinks its stupid


i went on saying that my friendships are none of her business and that its just a post. just because i didnt tag her means i hate her. 

she then said that she thinks its annoying that i havent texted her in months, which i understand, but she hasnt either. she sent me a posts every other day a couple months ago, but then also stopped. so no one texted. 

i, as an introvert dont really like talking to people, im not really outgoing either and only have like 3 people i ever text first. I understand that shes upset i never texted her but she didnt either, and were both freshmen in highschool and honestly i didnt know what sje expected after leaving my school. it shows that we only were school friends and that friendships end.

1092,"This is a bit of a weird one, and I strongly suspect I'm in the wrong - but hopefully someone can help me out!

My friend (24m, I'm 20f) has been living alone during lockdown. From the end of March, we were video calling and phoning every day - normally instigated by him. He would often moan about how his other group of friends (who, awkwardly, includes my ex boyfriend) never started conversations with him, how they talked about things he wasn't interested in on group calls, etc. I felt really sorry for him as that isn't a nice position to be in, so kept up the constant contact that he wanted. I like the guy a heck of a lot, and I was really worried that his mental health would take a downturn if he was too isolated. He would constantly say how I was getting him through lockdown. The oddest thing was - one of his close friends lives down the street from him, but he wouldn't go see her. I, however, am isolating 150 miles away from him! I know I was a bit motherly with him, trying to encourage him to go out for walks when he didn't have the motivation - but he actually said outright that he liked me mothering him a bit! 

Uni exams started in late May though, and I had to tell him that I couldn't video call all day whilst I was revising. (I also wanted to spend time with my family, which wasn't happening whilst we were talking constantly.) He made comments about how it was ""off"" that we weren't talking as much, and I apologised profusely, telling him how stressed I was and that I just needed to shut myself away and study. I still made sure to ring him when I could, but he was off and tetchy when I did.

By the time my exams actually started, he was starting to totally ignore me. He'd leave my messages unread for hours, then give short, often rude replies. Again, I kept apologising for being distant in that couple of weeks. I asked if we could video call or phone - but he started spending every evening talking to the friends he apparently disliked so much, which felt like a bit of a kick in the teeth, I won't lie!

I've tried gently asking if anything I've said or done has irritated him, because I'm terrified that's the case. I've tried pinning him down for a conversation, but he won't commit. After two months of talking for hours a day, I just feel rejected. Do I just say sod it and send him a message explaining why I'm feeling upset and ignored, or is that too brash? Or from all this, does it sound like I'm in the wrong and I've got more apologising to do myself? I'm just so worried that a long message will sound petty and accusatory.

I really shouldn't be in this situation, we're 20 and 24 ffs... This feels like high school all over again 😂

1094,"I (23F) have never been very good at making friends my own age.
I'd say I am older headed and I am very engaged in my job and university but would definitely make time for a friend. 
I have a lovely boyfriend of 5 years and we live together he has his friends and would never stop me from having mine. 
I don't go out to bars/clubs very much unless it's a work event as I have no one to go with. 
I have started my own business and I am now on my own there as I currently don't need any staff, so my work friends who are a few years older than me, married with kids haven't spoken to me since the move in January. 
I don't have any friends at university as I'm going into my second year now and all the other students are alot older (I'd say 30-50. I'm the youngest there) and are employed there already so im out of place as I sit on my own now so I don't get destracted as I was sat within a click but didn't enjoy it as when I needed to listen they would be giggling or talking.
I have tried to make back friends with 2 girls I used to hand around with in school talking about plans to meet up as I haven't seen them in 7 years they both still live at home one working in a chip shop and the other in a care setting and I know they are both unhappy working there and I always feel like I can't mention my life and how much I love my job incase they stop talking to me but the conversations stoped when one of them asked me to loan them some money and I refused and said I'm not working now due to COVID and that was the last time I spoke to them about 3 weeks ago. 
One other girl (28) who I tend to speak to, just tries to use me because I can drive, to sometimes take her places or bring her bits from the supermarket as she has 2 kids with no farther she can be supportive at times but it frustrates me as she has never offered me fuel money even though I would refuse it, I have gone through the whole being used to drop people off at home from college ect before and cut them out very quickly.
I tend to attract people who just want to use me. 
I have always got on with people who are older than me but because I'm not on the same page as them with getting married or having kids, I'd like to say I'm very career driven and currently none of that interests me, but I have always been engaged in the conversation and try not to let them know that that's not what I want to do unless I get asked if I will have kids and they are all surprised when I say I'm not sure.
 I have never had a good friend to talk to only my mother (who thinks I'm better off without friends as she herself attracts the same users and doesn't have any close friends) and my partner and there are some things you can't do or talk about with either. 
I have been in 2 long term relationships since I was 14 and the one I am currently in and my first relationship wouldn't let me have any friends in school and I then developed anxiety.

I lost myself senior year, it was horrible - I got denied from 18 colleges, eventually got off a waitlist in late may. then, while in college, i had numerous health problems. i went deaf (long story, lol), i got pericarditis (infection in my heart) and was also harrassed in my sorority. then i dropped out of my out of state school, moved back to community college at home only for there to be coronavirus. while in quarantine, i broke my jaw and was wired shut for 3 weeks. i am still recovering from that. 

my anger issues have gotten to consume my life. i get furious at little things going wrong. i had a mental breakdown the other day at my dad for years worth of hurt - however, my anger consumed me and i spiraled out of control. when he tried grabbing my keys out of my hand, i sort of blacked out. my body just started stabbing him with the keys on his hand. he is luckily ok but i haven't spoken to him in three days. one of my brothers (14M) has started bullying me over my anger. he makes fun of me when his friends are here, he is always trying to provoke me. my friends have started bullying me for it too. i know it sounds stupid but it is really hard to deal with. 

i need genuine help. i don't know how to calm down. my chest is always tight, I'm constantly tense. i will grab or break things when I'm alone. the only way i can stay remotely calm is smoking weed but i don't want to become dependent on a substance.

Even when we can't relate to each other, we understand we are 2 different people.  His parents are very mean to him on a regular basis.  We both have a problem of not wanting our issues to be other peoples issues, so he doesn't tell me the full details of everything. However, as someone who has known him a long time, I can tell that he is affected by his parents' behavior.

Whether its subtle behavior changes or his lack of interest on the topic, or even his self destructive behavior, the signs are there.  We both come from not so nice households and its something we've bonded over in the past. Around the same time we both got into drugs.  I never strayed too far and only stuck to smoking pot and an occasional drink, but he has done stuff from pain meds to molly. We recently went on a beach trip and he took 2 pills in the car on the ride home. I haven't had a strong confrontation with him about it but I have shown my distaste for it. 

I've heard him tell me how he had a knife to his own throat and his dad looked him in the eyes and said ""I don't care about you, I only care about your sisters"". I don't know how to talk to him about it because we are both guys and we have masculinity, you know?  I don't know what I should do or if I should even do something.

I’d like to preface this with the fact that I certainly don’t plan to get married anytime soon, I’m 19 and have only been with my partner like a year and a half. But life’s been boring lately, so I can’t deny I like to think about the future. 

So, here’s the thing- I don’t know if I exactly like the idea of marriage. We all know it’s kinda been born of outdated misogynistic practices, and while it might be better now, it still feels a bit traditional and like a way we’re pressured to make a relationship “socially accepted”. Like, people don’t think you’re as serious or valid as lovers if you don’t eventually start thinking of marriage, or get married.. it bugs me. 

I love the idea of a wedding as a way to celebrate a relationship and commitment to one another, but i hate the implications of needing to legally tie yourself to someone to be viewed as a valid partnership, socially and in the eyes of the law. I feel like the only reason I’d want to consider getting married is financial, ex. taxes and healthcare, which is shitty, cause i just don’t think that’s what it should be about. So i guess i’m torn on how to feel about it all, and would appreciate someone to talk to and figure out these feelings. 

So, how should i feel about the concept of marriage? My partner seems like they don’t think as much as I do (no offense), they just see it as a kinda “normal thing people do that’d maybe be nice someday”, so I don’t even know what to say to them..",11Jun2020,2

1113,"The other day my ""boyfriend"" and I decided to take a step back from the whole relationship thing, i had lived at his house for a month or so during quarentine and it became to be too much for the both of us.. the talk we had was super awesome and we ended up being on the same terms and it was great, we just want to be friends for right now. The issue is that now that it's a few days following the event I keep finding myself getting pissed off at him. I literally have no reason to be mad at him, I feel like my mind is  trying to be mad at him so I dont get hurt by him, essentially putting a wall between us. But I 1. Dont want this wall there, he's my bestfriend and 2. Dont want to ruin our friendship as we are also apart of the same friend group. 
Do I say something to him? 
If anyone has anything to say on this matter please let me know, because I know if I dont change something itll only get worse, but (one of) my issue(s) is that I dont know what to change.

Also, taking a complete step back to give myself time isnt really an option otherwise I dont get to see a big group of my friends, and we also have an event to attend in a group next weekend..",11Jun2020,1

i am young, and still prone to many, many hormonal changes (puberty lmao) but i recently lost weight (155 to 135-ish) and my breast size has dramatically increased, however, the band size has gone down. i have always had rapid breast growth over puberty, going from a training cup to a b cup just from 5th to 6th grade, to a c cup in 7th, and then to a d in 8th. at the beginning of the year (september) i was a 34d, and now that i have gone and gotten sized today, i am a 32g.

my mom made jokes about it at first, but now she's talking about taking me to get a breast reduction because of possible future issues, and then said that i should ""work out more"" because i am ""gaining weight"". in fact, between january and now, i have lost the weight as stated above very quickly, and i don't understand how this happened so quickly. my mom is also a little concerned since i have always had larger and fast-growing breasts and she's always been a little flatter, to be blunt (36b). the same with my sister (32b), who as also grown not nearly as quickly. i don't know if this is a puberty thing or something to actually be concerned about whether now or later. i also am scared about making permanent changes and surgery to my body, as my mom wants, while i am still so young.

1132,"So the title says most of it but I’ll divulge! TLDR at the bottom!

My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years now. He is a very confident, self assured and happy man with no mental or physical health problems (felt like I should specify). But lately he’s developed a tick - he clicks his tongue on the lid of his mouth while his mouth is shut so it makes a sort of muted clicking sound. I sometimes catch him doing it every 10 or 20 minutes, sometimes only once every hour or two. But he’s only started doing this in the last few months and he’s never had any sort of tick or anything before! The only times he doesn’t do it is if he’s eating (obviously) or having sex (thankfully). 

I’ve tried asking him already why he does this and he said he doesn’t even realise he does it. I asked if he has anything on his mind or anything troubling him and he said he’s happier than he’s been for a while and he has no concerns. But this clicking noise is starting to bug me and I’m not understanding why he’s doing it! He gets a little agitated when I mention that he’s done it or ask him to try stop. I understand that ticks are uncontrollable and he says he doesn’t realise he’s doing it, but I’m just finding it odd.

Could anyone try to explain why he might’ve developed this tick and how I can go about making it stop?

TLDR: my boyfriend often clicks his tongue on the lid of his mouth - why does he do this and how can I help him stop?",11Jun2020,1

1139,"It would appear as though a fear of mine has spiraled into a phobia— Thanatophobia, to be exact. The fear of dying. 

I used to have it terribly when I was a kid due to ongoing trauma. I’d spend my nights awake, terrified that I wouldn’t wake up if I fell asleep. Lately, with COVID (and the resulting being stuck inside) my mental health has plummeted, bringing back the constant fear along with crippling depression and anxiety. It’s gotten to the point that I spend so much of my day having panic attacks as a result of this, leaving me with no time of actual awareness. I just lose myself in wave after wave of white hot sheer terror. And when I’m not afraid of death, I spend my time believing (genuinely) that I’m a horrible person. 

I’ll believe I cheated on my SO when in reality I’ve been nothing but faithful. I’ll believe that I abuse my cat simply because I didn’t want her on my desk at that current time. I’ll believe any number of things, and I feel more and more like my own memories aren’t to be trusted.

The only things I look forward to anymore is curling up with my SO at night, my bi-weekly outings with a skills coach, and my upcoming move.

I find it worth noting that I take multiple medications, and have wondered if my recent and frequent substance use (weed) is interacting with it.

I’ve tried every coping skill I know (I’ve been in therapy for a good ten years now). Breathing exercises, meditation, getting good sleep, dieting, exercise. I’ve even attempted to get back into numerous hobbies, attempted to jump start my social life, and set a schedule for my schoolwork.

I’m at a loss. I’ve tried everything I’ve been taught for more than half my life, and it still isn’t enough. I need help.",11Jun2020,1
1140,"So I'm an immigrant from Thailand who moved to Los Angeles when I was 8 with mom because my step dad lives here. Everything was great for a few years, but as I got older my parents' relationship was decaying. My mom got caught cheating on my step dad, they fought all the time and eventually, after she had enough she just left me here in America alone. Her only child. After several tries my mom would eventually years come back and our relationship is kind of back to normal, but things were never the same for our family. While mom was gone for those years my step dad stepped up and decided to take care of me and looked after me like his own. He  even legally adopted me, making me legally a US citizen as well as his son. But it wasn't all roses. The separation really tore him up. My step dad fell into a depression and he started drinking a lot more. What I didn't know at the time was he's a long time alcoholic so I had no idea how much he's suffering because of the separation. I essentially didn't have parents for the entirety of Middle School and a year of High School. 

When they got back together everything just kept getting worse for us. My step dad got fired from his job because his alcoholism had gotten so bad and he had to go to the hospital every few weeks. Keep in mind my step dad is in his 60s and my mom is almost half is age. My mom is dying inside because she's essentially a hospice caregiver and cleans my step dad's mess while he drinks away his severance  package and savings. He spends most of his time drunk out of his mind and he's sober. He's the only provider in our household neither me or my mom work which meant we only had a limited time left. Their plan was for me to graduate high school, then I'd figure out what I wanted to do myself while they moved back to Thailand.

Now: For the past two years because of everything that happened my mental health was quickly declining. I barely passed junior year and coming into senior year I was already drained. Again, I barely passed the first semester, but this semester I failed several classes. Everything was just all too much and I couldn't handle the pressure. I couldn't do any assignments or homework because I couldn't even maintain my focus on it. I can't even read a paragraph without being distracted and losing my focus. But in the end, it's my fault my work didn't get done and no matter what excuse it is. I've always been the silent type to never ask for help and I feel ashamed when I do. I haven't ever really talk about any of this with anyone.

Today, while my step dad and mom were fighting about what I'm gonna do because as I said earlier, we only had a limited time left because of our money situation. My mom just told her honestly, if I was gonna graduate or not. All I could do was just look into sad and disappointed eyes and tell her no.  It was the first time in my life to ever see her in so much hurt and pain. All she told me before she left is that she never had the opportunity to learn further education and she only came to America because she wanted to give my life a better future. My step dad was equally hurt even though we haven't had the strongest relationship within the past few years and discussed what I should be doing instead. My relationship with my parents isn't the only one damaged because of my stupidity. The relationship I've built up in the last year with the girl I want to be for a very long time is threatened. And I can't blame her for wanting someone without a future.

Now that I'm 18 years old, I can't keep running or hiding from my problems. I'm sad and ashamed of myself for letting this happen. I can't stop thinking about the actions I've caused and affected the people around. I'm just so ashamed and frustrated with all those I've disappointed I can't stop crying when I think about it. What should I be doing? I want my future to mean something, but I'm scared I don't want to be a failure. While my friends grow up and leave I don't to be the only one left behind.

1142,"I don't know if this will be a cohesive post, but here goes. I've been very fortunate in my life, nothing to crazy has ever happened to me, or my family. I consider myself lucky. Thing is, lately I've been feeling awful. As if there is constant butterflies in my stomach, but it hurts, and frustrates me. I've never been to content and happy with myself, but I never truly understood why. I am considered the 'jokester' around my friends, and even though I don't want this label, I play into it. I'm sorry this post has probably been repeated so many times, but I just need someone out there I can talk to, or ask for advice. I've realized that I don't have any real friends. I have friends who I'd consider my best friend, but idk anymore, I don't think I have any friends. Like any real friends. When I was young I moved to a country in the middle east, despite being from Europe, and I just can't get out of my head, what my life would've been like back in Europe. I know I'm not truly being myself over here, but I can't talk to anyone, I have so many inner struggles I battle with everyday, things I wish I could talk about, things that may not even be serious to other people, but matter to me. I know who I want to be, but I don't know how and why and should be that. People see me as so one-dimensional, as a fun-loving jovial person, I wish just one person could take me serious, but by now I've played myself into the role so much nothing matters, I can't be serious around those people anymore.

My childhood is almost over, and I can't get over the fact that I've messed it all up. I always listen to other peoples problems, and of course I care but, what about me? pfft, that wouldn't matter in a million years. So many missed opportunities. I've missed out on everything, and I feel genuinely so horrible about it. Physically sick. Lately I've just had outbursts where I just have to breathe and calm myself down, hiding away from my family, who never see me all day. Its currently 3AM as I write this, I can't sleep, I can't think properly. I know it might be a stupid situation that probably doesn't even matter but jesus christ I just really want someone to talk to, or some advice on what to do next. I wish I could reveal more about ''who I am'' in this post but I'm still afraid that my 'friends' will find it and ridicule me for the content of this post.

Where I live, there is nothing to do as a teenager. We are essentially stripped away from any freedom we had in our home countries. I visit my home country often enough, but.... i just.... I wish I had stayed. These problems are probably so miniscule to what other people have gone through, and I apologize if you wasted your time reading this idk. I have this constant thought that my 'friends' are looming over me staring at me intensely as I partake in any private activity. I haven't done so much I should've. Even the basics of teenage life. Like the basics. I won't go in to too much detail, but I don't know how to do a lot of things. I guess what I'm asking you to give me advice is, what I should do? and where I could go to talk to people (maybe in similar situations idk)? I know this situation is probably similar to other ones but you guys are my last hope before I fall into a downwards spiral... I feel it coming, especially these last few days....

&amp;#x200B;

I tell myself ''wait for college'', thats in a year, I could wait, but I don't know, the future just looks so bleak to me, I want to be myself now. firstly, being 'yourself', cringe ik and schools advocate for that, secondly, giving me advice to be myself won't work, I literally can't conjure up the confidence to speak out to friends when theyre being judgemental/horrible. They aren't horrible people, but they just don't care about me, theyre amazing people, and perfect for one another, but I can't seem to find ANYONE out there for me, just as a listening voice and leading hand. I literally can't be myself, where I live it's socially unaccepted and I know I couldn't live a year with my friends knowing these things about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to try go to sleep now. Quarantine seemed to help with this, but I've realized its just my slow detour into downwardness (idk what i even mean by that). I usually use videogames and music to distract me from my problems, but I genuinely think it was my music that literally started this, this constant weight on my shoulders, this punch to the gut, the butterflies. I've always had these feelings, but never this bad. I have been seeing the school therapist behind my parents back. We know each other from before, so she promised to keep everything I say to herself. Since then I stopped talking to her, I don't think it helped enough. I have other problems that contribute to this, but it's all got to do with my head, and not my physical surroundings. Sorry for the long post. I'll check this in the morning and answer any questions. Any comments or any help would be so meaningful to me. Thanks.

1144,"So recently, I had the « opportunity » to check on my boyfriend’s phone while he was in the shower, pretending I had no data anymore and I needed his phone to do a quick something, before giving it to me he first logged himself out of Instagram, but wasn’t smart enough to do it properly so when he handed it out to me and went to the shower, logging back in was the easiest thing.
A year ago my boyfriend confessed to me that during  four years long of us together he cheated on me with several girls, either it be through casual sexting or through physical intercourses. I theb decided to leave him? But he kept sending me messages that he wanted me back and that he would never do that again. I tried to resist but ended up coming back, and this time I felt he was sincere about being loyal and all. 

Nevertheless, I couldn’t recover my trust in him, so when I finally had the opportunity to go on his phone, I was dying to see is he was telling the truth. Sadly, what I found was that he had another Instagram account the kind of ones with a weird username to do weird stuff, and on his main account he was talking suspiciously with girls, and one conversation seemed to be truncated so he is hiding stuff with that specific person.
Anyway, now my question is how do I confront him since I found out about these things through a way I am ashamed of which is secretly accessing to his account after he thought he had logged out?!

Now, I love my mom and know all too well that I need to respect her decisions but every boyfriend she’s had has hurt and has been abusive towards me brothers and I. Including my current SD. He’s so angry, annoying and even downright abusive towards me on occasion. My mom can’t see what the hell he’s doing to my mental state and the fact that he drove away my brothers unless it’s convenient to her. 
I’ve tried to talk to her about him but every time she shuts me down and defends him. Now, I have sensitive triggers to my anxiety like loud noises, especially from men thanks to early childhood trauma. I can mostly keep calm but it’s hard not to panic when he keeps triggering my anxiety nearly every day. He knows about it and he still doesn’t care. I feel really unsafe around him because I’m scared of him but my mom can’t see that. They also get into a fights more than once a week and I’m stuck listening to them. He’s also aggressive with his daughter and the pets we have in the house. He isn’t abusive but I know what it’s like to grow up with a constantly angry and irritated father. My sister is fucked over.

1149,"Hi, everyone. I am a 16 year old male, and I have a rather awkward and difficult relationship with my dad. Now he's not abusive or does drugs or anything like that, but I just still don't feel good around him. For example, he often walks around the home shirtless. Now I know that it's not taboo, but I still feel uncomfortable seeing him without a shirt on, especially considering that he has some weird bumps on his chest and he has an evident potbelly.

And he also has no sense of cleanliness. He often burps and farts without considering other people's feelings. Like he just farts really loud when he's watching TV in the living room or he sings or whistles when he's cooking. I think it's very insensitive that he does this, especially when he knows that it's not polite.

Apart from all that, my dad just does stuff that make me uncomfortable. He sings really loud, and makes me want to die. He also has bad breath. He brushes his teeth at least twice a day, but his breath still stinks. And if anyone tells him about his bad breath, he will get really angry.

The worst part about it is that my dad has absolutely no consideration for my schedule. I have a lot of summer homework for AP Calculus and AP Lit, as well as college applications and several online summer activities this summer. Yet my dad always asks me to help him with his stuff. Like seriously, can he just ask my mom or my sister? It's not like they're unable to help him or anything. Every time he asks me for help, I end up spending the whole afternoon out there in the scorching heat with ticks and ants because he might just ask him to help him carry something, but then he'll need me to help with fifty other tasks. 

And as you probably guessed, my homework does not take me all day to do. But I just feel like that with my leftover time, I can just do what I want rather than helping my dad with some boring stuff that he could just hire someone to do or ask another family member to do.

I've talked to my mom about the bad breath thing and the shirtless thing. Now my mom believes that it is a problem as well, but she doesn't do anything about it because she's the kind of person that as long as you won't die from something, you can live with it. But for me (and possibly my sister), we just can't tolerate my dad.

1150,"i recently turned eighteen and have been planning for a few years to move out of my household. i feel like my family are very toxic towards me and do not have me as one of their priorities- i feel like i get brushed off their shoulder. i am going to a meeting tomorrow with the women who work at the independent living household while my mother thinks that i am going to meet my friend (although i probably will later that day)

i am really just looking for advice because i told mum that i’m going to move out a month ago and she fought with me so much about it that i just gave up out of stress. i have a few undiagnosed mental issues (almost diagnosed until my mum dragged me out of therapy when i told her every time.) i feel like my parents do not try to help me and instead- make me feel worse about myself. i know too that when i move out that day, she will fight me about it. i’ve asked my friend if she can bring a professional to talk to my parents but apparently she isn’t allowed to (i asked my friend because she also has been in independent living for a while) 

can anyone give me any tips? i’m thinking of leaving a note on my bed that says everything i feel. i’m going to end the note with something about how i’m going to block their numbers for 3 days so they have time to cool down and talk to me like adults instead of spam calling me and lashing out on me. is this a good idea? 

i am extremely anxious about this whole situation. i feel as if i can have very severe anxiety and it leaves me really light headed and breathless sometimes. i’m struggling to sleep. especially knowing that there’s someone going to see that room before i go to see that room (because they are next on the list) and if they say they want that room then i’ll have to wait days, weeks or even months for a room. i don’t think i can do that. it’s so stressful to think of.

i could either move out any day now (like from the next 2 days onwards.) i’m looking forward to it but i am so incredibly anxious. 

TLDR: moving into independent living from a horribly unloving household as a teenager with as much help as possible. i’m very anxious about this all. it could be any day now.

Hi. Please could anyone give me some advice on my situation below. I know it’s kinda similar to many posts about relationships here but I do want to make things work with this man. Hopefully I would have chances to discuss with you guys and find my ways.

I’m dating a guy for about two months and we did agree not to see other people at the beginning. Things been working well at first (we spent some weekends together, I met his best friend twice, he likes my company and I could see that clearly) but I found out that he’s still checking his Badoo profile like daily just to check notifications as he explained. He told me he likes spending time with me and hates upsetting me but he’s in terrible mood now. He’s been acting distant lately, I didn’t hear from him some Friday nights, not putting effort to see me, texting me less… as he said he’s getting depressed by his job now. I miss his kind and sweet words when he said he enjoyed being with me or when he texted me to share what was happening around him. What should I do? I do like him and I want the spark back.

Tl;dr Should I stay or leave to save my feelings and my time? When I asked if we were exclusive he said YES with no doubt no wishy-washy and it made me really happy. I do care about him too. He’s got epilepsy.",11Jun2020,1
1156,"EDIT: I am 16M, the girl is 16F, and the boy is 17M. I am in the same grade as the girl, the guy is a year above both of us. We all go to the same school.


They have been dating for a rather long time and I don't see them breaking up with each other. Before they got together, I was already good friends with the guy and somewhat friends with the girl, however I have gotten much much closer to the girl in the past year and I have a relationship with her as much more than my friend's girlfriend.


The first problem is that it can be awkward and difficult to hang out with them at the same time, which is quite unfortunate seeing as I am very close to both of them. They have a habit of having serious conversations about their relationship without regard to the fact that I'm there, which needless to say I don't appreciate. They can also be quite lovey-dovey at times which everyone dislikes to an extent but also leads to my next point.


Seeing them together makes me jealous of the guy, not because of who specifically he is dating, but because of the nature of their relationship. I will elaborate further in the comments if needed but basically I have never had a relationship like that and I would love to but I feel like I'm incapable of it, and constantly seeing them together painfully reminds me of this. 


Naturally, they share everything with each other and I would never expect them not to, but this is quite inconvenient for me. I can't tell one of them something, trivial or grave, unless I'm prepared to sacrifice the expectation that they won't share it with each other. This has become especially serious as I have realized I am bisexual—for certain reasons I can only trust one of them with this information yet to tell one of them would be to tell both of them.


And finally, by far the most serious problem which I reserved for those of you who got through my boring and somewhat long post. I am becoming increasingly worried that I'm in love with the girl and I am positive this can not end well for me. I have become closer and closer to her, grown to trust her more and more, spent more and more time with her, and so on and so forth. So that you guys can hopefully tell me what I *can* do, let me spell out what I *can't* do with regard to this paragraph in particular.


I can't get rid of the girl because this would almost certainly mean getting rid of the guy, as he wouldn't understand why I disassociated myself with her. Obviously, I can't date the girl because I would be betraying my friend, I would look like a total dirtbag, and I would probably end up losing them both. Therefore, my only option is to get over the girl, but I have found this to be impossible given how much I interact with her. 


So what I can do? If anyone here can help with one or more of these situations, I would appreciate it immensely. This has been a plight on me for a long time now and I have no one to turn to who I know personally.


Please help.",11Jun2020,1

1160,"I’m trying to organize a trip with some good friends of mine up to my cottage - supposed to just be me, my twin bro, and 3 other lifelong friends. We all settled on a weekend, but this one friend said he wasn’t sure. When I asked why, he got super defensive and kept telling me he’d just ‘rather a different date’. Cut to 15 minutes ago, he calls me and says “Hey, WE actually can do that weekend”, and when I asked what he meant, he said that his girlfriend is gonna come along. Didn’t ask me if it’s okay, didn’t even say it directly until I asked. I didn’t know what to say cause I don’t wanna hurt him or cause some strain between them (and I could tell he was on speaker phone and she was probably listening), so I just said ok.

It annoys the shit out of me because I know she has him wrapped around his finger and probably isn’t comfortable with him going off on his own for a weekend (sounds like I’m jumping to conclusions, but he has cancelled plans SO MANY times to be with her, and I’ve been in something similar so I know the signs... and I’ve also known him all my life so I can just tell). I hate the idea that I have to entertain someone I really don’t know that well just so she can keep tabs on him. Some advice on how I should proceed would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",11Jun2020,13
1162,"I’m on mobile so sorry if this is rough to read.


I’ll keep this to the point. Basically my fiancé grew up fairly poor. Water, electricity, internet etc being cut often. 

When my fiancé turned 18 they had no phones no water, internet, nothing . So her mom asked to get two cell phones (one for her and her 16 year old brother and one for her mom as my fiancé already had one) and internet in her name. Reluctant she agreed because she didn’t want her single mother to go without under the agreement that she would pay it back. Well I’m assuming you know the rest.

My fiancé is now 24 and started getting collection calls from when she was 18 saying she owes thousands. 

Her mom recently went back to school and got a decent amount in student loans which she is not using it all. We both think it’s good not fair if her mom pays it back. 

Now for where I need advice.

We have a good relationship with her mom and don’t want this to ruin anything. What is a way we can bring this up without things going wrong?",11Jun2020,1
1163,I'm on a discord server and there's a non-binary person who I don't think has decided on a name yet. I want to dm them and ask them if they want help figuring out a name but idk if it's rude or not (we're both 13 if that changes anything),11Jun2020,2
1164,This is a serious ask- this may be the wrong subreddit but im new and wasn't sure where else to post. My(23F) boyfriend(21M) was hired by dominos a few months ago. He drives a (2000?) Mercedes Benz with a missing bumper. His vehicle was approved by the district manager. Apparently yesterday he delivered to an employee working for another dominos location. That person took a photo of his car and dm'ed it to all the GMs in the area. Today the SAME district manager that approved the car came in fuming telling my boyfriend he needed to get the bumper fixed or he would be fired. Is that allowed? He was already hired and had his car approved. It will cost hundreds to get it fixed and its just cosmetic damage. How can an employer make you use hundreds of the (very little) money you're earning from them to do something that doesn't matter? The rest of the car is in fine condition.,11Jun2020,1
1165,"After some time I finally decided to ask for advice (please dont judge it if u are not interested please ignore the post) 


So im 17 years old and I find myself horribly sad/depressed to the point that I can't properly function. Mostly because of my abusive/dickhead brother.  It all began when I was 13 or 14, you know when I started growing up and get more mature with time. We share the same bedroom becasue the house is not large enough for 2 rooms so there is no such thing as ""private"" space. So my dickhead brother gets all the room for himself bring friends over and forcing me to leave the house for the time her is there ,have the desk for himself turn the lights out when he is ready to sleep even if Iam not forcing me to stay in the dark or sleep and my mother doesn't seem to care. All of that happens because he was bullied in elementary school so he decides to do the same thing on me. 


Fast forward I'm forced to do most things by myself as I grow up and I'm independent living like an adult already. The thing is a few months back I decided that i wouldnt be hiding anymore and stand up for myself..... which leads to him bullying me even more and getting more physical and insult me in ways nobody ever can. He knows my weaknesses and all because he is my brother so he knows how to destroy my mind. For example, I'm quite an introvert and I don't get allong with socializing, which means I have no more than 10 to 15 friends. He takes complete advantage of it and bullies the shit out of me for it every day for hours, at first I could laugh it off but after a while it got me and I'm having anxiety attacks from time to time. A friend told me to try decorate my space as I wanted so I connected my playstation in my bedroom with a nice TV and a PS lamp with the buttons colors and all with a nice walls scroll behind it. I cant lie about it I loved it, it was a huge boost and I was feeling good for one or two days.... until he came into place again.... he straight up uses the tv to ""watch"" shows and doesnt even look at them he is all the time on his phone. In addition he doesn't let me use the playstation because he landed my mother like 50 bucks to buy it and now he claims it ""his"". When I get some time to finally play he uses the internet watching videos on purpose so I have slow connection leading to ruining one of the things that keep me happy. In the house everyday he puts tremendous pressure on me and my mother and we can barely take it causing us both mental problems.... Last month I got very nice Jordan clothes that I loved wearing boosting my confidence, then again he proceeded to laughing at me and stealing some of them which was a huge blast in my mind. Music and anime are a huge help and literally I feel happy about my life when i do those 2 things and of course he made his way to deserting it... he stole my headphones so I won't be able to listen to it and laughs at me for watching ""Japanese cartoons"" as he calls it.


I've tried talking to him but he wont listen at all. I looked for help in my parents. My father sees it as ""brothers thing"" and doesnt give a shit about it and my mother doesnt even try to stop it. After years of pressure my mind had snapped I have various mental issues, I've tired talking to therapist but diesnt help at all.... then I tied self harm which helped a little but was awful... at finally 2 failed sucide attempts which made my brother bully me more as a ""weakling"" 



If you are still here thank you for carning that much and I appreciate it. Tell me your thoughts/advice or what would u do in my place",11Jun2020,1
1167,"I (25f) have a guy friend (27m) who i have been talking to everyday for about 2 years now. Recently he started to get distant and i asked him if something was wrong and he wouldnt give me a straight answer. He would just get mad, stop texting for the rest of the day or just change the subject. I have anxiety issues and I was very anxious that I was losing my best friend. 

Admittedly I freaked out with asking a lot of questions and being doubtful of what was going to happen to our friendship. Instead of comforting my mind (since he knows I have anxiety) he just would claim that I was being “over dramatic,” “crazy,” or was just “over-thinking.” It got to the point where I was so upset that he just said I needed to take a few days to “calm down” and that he would talk to me after a few days. I had heard this line from ex-boyfriends in the past, knowing full well “take a few days” meant “you will never hear from me again” but him being my friend i hoped it was different. 

I hadn’t texted or messaged him for a whole weekend and he messaged me on that Monday. I couldn’t respond until the evening because I had things i had to do that day but that evening when I did respond i apologized for not getting back to him and he said “ok” i asked if anything was wrong and he replied “nah” i asked how he was and he said fine but didnt respond at all after that for the rest of the evening. 

The next morning i messaged saying i wished he had a good day and we made small talk but once again it seemed like he didnt want to talk to me so i mentioned it. He responded “we did so good the passed few days why start again” i responded “start what? Talking again?” And he said “yeah” i was hurt and told him so and told him that i was right about him not wanting to talk any more. Then he laid it on me that he had started talking to a girl (fine we are just friends). We stop talking for the rest of the week but he still liked my pictures and posts on FB, only for him to message me the following sunday asking how i was and making small talk. Me with my anxiety it sat on my mind for a few days until i get the nerve to ask him what the deal was that wednesday. I just asked why he messaged me when the previous week he said he didnt want to talk anymore and he starts going off on me saying he “never said that he didnt want to talk” but based on what he told me in the “why start up again” conversation he could have fooled me (please correct me if im wrong) he keeps bouncing between wanting to make “small talk” and not wanting anything to do with me 

Keep in mind like i said we had talked every single day for 2 years up until April. I dont know what to do about this situation. I dont know what he wants from me. I dont want to lose my best friend but at the same time I dont want him to play ping pong with my emotions. 

Thank you (sorry for the book)

1168,"She lives with a toxic family that is constantly tracking her movements and does not take mental health seriously (her brother's wife goes to one and they constantly make fun of them) so she can't see an IRL therapist. I know I can't replace a professional but I want to help as much as I can. She is suicidal and tells me I am the only thing keeping her from ending it all.

I am trying to gather as much resources as I could to help her. Right now here is the plan:

* Talkspace; I know the reviews but something is better than nothing.
* Woebot smartphone app
* I need audiobooks (or even normal books, I can read them out to her as she works) and youtube vids to watch/listen with her. I don't want her to have to sit through them alone. I need recommendations.

Please I need help, I don't want to lose her. I am willing to pay for any resource. I am M22 and she is F22; no she cannot move out.",11Jun2020,2
1169,"The title is pretty explanatory but for further detail, my sister is 14. She is my half sister (same mom).

They have been really close since they first met, confiding and just supporting each other.








Yeah, he came over to visit for a bit and I went to leave for the gym. Then I came back early and caught them in the middle of the sex. What the fuck do I do? I am angry and confused. Angry that she could do this and let her brother take advantage of her but confused as to how and when this started. I am scared that if I tell my mom, she'll hate me and they'll be separated. She might close up on us and not tell us what we need to know like how long or is this something she actually wanted or?",11Jun2020,6
