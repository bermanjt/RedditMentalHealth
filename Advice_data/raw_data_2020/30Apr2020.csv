My next door neighbors are an autistic Family, they aren’t social distancing, they aren’t wearing masks. They try to approach us and others 24/7, the husband told us “This is Ridiculous!!! It’s been two weeks I’m not keeping this up!!” After inviting other neighbors over to play basket ball. We are at risk, their fence is right up against our house, we share a driveway and they’re always playing outside (NEAR OUR DOOR) from 8 am to 11 pm. They try to approach me and my 50+ father everyday, they don’t move when we’re trying to maintain distance when walking in/out driveway, they run up to us also.",30Apr2020,1

School is hard. In one of my classes I have an overall grade of 77 but I need to make a 70% on one of the tests. I have done that. And the highest I got was a 67.65% which is 2 questions from passing. I emailed the teacher and they said (paraphrasing) “we have made adjustments already to what we thought was fair. It’s very unfortunate that you didn’t make the cut off. Focus on your exams next week for your other classes and we can discuss a course of action for our class.” 
Do you think this means I’ll have to repeat? Or they will throw the points my way? Idk how to feel right now. It’s an ambiguous answer...",30Apr2020,1
3,"There’s this women I work with who’s old enough to be my mother (or maybe even grandmother) and she keeps acting like she’s in high school. She is so rude to me and idk why I’ve never done shit to her. I’m not going to go into detail with all the shit she’s done to me but I will say she did something very disrespectful to me recently and I confronted her about it and she just ignored me then I told my boss what she did and he was upset about it but it seems like he wasn’t that upset because I don’t think he talked to her like he said he would. I was watching them all day to see if he would pull her aside and talk to her and he didn’t. I let things get to me easily and I can’t feel better until the person who hurt me feels as shitty as I do. I hated coming into work today and seeing this woman laughing, smiling, and giving me dirty looks. This woman is a fucking bully and i want revenge.",30Apr2020,1
5,"tldr: guy i met over snapchat keeps making plans that he cancels at the last minute. also told me hella personal stuff that makes me wanna give him the benefit of the doubt.

okay first disclaimer: this is a long one. sorry second disclaimer: pls no lecturing me on going out during the pandemic. im not gonna argue that ur wrong is just unrelated and not productive. also pls dont lecture me on internet safety. again, unrelated to the actual problem i need advice on and not productive. also posted this to the relationship advice subreddit.

so i added this guy, lets call him tanner, off of quick add on snapchat around a month? ago and quickly saw from his story/snap map/asking him that he lives close to me and some internet sleuthing told me hes from my hometown highschool and hes three years ahead of me. i saw on his story he grows pot and obviously, him living close to me it seemed to be to my advantage to introduce myself and i had lost a ton of friends since transferring schools and didnt really have people to hang out with when i come back home for weekends or holidays so ive been keen on meeting new people esp in my town. i responded to his story complimenting his grows and we made some conversation. we continued to kinda go back and forth responding to each others posts and we were able to have some intellectual conversation which i was kinda impressed by, i found we both love animals, have some common ground on sense of humor and interests (mainly outdoor adventures/hikes), and i thought he was cute and had a nice style. obviously we havent had crazy in depth conversations to bank anything on but its enough that my interest was piqued and i decided to ask him what he was doing the next day (4/20) and he said “working, why whats up?” and i told him something along the lines of “idk i was just wondering if you had any 4/20 plans. u seem pretty cool to smoke a j with and go out adventuring looking for bugs w lol, no pressure tho bc u barely know me im just tryna make more (hometown name) friends” he responded to another one of my stories and just didnt address that so i was like “imma take that as a no? its chill if u dont wanna hang” and he said “no, id love to, it just depends when i get off work tomorrow” so i text tanner the next day (4/20) and im like hey do you still want to go out and hes says “sorry i get off late today but definitely still go celebrate without me, we’ll do it some other time when i dont have work” and im like “thats chill no worries!” and i go out and celebrate w someone else and its not a big deal bc i also have crazy hours at work and i get it. i did kinda expect to get flaked though, just a kinda vibe i was getting thats not really justified but hey. i decided id wait a bit and ask once again to hang and if he flaked again id just take the hint and drop it.

so then after another week of the usual occasional story response back and forth i ask tanner again this past saturday if hes free at all this week. he tells me tomorrow (sunday) and i go “hey im working but we can hang after i get off at 5” and he says “thats cool, whenever youre ready”. so the next day i get home from work and i text him saying “just got off work imma take a quick shower and we can chill after if u want” and he responds abt an hr later at 6:30 and hes like “after dinner?” and i say sure. I wait around 2 hrs or so until i text him again and im like hey do u still wanna do something?”. no text for the rest of the night and im like ight im just getting stood up and played and flaked on im done here lol.

the next day (monday), i wake up to a text from tanner at like 8:30am saying “i am sooo sorry, something came up i was super busy last night but im free today if you still want to hang”. and, even though i told myself i was gonna drop it if tanner flaked again, i figured since HE offered plans this time and seemed genuinely intent upon hanging out i would say yes, despite still feeling the vibe that i was gonna get stood up. whatever, when people tell me they want to hang out with me i generally choose to believe them bc why stress abt people lying to you abt that. this is when tanner informs me that hes homeless. i had seen on his snapchat story that he had been staying in a house (again we lived close, and it is an upper middle class, generally affluent suburban neighborhood that a 20 yr old tradeschool drop out probably cannot afford, and there were children that ranged in age of almost definitely to definitely to old to be his) so i assumed the thing that happened last night was him getting kicked out for one reason or another. i told him im super sorry and im here for him and we didnt have to hang out that day if he didnt feel up for it but he assured me he still wanted to and he was just going to run some errands and then hed feel better and we could hang out and i say alright. i go about my business but as usual worried/checking my phone a lot bc im the kind of person who likes solid plans and i check in a lot until plans are solid (a lot of trauma involving unreliable ppl). around 3.5 hours later i text him to see if tanner still wants to hang out (3.5 seemed like more than enough time to complete what he told me he had to do). i see a few hours after that that tanner hasnt opened my text but posted on his story a video with a friend. i respond to it saying “nice”. i didnt really mean this to be passive aggressive i wasnt even mad just confused and i wanted him to know that i know he just blew me off. he later responded and said he was super sorry but he just needed to be with a close friend rn and then he said “i want to send you a picture of this letter wait a sec” and im just thinking wtf??? “okay”. he sends me a picture of a letter from his father to his mother that is really heavy and shows that theres a lot of family problems going on. he goes “if we hung out today i wouldve cried in front of you and i barely know you i just have a lot going on right now im really sorry”. i tell him i completely understand, and i really appreciate his vulnerability and honesty despite not knowing me well, bc i do. i tell him ive been through more than my fair share of family shit and general fucked up shit and that honestly if he had cried in front of me there would be zero judgement and im really just here to support him if thats what he wants. he responds with “thank you. i appreciate you”. i just tell him that “im just the kind of person who gets stressed when people flake on plans or dont communicate, i honestly dont mind if you need to take time or cancel plans but please try your best to like lmk lol bc otherwise im just sitting around worrying” and i also asked him if he actually wanted to hang out sometime that week and its fine if he doesnt and he said “Itd be easier if I hit you up when I can actually chill cuz with how my shit is it’s pretty chaotic” and i just responded yah bc i just took that as “i dont want to ever hang out but im too much of a nice person to say it”. imo when people say that they will text you to make plans, they say it because they wont they just dont want you to text them. tanner then said something that kinda threw me off “I’ll communicate more I’m sorry i shouldve said something”. like what kinda 20 yr old boy (or person in general) says that to some chick hes just met? not even in real life? but either way i say “its fine i mean you barely know me lol” bc its true like im honestly not mad i mean we have no commitment to each other im just confused. then to ease my anxious mind i say “promise youll text though” and tanner promises. i honestly did this bc i figured his promise would calm my anxious traumatized mind long enough to forget about him. and now im here. i honestly just dont know what to do next or what to think? like do i unfriend him? do i take this as a hint that he doesnt want to get to know me and just drop it? but why would he send me all of that personal stuff if he wasnt intent upon becoming closer? how long do i wait to text him, if i should even text him again?",30Apr2020,1
6,"I'm currently in a very bad state so excuse me if I make any mistakes or if I just don't make any sense at some point.

I have borderline personality disorder. I fight it, I try really hard, every day and on therapy. 
I've had problems since I was 12. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 13. Then again when I was 16 - I tried twice, the last one was really bad and I actually almost died. 

The thing is, I hate myself so fucking much. I can't stand myself. I just can't. I want to throw up when I think of myself now. 

Today I've had suicide thoughts for the first time in 7 months. I've had an argument with my boyfriend and it went really bad. Mostly just me saying he is aggressive and I'm scared of him, and him saying I'm always acting up, he's had enough, and that he sees that he won't change me anyway. 
It hurt me really bad. I thought he accepted me, you know, I thought that finally I was at least good enough. 

Turns out I never was and never will, apparently. I feel like he could list all the things wrong about me and the stuff he wants me to change.
I feel like shit. I feel like I'm the scum of the earth. I tried so hard to change for him. I tried so hard to be exactly how he wants me. You see, I don't have anyone besides him. I don't have family. I don't have friends. I just wanted to be loved...

I don't know what to do know. I'm really freaking out and I think I might have an episode today. I don't know how to calm down. 

Any advice will help, really. I don't even know what I'm asking for exactly, I just need to stop, like, being me. I don't want to be me.",30Apr2020,1
7,"He’s cheated on her multiple times in the past two years of being together, he’s mentally abusive towards her and manipulates her. She finally realized that she doesn’t want to be with him, she told him that about two months ago when she found out again that he cheated on her. When that happen she told him he needs to move out and offered to drive him to his family a few states away but he refused. He also loss his job a week before all of that happen and owes my sister a few thousand bc of that he said he can’t move out yet bc he needs to get a job first. And my sister told me that she didnt want him to move out until he pays her back, she was afraid he wouldn’t paid her back if he moved out. It’s gotten to the point that she doesn’t care about him paying her back she just wants him to leave but he will not leave. Here’s a little more of a back story, since she ended the relationship they still sleep in the same bed, still hangout together, she still pays for things for him( he has a job but doesn’t make nearly as much as he was making) he says things to her in which her and I can tell he still thinks there’s a chance of being with her( also since she ended the relationship he’s been talking to multiple women, even though he still wants to be with her) even though she has told him multiple times that she doesn’t want to be with him anymore. She doesn’t really like hanging out with him nowadays bc when they do he always causes fights. And I can tell it drains her emotionally from being around him. She started seeing someone and will hang out with the person occasionally, she stayed the night with the person the other night. So the ex started freaking out on her (even tho he knows she’s been seeing this guy for about a month now and has slept over at the guy’s house a few times) messaging her a bunch of questions saying really mean things to her and then messaging the guy she was with mean things. The ex then proceed to punch a hole in the wall, then threw paint on her wall and wrote something mean on the wall with the paint then covered it up with other paint. He then threw her clothes out of the dressers and onto the floor in her bedroom. All while she was gone for the night. He said she made him do it, I guess you could say that’s what broke the camels back. And now she really wants him out of the house but he won’t leave. I’ve tired to convince her to get an eviction notice to legally kick him out, but I feel as if she doesn’t want to do that. I guess what I’m trying to ask advice on is how the eviction process works. I looked up online about it but all I could find was stuff on if you are a landlord. Btw he does not and has never paid rent and has been living here for about a 10 months now.",30Apr2020,1
8," Okay, so sorry if I write bad, I'm not the best writer lol. So a while ago I made an account for my friend on Instagram because he asked me to. He then made himself an account and told me he wanted his second account to be cotton\_candy\_skies\_\_\_\_\_\_. So around the time, we were advised to stay indoors because of the Corona he slowly became less active. We didn't really think of it as anything. I mean we all go inactive sometimes. His main account was deleted. It's gone? So we texted his number and on Snap. He told us, he just wanted a break from Insta. We were like oh ok cool. (We usually talked like every other day in a group chat with a bunch of our friends and we were planning a party to celebrate when quarantine ended). It was weird timing, but whatever one to their own ya know? He said he was alright and everything so me and my friends let it be. Then on his snap story, he kept posting pictures in the woods each with the caption ""did you see it?"". I also slid up and said something along the lines of like ""No lol what is it?"" and he would open it and just respond with ""nothing"" so I stopped asking and this was like every day for a week and a half. Then it stopped. It's day two of no post on his Snap. But then he posted on cotton candy skies. Pictures of the woods and the caption ""Did you see it?"". I liked his post and messaged him if he was ok because that account is basically inactive, and has like no followers. He never responded. I was like okay sure. Is he messing with me? I am literally that accounts only follower right now. He had posted other cryptic stuff, but I just thought they were artsy pictures. I am going to this forum and the paranormal forum.

9,"So I'm a really empathetic and emotional person that sometimes it's to my own detriment. Most of the time I'm fine, but I just care *a lot.*

My brother was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder last year which explains a lot of our relationship growing up, it wasn't the best and turned violent often so we didn't always have the best relationship.

Because of trauma from both my brother and his girlfriend they have a toxic relationship. They both recognise this and want to fix it.  It's a never ending cycle of breaking up and getting back together in the next week. At first my mother and I were confused but we just learned to live with it. I'm friends with my brother's girlfriend. We met through him and we're chill, we make jokes with each other and the three of us hang out and play games together, her and myself hang out on occasion too just not very often. 

I often gave both my brother and his gf advice and told them to spend time apart but they never did. This came to a head when the gf promised me that she wouldn't talk to him for two weeks then decide what to do but ended up coming over two days later and tried hiding from me while she was with him. I was upset for a while for not listening to me and taking in my advice (I wasn't majorly upset, I was just burnt out from helping her, I have bad trust issues myself that I'm trying to work on and don't like it when people promise me something then change their mind almost immediately. I didn't even ask her to promise.)

A little more background on the gf, she doesn't have many friends. She has one she's living with at the moment (when she's not living with us), but the friend really isn't a good person, and definitely not a good friend to her but it's not really my place to say anything so I stay out of it. It seems like she really doesn't have anyone else who she can confide in that is a mature person. 

Fast forward about three months and it's this same cycle of breaking up and making up until this weekend just passed. She has mental health issues (obviously) and I wanted to make it clear that I care for her so I told her I was her friend. She was really happy about this and got excited but since then, her and my brother had a fight over something else. I honestly can't even remember what it was, they fight over everything, most of the time it's something small. I gave her advice at first telling her to let him come to her and apologise (I told him to talk to her about this yesterday and apparently she's blocked him). Then we chatted about her talking to another friend about what's on her mind and I was thinking it's great she has someone else to confide in.

Yesterday she messages me, my brother and I spent the day hanging out playing games and stuff and I was socially drained, she said she missed him and was sad. 

I guess my problem is: my brother and I have started to have a really good friendship lately and I really don't want to ruin that but at the same time I want to help my friend be okay and to help someone in need.",30Apr2020,1

12,"I work in retail. I started hanging out with one of my coworkers outside of work, usually going out for a walk or going over to each other's houses on the weekends. We were becoming fast friends. On saturday night, I got a snapchat from her and then a text message shortly after saying ""please dont open the snap I just sent"" She had accidentally sent me a snap she did not mean to send me. She said it was inappropriate and asked me to not open it so I didn't open the snap. 

Sunday afternoon when she started work, I jokingly asked 'so what did you send me?' and she said it was completely inappropriate and that she deleted it. Surprised, I said 'oh I didnt know you could delete a snap once you send it' and she said 'you cant. I went into the cash office and found the list containing everyone's locker combo and got into your locker and unlocked your phone and opened the snap' 

I was stunned. I couldn't believe she did that. She could SEE that I had not opened it and could've just talked to me or asked to see my phone but she went behind my back and broke into my locker. I was visibly upset and angry so that evening she sent me a long message saying she was sorry and she wasn't thinking at the time and was just so embarrassed she rushed to erase her message. I didn't send anything back. 

I asked another coworker about the situation and she said it needed to be reported to management, because she shouldn't have been able to access the cash office on her own. I want her to have consequences for her actions but I dont want her to be fired. What should I DO? please help!",30Apr2020,1
13,"I think the best way to describe what I’ve achieved so far, is very average. 
At school I got fairly good grades, mostly A’s and B’s. I then went onto study a degree in where I managed to achieve a 2:1 grade, which is what I was aiming for, so was happy with this. 

After graduating I worked at an insurance company for 4 years as a claims adjuster, but didn’t really enjoy it and wanted something more fulfilling. Currently I work for Local Government, in a data role. The job is fairly relaxed, and salary is slightly below U.K. average but not bad. Career prospects are not amazing as local governments can move slowly, and you never know if and when positions will come up to apply for within. 

I’m asking this question has I see some old course mates and they are doing some really cool things that I haven’t managed to achieve. The thing is I know it could also be worse too, but I’ve just been thinking about this a lot recently during this quarantine period. 

I’d just like some outside viewpoints really, like should I have aimed for more, or am I doing about average for a guy in his mid/late 20s?

22,"So a little backstory: I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have had them for some years now. My parents are the type that don’t really think mental illness is real and just brush it off. My therapist had to sit my mother down and tell her “your daughter is depressed, it is not a phase, it is a mental illness” before she would take me to a doctor. This was three years ago. And I’m not sure what was going on with the doctor but he would put me on a drug and if it wasn’t working within a week he would up my dose or switch the drug, and after so long my mom didn’t want me going anymore because we were going every week and she was paying all that money. So I just stopped taking meds and all that. Then a little over a year ago I stopped going to my therapist because my mom didn’t want to pay for me to see her anymore. 

Well, 10 months ago, my best friend died. No health conditions, no injuries, nothing. Just dead. The coroner ruled it as undetermined and no one knows what actually happened. When he passed he had a 6mo old baby. His death has seriously taken a toll on me since he was my best friend in the whole world and the person I did everything with and talked to about everything. He had called me a few days before he passed while I was in Europe and he said he didn’t care if there was international calling charges, he just wanted to talk to me. 

Well now, I can feel my depression getting worse. I can’t stop telling myself depreciating things and I know they’re not true but I can’t help it. And I am just getting stronger and stronger urges to quit school, quit work, cut off everyone in my life and disappear. Now I know this is just impossible, I’m a broke college student. But I know that the fact the urge is there, the thoughts, the calls of the void, all means I’m getting worse. 

I know my mom won’t take me to a doctor to get meds or anything so I’ve been trying to find a doctor on my own and go see them. But the problem is my family hasn’t met our insurance deductible and I don’t have the money to pay for the full cost of a doctors visit and I don’t know how much longer I can stay afloat like this without some kind of change.

I had a conversation with a friend today about college, they want to go to an Ivy League and I want to go to a state school, well my school was on their list and I got excited because I’m used to people talking shit about it, so I decide to hype my school up because I really want to go there. I also was confused about their school because I did think it was a STEM school (they’re not interested in STEM) so I told them that and apparently it isn’t. 


Well they took it as me bashing their school and discouraging them from applying which, isn’t true, I don’t really care which school they go to but it was fun to think about having a friend at my college. They got angry with me and told me they just won’t bring it up again with me which really got to me and I apologized but I later just cried to myself because I always just screw things up because I can never communicate what I want to say effectively and it always pisses people off. 


I did get pissed off though at my friend because they were trying to point out how I was deliberately trying to hurt them when I was explaining that I have a problem with speaking.


I just want my friends to believe me when I say this is a problem with how I talk but I know it just looks like a white lie to get away with shit. 


I know people won’t believe me if I’m trying to explain my problem with communication to them so how do I stop miscommunicating or at least fix my issue?",30Apr2020,1
24,"So me and my fiance were renting an apartment close to her college, where we found ourselves engaged in some pretty kinky sex. Now that she has graduated and we're living at my parents house until we buy our own house. With all of the adult stores closed right now due to everything going on, we have been wondering how we could order some new toys and lingerie without my parents figuring out what we ordered. Does anybody have any solutions?",30Apr2020,1
25,"Im 18 years old and still havent had a job, i have an extreme fear of going outside (Agoraphobia) and extreme fear of messing up (atychiphobia). meanwhile PTSD, and general anxiety lay ontop of that. this prevents me from functioning in an every day work environment.
i was recently diagnosed with fatty tumors in my spine (first thought to be a hematoma aka large blood clot) and had to have surgery.
these tumors are not cancerous but my doctor had comfired that these types of tumors have been very known to become cancerous.
I was on SSI (social security income) but they stopped it without notice (i looked this up and apparently they cannot make any changes without notice- so its illegal?).
without any sort of income, i had no health care provided to me to see a specialist for my tumors, or to see a therapist for my mental health.
I keep calling ssi to get them to look back over my case, ive called over 4 times and they keep saying they will call back in a week or so- wait over 2 weeks and they still didnt call back so id call again (it just keeps repeating).
so finally i filed a writen paper to appeal my case, they STILL never looked into it and im getting frustrated. i don't know what else to do.
im relying on my mother (who is raising two young childern) and my sister (who is also struggling money wise + pregnant) to pay my rent (in government housing so rent is only $19 with no income), and put things into my house until its figured out.
but its going nowhere...",30Apr2020,1
26,"I am a social outcast. I always have been! I never talk to anyone outside of school. I have barely any social skills, and I care way too much about what other people think to step out of my comfort zone. I always stay at home, because I am too scared to ever leave. I also have a low opinion of myself, and assume that everyone in the world hates my guts, further preventing me from interacting with others!

I see this lifestyle of being a hermit as sad and dangerous, and I fear that being this socially isolated will prevent me from feeling empathy for others, which is why I want to change that! I want to be able to experience things with friends that I couldn’t with my family! Is there any suggestions on how I can improve my social skills, or find ways to interact with people online, given the virus that’s going on!",30Apr2020,1
27,"Fake names used. On mobile, so forgive the formatting.

So on April 18th my closest friend died by overdosing. I haven't been in a good state of mind since then.

I told my other close friend (lets call him Derrick) about my friends passing and he said ""Well honestly I don't feel as bad now, cause it was his fault that he died and now he's going to hell."" 

I was pissed, so I told him off, in exact words, ""How could you say that about him? You don't know what he's going through at home. You know I'm having a hard time with his passing and you have the nerve to say that."" 

Then Derrick started talking about how he would never kill himself no matter what. I ignored him that day. I didn't have the energy to deal with him anymore. 

The next day comes and I texted him, telling him I was mad at him and that I never asked what he would do. I told him I just needed to vent and get it off my chest and that I needed his support and positivity not criticism and negativity.

He's mad and won't talk to me, what should I do?",30Apr2020,1

29,"So, me and my husband moved to a new house about 2.5 years ago, and we only have neighbors on one side. They are a couple in their 30's, just like the two of us, but they have 4 kids ages 4 to 12. The husband seems pretty arrogant for some reason, and the wife goes right back inside the house as soon as she sees us, which is a complete lack of common courtesy, but whatever. My husband gave them free stuff on multiple occasions (he works for beverage company and I worked for snack company), believing this was going to bring us kind of closer together, but it never did. I started having problem with kids' screaming last fall (screaming suddenly became their pastime). They have a trampoline in the backyard that kids like to jump on and scream. Now, since they're out of school I have been losing my mind, because I can hear them screaming in every corner of my house and it is driving me nuts! This trampoline was about 7-8 ft away from the fence, but when I woke up this morning the trampoline was literally leaning on the fence, and they have fairly big backyard and can put it in 10 different spots. Now the screaming is even louder, and they can see me inside my house washing dishes or cooking and I really don't like that. 
Here's the thing: I really don't feel comfortable talking to my neighbors about the issue I am having, because they use every opportunity to turn their heads away from us and to avoid even saying Hi. How do I go about resolving this issue? I have no clue what's the proper way to deal with this.",30Apr2020,1
30,"My biggest fear is that my friends aren’t actually my friends, that they only talk to me because they’re being nice. It’s something that’s always at the back of my head, and it fucks me up. It causes me to isolate myself and push away other people, because what’s the point of talking to them if they’re faking it, right?

Some days I’ll be talking to a bunch of my friends and everything will be going smooth. I’ll be making jokes, they’ll laugh, and I feel on top of the world. But then there are other days where I can’t seem to strike up a conversation. Nothing I say seems to matter. So then I start to feel like they’re tired of me and I should just fuck off.

I know Im probably just too deep in my own head, but I also know that there’s a possibility that I’m not, and that I’m right in my assumption.

How do I know if people genuinely enjoy my presence, or if they’re faking it to be nice?",30Apr2020,1
31,"My landlord called my reference contact, and two emergency contacts because I didnt respond right away.

Then 8 a.m the next morning she calls my emergency contacts and reference contacts. Tells me she will sue me. Keep in mind there wasnt a emergency going on and I wasnt late for rent or some shit. Like legit nothing. She was just trying to get in contact with me to view my move out sheet. Honestly does anyone relate? Idk how to react. Its embarrassing that she did that and for her to disturb peoples lives for no reason. She is old like 85 and crazy. I'm confused because there wasn't a reason she needed to do that.

35,"Ok so first off I’m almost 16. I don’t know if that helps or not. So I have an issue with some girls right now. I bet your thinking “oh just another weird teenager asking for relationship advice again” but just hear me out. To preface I don’t even really want a “relationship” more of just a super cool girl that I can hang out with and stuff. Kisses and cuddles appreciated of course.

Ok so we go all the way back to this summer. I meet this girl in drivers ed. Let’s call her Sophia (obviously not her real name). Sophia is great and we start to talk but nothing serious just friendly convo. Then as time goes on things stat getting a little flirty. I go to a party and she’s all over me. We go to a football game together and she was cuddling all over me. I even took her to dinner then a movie (I know it couldn’t get anymore cringe). So things are going great for about 3 months. I have not asked her out yet.

Ok so, my friend who is also a girl, let’s call her Hailey. Once again not her real name. Hailey calls me and is like tells me about this guy right. He’s 3 years older than us (which I find kinda weird but whatever right) and Hailey has been flirty with this guy. Everything she tells me about this guy seems weird and sketchy. Anyway besides the point. I take nothing of it at the time.  Like a day later I had Sophia over and we were hanging out just relaxing and I try to make a move. I go in for the kiss and she straight up just looks the other way and hugs me. I was kind of mad but maybe she just wasn’t ready. But there’s no way she didn’t like me because it was pretty obvious before and after that little event. 

So like a week later, I finally muster up the courage to ask Sophia out. So I did and said something along the lines of” hey I know we’ve been super good friends for a long time but I want to see if we could be more than friends”. You know terribly cringe highschool stuff. She says something like “I really would but I just don’t really feel like I can handle relationship ship at the moment I just have a lot going on” and stuff like that basically avoiding the question. She technically never rejected me. Stupidly, I was like “ok well if she doesn’t have time I will just wait like a month”.

Stupid mistake, a week later I find out she had been flirting and talking to the guy Hailey was talking with. So that was a whole bunch of drama. But at the time I did not know this. So I waited my month and did the same thing with the same answer. This time I was pissed. Although I didn’t show it because i try to keep it classy. So like the day after I find out about the guy that Hailey was talking to and that made me even more mad. I went into a super bummed out mood. Me and Sophia talked afterword but things got kind of awkward and we drifted apart. 

So that whole thing happened like 4 months ago. Yes I know the story goes on. This could literally be a reality tv show in telling you. Anyways I was super bummed and basically had the mindset of “I’ll show her” and just decided to take my step into the self improvement journey (that I’m still happily on today). 

So fast forward to now. I had moved on from Sophia. I gave myself a little breather for talking to girls for like 3 months and now I’m back in the game. I met this girl, let’s call her Katie, through a mutual friend. She’s super nice and sweet and very good looking. We have been flirting and talking throughout these tough times. Before the whole corona thing we hung out with a group f friends before a couple of times. The only thing is, we don’t exactly click. The conversation just gets stale and awkward at times. 

And now, for the grand finale, last night I get a snapchat text from no other than Sophia. We hadn’t talked in like 5 months. She said something along the lines of “hey what’s up it’s been awhile how’ve ya been?” Which made me pissed and happy all at the same time. I basically re introduce myself to her and we get to talking but nothing to serious. Apparently she “misses talking to me and how fun I was” which made me feel good but also super mad at her. *

*Sidenote: for some reason I was thinking of Sophia the day she texted me and kind of just recapping what all happened. I don’t know why the thought popped into my head before she texted me. Kind of weird. I’m not terribly superstitious but maybe it was a sign?*

So here’s the question, I don’t know whether to try to make things work with Katie and tell Sophia to screw off. (Maybe something a little nicer than that) or to try to explain to Katie that I really think she’s great but things won’t work out and try to give Sophia another chance. 

Ask any questions there is a ton more details to the story I just feel like it’s long enough already. Thanks for reading this far too I really appreciate it.",30Apr2020,1
36,"So, I’m a little new to reddit and I thought I’d give it a try. I’m currently having relationships problems, I know... typical. Do people usually come to reddit for relationship problems? Anyways, so here’s the story.

I’m 23 and my boyfriend is 25. 

My boyfriend and I met on Instagram, we spoke for a couple of months exclusively. He’s from Germany and I’m from Canada. Over the coarse of the months we spoke about our future. Who will move where and all that stuff. It was a rocky start, for a really long time. After 2 visits from Germany to Canada and 1 visit from Canada to Germany, we decided that he would move to Canada with me. The reason is that I’m an only child and growing up in an asian household I bare a lot of responsibilities of taking care of my parents and whatnot. I’ve been told countless times, just do what you want you’re an adult. But it’s just never that easy. My parents don’t really have family in canada so I’m basically all they’ve got. My boyfriend has 2 other brothers and a lot of family in Germany. It’s been very great the last 3 years but until recently, I’m not sure of quarantine is just hitting hard since we’re stuck in the house all day, every day but my boyfriend just started to get super depressed. He misses his family and friends and no longer sees a future here in Canada. We’re stuck and don’t know what to do. Either options we have comes with someone with a broken heart whether that’s us or our family. I just wanted to see if anyone out there is going through the same thing or has any advice for me. 

Our options were:
1. Move to Germany and I have visitations every few months to visit my mom and dad. 
Problem with that: my parents are getting old and they usually need my help with a lot of things. They don’t speak fluent English so I have to translate for them. They’re settled in living in Canada and don’t want to move to Germany. My mom says she’s okay with me going but I know deep down she’ll struggle as her relationship with my dad isn’t the best. I’m their only child so they wouldn’t be able to be with their grandkids in the future. 
2. We stay in Canada and continue our visits to Germany every few months. 
Problem with that: my boyfriend hates the city I live in, he’s always lived in a smaller city where every know knows everyone kind of thing. He misses his family and he’s scared of missing out on family things. 
3. We break up. 
Problem with that: neither of us want this.",30Apr2020,1
37,"So I currently live in a supported living place, there staff on hand round the clock to help us. Shopping, banking stuff like that. Its for vulnerable adults with mental health issues. 

A few times I have woken up after a wet dream (sleep orgasm/ejaculation) and my bed is icky as fuck and not very nice to deal with. I normally mop it up best i can with a t shirt or something that already needs washing. Its normally never very much to clean up so its been pretty easy, up till now. 

For what ever reason the amount has increased in the last few weeks. And because of my autism i often over think things REAL fast. Its like a super power. Theres too much...stuff...to clean up the way i normally do now so machine washing my bedding is about the only way to deal with it somewhat more hygienically.

We are entitled to one free washing slot per week to do our laundry and any extra slots we need are charged (dont ask why i dont freaking know but eh rules is rules). But, we are allowed an emergency wash if we throw up or whatever. 

How do I tell supports staff that I need an emergency wash? Sounds stupid but, as i say overthinking is my super power! Should i tell them why i need an emergency wash? Or do I just ask for one and not tell them why? This is the first time its really been necessary to wash my bedding after a wet dream so im not really clued up on this. 

Im happy to answer any questions people have to help get some advice on this. Thanks in advance guys.",30Apr2020,1
38,"I won president of this organization in my college that I’ve put hours and hours into. I worked super hard on my speech &amp; more, and I won the majority vote. 

However, there are 4 other executive positions that I’ll be working with, 2 vps, secretary, and treasurer. one of the vp’s is super friendly and nice. The second VP &amp; the treasurer both ran against me for president and lost. And the secretary is best friends with the second VP and was campaigning for her to win president. Basically while everybody in the org itself wanted me as president, 3/4 other people who won exec positions did not. The treasurer should be fine with me eventually, but the second VP has lost against me in the past to another position. She continually made me feel like crap by implying that she could do better.

I’m genuinely scared of her and I wasn’t able to enjoy that I had won president out of fear. She’s already texted me some very rude things. This isn’t a high school club where I can report back to someone else, I’m the president now. In the past, when she was rude to me, I could have some comfort in talking to the president who was a good friend of mine (I was a VP). Now I don’t have that. I don’t want to be like a baby and complain to others in the org because that will look bad on me. What can I be complaining about, I beat her! But lately I’ve been feeling so sensitive and having her tear me down is making me lose my confidence.

40,"Throw away account here. I do post on advice frequently, and decided to create a ""Trow Away"" just so the college can't identify me. I have a bachelors and masters from two different top college/universities in the field I am studying. This is for a third degree and state certification in the education of this subject. I graduated from my bachelors in 2017 and masters in 2019. If there is enough interest I will reveal the college in question, and possibly the department.

In a graduate education program, advertised for state certification. I think I may be getting taken advantage of, because the program director (and my advisor) is saying one thing, but the breakdown of the program says something different. I cannot change advisors.

&amp;#x200B;

* On the website currently, the college advertises 29-32 credits for the completion of the program. However the courses listed add up to 36 credits, and on my registration the credits some how added up to 40, with a bachelors and masters in the program that seems fishy.
* The information on the website says that the school accepts credits which may lower this total credit count for equivalent courses and proficiency. However program director says that the school will not do this, even though I have high marks in the courses that are equivalent. She said to me that it's very atypical
* There is an exam that is required for the program that is NOT listed on the website, I have philosophical disagreements with what this exam proves as a teacher, and avoided schools that had this exam or requirement. This is NOT a requirement for teacher certification in the state. There is also no course that prepares students in my program for this exam, and students often struggle
* Professors often do not give syllibi and (I have had this happen on three occasions) and the expectations for the students are either random, or nonexistant. In two of the courses I we actually haven't had a relevant class. The professor is working on a doctorate at another university and seems like they're collecting data for their thesis. Administration is defending the professors although they will condemn the professors to you in writing, no action will be taken, grades go unaffected. a syllabus is required by the college as written in their faculty handbook, and has to be approved by the department chair, this means the department chair is not checking syllibi. 
* Fellow students in the program feel similarly and are often dismissed by administration. Graduate students are not treated with respect, and are often lumped into undergraduate classes and sections.
* The college in question is a city college and may have some restrictions for a lawsuit
* I am finishing my first year of two at the college, and I do not want to leave as other colleges/universities are unlikely to take the credits I've taken. I would rather shake the tree for the next group of students that come in, so they do not have to deal with this. That or somehow expose these inequities.

Short of dropping out what options do I have? What can I do for myself and for the next cohort for this program? Should I consider talking to a lawyer?

41,"Ok, so this will probably be a long one, but here goes. 

I have been working from home since March 13. Since I’ve been home all day everyday (like the rest of you I’m sure) I’m noticing a lot of things that I probably wouldn’t notice if I were at the office. 

Today I was sitting in my home office working away when I hear screaming, banging and yelling coming from upstairs. I live in a two family home. For those of who don’t know, that means that one family lives upstairs, and the other family lives downstairs. Anyway, it’s a mother and a son who live upstairs. She’s in her 50’s and her son is early to mid-thirties. He has severe anger issues and gets extremely irate very quickly. So I let them (or whoever it was) scream it out for about 10 minutes. I text some family asking them if they think it’s valid that I want to call the police. After 3-4 resounding, “yes, you 100% should call the police” answers, I did. 

The police arrive about 5 minutes later, and they knock on her door. She answers and is absolutely baffled as to why I would call the police and claims her son isn’t home. She’s reluctant to let the police up to check, but eventually she lets them up to make sure everything is ok. I can hear her tell the cops that she thinks we are doing this “because we are mad.” 

So back up a little...last Saturday night, my fiancé and I were watching tv. I guess it was too loud, so the angry upstairs neighbor (the son) pounds on the floor (our ceiling). We were laying in bed, and almost passed out, so we didn’t think it could be the TV because it was just above the minimum volume. So we turn it off and the pounding stops. This was 3 a.m. BTW, so his frustration with noise is completely valid. 

Anyway, that’s the reasoning the mother gave the police as to why we were calling the cops on her. She thinks it’s a “noise complaint” because we are pissed at her son for banging on the floor. Even if we were pissed, wtf would calling the cops solve? And what would we gain from that? 

She then calls the landlord and starts blaming us for all sorts of shit that we have not done. Like break the garden hose, leave trash in the yard, etc. I literally went out last Saturday and picked up other people’s garbage from our yard. It’s super windy where I live, and we have a chain link fences so shit just blows over and ends up in our yard. 

So now I’m upset, my anxiety is in full blown the world is ending and I’m useless mode, and all I was trying to do was to make sure she was not being beaten and abused. 

So, how do I proceed from here? I want to make amends, and tell her that I’m not petty and angry for her sons outburst, but she is so mad, I don’t want to make it worse. Help.",30Apr2020,1
42,"I am a somewhat recent college grad. I graduated in 2018 from USC with a BS in Business.

It took me 6 months to get a job after graduation.. one that I hated and left after one year. 

I had money saved up b/c it was sales and was unemployed for about 2-3 months. I hated it so much I left without another offer which was not so bright in hindsight. 

I ended up getting another job with this crap ass company that I knew I was going to screw over, but I was getting nervous because my savings was being depleted. I stayed there for a month b/c the person I was under was a nightmare.

I’m now at another sales position at a financial relief company and have been here 2 months but because of this COVID thing the sales are down (at least I still am making the hourly rate I guess). 

The thing is, as a rookie here I’m not the best and have had some struggles. The hourly barely covers my expenses like rent and things plus maybe 600 a month. 

If I get fired or something I have come to the conclusion that I will most likely kill myself because my employment after college has been a shit show and I can’t take the exhaustion from job hunting /instability anymore.

I have a side hustle in e commerce but it’s still in infancy - I make about 100 profit a month from it. I started this because I hate working for other people.

I’m in 6.5k credit card debt and have only 9k in savings now. I’m 24.

I feel so exhausted from everything. I live alone and am very independent but I’m becoming extremely lonely nowadays and with my performance not great at work I feel I’m going to be bouncing around forever or have it look extremely negatively on my resume.

This is why I’m thinking of just giving up. It’s a lot right now for me. I’ve been diagnosed with depression before and thought I came out of it but I think its back and I’m just tired of fighting, you know?

I’m venting but also would like some advice.

43,"So I have this friend that I've known for about 12 years and I was roommates with her in college as well. She is a very toxic friend and often makes me feel guilty if I don't give her enough attention. She was a terrible roommate and living with her honestly put me in a deep depression; it was exhausting. After college I moved an hour away from where she lived which I thought would help distance myself from her. Unfortunately it has done the opposite. She is constantly texting me, like 5-20 texts a day. Sometimes I respond, sometimes I do not. If she sees me on social media hanging out with my other friends she immediately texts me saying that she would have joined us and she should have been invited  (my other friends cannot stand her). So every few weeks I get an angry text from her telling me how terrible of a friend I am and that she doesn't know what she did wrong. I've calmly explained to her that I feel a bit suffocated and that I don't think it's fair that she tries to control who I hang out with and that her jealousy bothers me. So lately she keeps asking to hang out with me during quarantine and I have told her several times that I am not comfortable doing that. So today she asks for the third time and I didn't respond. An hour later I get a notification on venmo that she sent me money for ""Food/coffee"". As much as I appreciate the kind gesture, I've noticed that she tries to buy our friendship and it really makes me feel uncomfortable, so I was annoyed. I'm sorry for the long post, I honestly could go on and on about the toxicity of our friendship and how it's gotten worse over the years. I want to be civil and friendly but it's so exhausting being her friend. I'm not confrontational and I hate making people upset, but I just feel so overwhelmed and don't know the right way to handle the situation.",30Apr2020,1

I won't go into detail with every single one, just know that I match most of them.

Here's the problem: I've got bad anxiety and he's the only person I've felt comfortable telling. I may have 2 others at the most who I believe can help me but because of the lockdown I can't get help right away. I'm not even sure if I can tell them.

46,"I recently was accepted to a Fulbright teaching position in Spain for next year. While I'm very excited at this opportunity, I'm not sure if I should accept the offer because it begins in January and I would need to quit my job to accept it (I work as a high school teacher). I'm nervous because the program was supposed to start in September, but has already been pushed back until January. That being said, I'm not thrilled with my job right now and applied to this program because I really want to explore the world while I'm young.

My question is: would it be stupid of me to quit my job and accept this placement? I have enough savings that I could make it until January, but what happens if this offer gets pushed back more or rescinded? Do people think that it's likely or even realistic to think that Spain/the world could open up by January?",30Apr2020,1

49,"Hey all, 

I was looking for some advice on what best to do.

From my perspective my sister is just outright self centered and only cares for herself.

For some background, she suffered from anxiety from the age of 16. She literally fainted one time under pressure. After some therapy she is a lot  better.

Before I get on to me, I’ll talk about her and my mum. When my sister was at college, she was constantly calling up my mum saying she had anxiety etc. My mum comforted her as any loving mother would do. Then whenever my mum was affected emotionally and was really down and she went to my sister to talk about it. My sister basically told her to go and deal with it herself in a very disrespectful manner.  I would comfort her instead. Even when my mum asks for help, she will say “what” in a very disrespectful manner and just give grunts. Bare in mind my mum helps her with whatever she wants whenever she needs it because my mum is just an awesome human. My sister is in her twenties FYI.

Also when she was at college, my mum goes and picks her up at the end of term. However when my mum gets there, she expects my mum to clean her room. Her room was in such a disgusting state I wanted to puke. However bare in mind my mum drove 2-3 hours to pick her up and my sister is expecting her to clean her room and help with bags. I should add my mum is elderly. 

What pisses me off the most is whenever we have these family incidents and my sister says things like “I’m worried about you mum” when her actions beg to differ.

Now she’s graduated college, she’s at home not able to get a job I assume because her attitude shows at interviews. 

What gets me is when she goes to my mum saying she’s anxious and depressed and then goes and orders stuff online. My mum tells me she’s worried my sister will commit suicide, but my sister is just exploiting this. She ran out of money once and I’m like wtf. Bare in mind she has no job. At least she could go and work in a supermarket.

Now with me I feel we have never been that close primarily because of what I perceive to be her selfishness. One incident that has never left my mind is when we were young my mum asked her for her water bottle as my brother was making a choking noise and she just said no because it’s hers even when my mum said he’s choking. 

I try to make conversation with her and she sometimes replies and sometimes ignores me. I’ve never had any direct conflict remember.  Even at college I would always try to call her, help her with applications etc, but she never does anything for me back in return. I only noticed now she never called me when I was at college or even visited me. 

Sorry for the long post. 

I was wondering what should I do about her? Am I misreading the situation? I’ve tried to be a loving and supportive brother as much as possible, but she just doesn’t reciprocate. Theres a lot more incidents. 

What triggered this is I jokingly said to her in a Trump voice that I’m the bestest brother around after making her tea and she just looked at me in a way that was like “no”. I’m just sitting here wondering what have I done given the situation on how she treats people.",30Apr2020,1
50,"So my boyfriend and I tried our hand at living together for the first time. It actually turned out to be a complete disaster. He works long hours and when he gets home he wants to decompress by playing video games – which I understand, but without uttering so much as a few words to me? I don’t know, it made me feel pretty unimportant . And in consequence, I felt very alone and insecure. I was crying every night and homesick away from all my friends and family until I finally told him I wanted to move home. Living together was a short trial run (barely over a week). I told him I would leave Sunday but he asked me to leave earlier. It was as if I was a complete inconvenience to him. He hasn’t talked to me for about a week since I’ve been back home. What am I to make of this? Am.........I being ghosted? Does he just want me to breakup with him so he doesn’t have to breakup with me?

52,"My mom and dad got a divorce almost 2 years ago now. They both have partners now. I absolutely love my step mom. Shes a really sweet person.
On the other hand however, I despise my moms boyfriend. I didnt ready mind him at first. Then things started going down hill. I started seeing what he was really like. He argues with my mom a lot. And when hes in the wrong he plays the victim. He possessive. I dont mean this in a bad way, but hes very bipolar. In other words hes very toxic.
 He always wants my moms attention. No matter who shes giving it to. Me, my brother, family friends, her parents. Everyone. He has to find a way to get her attention no matter how he does it, arguing with her. Causing a scene. ETA. To put it in my perspective, my siblings and I do 50/50 with our parents (week on, week off) and when were home he always wants it to be just my mom and himself even though we barley see her because of work. He feels the need to try to be our parent.
He is an alcoholc who wont get help. He doesnt have a job for this reason. He cant go for long periods of time with out drink because he will have withdrawals. No house. No bank account. And he wants to have kids with my mom. They've been together for 9 months. He isnt moved in with us. And they  break up at least 6 times a month. My mom and him do have a age gap by 7 years. I understand that he wants kids. But I dont think having them with my mom in his current condition is the best choice for them.
Hes is a jerk  to me. For no reason it seems. Like this one time we were at Carl's Jr. we got our food and I said, ""Oh the frys were spilled"" and he screamed at me "" No shit"" even though we were all talking just fine before. And I dont remember saying anything bad to him. 
But recently the thing he did made me really uncomfortable. And I told my mom that. But she didnt even acknowledge how I felt and tried to turn it around on me. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've considered moving in with my dad until he gets his life in order and spots being a prick or she leaves him. What should I do? Am I overreacting? Please help.
I can also share what he did. It wasnt anything sexual. I just didnt like what he said to me.",30Apr2020,1
53,"For some backstory, my sibling is 17 and I’m 19 and trans. My mum loves both of us very much, but unfortunately was in an abusive relationship when she had us both - my biological dad was incredibly violent, a drug addict and tried to kill her (we’re okay now)

Since they hit puberty my sibling has been a very toxic person. They started off with the usual teenage rebellion, like talking back and whatnot, but gradually it’s gotten a lot worse. I think their behaviour really got bad when they decided to get back into contact with my biological father through Facebook and saw that he was ‘a decent person’ (they were 13/14 I think). When my mum found out, she was obviously terrified and devastated, but my sibling refused to listen to her concerns, continuing to talk to him because she ‘believed’ him when he said he was different now. We could only get my sibling to stop talking with him when I mentioned the situation during one of my therapy sessions and my therapist decided to take action with social services (which I’m glad happened). Since then, my sibling has had a lot of resentment toward me and my mum.

My sibling constantly talks of how they’re going to go and see my biological father when they turn 18 and how unfair it is we grew up without a father (we’ve had a stepdad for about 12 years but apparently that doesn’t count). They constantly manipulate my mum about it, talking about how ‘better off’ we would be and that she is ‘a liar’ since our biological father seems to be a better person now. My sibling is also very violent - screaming and throwing things and lashing out when they don’t get their way. They’re also very entitled and believe they deserve everything and constantly badger my parents for new things that we couldn’t always afford.

My sibling has also had problems at school before. There have been a couple of times where they have actively bullied or treated other children (or even their own friends) poorly by calling them names or gossiping about them. Due to this, their friends chose to not associate with them anymore, leading to my sibling claiming that they, in fact, were being bullied and choosing to make friends with other toxic children instead of apologising and trying to make up for their actions. These friends treat other people the same way my sibling does, enjoy weed, underage drinking and generally just being pricks and since becoming friends with them, my sibling developed an attitude of ‘I’m attractive and I can do whatever I want’ if that makes sense, which has caused my mum in particular a lot of stress, especially when my sibling thoughtlessly stays out all night with these people without a word to my mum and when my sibling finally calls her up at 2 in the morning for a lift berates my mum for trying to get in contact with her and making her phone ring. Whilst my sibling is actually quite bright academically, they got GCSE results that were nowhere near what they could’ve actually achieved because they couldn’t be bothered to revise or try and would get angry at my parents (mum and stepdad) whenever they suggested spending some time studying or offering to help. They did make it into college though, but have since been suspended and got into trouble for getting into fights and bullying other students.

I have always been raised to be accepting of all faiths, races, genders and sexualities. However my sibling doesn’t seem to share all these acceptances - for example, I mentioned before that I am actually transgender myself. My sibling constantly dead-names me and uses the wrong pronouns and has told me that my gender identity makes them uncomfortable and that I am simply attention seeking, despite being in therapy and looking into transition for the past five years (six in November). I have never expected or insisted that they are on board right away, but they’re aware how this behaviour affects me mentally and simply do not care. There have been quite a few times where they have used slurs, claiming they can say them because their partner at the time was of the race in question (we are both white and their partner at the time was asian). My sibling is also incredibly stereotypical when it comes to sexualities - ‘why do gays act like this’ and ‘it’s just weird that they’re like that’ however generally doesn’t care about sexuality.

When it comes to relationships, my sibling believes that all their exes should fawn over them and miss them. They believe their significant other should buy them gifts and says their significant other has to be rich and attractive. Recently, they complained that their partner had bought themselves something that was more expensive than gifts the partner had bought my sibling in the past. The people they date aren’t really all that bad, but my sibling definitely pushes them around and is sure to always ‘get their way’.

Now, my sibling turns 18 in September. As much as I don’t like them, I am very much afraid that they will immediately go to my biological father, which they have the right to do but will completely tear up my mum.

I want to cut my sibling out of my life and my parents (mum and step dad) lives completely or make it clear to the people around my sibling that they are a generally nasty person they should stay away from however I know these are both dramatic responses, which is why I haven’t done anything yet.

TL;DR my sibling is toxic and violent and wants to go back to my abusive biological father. Should I cut them out my life?",30Apr2020,1

Alright so last night not sure why but I decided to go onto my photos and I went onto my old ex best friends one and as soon as I click on it the song i ‘I guess you moved on by Papithbk’ plays and I suddenly felt really really weird and upset looking at old photos.

I thought about the old times and how much I missed out on bc of my toxic relationship I was in which ended really badly and also got me in a lot of hot water, then my ex best friend unfollows me and that kinda hurt but I kinda said to him (not in person but like scrolling through his profile) ‘I’ve enjoyed it sorry for my fuck ups stay safe’ then unfollowed him 

I went to bed then I got a visitation from one of my dead teacher that I always looked up to and when I saw him vividly in my dream back in the boarding house I started to cry in my dream and hug him tightly then he slowly disappeared. Then one of my friends comforted me in my dream.

65,"I think I've been realizing places where a close friend of mine from college has been crossing boundaries and behaving as an emotional manipulator. We've had a lot of arguments, I've gotten the silent treatment, she expects me to come to her when she's upset, hours and sometimes a whole day will occasionally be devoted to these sort of conflicts, most of which are centered around me being somehow not attuned to her needs or emotionally supportive enough. Maybe y'all can lmk if, in this situation, I'm out of line or not.

SO, here we go...the tea.. my close college friend (we'll call her Bestie) hooked up with one of my friends (hookup) a few times, drunk. She had conversations with the girl afterward. First wanted hookup to admit feelings for her, then started feeling it had been manipulative, coercion, etc etc after hookup spun a sort of sob story and didn't directly address things or ask how to make it good again w Bestie. 

Bestie &amp; Hookup don't talk any more. They are kept out of groups together. This means it is a very emotionally sensitive, touchy thing when I spend time with my friends as a group without Bestie present (since hookup is invited and she's not). I've shown sympathy but also expressed in a very considerate way that I would be going to these hangouts when I'm invited because I miss seeing other friends. It went over fine, until the next day, and now Bestie keeps coming to me saying how shitty it feels to be left out, but also saying she just wants to be heard and emotionally supported. Which support I did provide, along with a bit of justification of my role within the situation since I felt targeted and like the previous conversation was being ignored, which was not received well. 

But after two rounds of her bringing these emotions to me while I'm just trying to live a night (watch a movie, go to an event over video chat) I expressed that I felt uncomfortable being vented to further because I was so close to the situation and couldn't help feeling guilted (throughout the whole deal she'd also not responded to texts and been frustrated with my responses). She got defensive and said it wasn't really venting. She said she respected my decision to hang out with people but also felt excluded by me and that it was inevitable I'd feel guilty bc from her perspective I'd been curving her all day around going to the hangout that she wasn't even invited to in the first place. I said I wasn't responsible for her emotions. She said she felt I didn't even think about how any of this made her feel and that I make her feel at fault for my own problems. We took a break from talking. I don't know if I ought to address it and maybe things will smooth over and improve, if I'm the one who needs to apologize, or if i should just send some text that we should take a longer break, and back away.",30Apr2020,1

70,"I apologize in advance for how longwinded this is! It's my first time explaining my situation, let alone posting on here!

I currently carry the legal last name of my father, who my mom divorced when I was 6 months old. I've always lived with my mom and was forced to visit him every other weekend growing up due to custody agreements. I'm grateful for all my mom did growing up, she knew divorcing him when I was young and taking me away would save me from being raised by him. He's an alcoholic, drug user, aggressive, and all-around terrible person to my mother and eventually, me. I tried for so many years to give him the benefit of the doubt, to understand why he was the way he was and just try to have a normal relationship with my dad. Eventually, I learned that it gave me nothing but severe anxiety, trauma, and pent up guilt. In the end, it just isn't worth it, some people aren't worth destroying yourself to appease simply for the sake of ""having a dad."" 

Meanwhile In the household I was really raised in, I had my mom and my stepdad, who came around when I was 2. He was always there for me. Every birthday, every after school activity, he watched my high school musical with me on repeat without one complaint, he taught me how to care for my pet hamster and how to move on after it died. To me, he was a father figure. I have a hard time calling him my ""dad,"" since it's more complicated than that. My idea of a dad has been warped, it doesn't feel right to call him dad since my birth father has ruined the word for me for so long. Still, in my eyes my step-dad is the one that takes the place of what a dad should. 

I was raised alongside my two younger sisters, who are his and my mom's kids. I grew up in this household, I felt safer here while was always anxious and unsafe when visiting my dad. Yet, I carry his last name instead. There was never any reason in court that would prompt me to change it, and my mom never tried. She couldn't predict *how* he would react, but one would assume it would be difficult. All my life I had to use his last name while growing up with a family I loved that carried another, the last name I always wished I had.

Now I'm an adult in college and rarely see my dad. Occasionally we call, and due to the custody agreements, he helps pay my tuition. His way of showing me affection was always money, which I know I shouldn't complain. Of course I'm grateful for it, but its important to understand that this was what you could call ""guilt money."" When he would upset me or hurt me growing up, he would take me out shopping or buy me a new stuffed animal. I turned it down a lot growing up, but soon learned to be okay with it in a sense. He'll never be my dad, but I'm okay letting him do partial pays for my tuition. I'm not going to let myself get torn up for that because I've acknowledged this won't make up for what he's done or act as a sign of affection. 

It really hurts to carry his last name, and I always wished I had the last name of the family that raised me. Now as an adult, I have the freedom to change my last name. However because he does send auto payments to my account, there is the possibility he would find out. I don't know how he would react, and though I don't feel the need to impress him I do worry about whether he'll still help me pay for my education. I know it sounds low to say that, but I certainly can't afford my education without that help, and also he's still my parent legally. He's expected to help me pay that, it's the least he can do after not being the parent I needed. 

I'm not sure how to approach this. If I change it and the next time he fills out a check or calls my school, there's a chance I'll have to tell him. If I do change it and tell him, I'm not sure how to approach it. However If I don't change it, I'll have to go through more years of carrying this name I hate and graduate with a diploma with that name printed on it.

My boyfriend (22) and I (22) have been together for 6 years, we’ve have our downs and ups, we have taken a lot of “break ups” and once (2018) we broke up for 6 months. In that time I slept with another man. There was no chance of coming back together for me that time.

Eventually we came back together (beginning of 2019) until now. There are a lot of things that changed for good but since then he holds a grudge on me (he really resents me) for what I did and little by little he came back to the same attitudes that he swore he wanted to change and he will change (give me “ultimatums”, insult me and being very cruel to me during fights, hit things when he is angry etc.) I’ve been trying to compensate him by helping him, listen to him, being more thoughtful; basically I put up with everything that he wanted to tell me and everything he wanted to do. Basically I was his punching bag (not literally) I really want to understand that he is having a bad time and has a lot of self-esteem problems right now. I swear to god I’m trying so hard, but he is stuck in a deep dark hole where he can’t go out. 

This is killing me, I thought I could manage it because I thought this was temporal but it isn’t. He is totally blind and he sees me like a monster, I doesn’t matter how hard I try to do right for him even if that implies to suck down my feelings. I’M SICK OF HIM NOT APPRECIATING MY WHOLE EFFORT AT ALL WHICH IS TEARING ME APART. Almost every one that knows the situation tells me that I should leave him. But I won’t do it.

I work at the new store downtown it’s large and beautiful but the only thing is I want to transfer to the original store which is much more cramped and cluttered. The reason why is because my manager is very harsh. She is super strict on everyone, scolds people in front of others. She’s even made one of my coworkers cry! She has written me up for not immediately saying “hello” and greeting customers AS SOON AS THEY OPEN THE DOOR. She’s an okay person out of work but she’s very up tight and when she’s on the floor working with the rest of us we’re all tense and super stressed. Always afraid of messing up cause she’ll get upset and scold you and make you feel like crap. She doesn’t provide a peaceful fun work environment. 

Since this whole COVID 19 started our store closed and the original store stayed open and I’m working there temporarily. However I’ve enjoyed my time there much more than at my store. The environment is much more peaceful and fun and more chill. Everyone is happy and talkative and no one is stressed out. The manager there is another female but she’s totally different she’s much more flexible and reasonable to talk to. My other manager is not approachable but this one is and she’s extremely nice. 

So now I want to transfer and told the manager of the original store I would like to work there and she said she’s love to have me! Now the only problem is I have to tell my current manager and she has to fill out a form to transfer me out. There’s no way I get around just transferring without speaking to her. I don’t want to hurt her feelings or be offensive and blame her. So what reason can I make up or give for wanting to transfer? I live close to the new store and the original one I want to work at is a little further away but not by much so distance isn’t really an issue I can blame it on. So do you guys have any advice on what I should say? I know it’s kinda dumb but I’d like to hear some suggestions on what I can make up or say so she won’t feel offended or upset and deny my transfer! Please help!",30Apr2020,1
79,"Throwaway cuz obv reasons 

I’ve had this on my mind for years, and have had no one to go to. So I figured reddit is the best place to ask for help. 

As the title says I’m an 18 y/o male and I’ve had very little sexual history with girls. I have made out with 5, and the furthest I have ever gone with a girl was making out with her topless. Pretty pathetic I know, maybe you’ll understand why it’s a throw away now. But I’m not an incel, I’m not a creep or some weirdo who can’t get laid for obvious reasons. I’m a very normal, decent looking guy. I have many friends and I’m liked by many people, people I don’t even affiliate with much. I’m charismatic and funny. This isn’t meant to gloat but to say how I’m very normal, just like other guys my age who are having sex all the time. 

I believe my parents are honestly to blame for this. They’ve always been very “stick up their ass” Christians who have frowned upon any contact with the opposite gender. I never got the chance to hang out with a girl alone, or go to a girls house, or anything that teens my age normally did. My parents constantly checked my phone and read my texts, and always wanted to know where I was going and who I was with. The only times I did things like make out was very secretive. I even got caught once or twice and the punishment was absolute hell.

I feel like this lack of sexual experiences has seriously hurt my self esteem and confidence, and it makes me think that there must be something wrong with me. At this point I’m honestly terrified of having sex, because I think I’ll be bad at it since I’m so used to just jerking off to get my fix. I need serious advice and help, this is absolutely wrecking me on the inside.

So my aunt is apart of the Monat MLM and my mother has become one of those family members that bought the stuff to help support her. 

When I learned it was an MLM I immediately told my mom what it was and that we shouldn’t buy it any more and she seemed to believe me so I at least have that.

What I’m most concerned about is my aunt. I have two small cousins who I love very much and I do not want to see them struggle due to my aunts choices. I want to confront her on the issue but I’m not sure how the best way to go about it is.

On one hand I just want to directly ask her if she’s aware she’s in an MLM and just start listing off the dangers, or if I should do it slowly and subtly. 

I also see her instagram posts about it but I wasn’t sure it was an MLM till the box of products showed up at my house and I googled the name to see what it was. 

I do plan on co fronting her regardless cause I am genuinely concerned for their safety. I would just like to avoid bad blood brewing in the process.",30Apr2020,1

86,"TL;DR  
I want to try dating my best friend again, but I've become emotionally jaded over the years with her.  
I've (M23) known this person (F27) for nearly 4 years now, we've been best friends, and even tried dating on &amp; off. She and I tend to get along well for the most part, though she's also a recovering addict, which leads to her being emotionally immature whenever we get into arguments. Whenever we did get into arguments, we'd stop contacting each other for an indefinite amount of time (with the longest being a little over a year.), whenever we get back together; we talked &amp; acted as though no time has passed, or that whatever argument we've had wasn't worth holding a grudge.  
We've been getting into contact with each other again recently, and she says that she's now willing to stop with all the games of us arguing &amp; cutting off contact with each other. We've also brought up the topic of being a couple again, though there's one problem that I have with all of this:  
I perceive that she &amp; I have a cyclical relationship with each other, and despite the fact that I want to trust her in her word, the pain in my heart causes me to doubt that we'll be ending this ""cycle"". I've grown tired of repeating this cycle over &amp; over again, and have told myself that I'd stop contacting her for the sake of myself, and my emotional well being.  
I like her, and I want to give this another shot, but I feel that the emotional pain that I've been through holds me back from actually being able to commit to the relationship. She seems to have healed from the pain through her religious beliefs, though I am not religious myself.   
How can I get over this emotional pain that I feel in my heart? How can I heal and start anew with this relationship?",30Apr2020,1

I do work and fully supported myself during this time working two jobs (30-32 hours/week) but decided that saving all that money while living at home could help me pay off student loans and grad school. My mom is more than happy to help me do this.

The problem is, during this quarantine my mom has basically forced me to come home and quit my two jobs, forbidden me from seeing my boyfriend, and when I leave to go to the store or run, texts me constantly about where I am, tells me that I'm taking too long, and asks when I am coming home. To clarify, I only agreed to stop working to appease her since I knew I was moving back in this summer anyways and didn't want to damage our relationship.

Yesterday I went back to work for the first time (against my mom's wishes) and my mom texted me every 2 hours, badgered me with questions when I got home, and insinuated that I was gone longer than I should have been. They come off as extremely overbearing and I am worried about how sustainable living at home is. My mom is treating me very similarly to how she did when I was in high school (a 9pm curfew and having to text her constantly where I was and what I was doing - not responding to her immediately was unacceptable).

 I think I'm nice to the point of shirt off my back no matter what for my friends and as I get older I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I also have a issue confronting others for fear that they will be angry at me and not like me. I'm not afraid of fights, but more knowing that someone doesn't like me. It's irrational.

Sorry for being so vague but hopefully the jist of the problem comes through. I've tried bringing this up with multiple therapists but they never give me a straight answer and maybe it is cause this is not a mental illness or doesn't seem that pressing. All I've heard from people is my niceness is one of my best qualities which makes me feel the fuzzies. But I'm starting to understand as I get older that it leaves you open to being royally taken advantage of by the bad apples.

It's not blatantly obvious now as when I was younger when people took advantage of me, but I've had people mention that X or Y is taking advantage of me, but then they ask me for similar favours. I always rationalize it as ,""it's not too much time out of my day"" so no biggie. I never ask for anyone to help me cause I feel that I'm inconveniencing them but deep down I know I am second fiddle to their lives and that makes me resentful cause they so easily ask me for help cause they know i will.

Since I've lived like this forever whenever I try to change myself through rational thought I feel emotionally horrible when I turn someone down. I reason it as why would I turn someone down when I can spare time to do this? I've had some recent situations where someone was fussing about paying their fair share of some monies and choosing to make some compromises of comfort beyond what is reasonable. After a small argument I told them to pay wtv they wanted and covered the rest cause i can afford it cause it's not a lot (under $100). Now the person is still friendly with me but deep down I feel taken advantage of. But saying something and even having brought it up in the first places makes me feel like an asshole cause I can afford it.

I'm finding it impossible to get out of my head and figure out what situations require me to go out of my way and which ones I should just say no to even if I can deal with the hassle of doing it, cause I will always make time for others. Helping them makes me resentful over time when I realise I'm second fiddle to their lives, and not helping them even when I know this causes me to feel like a horrible person.",30Apr2020,1

and now she’s saying “$90 gone jsut like that, just because you “thought” i’d like it, idk i’m sad, i don’t think u realize how much that is to me, i literally never ask for things and when i do i never ask for $90 games u know that, i literally play the same 3 games that are like $30 or under, anywya i’m just sad and disappointed, like my mom really wasted $90 on a game when she never buys anything for herself”

I’ve been getting a really weird vibe for the past 2-3 days like I’m being watched and things are at a full 10 tonight. It all started when was falling asleep an hour ago and heard something fall by my open window. The screen is closed and I have those pegs that only allow it to open a few inches but the curtain was pushed super far out like someone had tried to stick something through. 

I got up and locked both door locks (I usually just lock the bottom) and closed/locked all windows and popped up the pegs. As I was doing this I swear I heard someone walking across my front porch (it’s rickety wood). I looked out the front door and my porch light is out, I highly doubt it blew out on its own. I’m definitely not going outside to check. 

I live near a cow farm/train tracks so the area is super dark. My apartment is also surrounded by trees in the front and left, an open pasture to the back, and an old barn to the right so it’s super dark. My landlords live in front but I doubt they’re home, all their lights are off and I don’t see cars or hear their dogs. It’s also pitch black.

115,"Cw: possible family trauma, discussion of alcohol and alcoholism

I'm a teetotaler. I've been sober from alcohol since August 2018 and I'm nineteen years old.

Both of my parents are functional alcoholics and drink excessively each night. I fear that my younger sister is going down that path too. 

I quit after realising my relationship with alcohol wasn't healthy and I really don't want to end up like them. 

Even though it's been close to two years, I still get quite strong urges to get blitzed. I just want to get wasted, but I can't let myself do that. It's really hard to fight these urges but I've pulled through so far, although it's pretty distracting and difficult?

116,"My husband was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) less than 2 weeks ago. His parents were very supportive and flew from 2,000 miles away to stay with me and our son while my husband was in the hospital (we could not visit due to Covid visitor restrictions).  


Fast forward to now. My husband is in treatment and decided to announce through a post to his friends, colleagues, and family of his current condition (which is totally his choice; I see no problem with that). Long story short, word got out to his mother's side of the family, and Mom was NOT happy about this. She was burned by all of her siblings in the past and has a lot of resentment towards them. When her siblings started reaching out to her, she would ignore their calls/messages.  


My husband, on the other hand, although aware of his mom's history with her siblings, told his Mom (very nicely I must say) to not let her emotions get in the way of family wanting to be supportive and reach out to him during this difficult time. She was very concerned, borderline paranoid, that all of her siblings have bad intentions and are prying for information, when in all actuality, they want to see how their nephew is doing and wish him well.  


For example, my husband's uncle asked my husband for an address to send something (you know like a card, flowers, gift basket, etc), and my mother-in-law immediately assumed that they were trying to be nosy and wanted to know all of our business. Myself, as a neutral party, tried to be the voice of reason and told her, ""They probably just want to send him a get well gift (because....you know....he has cancer and all.....).""  


Anyway, she got really BENT that her sick son asked her to put her emotions aside for him and doesn't want to talk to her own son.....who is in the hospital.....getting chemotherapy as we speak. She basically has made this situation about her, when really that isn't what it's about. We are not asking her to kiss and make up with her siblings. All we want is for her to be civil and cordial and remember what this is really all about--supporting my husband (her son) through this very difficult time. What happened between her and her siblings has absolutely NOTHING to do with my husband and his fight with cancer.  


I tried asking my father-in-law to speak with her, but he expressed that it would be useless and she would only become even angrier (in other words, he's a pushover) although he completely agrees with everything my husband and I are saying. As for myself, I feel like it's out of my place to talk some sense into her, and it's awkward because our son and I are staying with them in their house while my husband gets treatment.

123,"I’m currently 23 years old and I admit I used to be extremely naive. I have a guy friend that has taken advantage of me more than once since I was a freshman in college, but it wasn’t until recently that I realized how messed up and slimy his actions were.

I first befriended him when I was 18 and going through a really rough time with my ex-boyfriend. My ex was manipulative and it was a toxic, mentally abusive relationship (he threatened to kill himself when I tried to break up with him). During this time I was pledging a Greek organization, and this friend was in the same class as me. I wanted to point this out because the pledge process was 8 weeks long. Within this time frame I managed to break up with my ex. There was one night my pledge class was up late working on our assignments and this friend had asked if he could sleep over. I said yes because my roommate had moved out and I had a spare bed he could sleep on. He asked me repeatedly that night if he could sleep in my bed with me. I said no multiple times yet he kept pushing me and eventually I gave up and said sure. All he did was cuddle me that night, but it still disgusts me thinking about how I wasn’t able to stand my ground back then. This night was never brought up again.

I ended up getting into another relationship with my current boyfriend the same year after we crossed. During this time I was so caught up in finally being with a good guy that I honestly couldn’t pinpoint any red flags from my friend.

We ended up dorming together my junior year with two other friends. We were basically always together and I considered him one of my best friends. But then summertime came around and we got really drunk one night. I somehow ended up in an Uber with him on my way back to my boyfriends apartment. I remember him getting really handsy with me and I kept telling him to stop. But he kept trying to hug me and told me no. That night he also told me that if I wasn’t with my current boyfriend, he would have made a move on me. I was so uncomfortable the entire ride and I was drunk texting my boyfriend how I felt. From then on my boyfriend didn’t like me hanging out with this friend because his motives are questionable. I remember feeling so grossed out by this encounter, but it got swept under the rug since we’re part of the same friend group and I was forced to continue casually seeing him in group events. I don’t even know if he remembers that night. 

Reading all of this back I know I should just cut him out of my life, but at one point I considered him one of my best friends. Nowadays I feel my stomach drop when I receive a text from him, because I genuinely dread it and just feel uncomfortable. He’s helped me in really rough patches of my life, such as dealing with the ex and more recently me having to take care of my sick mother. I feel like I exposed so much of my private life to him that it’s weird for me to just randomly cut him off? I’m not sure how to go about it. I feel like ghosting would be too cowardly, and I’ve always struggled with confrontation so I’d really like to overcome that. Despite how slimy some of his actions were, he was still there for me in the lowest points of my life. But it just doesn’t sit right for me knowing that he’ll never know how much he has hurt me. It truly makes me feel disgusting thinking about all the shit I let go. It just feels so out of the blue now to bring it up again... please help :(",30Apr2020,1

126,"Tldr at bottom since this is long and petty, I have nothing better to do though :/

We live in a row of cottages that are joined together wall to wall, for context. 

A few weeks ago our neighbour rang the police, mid pandemic, complaining about constant music and general noise coming from our house (a family of 4; 2 adults and 2 teenagers, who will inevitably make noise). These complaints were obviously bollocks and exaggerated because the music isn't constant, we played it at medium volume for one evening.

She also cited me as an issue, claiming that I make CONSTANT banging noises in my bedroom (go ahead, make the joke). This is bullshit since at the time of the complaint, I'd not been back from university for very long, so not constant. Any noise is a result of my door and my window opening/closing. It isn't helped by the fact that my room is right next to the bitch's, so she will inevitably hear noise coming from my room, as I do from hers (often moaning :/ ) 

The kicker is that, when she goes to work, she leaves her dogs barking all fucking day. My parents, who work from home, have to put up with that but have never complained to the police or the council. We mentioned it to her, like sane, rational people instead of calling the police and wasting their time.

She also put up a ridiculously high fence, despite her saying it would be smaller, that blocks all the light to our garden - hence why we originally fell out with her. 
 
Tldr - our neighbour made noise complaints about us despite us making a normal amount of noise for a 4 person family. She also won't stop her dogs from barking all day whilst out at work even though we've told her that they spend all day yapping. My parents who work from home have to live with this.

The truth of the matter is we don't really have much in common anymore and it takes most of my energy to spend even 45 minutes with her and maintain a conversation. She's pretty immature and is very close with her parents (she's an only child) which is the opposite of me. She's also still into disney movies and other kid stuff.

2. In the past, whenever I'd hang out with her and another one of her friends, it was like I wasn't even there with them and was the third wheel in the back 
3. I don't want to listen to her conversations about marching band in high school, or how she's applied to veterinary school 7 times over the past 5 years and doesn't know why she keeps getting rejected, or talking with her old roommates from college about whatever. I have no 

She texted me 3 times today and yesterday asking if I saw her message (I haven't responded to her yet) and then she called and texted my mom asking her if I'm okay, why am I not responding to her messages etc. My mom told me to call her and I told my mom what was going on and that I didnt want to be in her fucking zoom video call thing. ***Then my mom told me that I was rude, that I need to see a therapist, that this is why I don't have friends and that she told her that I'm going to call her tomorrow smh***

128,"So my friend invited me to an online pictionary game. We were all sharing our video cameras. Someone started drawing a girl with glasses and wavy hair, and I had already won a game so I typed my friend’s name just to troll since my friend had wavy hair and glasses and was even sitting at a side angle like the girl in the pic.

It turned out the answer was Medusa, and that the wavy hair was snakes. But the artist wasn’t that good at drawing and they were drawing with their computer mouse so it wasn’t clear. And other people guessed “girl” and “nerdy girl” so they also thought the snake hair was just wavy hair.

Anyway, someone asked “who guessed (friend’s name)?” And when I realized no one else found it funny, I decided to keep quiet and not own up to the fact I was the one who typed it. But then it revealed who made each guess so it showed I was the one who guessed my friend’s name. My friend suddenly turned off her webcam. I sat there, not knowing if I caused her to turn it off. She then opened her webcam again and was laughing and with everyone.

After the game I still texted her saying I was sorry and explained why I had guessed her. She replied “no worries. It was fun.” But it’s been a few days and usually she initiates chatting with me and hasn’t. I ended up initiating with her today, and her texts were very short 3-word responses. I am wondering if she thinks I see her as ugly and thought I was making a catty jab at her, especially when I didn’t own up to it and say it was me who guessed her name.

I just wanted to come on here and let some of my thoughts out and see if anyone has a similar issue? 

But basically I was born with pretty minor autism spectrum, one of my biggest symptoms being a sensory disorder. My parents get very ticked off by really small things, and my siblings who don’t have any mental disorders agree. If there’s a lot going on such as my family being too loud or being too invasive, for example, barging into my room without knocking and then yelling for something as little as my shoes being in the wrong spot, I’ll start to go into panic mode and have trouble breathing and will start to tear up. I’ve tried to explain to them what it’s like having my disorder, since they never really listened to my doctor, but they always tell me to suck it up or quit being so sensitive.

Another example is when I am doing chores such as doing the dishes, they always decide to be right next to me in the kitchen and start cooking or cleaning or something. And trust me I know this sounds super super dramatic but if I’m washing dishes and people are walking around me within like 2 feet of me, I start to get very irritated and I’ve never been able to put a finger on why but I’ll start to get a migraine or want to hit something. 

That’s probably not a very good explanation (explaining stuff properly is another issue I have with my disorder) but I am always trying to explain how I feel to my parents and they always take it personally or tell me I’m being a sensitive sissy.

137,"To make a long story short my entire life I have been lazy, stubborn, and I have had my hand held throughout most of my life. Now I am 19 and I am trying to get on the right path. I'll buy planners, I'll set reminders on my phone, and at the end of the week (or two weeks if I'm lucky) I'll just fall down the same rabbit hole I was once in.

I can't seem to get it together. I know its absolutely stupid of me to say that I want the easy way out, but I can't stand being stagnant any longer. It's like I just don't care. I have no motivation to do the things I don't want to do, and if I don't feel like doing the task at hand I just... don't.

My academics are absolute shit right now and my parents don't know. It took my mom a little over 4 months for my mom to admit that I ""probably"" have ADD despite the fact that my doctor diagnosed me with it months ago and just today agreed to treat me for it.

I know that there's not a magic pill to motivate you, but I'm worried that my mom is right in the sense that I am expecting it to be that way. I'm not a healthy person. I don't eat right, I have a god awful sleep schedule, I don't exercise regularly, and I just feel like shit.

I have no direction in life and I have been drifting since I was 14, and I just don't care. I have no idea how I'm supposed to make it on my own and since I have no reason to give a shit about my hygiene or my organizational issues I don't try to work on it because I have had my parents to do that. I've formed bad habits over the course of my life, and my mind is saying I need to change but my body just won't act. What do I do?

TL;DR: I'm a dumbass kid that isn't mature enough to do what I need to do and need genuine help. It's been roughly 8 months since I've been diagnosed with ADD and my doctor is just now deciding to treat me. I have no direction in life and I need to know how to fix myself and stop repeating my self destructive behavior.",30Apr2020,1

I feel like it's riskier to quit without backup but I might never do it if I keep waiting to find another job and only half heartedly working on a new job because of the lack of time, energy and courage.

This is probably bad/unwise but it is a grocery store and I don't even want to put it 2 weeks notice because it's dangerous to work there and I also just don't want to spend another second there because it sucks and I don't want to change my mind so that might screw up my references which might have been good otherwise.

139,"I’m in dire need of some advice! 

This always occur, I have very toxic thoughts and wishes in friendships. I genuinely try my best to not act on them. I don’t want these thoughts. They’re very haunting and scary. 

My current friend and I got into an argument which hasn’t been solved. For the past five years in our friendship, it was fine. Minor bumps, but nothing major. Suddenly, this person started ditching me for others and ghosting me. Of course it hurts. If this person just told me that they wanted to hang out wit others, I would’ve happily backed off. After I confronted the ditching issue, they promised to not ditch last minute or to tell me if they want to hangout with others. We decided to hangout again after a week of them ditching, and I got last minute ditched. I didn’t say anything, but this happened again. By then I said something, and they promised not to ditch last minute plans. Well, I got stood up until 4 AM.


At this point, I’m really just having scary toxic thoughts. 

“Are they better than me? Are they more popular? Why is my friend ditching me? I hope my friend loses all their friends. I hope my friend fails at [insert hobby that their new friend got them into]” and so many more.

I’m scared of these thoughts. My friend has every right to be friends with others. They have every right to be happy and enjoy time with others. I don’t act on these thoughts, but they’re getting more and more constant. They won’t easily go away. I know my friend SUDDENLY CHANGED after meeting these people; however, I have no right to tell my friend off. I don’t want to. But my brain is in a very dark place. I don’t want to lose friends because of this.


My friendships have always turned out to be shit, even if I’m not being toxic. At this point, I wis I can monopolize my friends; however, that is wrong. I don’t want to restrict them. I don’t want to do that to them. How do I fix myself? I don’t want to harm anyone.",30Apr2020,1

Everything started withmy first Sem when I scored a 9.55 SGPA and came second, ever since then I got a more and more careless cause things got easier for me, I havent bought books, borrowed them studied max of a week prior at times even the night and made all the way throught college (almost cause the last sem is left). I've even scored the highest of 9.75 once and my worst is 8.75. Well those number might fascinate you but I know Jack shit, I just somehow learn prior exams teach people and get myself through the concepts but if you ask me now Idk most of it, also Accountancy is important for my stream and I have to go through the format every time I start studying and that's like ABC's of account, I forget stuff and don't feel its important. This is kinda weird cause now I have to learn more stuff but I can't be sure of myself to be smart or intelligent cause I feel hollow, I might answer your question right but most of my answers are based on proximity and probability. So yaa I've pretty much lost my self confidence can't think of something positive as a outcome but I start to study from basics my over confidence and show off ness fucks it all up, cause I'm the guy who read stuff 2 days ago and topped.

144,"As the title says, my step-mom encourages the murders of people who fall under the sex worker umbrella. This includes strippers, porn stars, prostitutes, or basically anybody who has a risque job in her eyes. Now, while I don't necessarily like those types of jobs as a whole, I have massive respect for people like that who are willing to put their bodies on display. It's a hard thing for many to do.

There's some obvious background that I have to assume leads her to having this opinion. She was cheated on by her first husband the night of their wedding, and was left by her second husband for a prostitute he ended up having a hidden second family with. On top of that, she stereotypes strippers because her sister was one and also happened to be a MASSIVE thief &amp; drug addict.

I understand that she's had bad experiences with promiscuous women in the past, but wilfully and hatefully wishing death upon the range of professions is WAY over the top. I'm a mortuary science major, and we hammer in the idea again and again that you absolutely must respect the dead. Seeing a mentality like hers hurts so bad.

I'm not sure how I should deal with her nonstop threats to this group of people. I want to talk with her about it but every time I try, she gets really emotional and turns it on me. My younger step-sisters always defend her when she's upset because they've seen her be abused before and rightfully want to protect their mother, but it just enforces the idea in her mind that her opinion is completely justified.

Everything about her 26F is perfect, she is beautiful, kind, caring, compassionate, protective, even our personalities mesh. I love her and she loves me. I have found a way to provide not only for myself but for her as well by means of manual labor. I'm healthily, lean, and more or less by all others opinion... ""I have my shit together"".... 

almost 3 years ago I was having a simple conversation while enjoying my weekend alchoholic beverages...with my gf on a typical friday night... when she began showing symptoms of a stroke. 

I have wanted to be a firefighter for about 5-6yrs at this point and we were fortunate enough that I had EMT Basic training from a college course I was taking before I dropped out.

So I actually knew what was happening to her. I ended up making a calculated decision on transporting her to the hospital myself rather than wait for an ambulance.  that decision later was confirmed by the ER doc, was the sole reason she lived.

Once my GF was hospitalized, certain things came to light. 
I was forced to acknowledge... that she in fact has had a long standing history with... Anorexia.... Something I suspected but was unwilling to confirm at the time. she was hospitalized for nearly 3 months. 

in here absence... I did a lot of reading on the ED....

When she did finally come home I refused to allow myself to be an enabler....of her ED. something that she resisted heavily and eventually accepted.... that I was in fact slightly more determined to see positive changes.

every single day for almost 3years now, I have been that external voice to help passively silence her ED demons.... she is now more open about it, she says she eats lunch when I'm at work which all I have is her word, but the reality is...


.......she is not getting better........

I hate myself for failing her.....

I love her.....

I'm 26 years old.... 

I want to have a child...I'm ready to start my family with her and marry her.... 

but she hasn't had a menstrual cycle since we've met.....

I dont think she could even bring a child into this world full term without it killing her....

And today ...idk if it was the light..... but I realized i am utterly unsure whether or not I'm still physically attracted to her.. 

I love her.... but my eyes are starting to stray...

and I'm slowly falling apart inside because i hate myself for thinking these things....

152,"I'm a university student who has been one of the lucky ones to land a job in a time of such uncertainty and stress, but I want to quit after only 2 days of on-the-job training. For context, the company is a large food company, and the position is a Sales Rep (basically deliver product to stores, stock shelves, and maintain inventory). The problem is that my trainer is doing an awful job. He is having me complete mundane self-explanatory tasks (stocking food on shelves) while I see him completing more important tasks like ordering product, managing inventory, and interacting with managers (something I will need to learn in a short time when I begin working alone)  


As an example, today my trainer was ordering product after we stocked shelves. The managers say to ask as many questions as possible to learn as much as we can. So I asked a question and here's how the conversation went:  


&gt;Me: ""I see you scanning many products for a new order.. how do we know how much to order for the next delivery? Do we rely on previous sales to estimate how much to order for next time?""   
&gt;  
&gt;Trainer: ""Well its kind of hard to explain""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Well will I have to be ordering product on my own after training""  
&gt;  
&gt;Trainer: ""Yes""

And that was the extent of that conversation and many others that I've tried to have with him. He's not teaching my anything, and I don't want to be thrown into the job after training and have absolutely no idea what I am doing by myself. 

At the end of the day, we get back to the factory to sign out and clean out the delivery truck. Back inside the factory, my trainer gets talking to another full-time worker (lets call him Bob). For context, as a summer student, I am coming in to cover full-time workers shifts when they take vacation (but due to COVID-19, many of the full-time workers have cancelled their vacation). Here's how this conversation went:

&gt;Bob: ""so they want me to take my vacation days even though I have nowhere to go on vacation."" **\*Bob looks over at me, while still speaking to my trainer\*** \- ""they want these guys to take my shifts, I'm not taking my vacation days""  
&gt;  
&gt;Trainer: **\*looks to me\*** ""No disrespect, but the company should have scrapped the summer student program this year.

After that, I'm sitting there in shock about what I just heard. And now, tonight, I'm sitting here thinking to myself.. ""maybe my trainer is doing such a poor job because he doesn't want me (a summer student) working for the company this summer because they want to keep their hours"". I also can't help but feel like the rest of the full-time employees feel the same way about me and other summer students who have come to work. 

As a full-time university student, I am eligible for government benefits if I am unemployed during COVID-19, and I am genuinely considering quitting this week. 

I feel like I'm being used as an errand boy rather than learning anything of value. The work is hard, and I will never shy away from hard work, but I'm not willing sit here, receive poor training, and then thrown into the stores by myself with no idea what I'm doing.

For about half a year now I had started thinking about moving in with some friends who live in a different state, and those plans are almost completely finalized (which is great!) However, the only people who know right now are my soon-to-be-roommates. I had only told my friends a big “MAYBE” a couple months ago

I’ve kept a lot of secrets from my parents due to their overprotective nature, last year I didn’t even tell them I was moving out of their house until the week before it happened. They also don’t know what I do for work because they wouldn’t approve, even though I make good money. I’m very nervous about telling them I’m leaving for a few reasons:
1. They don’t know how much money I really make, so I know they will get suspicious that I have the money for this move to an expensive city
2. One of the reasons I’m moving is to pursue this job, which I don’t want them to know about 
3. Their overall reaction (I know they will flip out)

I also feel the need to “explain myself” to everyone for some reason? My boss, friends, family, everyone. I want to just say that I’m moving because I’m young and want to explore new things, but my brain tells me that’s “not good enough” and it needs to be for school or work (I haven’t gotten the job yet, but even if I don’t I’m still going)

158,"22F. I lost my dad to cancer 2 months ago. He passed only 12 days after being given 3-6 months so it was really unexpected. The whole situation was traumatizing for me because I have very little family and was by his side as he passed and it was all just a huge nightmare. 

Anyway, I only have (had?) a couple of close friends because I’ve moved around a lot and honestly it’s just hard to make friends when I don’t go to school and work with people quite a bit older than me.

My best friend here who I’ve known for about 8 years was there for me right after my dad died and up until the funeral. But since then he’s barely spoken to me at all. He goes through these spurts where he’s stuck up his boyfriends ass and forgets that I exist and then only talks to me when he feels like it. He’s always done this but I’ve put up with it because I felt like I had to. But he has reached out to me to actually talk maybe two times since my dad died, one of which because he and his boyfriend broke up for a day and he probably had nothing better to do.

I’m not trying to sound like I think I need so much attention, but like... my dad, the most important person to me in this world died. And I’ve been pretty much alone since then because my life revolved around my dad. And my “best friend” all but forgot I existed. Then today, I see him post pictures on vacation with 4 of his friends who all totally ditched him last year because they had cooler people to hang out with.

So at this point I really just want to move on and try to work on myself. I want to delete him off of all social media because if I don’t see his shit everywhere it’s a lot easier for me. But I also don’t want drama or him asking me to explain why I did it, because God knows he’ll turn it around and blame me somehow like always. 

Have any of you ever cut someone off without all of the drama involved? I have a couple of good things going for myself right now, I’m planning to move away in about a year, and so I just want to leave the past behind me. But I’m afraid it’ll be a bad idea and just cause more trouble.",30Apr2020,1
159,"Hello! I am 19 years old and work at a sign shop in my area in Sales/Design/Production. This is my first job and I have been employed there for about 8 months now and have caught on very quickly. I would like to say: I love my field of work and creating things for my city. I know shitty coworkers and management is a common thing in ANY workplace, but hear me out. I do not think what I go through is 'normal'. I would like advice/what you were to do if you were in my situation.

How is my job hell? Well.. to keep a long story short.

Boss is a hot-head. So is my sales manager. They fight, like full on yelling matches. Boss punches file cabinets. Sales manager has scratch marks in her desk.. etc. Turns out, they are dating which probably contributes to this. Since they fight over everything this often leaves my sales manager in a very hostile mood. So anytime I come to her with questions, she acts as if it is a huge inconvenience. This affects my job performance greatly as I am not able to get things done efficiently.

After the arguments over simple things, she just takes her anger out on whomever is around in a passive aggressive way. Which in a small shop of no more than 5 people and we are the only two in sales. It usually ends up being me. I have already asked my boss if he could consult with her, he said **I** should talk to her about it. Yeah, no thanks.

There are other smaller things, despite it being a small shop. SO much has happened in my 8 months being there. Sometimes it feels like I am in a movie.

I, of course have debated leaving. But as this is my first job and I have very little experience. It is much more difficult. Oh and I have signed a 5-year NDA to not work at another sign shop within a 5 mile radius. Which is pretty much all of them. And with COVID-19 no where is hiring of course. So that definitely complicates things. Could I get out of the NDA? (Yes I could always work somewhere besides a sign shop. I would like to stay in the sign industry.)

161,"Some clarification, I asked a similar question in r/RelationshipAdvice, however, that was before a few confessions. I got advice on trying to better communicate with him, so I tried to do that. That frankly went better than I expected, as i opened him up just a little bit more. My Boyfriend was sexually assaulted when he was 13 Years old. His at the time father had raped him multiple times in the span of a year, when he was 14, we had been dating for about 5 months, and he broke down in front of me and explained what had happened.

I was Extremely furious, and my hatred for his father has stayed with me 9 years later. I usually try to have sex with him, as my libido is quite high. We rarely actually do it, maybe once a week or so. However, recently it has down to the point we don't have any intercourse nor ""inappropriate"" touching. He is what you could consider a ""trap."" He is quite feminine and about 2 inches taller than me. This causes a lot of people to mistake him for a girl, which makes him extremely embarrassed, which he also does when we have intercourse. 

He recently confessed to me that he is 'terrified' of sex. He enjoys it, but he just feels bad and kinda uncomfortable doing so. He directly can't stand any sort of touching, which of course doesn't help me either. He is currently stuck at my place due to Covid, so al he does is online school and with his relatively small amount of Youtube money in order to buy food and stuff, which he admits had made him really stressed out. 

I really am desperate for any sexual interaction with him. He has said he doens't want to leave me and legitimately loves me, but he simply can't stand sex. I really appreciate your time guys! Thank you :3!",30Apr2020,1
162,"I am 17M and my father doesnt do anything but sit around and smoke weed all day, watch cnn, go on his phone, eat unhealthy food, sleep. He has been doing this for the past 4 years at the age of 53

He does not look like a stoner, just a washed up business man, hes definitely overweight, and he has bi-polar disorder but takes medication for it, hasnt had any recent phases for it within the past 2 years. Claims hes depressed but when I constantly offer him help or give him ideas he just trolls and tries to be funny.

His dad died at the age of 60 from a heart attack, when my dad was 16.   I am scared my father is going to have one too, he smokes cigarettes for the past 40 years and is always coughing. He has not been diagnosed with anything but high blood pressure, I can tell he is in poor health though.

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked him if he wants to rot away, even though he has perfect opportunities;  (money laying around, self improvement, educating himself off the internet)... then he just laughs and say he wants to rot away . I have confronted him so many times with my eyes watering up asking if he is going to let his sons watch him decay, waste all the rest of his lifeless years , and die and he says ""Yes"" ... he does not care, my 3 brothers dont either... no one does",30Apr2020,1

164,"A little long. tl;dr at the bottom  


I'm 30, and I've had a job of some kind since I was 16. I only left jobs if I moved or, in two cases, the work environment was hostile. I received promotions when I worked at a call center, I worked when I went back to college, and nobody ever wanted to get rid of me at work.

Fast forward to 2017. I had a temp job for three months, where I wasn't hired full time after the probationary period because, despite the temp agent only getting positive reviews, my boss said he didn't like me very much. Ok... 

Then I worked in accounting at a law firm for 18 months. It was a very, very hostile environment, but the pay was phenomenal at the time, so I kept it until the burnout was impossible to hide. My boss, during my review, said that she knew I was capable of doing so much more, so me underperforming was \*intentional\* and disrespectful. I didn't argue back. But later (just this past April), I got fired for the first time for poor performance. I was enthusiastic about being let go (again, hostile lawyers), but it was still my first time being fired.

I got a job a few weeks later for a large A/C company, working accounting and payroll. Here's where I realize I have a problem. People would call my name, and I'd barely hear them. Like I heard them say things, but I just was too lethargic to respond to anyone. I slept 8 hours and I even got a CPAP because I suspected I had developed sleep apnea, but I was like a zombie at this place. A few months in, my boss literally said, ""what the entire fuck is your problem? You're very brilliant at problem solving, but I don't think you're even alive."" I admit I got my feelings hurt, and when he asked me what he should do, I said that he should do what's best for the company. My supervisor, in the same meeting, said that I didn't apply myself anymore.

I decided to go back to graduate school. Fast forward to this past March. I found work at a pharma company. This time, it's outbound calling to insurance companies. I got let go today, because according to them, I was working too slowly and I also ""sucked the life out of the room.""

None of my friends or family would say that I'm a mean, cold, or apathetic person. But, the past few years, I have been unable to enjoy anything in my life. School has been tough, even though it's a field of study I enjoy. It's mostly just motivating myself to do the work. The thing is, it's not that I am trying to be lazy and avoid it: I think about doing my work all the time, and I perpetually stay signed in and try to do it, but I stare blankly a lot and daydream. At night, I cannot stay asleep.

I used to be a very hard worker, and I used to motivate others around me. But for the past few years, I feel like I'm an emotional vampire, even though I try to speak to people as little as possible now just because I've apparently been unpleasant. I don't snap or cuss at people, I don't throw people dirty looks, I don't do anything hostile - and yet, my work ethic seems to be in the gutter, and people at work hate working with me apparently. 

I don't know the first thing I should be doing.

171,"I will try to make this as short as possible and sincerely appreciate any advice you can give. I do need to give you the context though: 

Six years ago I started at my company as a customer service rep but have since worked my way up to a senior outside sales rep position in a good territory. I am the youngest employee in my region but I consistently outsell my peers and train new hires. Recently my VP told me I demonstrate her “ideal qualities” for a rep in my position.

We are paid salary + commission so your earning potential is strongly tied to your territory, good or bad. Typically new reps are expected to “develop” or “grow” the bad territories and then tenure up to the good territories after proving their selling ability. My salary increased from $40k - $45k across two promotions over 5 years + around $10k/year in commission. 

My current location has historically employed two outside reps. In Sept 2018 my coworker (and the more senior outside rep of the two of us) left for a better paying job. Within 10 mins of her resignation, my boss and the VP decide the newly hired outside rep from a nearby location will move into this position. I was disappointed that I was not considered for the more “senior” position (and the better territory) but kept that entirely to myself and made big efforts to make her feel welcome. 

A few months after the new hire has settled into our location, she proves to be a disappointment to our boss for reasons I won’t get into. Around this same time she is chatting me up at my desk and casually mentions how she is making a base salary of $60k/year. What?! $60k?! Remember I am making $45k after five years and 2 promotions with a worse territory. 

I decide to confront my boss. I tell him I’ve earned my keep after 5 years and I am worth at least, if not more, than said coworker and I would like to be compensated as such. He tells me lots of things but ultimately his argument had little merit and they end up giving me a $5k raise (base is now $50k). They also cut the territories in half so the best portion of her territory and the best portion of my territory (which I grew over 3 years to be quite lucrative) become one territory which is awarded to me. New coworker is given the worst parts of both territories and quits 6 months later. She was not replaced and her territory was given to reps in other locations. 

Fast forward to now: I have been working in my new, large, great territory for over a year and receive nothing but positive feedback. I exceeded my goal by over 10% and I am consistently ranked in the company-wide top 10 week after week. I also made nearly $80k in 2019 after commission and bonus. I was promised a raise based on my performance but that is now TBD with COVID-19. I was finally able to pay off cc debt, build up my savings and I just got pre-approval for a mortgage last week. I also am expecting my second child. This is where the story details and I need advice. 

I told my boss I am expecting 2 days ago. He took the news well and asked if he could inform VP. I said yes of course. Today he calls and tells me VP says it’s time to hire someone for the other position now that I will be going out in the fall (US - 12 weeks unpaid leave). He tells me that we will need to split up my territory by choosing either the new area acquired last year or the area I built up from the beginning. He can’t give a new hire the “worse” territory because it wouldn’t be “setting them up for success.” He says he wants to bring back a former rep who left for more money 3 years ago. He already spoke with her and she is “happy to take whichever territory plishyploshy doesn’t want.” 

For the record, the “coverage” they are citing as a need while I am out on leave can be fulfilled by the junior sales rep in our location or the two reps who are currently residing with us while they wait on construction of their new location (which was supposed to open Spring 2019 but still has not broken ground).  

I tell him this is very concerning to me. I am not prepared to take a financial hit like this and the timing is bad optics at best. I propose a few different solutions for how to bring on a new person without cutting my territory (i.e. pay). He said we were not getting anywhere and ended the call. I followed up with an email at the end of the day pointing out my track record, my value, etc. and four alternate solutions to splitting up my territory. I kept emotions out of most of but did note “my personal concerns” at the bottom highlighting my current pregnancy and impending home purchase (I hope this wasn’t a mistake). I ended it by asking to discuss this further on a call with him and the VP. 

What more can I do to defend myself? What can I do to protect my financial gains I have worked for to this point? Am I wrong to think I’ve earned my position and deserve to keep it? 

On a personal note I am heartbroken that I now regret telling them I’m pregnant. This makes my new baby feel like a dent in my career. My first thought was to look for a new job but I am doubtful anyone will hire me 5 mos pregnant in a pandemic. My insurance is also tied to my job, of course, and it is important that I maintain a steady income.

172,"Hello everyone. I’m going to skip a lot of her past details, just for convenience sake. Sorry if it’s too long.

Me and her have been friends since we were babies. However she has experienced a lot of traumatic things in her life, and it’s always been known she’s been bullied heavily always for being the “weird” kid, but I didn’t know how bad because of factors I won’t bring in here. She has been abused heavily, and she dated an ex who constantly berated her and called her names, cheated on her openly, which I think might be contributing to this current issue we have. I love her very very much, but her issues have been so out of control I’m starting to wonder if this is going to last much longer. 

We have been dating for a few months now, and it started when we reconnected again after a few years. We started dating quickly after that. I always knew she was “quirky,” but I her experiences might have damaged her more than she likes to admit. She has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD. She is currently seeing a therapist. 

One huge issue she deals with is jealousy. Because of her ex and his gross behavior towards her, it would seem obvious why she acts this way. When school was still going on, we would often meet up in the college student hall after our classes. I would usually be there before her, and me being the extroverted person I am, I have a lot of friends and they’d see me and start talking to me.

- once one of my good female friends saw me and she started talking to me, we were standing up near the hall entrance where I told my gf to meet with me. So me and my friend just talk and my gf walks in and immediately spots us talking, her expression turns from happy to what-the-fuck-do-you-think-you’re-doing. She just stands on the other side of the room where she walked in staring at us. I notice her and wave her over, my friend turns around and smiles at her, but my gf just has this unblinking blank expression on her face and keeps standing where she is which makes my friend uncomfortable, and she makes an excuse to leave. I walk to my gf and ask what’s wrong. She starts to cry but won’t let me touch her, she just has her hand in her hair like she’s trying to stop a headache or something and we walk to the bus stop. I try to talk but she won’t say anything. Her body tenses up so hard and she looks likes she’s about to have a panic attack. She calms down after awhile but she’s quiet for the rest of the day. This has happened on more than one occasion.

- she had a panic attack because I told her I had an old friend from another state I talked to still over text sometimes, whom I ask for advice. We don’t have any history. 

- it’s kind of my fault, but I admitted to her at the beginning of the relationship my “type” was girls were red hair (my GF does not have red hair. She also did not provoke this question, I said it). It was something stupid I said and have apologized multiple times, tried to comfort her over, but everytime we watch TV or she looks over to my phone when I’m on social media and sees a girl with red hair she has a panic attack and says things like “I can’t ever find someone who likes me for me,” and “I told you I’m not fucking like them!!” Like she’s talking to herself. I try to help her but it makes it worse, and no matter what time of the night or day it is she leaves to calm down and I don’t hear from her for hours. 

She also I believe is developing an eating disorder. She admitted to me she starved herself before to make her ex happy. It’s been occurring again though, to me. I love my gfs body and have no idea why she’s doing this again. I tell her this often. She often complains about how “ugly and disgusting” her thighs are, also her stomach which is a bit chubby. Because we can’t see each other rn, sometimes I ask her if she’s eaten yet. She replies often with “no, I’m trying to shed some weight off my pig body,” or something like that. She says it in this creepy, fake happy voice like she’s trying to sound normal. She believes that since the girls I am friends with aren’t chubby or anything (not that I’m discriminating against them, I just literally have no chubby friends who are girls rn) I must like those types of girls and must have been developing feelings for them. She cries when I tell her otherwise. She cries how it can’t possibly be true that I would appreciate someone like her. 

She acknowledges she has a problem with depression thoughts and self esteem but one leap towards getting better, one thing can “trigger” her and take her three steps back. I don’t know what to do anymore. The character in a Pokémon game we played together awhile back caused her to have a breakdown, just by looking at her. She started to cry after an ad was shown with a girl with a flat stomach. She went into a depressive episode because one of the girls who severely bullied her and beat her in elementary school was in her class and was in her words “so pretty,” so she dropped out of that class. 

I’m scared for her well being, I know she’s a wonderful person when she doesn’t get in these moods, and despite her being in therapy, I just want to know what I can say to help her feel better since I’m new to the whole girlfriend thing and don’t know if this is common. She’s also getting her birth control removed because she suspects that might be the push for her dark thoughts. 
How can I help support her?

i’m writing on reddit because i’m at my wits ends. I’m not a fan of airing my dirty laundry out so i’m doing this on a throwaway account (yes i suffer from depression, largely due to my father, in case you decide to check my profile).

Now here’s the story, this pandemic has brought a lot of mayhem and it doesn’t help that i moved houses weeks before shit hit the fan. Because of the move i switched schools meaning i had to turn in my school laptop, the plan was that i would spend time at home adjusting to the move, go to school and collect another laptop at my new school but the lockdown happened and now i’m stuck. i’m not from a particularly wealthy family so the laptop i had at my previous school was my only one. So here i am falling behind on so much school work that i am unable to do because i 1. don’t have a phone because it’s broken and 2. i don’t have a tablet or laptop either. So what do you do when you need some extra money or help? you ask around. I asked everyone and no one was able to help. my mum said she would have got me one but she can not afford to buy a laptop or tablet and her credit isn’t good so she can’t pay in monthly instalments either. The last person i would have wanted to contact was my father, i do speak to him on occasion and have never been disrespectful to him despite the fact that he is so horrible to me. i know he has good credit so i tried to ask him if he could get me an ipad pro on monthly instalments and my mum send him money to pay those instalments but he wouldn’t listen and ended up hanging up on me i sent him a message basically saying how i don’t need his money because he thought that he would be paying for it, which he wouldn’t, my mum would. i was quite stern in that message and out of context it looked like i was being rude however if someone is berating you and being extremely would i’m sure you would too. so he decided to send that message to family saying how disrespectful i am. luckily my mum was able to explain to them the full situation and they understood and realised that my dad is a dick. i don’t know whether i should persist and ask him because i have no one else who can help me and i’m falling behind on school work because of the “lack of basic equipment”

184,"On this sub I’ve (17 F)  talked a lot about my friends (18/17 Fs and Ms). But I’d summarize everything up: A year ago I met a friend of my friends, he flirted with me the entire night. The next time we met he barely talked to me. And that happened again, the next time we hung out. While all of this was happening I was starting to have feelings for him. Also, I should mention that I’m bi. It’s not like I came out to him, cause most people I know already know I’m bi, but that gave him an opportunity to call me “gay” whenever I spoke. Seriously. For example, I’d walk up to him and say hi and he’d say: “How’s my gay friend in denial doing?”. Or for example, I’d talk about traveling and how far some countries were. And he’d say: “Has anyone wondered how far Rachel’s (my name irl) gayness can go?” I literally have ss’s of every chat we’d had, and there were at least 20 mentions of me being gay. 
Then, last December we all hung out at my place. He was the first to arrive, and we spent the first fifteen minutes or so bantering and making hot chocolate. Then, once our friends started arriving he barely spoke to me, only to ask about the bathroom to throw up. On the same night, he was being very lovey-dovey with one of my friends. Lets call her Leila. He gave her a sweater. Which like, I don’t mind, but I’d have appreciated at least a small gift, since I hosted the reunion, and they all left a mess at my home. 
Then, at the end of the year I told him and everyone that I was sick and tired of being referred as gay, and being the butt of every single feminist joke. (Yes, I’m a lgbt person and a feminist, and this is literally all he can joke about).
Then our friends encouraged him to ask me if I could forgive him. Note that he didn’t want to apologize in the first place. Anyway. I forgave him, just so we could stay in peace. Not even a week later, we all hung out, and a friend told me that Leila and him started dating. They told everyone but me. My friend said they were going to tell everyone that day anyway, but that yeah, they started dating. I felt hurt and betrayed. I wanted Leila and I to be best friends, but after this, I don’t feel that connection anymore. I mean, all of my friends know all the hurtful things they’ve said to me, and they still talk to him. They knew him before me, so I kind of get it. But I’m the one that founded the group chat we all talk in. That group chat solidified our friendship.
Then I got into a fight with him again, because I told everyone that I went to a store that just had opened, he told me “Ok, and?” And then I told him to shut up (I know, not my brightest moment and I apologized) but then we talked in private (this all happened on Messenger btw) and I bursted. I told him that I’m mad that I’m always the one that’s fixing our problems. He told me that he’s not that bad, that he’s usually a very chill and nice guy, and that he’s sorry I got that impression. I told him that he’s been like that after we met. He told me to “f*ck myself”, tjhen blocked me. Also note, I asked Leila on our group chat, so it’s something that everyone saw. 
Then I had to tell Leila if she could tell him to unblock me, and the guy did. I told him that we won’t talk to each other anymore.
We haven’t talked in like 3 months.. I told some of my friends both in person and in messenger that I’m thinking of maybe leaving the friend group since I don’t want to see him. Just one friend told me that he would be on my side if I ever confronted Leila and the guy. Others just saw my message and reacted “sad” to it, but didn’t reply. Then, Leila told me she can’t choose between her boyfriend and me. But what she doesn’t get is that she already did, the minute they both started dating. Since they started dating, and after our fallout, she and my friends talk nonstop about how funny, amazing, kind and truly a good person he is.

Hi. I would like to premise this post by saying that I do respect my partner's privacy and I have no problem with him liking pictures of girls on social media (has never been an issue). We have been dating for 10 months (I am 23 and he is 25). I don't particularly like social media and rarely post to it but I saw something on my Instagram feed the other day that unintentionally caused me a significant amount of hurt/insecurity.

A photo of a girl popped up on my feed who was completely topless wearing knickers in an extremely provocative pose. To each their own on social media, but this was an obvious ""thirst-trap"" (photograph of someone on social media that is intended to attract attention or make people who see it sexually interested in them). I clicked on it and my boyfriend had liked it. In fact, he had liked every single one of her provocative photos. She isn't a model, she doesn't have a big following, so he knows her in some way.

Maybe this is my own problem and stems from my own insecurities (I am by no means bad looking, but like most women, I struggle with body image issues), but I found the fact that he has been liking these photos almost disrespectful to me. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough for him, and to publicly like something that is meant to attract the attention of people sexually interested in them, it makes me feel really upset and hurt that he would need to do this (There is porn for that?).

The thing that also hurts me is:

1. I would never like a photo of a guy I found attractive who was being overtly sexual - in fact, I don't even follow anyone like that
2. if I ever posted a photo of myself in any of the position she was in, he would have a massive problem with that and think that I'm acting slutty and trying to get attention from other men - if you don't like that behaviour, don't like the photo.
3. He knows that I have recently been having some self-esteem issues - he posts really unflattering photos of me on and then goes and likes photo-shopped, bikini-clad, tanned women, making me look frumpy in comparison and like he doesn't have a good looking girlfriend (which he bloody does).

My question is, am I being immature? I feel irrationally angry about this and I do want to talk to him about it, but I first wanted to get the opinions of other people who may have experienced this, men who do this etc., b/c atm I'm very uninformed and probably operating more emotionally than logically so I don't want to accidentally cause an argument about something that was harmless.

**TL;DR : My bf (25) \[I am 23 and we have been dating for 10 months\], has been liking this one particular girl's photos on Instagram which are extremely sexually provocative and meant as ""thirst-traps"". Is it wrong that I feel disrespected by him doing this? It makes me feel like I'm not good enough for him. If I ever behaved in that way and posted sexual photos of myself he would have a massive problem with me wantonly trying to attract other men. So if he gets that the behaviour is bad, why like the photo? Am I being immature in thinking this way?**",30Apr2020,1

187,"I am a 24 year old graduate student who was staying with her parents in order to finish my degree. However, my father and emotionally abusive mom decided to split and decided to move in with my grandparents so that way we can get back on our feet (I.e., get places of our own and et.cetra). I also started virtually dating this guy I met on Tinder. Of course, we can’t meet in person yet because of qurantine but it’s getting very serious and he asked me to be exclusive (I said yes because i really liked him and there’s no telling how long we’ll be cooped up in here). However, foster care is making the motion to evict my mom from our old house and grant my dad custody of my sisters because my mother is severely mentally ill, shows no signs of getting help, and her behavior is becoming increasingly more erratic. I have already told my boyfriend that I am a product of emotional abuse and that my mother is crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here what I’m worried about. My mom has a history of making of making false accusations against everyone on my dad’s side of the family. She has falsely accused literally every male on my dad’s side of the family of pedophilia/sexual abuse and has had my dad falsely arrested on claims of violent threats against her. Luckily several audio recordings have proven all of her claims as false but still...it was a mess and i am scared that when things get more serious between my boyfriend and I, she will do the same to him and don’t I want him dragged into that drama.

&amp;#x200B;

That is why I made sure to ask my dad not to tell my mom about my boyfriend if he can avoid it. He said that should not be a problem since him and my mom are no longer together and he has no desire to talk to her. He also said that he will also try to refrain from telling my sisters right away since they are very close to my mom and tell her everything. And if my dad does get custody of my sisters, I will have to move back in to the house with him in order to help him with my sisters for a bit. Therefore, I have made a pact that when the day comes for me to introduce my boyfriend to my sisters, I will introduce him as a “friend”. But of course....my sisters are nine and eleven. They’re old enough to catch on to the fact that if a single parent or an adult sibling is constantly hanging out with a person of the opposite gender than it usually means that they are dating that person. But that is also why I am going to try to refrain from allowing him to hang out my dad’s house and if he wants to spend time with my dad and sisters then it will have to be in a public place like the movies or a resturaunt. I figured that this might be safest way to do it because i don’t want my sisters telling my mom, “Oh! Toni has a new boyfriend and he has been spending time at the house.” because I know my mom could use that as ammo to say, “If he has been spending time at the house, how do you know he hasn’t been molesting them.”

&amp;#x200B;

Are my rules reasonable or should I go about this in a different way? Is there anything else I can do to protect my boyfriend from getting directly entangled in my mother’s web?",30Apr2020,1
188,"Hi everyone, writing this after an emotional day, sorry if it comes off as a rant, I really mean this to get advice from you awesome guys. 
When my parents got divorced 15 years ago I haven’t had contact with my dad. We had just moved to the US, and after the divorce, he decided to move back to our home country of Poland. 

It got a little hairy when I decided that I’d move back to Poland for college. During this, my mom and I decided to take him to court to pay child support. (In Poland, a parent has to pay child support until the child is 18 or finishes university, so in my case for at least another 3 years) (Note, he has never paid a cent of support)

During this, my father tried to reach out to me. Naturally I was really angry as I felt that he only contacted me for the first time in years just because he got a letter in the mail about the child support. It was during Christmas, the first Christmas I had spent away from my mom, and texted back some things that I wanted to get off my chest, that looking back, May have been a little harsh. (Some messages were vulgar, I’m not proud of it, but I am glad that I released them)

Maybe a couple months later, he contacts me again, and I agree to meet him. I was hesitant, but I was glad to try to build some kind of relationship with him. We met a few more times and everything was good. 

I went back to the US since the pandemic started, and then I heard from my lawyer. My fathers lawyer had written back a statement that my father only wants to pay the minimum amount (500PLN, about 120USD) a month. His reasonings are that he claimed he has supported me throughout my childhood (not true, I haven’t received one cent from him growing up, or even a letter or a call) but the worst is that included in this statement was slander against me and my mom. He included screenshots of the text messages I sent him during Christmas all in attempt to make me look bad. 

I was obviously hurt seeing them being used against me, as even though I’m not proud of them whatsoever, they were private. Written in the statement was that I was a “malicious young girl just looking for money” and that turned out to be a quote from my father. He also wrote that during the divorce proceedings, my mom was looking for other men, in an attempt to slander her name too. 

I haven’t confronted my father about it as I’m worried that any future texts will be used against me. But the icing on the cake for me was that, and I know it sounds really trivial, but with all other things combined it just pushed me a bit over the edge, was that he didn’t even have the decency to wish me a happy birthday yesterday. 

I know that sounds really stupid, I’ll be the first one to say that, but it just really ferments that all that progress we made during those few hangouts were likely fake. And I’m just upset, because deep down inside I do want a relationship with my father, but I don’t want one of its going to be like this. 

I again apologize for the rant, but I’d please like some advice on how to proceed with this matter. Thank you all so much, I really love this community, and trust you guys to give good advice! &lt;3",30Apr2020,1
189,"Everything I say comes off completely wrong. I don't even feel like a real human, I just feel like a robot. I don't know how to communicate with anyone. When I was a kid I didn't worry about it because I figured I would just grow up eventually and act like a regular human. I'm not done growing up, but nothing like that ever happened.

I feel like there's a wall between me and the rest of the world, and everyone else is living a different and better life than me. I can't even imagine how awesome my life would be if I was someone else, someone better. 

I'm probably going to end up killing myself. That's all I see at the end of the road for me. Some people see a bright future with their families that they were able to create. When I imagine what I want to do in five years I can't see anything but me dead. In fact I should have done it sooner so that instead of being a dead burn out, it'll have been a tragic case of dying so young.",30Apr2020,1

191,One day I asked my dad if I could buy an account for a mobile game. I was very tired that day and not thinking clearly. It wasn’t expensive however my dad got mad at me and said I am not allowed to play mobile games ever again. The reason my dad got mad was partially because my account had been hacked before and I thought someone hacked my phone. When I told him I thought someone hacked my phone he freaked. Turns out that wasn’t the case but I am not allowed to play games at all and I feel terrible because I miss playing. I am over 18 btw. What do I say to convince him to let me play games again? Btw my dad is kinda paranoid and thinks mobile games are not secure.,30Apr2020,1

193,"I am projecting this lack of being wanted in the community house that I am in, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I have such great conflict with one of the people that I live with. I know that I am invited to things, but I feel so shut down and as if I am not myself, or the worst parts of me are coming out, so I have come to isolate myself in my own home. I feel so conflicted because I know there is a great projection on my part onto the house that I can work through and clear if I work on myself, but I also feel so uncomfortable with my one roommates who can be a very difficult person. We have tried working through things in the past, but now she doesn’t want to process or work on our dynamic even with a neutral third party present. I love this house though, my room is beautiful, its the cheapest rent I will find where I live, I have so much stuff that I would have to move which would suck, everyone else is cool and my dog has another dog he can play with and they love each other. The dog thing can also be tricky though because the other dog belongs to the roommate I struggle with, and she isn’t the best dog owner. Her dog has certain aggressive behaviors and I have been the one training both of the dogs which is hard. Do I stay or do I go? I am so stuck. I am fine with all of my other roommates (there are 6 of us all together) but wonder if I need a reset. I am afraid I won’t find the right fit.

194,"So, I’m wanting to become a waitress at Cracker Barrel, which has a pretty bad reputation. However, I’ve been looking into it for a while. I have severe anxiety and was wondering about some things.

1.) When it comes to money, what all goes into it? Like, I hear that you only get a percentage of your tips, so does the manager do that for you? Do you have to count the bill that the customers leave for their food payment or do you take it to the cashier? Do you have to cash it in? 

2.) I’ve heard some pretty horrific things about certain ways you have to do things. Like balancing plates on your arms. I’m a short person with thin arms. Will that make this a challenge? The Cracker Barrel I want to work at usually serves the plates on a huge plate.

3.) What would be really inappropriate to do as a waitress? What are the “no-no’s”? Like, getting things for a table that you aren’t waitressing. Deciding when to clean up a mess you see as you’re already doing something else. Things like that. 

4.) What advice do you have that no one talks about that I should take? What else should I be concerned about?",30Apr2020,1

I found out as these people asked me about it and told other people and all of these people said that she told them so I obviously just laughed about it and called it ridiculous but then it all kicked off when I confronted her.

I asked her why she told people and she lied straight to me and said that she hadn't so I got quite pissed off and told her that a few people had said she told them and she said that if she knows something she's allowed to spread it whether it negatively affects someone or not so I called her a heartless bitch and all that and told her not to talk to me ever again and all that and maybe some other not nice things.

But ik that she's been struggling with depression and stuff like that for a while, and that night she sent me a message saying that she was sorry wanted a second chance and i basically told her to leave me alone (in a not so nice way) and then she tumbled and slumped back into depression said that I did this to her and I said that she did it to herself and haven't spoken to her since and go out of my way to avoid her, knowing that she is struggling.

This isn't the first hiccup and we normally alright and I've helped her with this for a year or two and when she said I caused it after all that help I shattered and snapped and just cut her off.

But my best mate goes out with her and unfortunately he's been put in the middle of our problems because she brings him into it and I've posted on AITA and I'm NTA apparently and feel like I need to cut her off because she's just toxic but I think that everyone deserves forgiveness no matter how many times they mess up but I cant bare to talk to her after some other things she said and what she did.

After a while of talking, she said she needed to focus on school and stopped texting me. We started talking again that summer, though and after a couple exchanges she stopped responding to anything. She wouldn't even acknowledge me talking straight to her in person. 

I can't get over her. I've been told it's cause we never really ""ended things,"" although they certainly feel over.

I (22F) help watch over a 16 year old girl with autism (Tina). Their family is going through a rough time, and the girl adores me because I understand her references and have a god-like patience with her hyperactivity. So I'll be called to give the family a break and help keep her from getting in trouble/in the way of anything they'd need focus for, especially while working from home. I've known the family for about 4 years. 


Mid 2018- mid 2019 I was going through a reeeally hard time with my mental health. During this time, Tina was very happy about a group of friends she had made on Amino, and asked me to join constantly. At first, I'd come up with reasons why not, but I eventually gave in and joined.
The Amino was about art, so I figured I'd join and just not talk much. I'd check in whenever Tina texted me asking to,  usually to answer a poll she posted, look at someone's art, or explain why someone got upset with her in the group chat. 
I was very lonely during this time, and began talking to these friends of hers. They were nice to me and I started to enjoy talking to them, feeling like I was a big sister to them. They'd ask me for advice or just want to talk to someone about mental illness, divorce, death of a pet, etc. It was one of the few times I didn't feel like ending my life, since I felt like I was of purpose and could actually help people.


I'm feeling much, much better now and am on medications. The Amino chat eventually died down a little bit before summer 2019, and I forgot all about it. Tina would sometimes give little updates on drama or tell me someone missed me or said hi. 
Today, I saw Tina for the first time in a while. She saw I had the Instagram app on my phone while I was showing her a meme, and she added me to the group chat. They had apparently moved from Amino is Insta, and that's where my confused feelings come from.
I couldn't refuse, since Tina added me by taking my phone (I thought she was going to go to her page and make sure I'm following. thats what she usually does every time she sees i have a social media app).

So, Reddit, is this okay? The ages of the group range from 14-18. I do not feel ANY feelings for these kids other than ""sisterly,"" and have always tried to limit one on one messages, unless they really needed to talk about private feelings. Even at my lowest, I encouraged all casual chat with me to be in the group chat. 


Is it okay for me to be talking and being friendly with them? Or is it creepy and I should keep a distance? They all know my age and that I'm not comfortable with some scenarios when I'm asked to rp with them. They're all pretty respectable, nice people- I just don't know if this can affect them negatively some way in the future and don't want to cause trouble for them or myself.

I hated myself for it, and pretty much I tried to stop myself from being gay, so i pretty much made a girl fall in love with me, and I never even loved her back.

I felt so bad but I couldn’t tell her because it would’ve broke her heart, so I lived this lie for months what she thought was a reality, I was still gay, and I didn’t like her that way, but I didn’t feel like there was a way out, I never wanted to see her and I was frigid with her and she blamed herself for it, not knowing my secret.

Eventually I had to break up with her, I never even told her then I was gay, I told her I just didn’t want to be with her and didn’t like her anymore. 

It broke her heart, she told me i was her first love, the love of her life and she couldn’t love someone again how she loved me , this was 3 or 4 years ago now and I still hate myself for what I did to her.

I should’ve never lead her on like that. I think about it everyday and sometimes I have to get blackout drunk just so I can have a distraction from feeling like the worst person I know.

There were over 400 corrections on a 7 page paper (that ended up being 8.5 after her fixes). Now, these weren’t just fixing conjugations or saying a word is wrong. This was entire sentences completely rewritten for seemingly no reason. My entire thesis sentence and conclusion paragraph she deleted and rewrote herself. Every transition phrase I had she replaced. She used words I don’t know. I imagine this was to make it seem more “professional” but, honestly it no longer feels like my work.

For example, she told me the page number needed to be in the bottom right hand corner without my last name, instead of the top with last name. She also said all web sources need to say “n.p.” instead of just not having a page number. This is just icing on this weird case.

208,"(Some information about me ) 

So im currently 17, last year of school, active gym goer, and have a very lovely girlfriend who i have been with for over a year, i feel like this should be enough to at least get the ball rolling. 

(Why am i here?)

My mother has always been a large part of my life, im nowhere near a malnourished child, im given lots of privileges such as the gym, gifts, pc and i do get very spoilt on special occasions. The relationship i have with my mum is very rocky, very toxic and full of constant fighting. For as long as i can remember my mother has always been riding my back, whether its year 3 assignments, 10 year old soccer or even 10 year old public speaking ive always had pressure to achieve the best. Im no where near a bad child, ive never gotten arrested, expelled or even suspended, im polite and nice to everyone i meet and always have been. From kindergarten to year 10 (over 11 years) ive been a top grading student, very smart and always being the best, my mother still proceeded to ride me for the whole time strictly to maximize my resutls. My mother has always been a strict person, never packed unhealthy foods in my lunch, get mad and punish me for buying chocolate, doesnt let me randomly hang with my friends (i have to plan ahead) overall just doesnt give me freedom (ill explain later in the story) 

It wasn't around age 15 (year 10) where i was diagnosed with adhd, depression and anxiety. My mother took me to everything, and helped me sort it out but my life is processing to constantly go down hill. Year 11 and current year 12 are my senior years (final years before school is over) and my results and care for school are low, im barely passing my best subjects. Ive recently got my drivers licence meaning i can drive independently, i love to think this is amazing but i differ, since its another thing my mother can control, she lets me drive to place to place, and nothing further, i dont get to drive my car with friends or even leave and hangout i just drive to school and back. 

My mother has always been very negative towards me, blames me for everything, says extremely harsh things to me and gets physical alot (not enough to cause blood). This quarantine shit isnt making it easier,  she is always up my throat for everything, for example she will go off and throw and hit me with shit because i had tuna and rice for breakfast instead of a shake. Really little things push her over. She always controls my possessions from getting mad when i spend my own money that i worked for (she will transfer it into her account and give it back when she feels like it), she doesnt let me have my phone at night, she has to know all my passwords and constantly checks my messages and photos and gets mad when she sees dumb teenager messages or photos, she never lets me drive my car, and pressures me into to things i find fun such as the gym and makes it no longer enjoyable. As im writing this, she is throwing insults and harsh comments at me because i logged in to Instagram on my laptop.  

Im emotionally destroyed, the comments are very mean and harsh, i feel like i dont have a childhood, i dont have the freedom to hangout late with my friends becuase i have to be home at 9pm, and if im 5 mins late i lose all privileges for the whole week, my girlfriend is the opposite with her family, the bounderies are very eases and i feel like i can relax and be at peace when im there, my mother loves to start fights on purpose when my girlfriend is over and she cannot take it and leaves, ill be relaxing on my bed and ill get a text saying good workout you didnt do today, or constantly check me on this tracking app, where she constantly monitors where i am, how fast im going when driving and to measure that when i say im leaving im actully leaving.  She constantly rides me about the gym, and if i miss a day of working out or dont want to work out, she will yell and harass me as well as compare and take things away from me, im forced as if i have to say yes. 

I want independency, but i just cant achieve it here, i cant leave home since im not old enough and these years are getting so hard, she takes away my phones and applications so i cant message my friends and girlfriend and even takes away my girlfriend coming over for weeks on end if i do a minor thing, i need help guys, am i overreacting is my mum just normal? i feel like my life isnt good anymore and everything i get happiness from is gone and reduced.

209,"So its exactly as the title says, I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Currently, I'm a computer science first year and I wasted it because I got high basically everyday and just attempted the bare minimum at everything. I don't exactly have a clear cut goal, aspirations or hobbies in my life. All I do is just watch shows, play video games, eat and sleep everyday since this quarantine has happened. I feel like such a loser in life already and I don't know what I should to change it. I've been feeling extremely depressed and had suicidal thoughts because I think of myself as a loser. I don't know what I'm doing. If anyone else has felt like I have, what have you done to change? What can I do to be better?",30Apr2020,1
210,"I (24F) have worked for this company for 3 years, ever since I started as a co-op student. I love the people and the general company culture but tbh the pay is shit (which I accepted because I was entry level) and my higher ups are essentially ignoring our struggles to please clients. I wanted to start applying for a new job but then this whole pandemic happened and it didn't seem like a good time to be going around looking for jobs so I held off. Recently it's been getting worse and I've been feeling really depressed at work (I've struggled with depression and panic disorder, had it somewhat under control until now). My supervisor has made at least 3 other coworkers cry because of all the pressure she's putting on us while also ignoring our justifications. I've never felt the need to cry as often as I have while working under this supervisor (I started the job with a different one). I want to quit for the sake of my mental stability but I don't have another job lined up, so I would be without income for a while. I feel it might be hard to get another job considering everything that's happening in the world. Another thing to note is that I don't drive, and due to the pandemic I'm carpooling with someone to avoid public transit, which I would have to take again if I find another job.  Should I just tough it out until the pandemic restrictions end? If so do you have any suggestions for staying sane under all this pressure? I don't want to keep struggling not to cry at work.

TL;DR: I can't decide if I should quit my job for the sake of my mental health or just suck it up and wait to apply for another job?",30Apr2020,1
211,"I run a small business—it’s pretty much just me and I manage a few teams I outsource work to. It’s very successful and I was going to hire a manager. 

She worked for me once but then kind of drifted off—we were changing a few things—so ended up working for another company in competition with me. She came around and wanted to work for me. She quickly realized after a week it was too much work. She went back to work for the other company. 

With her—she took all my sales and processes sheets I shared that week we did some training. Since then—I have email notifications set up to, she is constantly reading the training info. 

I want to ask her —why is she referring to these email months after quitting. But I’m sure there is no point to this. I’ll just start drama. But it is frustrating.

214," First of all to start off with, I’m not claiming I have OCD, and I don’t want to self-diagnose but me and some people I know have brought up the fact I might OCD and I’ve seen texts between my parents thinking I have ADHD. I’ve researched OCD and ADHD and I feel like I have a lot of OCD “symptoms”. 

 Some things I do is that I have to do things an even number amount of times, or else I go a little insane in my head. Like, if I don’t turn the doorknob twice, or even four-six times I get really uneasy. Also, whenever I enter a room, I always feel the need to touch all the corners in the room whether it be a table, or the corners of a tv, sometimes I feel the need to do it twice. At school I feel like I need to touch the corners of my desk and iPad but not the walls. Another thing I do is touch my face a lot. Like when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade I kept touching my eyebrows (even number amount of time) and my mom thought I had eye problems, so I went to the eye doctor but I was fine, I just didn’t know how to express how I was feeling. Also, this one is hard to explain but I always have to do things on the left. I’m right handed, but like if I’m walking and sit down I have to make sure the last step I take is with my left foot or it makes me really upset. This one is a little gross, but every time I use a makeup wipe I feel like I can’t throw it away so I keep used makeup wipes in my makeup bag even tho I won’t use them again. There’s a lot more, but it would take a long time to explain. 

I feel weird reaching out on Reddit, and I hope I don’t sound like I’m doing this for attention (which is why I’m scared to reach out to my dad or anyone). But I feel like it’s getting more and more annoying to deal with and I was wondering if this is something to worry about, or if these are normal behaviors. 

I’m not sure what I’m expecting out of this, if anyone knows a lot about OCD or if there’s something else that might be wrong, please tell me because these things keep making me upset and getting into my day to day life. Sorry for making this so long.",30Apr2020,1
216,"So I just got back with my old friend again and we talked. It got deep with some things. He told me why he wanted to stop being my friend which his reason was funny and silly and stupid but it’s okay. We chatted. And the vibe I was getting felt great then it got ruined by him sending me a snap. But it wasn’t anything inappropriate. I was every taken aback cuz he never ever sent me snaps before so I had a feeling that it wasn’t meant for me. The snap was a just a picture of his leg and the 👀emoji. 
After that I felt turned off and didn’t even wanna continue the convo with him. But we talked after that laughing it for but I’m still up tight on it. I feel tensed. I have no idea why. And my mood completely went down. There’s so many other things I should be mad about but I’m getting pissed over this. It wasn’t anything bad but him saying he wasn’t supposed to send me that, made me feel some type of way. I can’t stop thinking about it. It shouldn’t even be that big of a deal but for some reason I’m getting extremely stressed. Then I texted him the next day and we talked. The vibe was good, but in the back of my head I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Then he had to go and he said he will talk to me later but I knew he wouldn’t. This is driving me crazy and I hate idk why. I was just talking to him about that I know he don’t give a shit about me and he’s probably talking to someone else then he goes on and sends me the wrong message.

218,"Written on mobile so forgive the formatting. 

(F18) I really want to go to college next year, I’ve been living with my dad, stepmom and 2 half siblings for almost two years now. My dad and I don’t have the best relationship due to him and I having zero contact from when I was 4-14 years old, living with him feels as if I were living with a stranger, and though he has been somewhat financially supportive for the past couple years (mostly because he HAS to be), he always seems to hold it against me. I feel like if I were to stay in this household and go to a local community college it would take a toll on my mental health. 

Now, last year I became good friends with my social studies teacher (who we’ll call Mr. C), and though I was doing well above average in his class I was failing half of my other classes due to the constant belittling and coldness from my father (he has his own unresolved issues and unfortunately projects most of this onto the people around him). When Mr. C found out about my other grades, he decided to have a chat with me about it. I was very hesitant at first as I found it very embarrassing that I was literally failing half of my classes, but I soon opened up about my father and how I wasn’t sure I’d be able to endure another year with him, which would result in me moving back with my mom who lives in Mexico and thus settling on a not-so-great education. 

Mr. C was very morally supportive, always pushing me to do better in my other classes and encouraging me to push through whatever was happening at home. I’ll be honest, I took solace in his class as well as his advice and knowledge. My grades got better after I began pretty much ignoring my dad and instead focusing on school and my part time job. I was able to tune him out until he became background noise. 

When I started senior year I no longer had him as my social studies teacher, instead I had Mrs. S who so happens to be his long time friend. Once Mr. C found out she was my teacher I realized that they would often talk about me. Nothing bad, mostly good things and also about my academic future. They believed I had potential that would go to waste if I didn’t get a good education. 

Even if I didn’t have his class anymore I would often hang out in Mr. C’s classroom just to chat and discuss politics. Since he knew I was having thoughts about probably taking a gap year and going back to Mexico due to the situation with my dad, he would often tell me that Mrs. S would take me into her home if she had an extra room. He would go as far as to say that he would take me into his though I’d have to sleep on the couch. Of course, I took these comments as a joke. Until one day, he expressed serious concern about what I would do after graduating, he mentioned that he and Mrs. S had seriously thought about taking me into their respective homes (even though they each have their own kids). He flat out told me that he was willing to let me stay in his house and attend a local community college (he lives in a different town 50min away) if I really wanted to, I was taken aback by all of this but could tell that he was being sincere about wanting to help. Of course since I was 17, he told me that I couldn’t decide anything until I turned 18 so he would give me time to consider it carefully. 

And I have. For the past 7 months I have been seriously considering moving in with him and his two teenage sons. I turned 18 early this month so I was able to talk to him more in detail as to how we could make things work if I were to accept his offer. He also spoke to my mom over the phone to let her know of his intentions, though she’s not thrilled with the idea, she has told me that she would understand and respect my decision of pursuing a higher education. 

Currently, I want to accept his offer, but part of me feels like I am potentially making a very naive decision considering that I’m a teenage girl and he’s a middle aged man. I am aware that to someone who doesn’t know the whole story it appears like he’s taking advantage of me. I have spoken to Mrs. S, who has known him for almost 30 years and has been aware about his decision to help me out. She has even encouraged me to accept several times but only if I feel it’s the right thing for me. I’m still not certain, what do you guys think of all this?

Thank you for reading.",30Apr2020,1
219,"First i want to say im not the ""crazy"" type of gf, i am simply just concerned as I haven't been dating my bf for long...

We met at a club 2 months ago, he was really into me and i was to him as well. We hit it off and starting talking on the daily, about 2 weeks after meeting him we all (as in my friends and his) went out again and we were together for about an hour or 2 then I got a little too hammered and went home. I come to find out (like an hour after writing this exact post) he had made out with another girl the rest of the night but was still asking about me and blah blah. Fast forward a month and we just begin dating and hes taking about some girl who is crazy and obsessing over him and wouldn't stop calling him (its the same girl he made out with that night), he tells me he ""doesn't give a f\*ck"" about her and told her to leave him alone because he has a girlfriend. Well now fast forward to now and I see that him and her still snapchat on the regular and she added his sister on snapchat out of the blue (his sister even said it was weird), today i was texting him regularly and was on snapchat and realized he had turned his snap maps off (I do usually check snap maps, not to be overprotective but simply cause its quarantine and i have nothing else better to do) and he never does that, additionally he had told me he was at home watching netflix, then he doesn't text me for 40 mins and when he did text back he said he was going to bed and his snap map was back on.

220,"So the past few months, my parents have been trying in a way, to forcefully influence my future for me (pressured me into joining the Navy, and then going to some community college to enroll in an RN (Registered Nursing) Program). Not too long ago, I un-enlisted from the Navy because deep down, I knew it wasn't the type of future I wanted. Shortly after, I received an athletic/academic offer (partial scholarship) to attend a 4-year college out of state (in-state and out of state were the same price), which also had the major I was looking for (Exercise Science, also looking to minor in criminal science). I haven't been able to tell my parents this because I've already been undermined previously when trying to open up about my plans for the future, because they believe that a lot of money is the way to have a happy life. They want me to become an RN or something like that (my cousin is one and said that it's a trap), while I'm pursuing a PT (Physical Therapy) career while also coaching my youth athletic club. Granted, I know I should be taking their perspectives and advice into consideration but frankly, I've had this dream for a while and not being able to open up even a little has been eating me from the inside out.

226,"We were good friends, not best friends in my primary school years before I left and moved to two more schools before I graduated HS. along the way I made good friends with some I would consider life long friendships. Along with that, my life changed a lot in terms of the people and culture I am surrounded by as I continued my education abroad after primary school. 

A couple years ago, out of the blue I get a message from my primary school friend. Of course I still remember his name, but we haven’t talked in at least 11 years. We texted each other to catch up on things and it is clear that we had problems relating to each other, it was like a stranger pretending to have know you for years. He was really friendly and kind, but to the point were it was getting suspicious and uncomfortable. Sometimes I would ignore his messages and he would still text me randomly. 

My parents advised me to give him a chance, so I accepted one of his many invitations to go out to lunch with him and it was awkward as we didn’t have anything in common to talk about whatsoever. I was way too young to remember anything from my primary school years to the extent that I could have a conversation with him. 

Afterwards, I thought we would be on the same page and probably not meet up again as we were practically strangers at this point, but I guess not because he kept asking me to meet up again and again, regardless whether I ignore the messages or not. Even now that I am starting Uni abroad he is still randomly texting me. 

I’m naturally a skeptical person but from everything, I have a feeling that he is trying to take advantage of me in some way or another but that could just be my skepticism. 

I don’t want to come off as a bad person by leaving someone I knew behind, but I don’t know  what to tell him or what to do so that he would understand that we are too different now and we weren’t even close friends from the start. I can’t keep ignoring his messages because I will bump into him one day and that’ll be awkward.

230,"Just  an added note, I know I'll be okay, it's been a little rough for me but  I know I'll get through it, so please if something more concerning is  out there, help them instead.

Hey!  I think to really get the best help it'd be a good idea to give some  background. To make the long story short, a few years back I was a  pretty mean kid, I would do mean things, but I always felt bad about it  because I still cared about people, I think back them I had some  problems for sure. Now after all that I've changed, felt bad for what I  did, made a difference in it, and for the past few years I've been doing  what I can to help others. It's just with that whole sense of  responsibility I got from me changing for the better, I got a new sense  of guilt. Now I just absolutely lose it if I can't help people, it  stresses me out, breaks me down, makes me feel like whatever happens to  them is my fault, whatever they do is my fault, and that I absolutely  need to do literally everything to help no matter the cost to my own  mental health.

I know its one  thing being able to help people you are close to, you know personally,  and trust me that happens sometimes, but usually I'm able to be there  for them, and eventually they'll come around, get better, and I get to  see it with my own eyes and its amazing. But lately, it hasn't been  going well for me. Lately I've been online actually, trying to help  plenty of people, because funny enough I try to make some posts  somewhere or talk to someone to help me, but then read something that  concerns me a little bit, and immediately realize that's more important  and do my best to help, and guilt eats away at me if I don't. It's just  lately, I haven't been able to help well enough and it really is eating  me inside. Usually I'm always able to say something, even to some online  strangers, something that can help them, make them feel a little better  and I can go from there. I mean sometimes I can really help people, and  I'm grateful for it, but when I can't help people is when issues come  up, and I forget all that I've been able to do for other people, and  feel like I'm a bad person.

But  now I'm not sure, because it hasn't worked, and I'm just doubting myself  a lot. I realized that being online holds a lot of limits, and I can't  help all these people, yea I don't know them personally at all, but I  want to do what I can for them, and it seems they just won't listen, or  won't let me, but I know they really need help. I know I'm not qualified  but it's hard to just stand by and do nothing. I'm not sure where to go  from here, this guilty feeling is just hurting me a lot, its taking up a  lot of my thoughts at night, when I'm doing work, even when I'm just  trying to maybe relax get my mind off things, or play video games with  friends. There is always just a voice in the back of my head telling me I  could've done better, or that if I can't help and something bad happens  its because of me, and I really don't know how to deal with it in a  healthy way.

232,"I used to work at a poolside restaurant. I loved it at first but quickly learned how sketchy and gross everyone that worked there was. **EVERYONE** was sleeping around, even if they were in relationships. I usually mind my business and didn't get involved cause it was constant drama. Until one day a coworker I really liked told me she was involved with someone at work. 

She was in a 3 year relationship at the time, living with her boyfriend and told me she was sleeping with this coworker for the last year. He also was in a relationship and lived with his girlfriend who worked side by side with him at the pool. I was so disappointed I didn't want to judge but there were so few people I actually thought were decent people at this job.

I knew this guy's girlfriend, she was such a nice girl, a hard worker, and was absolutely in love with this guy. By the time I found this out she had been promoted to another hotel. I felt torn. She had a right to know, but my coworker trusted me with this information. She was in a toxic situation with her partner(not justifying her cheating but we are all human). I never saw the guys girlfriend again so I just let it go.

A few weeks later my coworker told me she needed help. She was pregnant and she knew it wasn't her boyfriends. She was scared and crying. She wanted to end the pregnancy but didn't know where to go that would be safe. Again I was very angry because what they were doing was already wrong, and now this. But I'm not heartless and when someone ask me for help, if I can, I help them. So I did some research with her and found her a clean safe place. 

She went with her mother to the clinic, when she got back to work she looked so sad. I asked her how she was feeling. She simply showed me a text on her phone from the coworker she was having an affair with that read ""you good?""

""YOU GOOD?"" Are you fucking kidding me?!!!.

The day after she had to get an abortion and all you text her is ""you good?""..nothing else.

 She has told me everything that's happened between them and it was clear to me that this asshole saw that she was in a shitty abusive relationship and took advantage of her emotionally. She talked to him about why she was with his girlfriend if he was unhappy and he'd say he ""can't afford rent"" on his own.

I know she is no angel, abusive relationship or not *(and idk why she was with her boyfriend either)* she made her choices. Eventually they ended it, and my coworker got out of her toxic relationship...only to end up in another weird one that just showed me she gets herself into these situations.

I got sick of all the bullshit and toxic behavior so I got a new job. It's been a few months since I left and distanced myself from everyone that worked there. I think about it sometimes and can't help but feel bad about this jerk's girlfriend. Sometimes I even thought about sending her a message on FB but chickened out because I didn't want my coworker to suffer anymore than she has. 

I nearly completely forgot until I saw his girlfriends FB profile show up as someone I may know. She was still with him. Her profile picture was a couple photo of the two of them. I don't know why but when I saw that everything went red like in a fucking scene from Kill Bill. 

In the last year I was fucked over by so many people and felt embarrassed and like an idiot for trusting anyone. Maybe I'm getting my own experiences mixed in my head for vengeance of this woman and her shit boyfriend. But I can't stop wanting to make a fake account and tell her. 

I don't know what to do. If I say nothing I'm helping him continue to take advantage of a kind person. But if I say something, not only would I be putting my old coworker in the line of fire but potentially myself if they find out I was the one that told her.(I don't think she's told anyone else) And I've worked very hard to get away from these people and their toxic drama....what should I do?",30Apr2020,1

Since the breakup, I have been living with a friend's parents while I try to get my life back on track.  I'm an trying to learn how to live my best life again and it's hard to know where to start.

I have a stable and comfortable place to live where I essentially don't need to pay for rent, bills, or food.  I have a new boyfriend who lives on his own and is completely different from the guys I've dated in the past.  He wants to support me in figuring out myself again and be here as emotional support while I fix myself.  I also am starting a full time job in a couple of weeks which will help me get back on track.

Now, I am realizing that I'm not really taking care of myself.  I feel stuck in a rut where all I do is watch TV shows, scour Reddit, occasionally play video games and ride my bike for 6 miles occasionally.  
I'm not really focusing on taking care of myself and the things I'm not happy with.  Those things are my weight, my health, my mental health after quitting drugs, anxiety, stress, daily routine, responsibilities, etc.  I only do laundry once a week and don't put it away, I shower every 3 days or when I see my boyfriend, I'm not motivated to exercise or do any of the hobbies I used to love.  My sleep schedule is shit and isn't going to work with the job I start in 2 weeks.  I only have one close friend other than my boyfriend and feel cut off and isolated because I have almost no friends to talk to during this quarantine.

I want to be able to fix all of these things I am lacking in before I get my own place so I am not stressed out when I finally do live alone.  I don't know where to start or how to work on the basic necessities of being an adult human being because I have never lived alone before and I don't plan on moving in with this boyfriend any time within the next 2 years, because I don't want to make the same mistakes again.

TL DR:

Can anyone give me advice on what I should be focusing on right now?  How do I keep daily habits and get myself to do things that I need to do?  What are things I can do to keep my self care up? What should I be doing to make the transition to living on my own when I have a stable income?  How do I start focusing on fixing myself and not others?",30Apr2020,1
234,"I had 17 surgeries, no friends as a kid, was alone a lot, two rare conditions (one physical disability and one sex condition), autism, hearing loss, speech impediment, and ADHD. I hate AP students, national honor society students, abled people, females, gifted people, people with a biological family, those abused, and more. I am told constantly the world doesn't revolve around me. I am called emotionally manipulative, aggressive, rude, and a dictator. I want equality.

235,"No, I’m not using the word panic attack lightly. I am genuinely afraid. I spent my whole life being completely confident that there was something else out there. I started thinking it could be something like bacteria or a virus. Up until recently I started to think there could be another life form like us. I just watched the released UFO videos from the US Navy. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were fake or set up by another country. It just sprung something in me. I ran to my family, went on the floor, and couldn’t stop thinking there was something more intelligent than us out there. I don’t know if it has evil intent or if it even exists.

236,"She rejected me awhile back, but we’ve maintained somewhat of a friendship ever since. She just gets me. I’ve just never connected with any girl like I have with her. We have the same taste in almost everything, humor, music, even fashion. There was a time where I felt like we were meant to be together but I guess not. She’s in a relationship rn and I have pretty much accepted that it’s not happening. But, I just can’t shake this feeling deep down that she’s not happy and will end up with me some day. I do realize this is sort’ve delusional, creepy, and simpy. So, can someone tell me how I can get over her? I’d like nothing more then to get over her and find a girl who actually shares mutual feelings. But like I said, the connection with her just feels like it will never be matched.",30Apr2020,1
237,"So things didnt spark up until recently, but now it's just too much for me. Some info, I'm 17, my brother is 25 and my sister is 22. Then there is my mom and dad who are both in there mid 40s. We all live here, and my brother is a recovering alcoholic.

So basically what happened yesterday is that one of my relatives came over yesterday very angry, and she wanted to speak to my mom and brother. Its was my relative and her daughter here (my cousin), and when my mom and brother came home, all 4 of them went to speak privately while my older sister and I stayed in our rooms. When the whole thing ended my mom went out to say by to my relative and my brother went in to talk to my sister. I heard the whole thing, they dont talk very quietly, my brother was angry because what had happened is that my cousin was getting blackmailed, be use when she and my brother were younger, she had done something to him. My brother never told my mom until about a year ago. My moms biggest problem is that she cant keep a secret, but she refuses to admit it. She had told another family member, while she was venting to her. This sparked a whole thing where our entire family found out about it and they are blackmailing my cousin. So anyway, back to my brother and sister, they were talking about it and how borther is angry because everyone knows what happened and my sister always tells him to not trust my mom. My mom came in, and then my brother started saying how he was mad, which is reasonable, and my mom first tried to defend herself but then apologized. A whole argument started, because my sister started to say stuff and then it resulted in my mom saying that felt like she was attacked, but really she wasnt, by my brother atleast. My sister is a different question, anytime they get in an argument, my sister always starts throwing insults on how my mom is fat, she mocks my mom and mocks her voice and all of that. There is a lot of stuff that has been happening in the past 5 or so years that has me, my mom, dad, sister and brother tired. So my mom ended up saying f**** you to both of my siblings, after my sister had said that she was a fat b**** and a whole bunch of nasty things, and they want back and forward. My mom left the house for a bit, and then my sister started saying how all my mom does is childish and that she isnt a fit mother and how my sister will never allow my mom to see her kids. My mom said she wanted my siblings out of her life aswell. Then today happened, my mom decided that she wanted to spend the day out of the house in her car just so she can go through her thoughts, my sister and brother are calling it childish and that she is running away and shes playing the victim. Later, another argument started with my mom and my brother about a small thing like a phone charger, and then my sister refusing to give my mom her speaker. So my mom left again, she said sorry to me over text for having another argument. Then my sister and brother started talking later, I was trying to stay strong because I would always get picked on for crying to much from my siblings. My brother and sister started talking, and they started insulting my mom in front of me, which I was just staying silent since they werent talking towards me, but then my sister looks at me and say ""I'm sorry for saying this to you, but I hope mom and dad divorce, I hope they do so much, and I know they will"" that actually broke me from the inside, my dad's always working so we can live here so he doesn't se emost of the arguments, only gets the stuff that my mom tells him which isnt always what happened. My biggest fear is them divorcing, because I know with my moms health, she wouldnt handle that and would most likely die from some sort of heart attack or blood pressure problem, and my dad would move to mexico back with his family, my brother and sister would most likely stay close, but I know I would probably seclude my self and my plan is to move out of country when I graduate, but still have contact with my parents. I just broke down, I decided to take and shower and I just cried for a good 30 min. I came out got dressed, and now my brother was bugging me to call from my cause he hadn't heard from her all day and she isnt taking his or mine calls, but I know she just doesnt want to talk cause another argument would erupt. My sister still seems happy, my brother and I are both down and I just havent been able to do my school work online cause of this, so much of my energy is drained. I just want to know does anyone have any advice, something to say that could help me in anyway, to get through this?",30Apr2020,1
238,"So, um, just a bit of backstory. I'm 21 years old and I'm a store manager for a retail chain location. I started this job when I was 18, having just graduated high school, and it was my first job as just a general floor associate. And I guess I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and pretty okay at my job, because I look around now and everyone either quit or left for some reason. I moved up through the ranks and now I'm running a store. Everyone that I know within the company is older than I am. And I feel really awkward telling them what to do. I don't know how to do this, this whole, boss, thing. I said yes to a salary with a 401K all before I could legally get a drink from a bar. I feel really in over my head at this job. Sometimes I just want to feel like I could have fun with friends, but I remember that I'm running a business and I can't just take weekends off. 
I'm sorry, this all sounds pretty pathetic of me. I know with everything going on, all the people getting laid off or worse, and millions filing for unemployment and I'm griping about having a job. I really just, want to know if someone out there would understand why I feel so overwhelmed. And if not, maybe there's just something wrong with me. I don't know. Either way, please help, if you can.
Thank you.",30Apr2020,1
239,So I was scrolling through Instagram when I saw a video that triggered my trypophobia to an INTENSE level. Whenever I think about the video my skin crawls and then I get goosebumps everywhere (which continues to remind me of the video). I tried rewatching the video for “exposure therapy” and to make sense of it so that I wouldn’t be so terrified of it. Now I just want to forget it but everything is reminding me of it. I’m about to cry just typing this.,30Apr2020,1
240,I’m no longer motivated enough to really do anything anymore. I’d start something but later stop it. I use to be really focused and would be able to get things done but now I feel like I just burned out of all the effort. It’s strange but I’ll only get motivated to do something if it’s for a stupid reason. For example I started to learn Norwegian because of this book I have read. (Don’t actually remember why I wanted to learn it all I know was that it was inspiring for some reason) I had kept at it for about 5-6 months and then stopped. There is just so much things I want to do but I wish I had the motivation to do them.,30Apr2020,1

243,I moved to the US to complete my second masters. I just completed my first year of university and I now regret coming here. I miss home a lot and the pandemic isn't helping either. I could have continued at the same university for my PhD but my parents wanted me to start working as soon as possible (also PhD takes at least 5 years with minimal pay) and when that didn't happen they sent me to the US in hopes of getting a better job here.

My friend told me to play the long game and wait for him to come to me, but I’m not the kind of person that can sit and wait. I wanted answers!

So I texted him and told him I was pissed at him and that I wanted some fucking answers. He said okay about what. I told him what and he didn’t respond for a full hour.

I then told him I was done playing games and that’s hope he has a nice fucking life. I then blocked him in everything.

248,"**So I knew this guy in middle school. While growing up he was a trouble maker  and now few years later. After high school I got drunk at a party and I think he knocked me out ( uppercut) because I still fill the wind hitting my chin once I relax .  All of my friends been acting weird ever since then. One day my ""friends "" invited me to hang out and guess what? He was there waiting for me in the car. I didn't remember much the vibes creeping in me telling me it had something to do with him and I was right.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I felt my body so cold and trembled because of how dark the feeling was. He'll stalk my house with a truck and blow his horn while driving by. One day he came by and I pushed aside my petty pride  and so he's doing. It seem karma caught up to him but it didn't stop him . He believes he's a thug or something and he does sell stuff like that what I heard from people but I don't get to involve  in that . Anyway he wanted to sneak in the movie theater. Ya know.. Instead of being a responsible adult and paying for it. I of course didn't get in the car because it seems he's aware the awkwardness and tension between us.** 

**But of course that didn't stop him. One day I came home and found big load of garbage in my trash bin. So instantly my intuition told me it was them and looking at the evidence. It was alcohol , cigarettes, swisher's, beef jerky and sweet tea. Lol so that was clearly obvious it was him and his goons. So yeah I got  a no soliciting sign  and that seem to do the trick . Couple days later I went for a mid night walk and it appears to be a white truck. Now that's what kind of truck he drives but for me. I'm thinking anyone could be driving a white truck. The truck circles my home and when the ""driver"" saw me he made this unusual turn. Like it look like his tire blew out but I felt like he was drunk and anxious. He circles my house again to see if it was me and I was chilling staring at them. He then drives away but with a loud ass noise a truck makes when you step your full foot on the pedal.**

&amp;#x200B;

**So after being patient I decided after this Corona Virus thing dies down I'd pay a visit to the court house to fill out a restraining order.  I looked up his records and he's supposedly driving illegally since his license is suppressed and resist arrest.  What shall I do know? I'm 90% for sure about restraining order but will that truly make me safe??**",30Apr2020,1
249,"So to be clear. Single income. I pay for everything.

Wife is a STAHM with no income, other than a child subsidy. We have agreed that this would be her play money and to not touch savings. It works out to $400/month. 

She had a spending problem before we ever got together.

Give you an example of what its like.

Wife has a closet full of new clothes. I am staring at a brand new box of clothes for $200 that she just bought online. 

Last year the child subsidy was 5k total ish. Well, theres 10k in amazon purchases.

I pay all the bills and everything and thats fair and I have no issues with that. She also doesnt want to work anyway.

My issue is...shes over spending and dipping into savings. If i bring it up she argues that I am controlling her spending...which is true, but only because shes clearly over spending....

we arent well off. 

How do I bring this up in a way where she isnt going to go on the defensive every time?

I need to save for both of our retirements and kids education funds.

her dropping 5k on brand new clothes and 5k on misc stuff when she only has 5k per year is counter productive.

250,"To make it clear, I'm not asking for any legal or financial advise. I just don't know how to tell my parents without them feeling embarrassed.

With this pandemic, it's gotten difficult for us to get by. Before this all happened, both my parents don't have any stable income. They were starting up a small catering business but obviously they can't do that now. 

I don't know who introduced them, but they were recruited to join this ""online investment"". They want me to invest in it too, but I'm only just a college student so I can't really put into much investment into anything, and I was-still am-very suspicious of it. They seem to really believe that it's a legit online business. I haven't been able to find any research or articles to prove my suspsicions until just recently, but I don't know how show my parents the article without them thinking bad of me. I'm scared that if I show them the article, they might think that I'm a know-it-all or something. A little backstory, my parents and I do not share the same political beliefs.

At the consultation I lied and said the reason I want it is because of sleep apnea(so I could get it paid for with insurance). And I basically said that I wake up a lot and dont have a normal sleep schedule(this was back in january). 
He recommended me to get tested for sleep apnea so they can see where the problem is. Making a drs appointment has been a hassle for me because of my insurance and now because of the virus. Plus obviously I would fail the sleep test. 
I have decided that I am willing to pay for the procedure without insurance but I dont know what to tell the surgeon. I don't want to make it seem like I was lying. I was thinking of telling him that the sleep test came back negative but then I'm afraid he might ask for proof or results.

260,"(this is a personal dilemma but I'd like to pose it as a thought experiment)

Consider parents who have done everything to raise their child in a loving and safe home (providing the child with food, shelter, entertainment, attention and affection). Take into account that what the parents consider to be a loving home may not be one in the eyes of the child - for example, the parents dictate significant aspects of the child's life on the grounds of religion.

As an adult the individual is now (partially) free of their parents' rules as they don't see them as often as they once did. The adult feels anger and resentment towards their parents as they feel they have been robbed of their childhood and early adulthood. However, they are still aware that their parents have given up so much and done so much for them to raise them as best as they could.

Is it fair now, for the child to come out to their parents by telling them they have not only left their parents' religion but are also gay (the parents are raging homophobes) knowing that this will break their parents' hearts?

Coming out to their parents won't change this individuals life significantly but would probably greatly impact the parents.",30Apr2020,1

Becky admitted to me months ago she was pansexual, and I was really proud of her because she also came out to her family also. It’s been months and lately she’s been making pan jokes all the time, even when I don’t always get them. Of course, I probably am definitely overthinking this one. 

Becky moved to New York not too long ago. Ever since, we’ve had our ups and downs but we come back every time. We were usually very loud during calls and had a lot of fun. Lately though, it’s been quieter and she’s been saying things. She’s implied multiple times that she misses me, and even stated once that she wanted to touch me. Which was, y’know, pretty strange. She even said that she had a crush on me two years before she moved. 

Back then, her crush on me was pretty obvious, and not as subtle as she liked it to be. At the time of the call, I believed there was no possible way she liked me, so when she asked me if I knew I was like, “Yeah, it was really obvious.” Or something along the lines of that. I could tell Becky panicked for a bit and not too long after she had to go. I bought her one of the meme chickadee plushes and she wouldn’t stop bringing it up for two weeks.

She’s been handed money left and right, always meets the criteria for stupid awards and financial aid because her parents are divorced so she can say she’s in a one income household. She owes me so much money because we split hotels or I pay for concert tickets. She hasn’t paid a cent. She says she feels bad, hates owing people money, doesn’t pay me a cent. She financially takes advantage and I’m sick of it. She just makes me so unhappy. I’m so numb right now because I do love her and she does mean a lot to me but she’s awful. I love my other friends more than her at this point. I don’t know. I’m so sad.",30Apr2020,1
265,"I'm going to be a junior in the fall and I have an oppurtunity to start as a WR. I'm already a great athlete (varsity lacrosse, JV basketball) so that's not an issue. My mom says I need to focus on my studies but her logic is so bad. If I don't play I'm not going to have any motivation to do well and I'll probably be more depressed than I am now. The thing is, sports are my escape from the problems in my head. They make my grades better but mom doesn't want to hear it. I suggested a 'mission statement' where I'd promise 3.8 GPA or I drop out of football. She says I should be doing well anyways but she doesn't understand that I have no sense of purpose without sports so I won't do well. She doesn't seem to have any other argument just ""you're not playing football"" and ""get it out of your head"". I'm closer to ending it now than I've been in a long time. If I don't play in the fall I'm worried I might. How else can I convince her? I'm at a loss and she won't take any more reasoning.",30Apr2020,1
266,"Hi, i am 18 year old currently still studying. From young i did not know how to properly make friends, the only time that i would talk to people would be to talk to them when i met them face to face, or when i went to someone's house to play, i would consider that back then i had friends, but after a while i just stopped, i cannot remember why. When i was 13 or 14, i was in a cliche, we were good friends in the class room, we were teenagers now and i still had not texted people, i guess that is what people do when their teenagers. I guess i did not feel the need to as i was kinda addicted to video games. My grades were bad like i failed 4 out of 6 subjects at times and i got really depressed, but i keep being engrossed in my games even going to the point that i would lie to my parents about it. My relationship with my parents grew strain after that for a while. Until eventually i told my parents and we reconciled, but right now as i am thinking about this, the problem of my ability to make friends did not go away, i chose not to think about it, i chose to run away from reality by shutting myself in this box you called games(mostly it was First Person Shooters like Cs Go). Till today i still have no idea how to make friends and i think i want to make friends, but the thing is that i feel that sometimes it is a waste of time to text your friends, this is what i think, texting your friends can sometimes take up some time and i don't know what to text them sometimes, will people think i am weird if i text them suddenly out of the blue when we first met? Being a male, will the females i text think that i am trying to hit on them when I am not(I am not interested in finding a Girlfriend atm because i want to concentrate on my studies and dont have so much cash to blast). Recently i turned 18, and i still do not have any real friends, of course i tried to make some but still doesn't feel like anything genuine. It all feels just like im a facade, did i mention in the last 5 years i tried to be someone who i am not. Since i dont really understand myself, i always wore a mask, i took personalities from people, i acted like people whom i feel have many friends, till this day i don't really know who i am anymore. I work hard to make my parents happy but i still feel that i am not able to do it. I have considered killing myself many many times, but i guess i am too afraid of dying ( i am pathetic), sometimes i just don't know what to do anymore, i try to be the best but doesn't feel like i can thats why i resort to finding help on the internet where people do not know who i am(i guess it makes me much safer to think that at least people who dont know me will see my story). Oh i have an elder brother, who is with the military right now, his grades is not so good, and we come from a rather Humble background, so i think its all on me to do everything, to fufil my parent's wishes of becoming rich someday, i think the first step to take is making friends, but i still do not know how to do that. Hence i have held my head low and have taken this to reddit.

268,"So there's a background to this so I'll start there. So I started dating my boyfriend 2 1/2 years ago. I was the first girl he had ever introduced to his close friend group. His friend close group consists of a married couple (my boyfriend has been friends with the husband since he was like 4) and two other guys friends. It wasnt long after we had all meet that they friended me on facebook. (I never request anyone) So right off the bat from the first time that I met the married couple the wife rubbed me the wrong way but I figured once I got to know her I would be fine with her. Well that's not the case at all. I absolutely can not stand her or her husband anymore. They act like 15 year olds, treat people like shit, are manipulative, lie about stupid shit all the time and are just all around shitty people. The last straw for me was when my cat was attacked by my pitbull and it resulted in an unexpected 900$ emergency vet bill. The wife the day after all of it happend had the audacity to say that I was dumb for spending that much and I should have just taken my cat out back and shot him in the face. Its to a point of I will intentionally find something that ""has to get done"" on days when they want us to come over just so I dont have to go. I have told my boyfriend how I feel about them and he totally understands. (He only stays friends with them cause he likes hanging out with the husband) I want to unfriend them on facebook but they are so dramatic about everything they it will blow up into this big huge problem in the friend group.

270,"It seems that whenever I set a goal for myself and tell others about it (usually due to excitement for setting a new goal) it NEVER pans out. 

For example, I set a goal for myself to finish college early and I told everyone about how excited I am to embark on this new challenge. Well, it never happened. It seemed that the entire world conspired against me because I kept running into many, many obstacles along the way that stopped me from reaching my goal. 

Another, more current example. I've wanted to join the military for a while now, and I've told a lot of people about it. As soon as I start exercising, I get a bunch of injuries. I barely run 4 miles this week, and I get bad shin splints that stop me from running. Earlier this year, I was lifting weights to prep for this and I get a major hip injury. Along the way, things keep popping up that stop me from completing my physical training and I go nowhere because I'm constantly getting injured. 

Honestly, what's the point in setting goals anymore? It seems that whenever I don't set goals, I'm able to do a lot more, but when I do set them, things never work out.

272,"I'm in my early twenties and filled with all sorts of fun things like self loathing, depression, pessimism and general negativity.

I've given up on getting any sort of decent help from medical professionals at this point, unfortunately I've been clinically depressed for over ten years and have periodically entertained suicidal thoughts during that time.

I have no interest in anything and when I'm not working my days consist of doing mindless things to pass the time (eg. watching random YouTube videos) that I don't enjoy. I've been unable to find anything I actually enjoy and I recognise that's probably due to the depression.

I genuinely believe I am a bad person who doesn't really deserve to live. I can't remember the last time I was happy and find it incredibly difficult to picture a time in the future when I will be happy.

I have no relationships with anyone other than work acquaintances. The last time I got a text from someone was the 24th of March (to do with work), before that it was sometime in January. I have a deep reluctance to get close to anyone and whilst I'm able to make people like me (or the act I put on) I find myself pulling back whenever they start wanting to hang out.  I feel distinctly different and alone.

I'm unhealthy and inactive, whilst I'm not obese I am overweight. I don't eat massive amounts, I just don't move. If I don't have to go somewhere like work or to a meeting then I don't go anywhere. Just leaving the house gives me a tonne of anxiety. A lot of the time I find it difficult just doing the basics of keeping myself alive, eating, showering, brushing teeth, getting out of bed etc.

I really want to pull myself up by my bootstraps, so to speak, but find it incredibly difficult to do so. I struggle to think positively, I don't know where or how to begin fixing myself.

I didn't have the easiest start to life (it could have been worse, sure, but it certainly wasn't the nicest of times). The first part of my life turned me into what I am now, so how do I go about undoing the damage and fixing things?

What do I do to stop feeling so terrible and have a normal life in which there are things I enjoy, I'm healthy and have good relationships with those around me?",30Apr2020,1

275,"Okay so there's this guy that I was slightly involved with but I guess I got attached. I tried to hide this, but I'm pretty sure it's obvious since I called him over and a week into it I paid for food for us. Anyway, I do believe that he's a good guy but he hasn't texted me since I saw him and I haven't either since I'm scared of what he'll think. I think that since I did all that I came off as desperate. I even lost my virginity with him and so I'm afraid I'll come off as one of those clingy ex. virgins. Which I kind of am but I'm really trying not to be and I'm aware at least. I'm probably not going to text him because I am 100% confident that he would lose all respect for me and that it would become completely one sided. His manners the last time I saw him were not as good as when I first started talking to him (although they weren't crazy or anything). I'm not saying he should feel any sort of way. I'm not entitled like that. I just felt something for him and at this point wouldn't really care if it was just a hookup situation because it felt good being with him. I don't think I'd prefer a real relationship in the traditional sense because I don't see the use in that right now.  I feel like I wouldn't know what to talk about or something like that. Again, I don't want to text him because I feel like that would give him too much power and I know that I make it sound like a game but it's how I feel. But at the same time I'm afraid I'll never see him again. So, I'm wondering if anyone had any experience with texting back first after a hookup and what happened after. Or, what a guy thought after a girl texted him after a hookup. Is it reasonable at all to think that I should do that. I'm honestly coming to the point where I'm ready to give up and at least be able to focus more on myself.

283,"Im a first-year college student who has failed 2  out of 9 college classes and got D's and B's on the rest out of pure laziness. I cannot seem to stop being lazy, whenever I plan to do school work I just can't seem to start. I have tried to break it up into segments but that does not work, the only thing that motivates me is group work (because other people depend on me) or procrastination of big assignments. I like what I'm going to college for, not to mention I'm paying for half, I also understand it. I could have easily gotten A's and B's I had the time and know-how, I just didn't for some reason.

I have had this problem ever since my sophomore year of high school I used to be the top of the class and then my average grade dropped to a C. Nothing traumatizing or terrible happened around that time I just became lazier. I cannot seem to get my self motivated. I have been told I'm extremely intelligent and hard working. I'm completely different from my friend groups and work. I often the go-to when somebody needs help. people usually trust me with their issues whether it is emotional or physical or even school or work-related. At work I overachieve and my bosses love having me. 

I have realized that people's image of me matters like bosses or teachers that make me care about my school work. The few teachers that have made subjects interesting both in high school and college I have done well in. The other teachers and professors just did not get me interested even though I like the subject or found it interesting.

287,"I'm in my early 20's living with my parents. My mom has always been great, but my dad is incredibly unstable, and verbally/emotionally abusive. Furthermore, I have a boyfriend who I've been keeping a secret from my dad, because not only is he abusive, but he is maliciously homophobic, go figure. Unfortunately me and my mom rely on him for financial reasons. And despite being abusive, he most definitely provides for us financially. He even helped pay for my college and much more. I have a job, but it doesn't pay much, so without him I'd basically be broke. And he often uses this against us. Like if anyone tries to stand up to him, he'll be like ""I do too much for you guys, you just don't appreciate me."" He's also hypersensitive, if you say/do anything that even slightly rubs him the wrong way, he'll explode into a screaming match that could last for hours. 

For example, he got pissed one time because my mom read the ingredients on something after he cooked it. He literally threw the food out the back door and proceeded with his usual ravings. Sounds pretty nonsensical, right? That's because he will take just about anything as an insult/attack against him. If he found out I had a boyfriend, he'd lose his goddamn mind for sure. It's also bizarre because in public he's very social, charismatic, witty, ext. But behind closed doors, he'll devolve into a screaming man child at the drop of a hat. He's been like this for as long as I remember, and it's unsurprisingly caused a ton of built up angry/hatred in me. I feel like I'll eventually have to cut him off if I truly want to get on with my life. My boyfriend said I could live with him if I really wanted to, so I'd at least have a place to stay. But cutting my dad off and living with BF would have quite a few downsides.

First off, I'd be broke, and probably have to find a new job. Not only does my BF live an hour away, but because the car I drive is under my dad's name, and he of course pays for it. So cutting him off would almost certainly mean losing the car. Also I have medical issues that I go to hospital for every few months. My health insurance is covered under my mom, but again, the hospital would be an hour away (and without a car). So yeah, cutting him off is a possibility, but it would mean losing just about all financial stability. 

I've thought about a middle ground, where I tell my dad I'm just moving in with a ""friend."" But assuming the relationship lasts, I feel like he'd find out eventually, and then catastrophe ensues. So yeah, that's where I'm at, and feeling more confused and anxious as the days go by. Should I just cut him off and risk going broke? Should I wait until I'm more financially well off? Is there a middle ground? Is there a completely different angle that I'm not even considering? Any advice would be appreciated, don't be afraid to be direct, just keep it civil.",30Apr2020,1
288,"Hi, I don’t really feel comfortable sharing my exact age on here, but I’m in high school and female. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I take medication, and I’ve even been able to call my therapist over this period of quarantine, however despite all the precautions and help I’ve been getting, I can’t help feeling suicidal. 
Back when the school year was still going, I was taken out of school for two days because of my mental health. This happened again about a month after the first time, because I had a plan to commit. I was referred to a mental hospital despite me never going, but I wasn’t allowed back to school without a signature from my therapist. After that period of time, I started to feel a lot better. I was happier and I had friends and support, and it was all good up until the start of quarantine.
The beginning wasn’t so bad, but now, I can’t focus on anything because my mind keeps wandering on how I could possibly end the pain I feel everyday. I don’t know if it’s the fact that I’m alone most of the time, or maybe it’s just that I don’t interact with people much anymore, b something just isn’t right. It’s not even like I have many problems either, I feel like it’s just that my head is so messed up. I’ve been crying myself to sleep every night and losing my motivation to do anything but exercise.

289,"So, the short story is, I want to move out of my parents’ house along with my sister for the summer.

For some context: I’m currently a sophomore in college home from school due to COVID-19 like every other college student in the country. I’ve been home since mid-March and it’s been very stressful for me because I am not entirely comfortable here. My sister is graduating high school this year and starting her freshman year of college next semester. I’m 19 (almost 20) and she’s 18.

This summer, I will luckily be one of the few college kids who actually has something planned for the summer (albeit remotely). I am going to be doing mathematics research, and I will be paid a generous stipend. Before my program was moved online, this stipend was going towards my rent and living expenses since the program isn’t in my hometown, so I was planning on paying rent already. I have enough to spare for my own place in my hometown where rent prices are relatively cheap.

My sister has a nice, steady part time job at a local business. She has quite a bit of money saved up from working there and will continue working there throughout the summer (essential business), so she will also have no problem paying rent or living expenses.

So, money is not an issue with moving out. We will ask nothing from my parents and cover all living expenses ourselves. I suppose most parents would be elated at the thought of their kids moving out and being entirely self-sufficient, but I’m afraid my parents will be offended at the idea. 

So, why would I want to pay for rent and groceries if I can just live at home? I have a variety of reasons.
-My family does not get along at all. My parents have been on the brink of divorce for their entire marriage and it’s not a great environment. My sister and I have always stuck together through it, and I am very close with her.
-I know everyone finds freedom in college, but going to college honestly liberated me. At home, I am under my mom’s thumb, and she has a firm grip.
-My mom is very conservative and tradicional, and I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells around her. I actively have to suppress parts of my personality and censor my words and my actions.   
-I can’t work effectively. Being in this environment is distracting and stressful. I feel like if I had my own space (with my sister who I love and trust), I would be work much more effectively and efficiently. 
-I don’t even sleep the same here, I’m so stressed.
-My sister and my mom don’t get along at all. They constantly argue and my sister is constantly ridiculed, to the point that I have serious concerns about her mental health because of it.

I could probably list some more things, but honestly, I think having my own place this summer would just be a better environment for my work and my health overall.

Anyway, the issue lies with how to approach my parents about this. It’s kind of a strange circumstance because we are purposefully wanting to live elsewhere in the same town, not with them even though we’re welcome to live here for free with no problem. I feel like my parents would be offended if we decided to move out, and would even maybe block us from doing so. I’m not sure how to discuss this in a way that doesn’t make them upset. Also, I feel like even though my sister and I are (legally) adults, we are still seen as children who are unable to be self-sufficient. How could we show them that we are capable of being fully autonomous?

TL;DR: How do I approach my parents about moving out with my sister for the summer?",30Apr2020,1

I don't know if it is but I'm sure the amount she spends on beer is a lot for us and she should instead save it or spend it on something that we need. her alcohol tolerance is remarkably low so she gets pretty drunk with the amount of beer she drinks. for some reason, she becomes extremely quiet and just sits there at times swaying side to side not responding to things we say.",30Apr2020,1
291,"about last year ago my Ex made a slandering post about me after she found out about my current gf. My gf said she found out because one of her friends told my ex about me.

Just recently my gf said that she lied about how my ex knew and told me that she talked to my ex about why she left me as me and current-gf were having problems back then.

292,"To preface this, I live in an EXTREMELY cliquey town. 

I did not see this happen myself but I've heard from multiple people I know who saw it happen, including one who works where this happened. So one resident of my town is heavily involved in all aspects of it and basically knows everybody and I'd imagine has all kinds of pull. Let's just call him Mr. C. Well, he parked in the fire lane right in front of the supermarket and one of the workers who was manning the door (they're limiting people in the store) asked him to move his car, and that's when Mr. C began to go crazy and yell at the worker. Asked him ""do you even know who I am?"" and said ""You and your family better watch out because I know everyone."" 

Well the store employee, as I was told ""began to wave his hat"" at Mr. C and was asking him to stop threatening him, and at that point Mr. C began to flat out ask the worker ""what was wrong with him"", began to ask him if he had autism, if he was retarded, etc etc. The thing that makes this all the more worse, is that Mr. C is a special education teacher as well. Well the worker got fired and honestly this story has been bothering me since I heard it yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to reach out to the super market on social media and have heard nothing back from them, and I don't even know if a local paper or whatever would run this story, and considering how popular Mr. C is around here I would assume they just wouldn't run it anyway.

295,"Hi!

I have many ideas and thoughts about potential projects, products, inventions, movies, books, educational systems, software as well as a new ideology and political party in Sweden, where I happen to live. 

I am sure you have as many ideas as I do! 

All of these thoughts keep me up at night. I have had too many sleepless nights in my life because of the stress of having to choose what to pursue for the rest of my life. That is not beneficial for my health and I want to live for as long as I possibly can.

It is obvious that I will not be able to do everything I want to do in my life. I am currently trying to find out which of these commitments that are most important to me and everyone else currently living and anyone who will ever live.

I have been wasting years of my life not pursuing what I find most meaningful and I want that to change.

Due to not being able to do everything I want to do, I want to share all my ideas as efficiently as possible.

I have documented several of the ideas, but it is necessary for me to document all of them and all upcoming ones as well and put on my website for anyone to pursue or be inspired by.

I have considered many options, such as typing all ideas on a keyboard. The problem is the keyboard. I have been using a keyboard for 25 years, I do type fast, but not fast enough. I type faster on a keyboard, than on a smart phone, still not good enough!

I can study the art of typing faster, change from the QWERTY layout to another layout, but how long may it take me to learn the new layout and be as efficient typing with it as I am with QWERTY currently..? Dvorak has a 4% average advantage in typing speed according to research. That is not good enough for me to change.

What would you do in my position?

Thank you for reading, caring and I am grateful for any help I can get!

Kind regards,

298,Me and my boyfriend signed a lease to an apartment before everything went down and our move in date is June 1st. Im still working my current job and should have about 6-7k saved up by the time I actually move. Only problem is I don’t have a job lined up and neither does he. He doesn’t not have as much saved (about 3k) because for him it’s only a 30 minute move VS an 8hr move for me (we’re long distance). He’s freakin out because he’s worried we wont be able to find jobs and we’ll be living paycheck to paycheck. Im not so worried because of how much i have saved and i feel like it will last long enough for us to be able to find a job. Of course I still cared that’s he’s stressed out and I don’t wanna make this process more stressful than it needs to be. We’re job hunting but haven’t had luck with everything going on. I guess my advice would be do you think we’ll be okay with the amount we have saved? Do you think it will last us enough time to find a job and how hard do you think it will be to find a job once everything eases up..  he has a degree in English and i have no degree.

300,"Ok so I know you're not supposed to make huge life decisions when you're going through something big... but if the internet tells me it's ok then its probably ok right. So here I am, internet. 

Relevant pre-story: I grew up military so I moved to a new state or country every 1-2 years of my life. Nothing has ever felt like home to me except ONE place and ONE group of people. 

So I moved back here as an adult and got a job at that same childhood place with those childhood people that felt like family and have spent 6 years loving every minute of my life here. But last year a psychopath narcissist was also hired and decimated the group. I lost everything that ever felt like home when it all broke apart - the people, the place, the family. Narcissist spread discord and rumors and hatred, causing mistrust and broken friendships... it was v devastating. 

Anyway, because I didnt have a job anymore I had to get a job at lowes where I suffered a traumatic workplace injury that left me in a wheelchair and physical therapy for 4 months. At the end of that four months when I was FINALLY able to walk again, I was diagnosed with cancer and have spent the last 7 months fighting for my life. 

But I had to go through the wheelchair thing and the cancer thing mostly alone bc I lost my people, right? So let's talk rock bottom, I literally feel like I have nothing left. I'm being forced to sell my home and most of my possessions bc medical bills. 

I still have a very small number of people I trust, but all my closest friends ditched me. 

I'm honestly thinking of moving away and starting over fresh. But am I being dumb? Should I stay and let myself put down roots? I'm 30 years old, how am I supposed to find new friends? Do you know how hard it is to make friends at 30??? 

But also I dont know if I'm letting myself talk me out of moving on because I'm depressed.

302,"I’ve tried asking for advice from a therapist, a work coach, friends and family...but I just feel absolutely stuck. It’s to the point now that I can’t sleep at night anymore and have crying episodes almost daily. 

Basically, I started a new contract job at a top tech company in December. We are remote since early March  From the first month, I noticed there was a big imbalance between myself and my coworker who was hired only 3 months before me and is the same level and title. 

My anxiety at work grew because she was taking most of the assignments, was getting special side tasks and invitations to brainstorming sessions and meetings above her role which I was never given a chance to attend or try. I tried asking her if we could share the workload a bit more, or if I could also have the opportunity to do a certain task since she was often very busy and I was not. Nothing improved. 

I quickly noticed that the CD (who is head of our small creative team) was going to her directly with plum assignments. Then, a big blow: he invited her on a shoot abroad. This had never happened before as the other person on our team, (who has been here for over two years and is still just a contractor, btw) had never been invited to work on a shoot as those are usually given to editors and directors, not us. 

I tried offering myself to different people on the team: I’ve tried asking for feedback, making sure I’m doing things correctly and well, and I’ve only been told positive things. 

This CD who favors my colleague ignores me completely. When I joined the team, I tried to talk to him and make some connection but he dismissed me. I’ve tried speaking to other higher ups to see if I can work with them or help them, and they had mostly said no because my colleague is already on their tasks. 

My colleague does absolutely nothing to include me or get me on her team...we are supposed to be working together not against one another! I’ve exhausted myself completely with this. 

Then the bigger blow: he made her full time. He did this while our other colleague whom I mentioned was on maternity leave. How come she didn’t get full time by now? How come she didn’t get to go on any shoots? She was the one who trained the both of us. When I asked her how she felt about the news, she said she was shocked and felt betrayed. But then she said that the CD said this new person had “potential” and was a “strong editor”. But we are not editors! How did she have the opportunity to even show she has such a skill? Because of him. 

I actually did try to speak with the CD directly. He mainly blamed the current global pandemic and not having things clearly organized but I told him it has been going on longer than recently. He said he would give me a new assignment that I could take ownership of but I never heard from him again. 

I feel like the black sheep of the group here. I hate it. Everyday I wake up dreading it because it’s always me who is last to be considered. I’m never given my own assignments, and I’m often forgotten about. I’m scared they won’t renew my contract again in June because without work I will really struggle. But I don’t know what to do anymore to handle this situation I’m in. It has really hurt my self esteem, has made me question myself and my knowledge. I feel like a loser while my colleague is just basking in the glory. I hate unfairness in the workplace. I can’t find peace. 

Long story short: my colleague is the favorite and I’m constantly left behind and forgotten about. Ive tried everything to attempt to improve the situation and I don’t know what to do anymore",30Apr2020,1

304," As we all know now, there has been the quarantine that has affected many. With that, all schools have gone to online learning including colleges. There is a program where I live called the FT3 and basically if you have 12 credits and pass you get free college. 

 At the start of the semester, I had 13 credits and was doing great! However, with the online learning my grades plummeted. I was forced to drop out with a W in order to avoid receiving all four F’s on my transcript. I haven’t told my dad yet simply because he’s been riding on me going to college and doing better than he did in school. 

 As well when it comes to car insurance, I’m supposed to present my grades to him by the end of the semester to give to our company so I can have lower rates. I’m only allowed to be on his plan if I’m a full tune student. However, I do work 35 hour weeks (which isn’t a lot I know) and that as well got in the way of my learning.

308,"Hey everyone! Hope all is well during the lockdown. 

I [M32] have a best friend [F27] that has been taking to a romantic interest [M24] over the last few months. She has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression as the result of a difficult childhood/ upbringing. Recently (over the least few months) she has been seeing a guy that has been diagnosed with an unspecified bipolar disorder and has attempted suicide at least once before. Both of them are prescribed medication to manage their symptoms. My lady friend takes hers regularly and seeks professional services from a trauma counselor. Unfortunately, the guy she’s seeing does not, and it makes his interpersonal interactions with other people, especially men, very difficult ( this is actually the major problem with him, which I will discuss shortly.)

Long story short, he is a very abusive person verbally, and berates her in very degrading and sexist ways ( calling her a “hole,” dumb bitch,” etc.) and pretty much treats her as a piece of meat. He also has a profound distrust in other males and accuses her of cheating on him (even though they’re not officially together) and any time she posts a Snapchat story and there are other males in her story, even if they’re just acquainted, he immediately gets defensive and asks why they’re with her. Unfortunately, this includes me, and she has explained multiple times that I am her best friend and assured him that nothing between us is going on. He still does not believe this and it is beginning to become a problem. 
  It has gotten to the point that when she goes to see him and vice versa, she forces herself to delete all texts/ snap conversations and temporarily deletes me and her other male friends on Snapchat as well so he doesn’t get suspicious and flip out ( red flags EVERYWHERE obviously)

I can see this getting worse and worse as time goes by and I know he’ll become verbally abusive again and I don’t know what to do about the situation. She wants me in her life because she knows I am profoundly supportive of her because of her trauma, but her guy friend is immensely distrustful and it is unacceptable. 

Please help me delegate this situation as delicately as possible. Thanks everyone!!",30Apr2020,1

311,"I'm moving into a house with 4 other people in a month. They were studying abroad before everything got shut down, so I scoped out the houses, I'm the one who toured everything, I'm the one who put down deposits since they were overseas, I did everything. They let me pick my room first. I didn't even pick the biggest or the best room, just the one I liked the best! I wanted a street view so I picked the room on the corner of the house with a tiny closet just because I liked where it was in the house.

Let me explain how the house is laid out a bit so you can understand (names are changed):

We are all 21F

Bottom floor off the living room has a bedroom, Veronica's room. Not important. 

Middle floor, room one - big, on the back of the house, view of a pizza hut parking lot. tiny closet. Trish's room. Huge wall that comes in and makes it into an L shape.

Middle floor, room two - big, on the front of the house, view of the street. Can get on the roof from it. tiny closet. My room.

Middle floor, room three - tiny room, huge closet. View of the street, on the front of the house. Can get on the roof from it. Ashley's room.

Top floor - one whole floor that's a bedroom. Not important at all. Chelsea's room.

Anyway, Trish decides that she doesn't want her room anymore and asks me or Ashley to switch with her. Ashley was fine with it, she didn't care what room she had. So Trish and Ashley switched, Trish now in room three and Ashley in room one. Then, Trish comes to me and asks if I could switch with her and take the tiny room. I said no, and asked why we were switching to begin with. She said it's because she needs more space for her work, which is fair, she's an artist and wants to keep it out of the common spaces. That's fine. But I'm NOT fine with having the small room. So I ended up agreeing to switch and take room one, with the view of a pizza hut parking lot. I ended up asking why she wanted my room, and she said ""well your space was nicer and I need the extra space I can't have the wall in the way and I wanted to be able to get on the roof. you can come use it whenever you want just knock haha!!""

I didn't say no because I don't want to start any drama before I'm locked into a year lease with anyone.

I don't know why this is making me so fucking mad. Like this is such a stupid fucking thing to be mad about and I KNOW that.

I want to ask her to switch back with me but I don't know how to bring it up without starting drama or conflict. I don't want any conflict before moving in with 4 people and having to live with them for a year. I really love the room I chose and already had everything planned out where I was going to put my stuff. I only agreed to avoid conflict. I just don't know what to do. 

tldr; I agreed to switch rooms with my roommate because she ""liked my space better"" to avoid conflict. I don't want to switch. What do?",30Apr2020,1
312,"Hi guys, I recently began painting my baseboards and door trims and unfortunately it isn’t turning out like I planned. The color underneath was a dark brown, and I used interior Behr satin primer+paint in one to try to paint it over. I’m unsure what type of paint was originally used underneath. When I began pulling up my masking tape, the paint began to peel up with it, and it’s a pretty thick coat. I wiped off a good amount of dust from the baseboards but honestly I probably didn’t wipe them down as well as I should’ve (or at least that’s what I’m thinking since my paint doesn’t seem to be adhering). My new paint layer pulled up the old paint underneath as well.  I tried to use a thin razor blade to remove the tape without damaging the paint job but to avail.

We have two other female roommates and we ended up all living together in a dorm at my college because my male roommate didn’t want to live with other guys, so the four of us ended up together. It was really nice in the beginning as we used to be close friends, but it started to become more problematic towards the middle of the year. My roommate is incredibly negative and constantly complains, and it’s gotten to the point where it’s affected my own mental health. He was going through some stuff earlier this year (he had just gotten diagnosed with anxiety) and he always vented to me about it.

Additionally, we recently got into a fight over something he did and he got really defensive and started acting very aggressive. I ended up having a panic attack and had to hide in one of my roommates room.

Today my joyfriend (NB partner) received a cryptic email from their mom, asking them to call her. They haven't spoken since JF left Florida, just over a year ago. Turns out their grandma is dying. I was there while they talked, and they were discussing whether JF should come to see their grandma for a final goodbye and such. Then, they asked if I'd be willing to come with them.
The emotional part of me wants to, so I can support them and all, but at the end of the day, I'm not even sure I can. Between Washington (where we live) and Florida, I can't find any articles or anything saying that travel restrictions have loosened/changed at all, but all the sources I've found so far are from a month ago. I talked to my mom about it, and she pointed out that while JF might be able to make a case to go, if the restrictions ARE in place, I'm not directly involved and therefore wouldn't. Is there anything I can do? Assuming we find out whether or not a travel ban is still in effect, should I even go at all? They said they want me there, but I don't know if that'd be okay considering the circumstances. I'm honestly just not sure.

316,"I’m an 18 year old male, I just need to put this out there for someone to hear, I’m a very closeted person and I struggle to talk about my feelings a lot but through the mask of anonymity it makes it slightly easier, I don’t think anyone gonna read this but if you do I really would like some input anyways,I’m sorry if this is poorly written 

I’ve been dealing with self loathing, low self worth, anxiety, and insecurities since I was 12, I have hated myself for as long as I can remember, I’ve hated everything about myself. I’ve had low self confidence my whole life , I don’t have a reason to hate myself, I don’t have anything wrong with my appearance, I have nothing inherently wrong with my appearance, I just despise myself, in high school all my relationships were a disaster, the typical shit. Getting cheated on blah blah blah, I never really have blamed anyone for wronging me, I would wrong me as well, I used to have a bad self mutation problem , but I’ve stopped that years ago, I’ve never been sucidal tho, I have a great family and have had a very good life, and I’m greatful for that, I’ve only ever told one person abojt how I actually feel... I was basically told I was a cringe fest and to shut up, I put on such a great fucking mask tho. No one has ever asked me if I’m okay. I’m very socialable and never give off then depressed kid vibe because that would be embarrassing. Yet I have no friends anymore. All the friends I had completely ignore my existence. It feels like everybody loves me but nobody likes me. I find myself exicted to go to bed so I can escape to my fantasy world where I have people who love me and people who tell me I mean a lot to them. Sometimes that’s all that really keeps me going. No matter where I am I always feel alone, I sit in my room and write music to pass the time, I used to smoke a lot of weed, but now every time I smoke I have panic attacks and become even more hollow high. I really feel as if I’m not depressed but somethings mentally wrong with me on a deeper level then that. I don’t want this to come off as a “poor me” post. I just genuinely want help or someone to tell me what I’ve been dealing with for all these years is normal. Anyways.... I’m sorry if I’m going all over the place.... : When I was young I was ultra sensitive I was a cry baby of a kid, the smallest things would make me lock myself in the bath room and flip out and cry for hours, I would try to hold my breath, thinking it would kill me. And the older I get the more I realize how fucked up I am. I didn’t have any childhood trauma, like nothing bad like that ever happened to me. I don’t think anyone could ever love me honeslty, the only lovable part of me is the mask, the facade I put up to blend in with everyone else. Because I act like an outgoing funny guy I guess. But I know it’s so damn fake, it feels like I can’t even think straight ever anymore, I can’t collect my thoughts. I can never get close with anyone. Cause I don’t want my mask to slip and for anyone to see how truely fucking miserable I actually am. I hate having to feel this way, I wish I could be perfect like everyone else, and have friends and hang out with people but I just can’t, I think too much abojt everything, and the only comfort I have is my fantasy world I think about to fall asleep. IMAGINARY FUCKING FRIENDS. I’m so fucking pathetic, I can see why everyone ignores me. I’m annoying as fuck god I hate myself . I’m so fucking ugly I can see why girls cheated on me, I just feel like an alien who wasn’t mean for this body, I make this art, of crucifix’s and sperm cells and female eggs, because I feel like that was the only time I ever fit in, I DONT KNOW HOW I WAS THE FASTEST SWIMMER?? the crucifix represents the God that everyone can bow down to. I can’t believe in a god and I have a deep hatred for religion. I was raised in a Christian household and yet I never could believe in a god. I’m not a violent person... I’ve never been in a fight, I can’t stand the thought of harming others. And that’s another thing that makes me hate myself, I accidentally hurt people because I never think. I’ve hurt people with jokes, I’ve hurt people in relationships “never physically “ and I still think about everything all the time. When I was in first grade I accidentally stepped on a kids hand and he started crying and shit. And I still think of that and feel horrible. This is not normal behavior and I know this. I just want someone to read this and voice their opinion &lt;3. I’m not sucidal, I’m not on any crazy stuff, I just wanna be able to love myself and I want advice because I wanna have a happy life.",30Apr2020,1
317,"I am f22 and I recently had to move in with my mom and her husband of 1 year. They were together I think 2 years before they got married. We would always have dinner together and go places so me and my siblings could also get to know him.

When they were dating I noticed a few things about him that didn't sit well with me. I talked to her about them and she made excuses for him and since she knew him better that I did I let it go cause there was probably more than I was seeing so I didn't understand.

Now living with him and with being in quarantine I see him more and I still see things I don't like, including the way he treats her. He is definitely verbally abusive. I'm positive that he isn't physical, but he is constantly raising his voice and saying things, sounding like he just wants to start a fight over silly things. He also is constantly interrupting her and saying things to make her feel bad about herself.

I feel like a guest in their house and don't know what to do. Any advice on how to talk to her and make sure she is ok?! I can tell that she knows this is not right and that she is being drained emotionally. I just want her to be happy and it makes me sick to think of her being stuck in this relationship unhappy for the rest of her life.

Examples:

\- she is trying eat healthier to lose weight and whenever she eats he is constantly talking about what is on her plate and making comments. When he comes home from work one of the first things he asks her is what she ate that day, and whenever she says something that maybe isn't the healthiest thing he'll say something like ""oh so we loaded up on carbs today?"" (asshole) 

\- he'll say something to her and she'll be too far to hear so SHE will walk closer to HIM and ask what he said. She will be like 2-3 feet from him and he'll yell back what he said in a rude tone like shes stupid or he's so annoyed that she didn't hear what he said to her from another room.

\- he's lived alone for a long time and he has a certain way he likes to do things. he will get so upset at her for the smallest things that don't matter. To me it feels as if he is still treating it like this is still only his house and she is just a guest so she doesn't get a say in anything.

\- we were watching tv today (Youtube) and the skip ad thing finally pops up when me and her were talking and he interrupts and said ""Skip ad"" very loudly. She reaches for the remove that was between them on the couch and hits it trying not to look upset. He then says ""it was right there on the screen, i don't see why you didn't hit it""

\- the other morning he wanted coffee and instead of making it himself he kept making comments not asking her to make some, but that was his meaning behind them, then as she was making it he was criticizing the way she was doing it.",30Apr2020,1
318,"Not opinions about myself, I don't care about those. I mean things I like and everybody else doesn't like it. Whenever I like something but not many other people do I just gradually stop associating with it. Sometimes when I like something really strongly I can't really stop enjoy/associating with it. Anthony Fantano gave Juice B Crypts by Battles a 5/10. Strongly disagree with it, album bangs. So thankfully I still love that album. I put off playing Fallout 4 for 4 years because of bad reviews.

319,"So I noticed that I’m crazy over this guy. My friends told me as well. And I think the guy I like is noticing it too so I think he’s afraid of me. He said it himself that he is scared. But because of my moods. But I don’t believe that. I noticed that I’m doing behavior that obsess people do...and at the time the things I texted him I didn’t think it was crazy or creepy but now I’m starting to see it and my crush told me he felt creeped out with the things I did. Some of the things I did was text him saying about how th thought of him being a senior makes me sad cuz he’s gonna be leaving and I wanna hug him. I mentioned that I know we aren’t friends anymore. I was just being nice but I guess that creeped him out. We been friends for almost a year so I didn’t think he would be creeped out.  

I asked him what did he think about the message I said and he said was that “A bit creeped out but ik you still like me but I didn’t. So I was like why do you still like me if I don’t like you. And I find it odd.” Another thing I did was text him saying that he looked so adorable holding this big mat thing. At the time I didn’t think anything of it but now I find it totally creepy myself. I don’t know why I said the things I said .

Another thing was that I was willing to buy him $100 pair of headphones and we weren’t even friends anymore. He found it odd as well. And I also picked up the same instrument he plays just because he plays it. He keeps telling me he’s not into me. He left me so many times. Like 3 times and I think it’s because he knew I was crazy about him. And he doenst feel the same way. But each of those times I came back. And he finds it a bit odd that I still like him even tho he don’t like me back. I know getting these comments will get me hurt so badly. When he tells me he don’t like me it literally goes one ear out the other. Cuz I heard it so many times it doesnt bother me or give me pain. I just want something from him I can’t have I guess. I never felt this way before toward somone and I’m scared. I don’t want to do more damage then I already have done.

I remember when I was on anti depressants a few years back I was always in an emotionally numb state, it was awful because I wanted to feel but I couldn’t. I’m not on those anymore however throughout this quarantine break i’ve had a few traumatic events happen to me. 

At the beginning I would cry everyday or just out of nowhere, really bad mood swings. I have been okay for a while but just this weekend I had unexpectedly lost a family member I was close to. 

Inside I want to cry, I am hurt but at the same time I just can’t and I don’t feel anything. It’s weird and hard to explain but I’m hoping somebody gets me. I just can’t get myself to cry or let the pain out. It’s like it happened but it’s not reality, I don’t know when reality will hit me or if it ever does.

Hello, Reddit. A friend of mine has recently started seeing a man who was on the news for downloading + distribution of illegal content involving children. I told my friend that I think she shouldn’t date him, but she said not to be judgmental because he shouldn’t have even gotten the charge. she says that he was attempting to illegally download a video game that he didn’t have the $ for and inside of the file were some viruses and also the awful content in question, so he sent it to all of his friends so they knew not to download that fake video game file. I think this is nonsense because 1 why would this content be easily accessible on a video game file? i watch law &amp; order svu and it’s not that easy to find, and I’ve also been all over the internet and I’ve never once came across it. is it really that easy to find? 2 if a person did come across these images, would they really send it to their friends? who is that dumb? 3 if it WAS an honest mistake, why didn’t he call the police, why did the police have to get a warrant and show up at his house. if I accidentally downloaded something like that, I would call the police so they could properly dispose of it and also help get it off of the internet. I really think there must be something wrong with my friends new man and she should dump him.",30Apr2020,1
325,"Recently got a job at a super market that recently had a covid19 case with one of it’s workers, and a lot of grocery workers get sick for working at these places in general. Plus I have a lowered immune system from medication I’m taking.

I read that Covid19 can potentially get on your clothes so I wanted to be practical and express my opinions on getting a white plastic coverall similar to what scientists wear (not full hazmat suit) because it would be easier to sanitize and safer.

In the back of my mind I knew the company most likely wouldn’t allow that so it was only a hypothetical argument because it’s similar to how they didn’t want health care workers to wear masks just for the sole purpose of not scaring patients which boggles my mind.

His first response was “your going to scare the crap out of people!” And said your not wearing it! In a loud overbearing tone of voice. This triggered me because it’s similar to how China detained the doctor who was the whistle blower on the corona virus and how the US didn’t allow health care workers to wear masks.

I raised my voice a bit because I was shocked because it’s totally against my morals and said no way I’m not going to agree to your opinion on this regardless what you say.

Then he got really aggressive and moved toward me backing me into a corner like he wanted to hit me. We got into a huge argument about this and my mom was involved.

I tried to have an intelligent debate with him and all he says is to man up and that I don’t make any money so I don’t have an opinion and that he would kick me out, and that I should be happy to finally get a job.. which I was.

He goes what are you going to live your life in a bubble!? And that I have a defeatist attitude and just not to go into the job.

I said to him that I know I most likely can’t wear the protective suit and would only be provided a mask and I would just go in with regular clothes anyway and it’s just a debate.

I asked him if I’m wrong for wanting to wear this protective gear during a pandemic with a lowered immune system and just want a yes or no answer.

He can’t even give me a simple yes or no answer and continues to belittle me and say I haven’t had a job in a long time and says that’s not the way things work.

It just triggered me so much when he said that I’m going to scare the crap out of people. It went against my practical mindset so much because it’s pretty similar to how the communists were arresting the doctors who were trying to get the word out.

Just because it might scare people or look weird is totally against my philosophy, as long as it protects in some way I’m all about it.

He works in his own office so doesn’t have to worry about it and doesn’t wear a mask outside only when he went to the store once.

A worker even got the virus in the same super market I’m going to work at and I see people not wearing masks when I go out to public places which shocks me.",30Apr2020,1

329,"im sorry if this is a lot. I’ve been struggling with this for the past year and i’ve reached the point where i need other people to confirm or deny my thoughts. TW: child grooming

I started being groomed online at the age of 9. I’ve had unsupervised access to the internet for as long as i can remember, so i naturally stumbled upon chat rooms and “friend making” apps as i got more curious. at first i lied about my age, many times, but then i started to display my real age and got many responses from older men, anywhere from early 30’s to late 50’s. the conversations would start off nice and casual but, of course, a man in his 50’s isn’t talking to a 9 year old for small talk. they’d get sexual very quickly, and i would always go with it because i didn’t want them to leave. the conversations included anything from role-playing to them sending nudes. this became a very normal thing for me. i started to like it and actively started to seek out older men on these apps or chat rooms. at one point i even talked to  an older couple, maybe early 60’s, that shared an account and actively interacted with me every day. they were the first people i ever sent nude pictures of myself to. i was 10. i want to make it clear that i never showed my face in any of them, but it was very clear that i was obviously a child, due to my undeveloped body. these interactions continued until i was around 12, someone threatened to blackmail me which left me absolutely terrified and with no motivation to continue doing what i was doing. after that, i tried to bury those memories into the crevices of my brain in order to forget. and it worked, i never thought anything bad of that period in my life and just saw it as some weird daddy issues phase that i eventually got over. i didn’t realize i was groomed until late last year, and that’s when i started to be really harsh on myself. i keep blaming myself for what happened and the thought of my 10 year old naked body being on the internet torments me everyday. it makes me feel disgusting.

i opened up about this to 3 of my closest friends, (not mentioning the nude parts), and all i got from telling them was more confirmation that it was MY fault. i didn’t get the closure i needed, all i got was more people agreeing that it was my fault. i want to believe that deep down, i know it’s not my fault. i know that i was taken advantage of, i know that an adult shouldn’t be interacting with a 9 year old for ANY reason, but i can’t believe that when i have 3 people telling me it was my fault, that i was actively seeking out older men. and it’s true, i was willingly doing all of it. no one ever forced me to do it. my most delusional thoughts right now are the ones telling me it wasn’t my fault. so now i’m here, asking everyone for their opinion on this. please be completely honest and raw, if you think it’s my fault, tell me why. if you don’t think it’s my fault, tell me why. i feel like i’m going insane.

330,"This might be a long one. Sorry!
I'm 19 and I'm currently taking a gap year. I decided not to study right after high school, because I didn't want to immediately start being a student again and also because I just didn't know what I wanted. Now, I think that I do. I mean I always knew that I wanted to be in the creative industry, the ""show business"" if you like. And I guess this year just really helped me realize that I want that and only that. Nothing else will be good enough for me. So I looked into creative business programs, film production, musical theater, just everything I could find that worked for me. And I have nothing. I'm not lying when I say that I spent this ENTIRE year researching universities and programs. Name any university in Europe that has any kind of a creative bachelor program and I swear I will know it. There have been at least ten times when it seems like I finally found the one and then something comes out that makes me realize that it's not right for me. But every time I bounced back and kept searching. Now, however, I really can't anymore. Yesterday I again found out some bad things about the university I had chosen and there's nothing left. There are no more universities or programs in my country that I can choose from, because none of them work for me and I spent the entire day yesterday just laying in my bed wishing that this was all over. I know how dramatic it sounds, how childish and dumb, because there are people with real problems out there, but to me this is important. This is my life. This decision is crucial and I don't want to make the wrong one. I often think about how I hate myself for having such big dreams. Like, if my dream was to become a lawyer, great! I just study law and that's it. But no, I had to be this impossible dreamer who wants to move from her tiny country in Europe to North America and really do some good and make a change with her mind and creativity. And with every day this dream seems less and less achievable and like I said, I can't imagine myself doing ANYTHING else. I'm afraid that I just simply won't want to live if I'm not doing anything close to what my dream is. 

I'm just done. I can't do this anymore, nothing is going my way at all, every single choice I make is the wrong one. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Can you tell me what the right steps to take here are? Cause at this point I really can't think straight.

Thank you!",30Apr2020,1

332,"A childhood friend of mine has a mental illness that gives him mania, depression, and psychosis. Being at home was triggering symptoms, and he basically called me from his car a couple days ago asking if he could stay at my place “until he’s stable”. He insists that he cannot live at home or else his psychosis will remain. He told me not to feel obligated, but it’s hard not to feel obligated when you’re the only thing between a childhood friend living in his car and living under a roof. When he got here, my parents told him that he can stay “as long as he wants”.

Fast forward a couple days, and his mannerisms are a bit frightening. As much as I want to help him, listening to him talk about the ways in which his psychosis is manifesting and how he is trying to manage it throughout the whole day is overwhelming. 

He has been in a mentally fragile state the whole time he has been here. We needed to rearrange the guest room because the color of the carpet was the same as the color of his carpet at home so it was triggering him. 2 of the 3 nights he’s been here he’s needed to sleep in my room due to panic attacks.

My family and I are not qualified to treat his disorder, so all we can do is try to make him as comfortable as possible. Any of the food he wants, cleaning up after him, giving him plenty of space whenever he wants... As a result, it has begun to feel like i’m walking on eggshells in my own home, trying not to do or say anything that might set him into another manic or psychotic episode. My family is observing the quarantine, so none of us can really even leave to go anywhere.

He’s just started new medication, and it will take a couple of weeks to begin working. I don’t think I can live with him like this for more than another couple days. He’s bought himself groceries and had his parents brought his clothes so it’s clear he intends to stay for a while.

""My brother doesn't get a lot of privacy at home due to very strict parents. Maybe he got frustrated and told me that he wants to watch porn. So I told him that it's not the right age to watch porn but if he still needs he can take my laptop for his use. I made a different user login on my laptop so that he can use it. 

Then he replies to that with "" I know you watch porn too"". I told him that it was none of his business and if he wanted to he can use the laptop. So he tells me next time when you watch porn tell me we can watch it together. I got angry and told him that I am not his friend that he can ask me to watch it together. I haven't talked to him since then. I badly need advice on how to react to this.

338,"I was only a few days away from turning 17 when i first got into college. This wasn’t because I was necessarily smarter than anyone else, but because I was a high school drop out at 15 and rushing to prove a point.  The second I got out, I isolated myself for a year to heal from anxiety and insomnia, detox from all of the unnecessary meds the psychs shoved down my throat to get me to function, and studied for the GED. (My anxiety is due to being molested at a young age for an extended period of time)

Through some miracle I passed and jumped some hurdles to get into a community college. I still couldn’t be around large crowds without feeling like I was going to throw up or faint and I still couldn’t look people in the eye or have a normal, flowing conversation but I could finally sit in a classroom and focus as long as I was sitting close to the door and knew where all of the exits were. I finally felt competent as I was getting straight a’s, but it was silly for me to think that i was mature enough to handle making my own life decisions at such a young age. Not only did I switch majors 6 times within 2 years, but I started hanging with an older crowd that helped me to self-medicate although no interventions were even necessary at the time. They weren’t necessarily malicious but they’ve been in my shoes before and attempted to help in the way that they knew best. For a while these methods helped immensely, even getting me into a university for my junior year and enabling me to feel confident enough to actively participate in clubs. Most of my loved ones didn’t know what I was doing or pretended the issue wasn’t there but dependency turned into addiction and all of my progress fell apart. The withdrawals made my anxiety and paranoia worse and I wouldn’t sleep for days or weeks at a time. I was back at square one, took advantage of my grace period, and decided to stick with work and isolating myself in my apartment. When my friends and loved ones figured out about my situation,  I was berated with comments stating that I had no excuse to make such decisions/others had it worse/I was a first-world problem/I was being selfish/etc. And they were right. It was my choice to follow the suggestions of my friends and continue to rely on bad habits. At the same time, I wanted to tell them that they had no idea how it felt to be so sick in the head that you can’t even leave your house or catch a break because you’re unable to control your thoughts and the only way to stop is by doing drugs. The same drugs your psych could easily get you if you’re knowledgeable enough to fake it. The same people I told this to and even advocated for mental health with essentially told me that I should’ve “sucked it up.” Maybe it’s because they actually saw me as someone with potential who was giving up too easily. If I were just a failure to them, it would’ve made more sense to just pat me on the head and send me off with their condolences. I guess I should’ve been flattered, but I was pissed off. These actual dumbfucks think that I’m just making shit up because I’m weak? If I could’ve chosen between losing my legs or remaining sick in the head at the timeI would’ve chosen the first. My family members even told me they’d prefer if I was physically ill. 2-3 years have already passed and I overcame the addiction and only have a semester left of school but I still feel rage at all of the ignorant assholes who still think we’re friends after making these comments and talking behind my back. Im pretty chill and forgive pretty easily but this is one thing I can’t let go. I really just want to cut them out of my life but I feel guilt doing that to anyone.

What other ways can I tell if she’s just using me for attention? 

I’m not sure what I want from her relationship wise or just sex, but she doesn’t want a relationship and she said “maybe sex”, a complete reversal from her wanting me to sneak into her house a couple weeks ago. 


I was talking to her and she said she was really fat. I was sick of it and I told her to workout then and she said she didn’t want to. I told her that something was going to have to give then and she flipped on me and didn’t talk to me for three days. 

Any advice is appreciated I’m really struggling right now.

344,"I'm trying to be as vague as possible because I have family on reddit who would see this and I'd be in MAJOR trouble. 

My sister and her wife have been completely supporting the household (mom, sister and SIL, me and three younger siblings) for the last five years. My mom doesn't have a job. Shes had one job in her entire life and shes been supported by various boyfriends, husbands and her family her whole life. 
My sister has been supporting her since she lost her job due to showing up high all the time (former opiate addiction) and my sister is an alcoholic. We live in SILs house, so it's not even my moms house at all. 

My mom is sober from 2018 forward. She has a car. She could get a job if she really wanted to, but she doesn't want to. She lives off of other people. Shes super religious and conservative and a conspiracy theorist (extreme) and expects that a miracle will happen and just give her a way out of here so she won't have to work but she'll live in her own house. She doesn't cook. She doesn't clean. She doesn't bring any money into the house at all other than child support she gets every two weeks ($300ish) and usually doesnt use it for something beneficial (gas money for her car, saving up to get a place, ect). My mom refuses to work. Shes in a bad shape mentally (paranoid, went through an episode in November last year where she wasn't sleeping or eating and was convinced everybody was trying to kill her and that people on the internet had spies inside the house and was feeding information to her ex husband so he could write songs about her life and have people make vines about her).

Me and my siblings are all educationally neglected. I haven't been in school since I was like nine, and my brother is 14 and can barely read. My only hope for a future is the GED and I can't study for it because everything is fucked up. I'm awake all night because my sister (32) is a passive aggressive cunt and plays her music super fucking loud and it wakes the whole apartment up. We live in a three bedroom. Her and her wife have their own room, my brother (14) has his own and I have to share with my mom and the twins. I have to babysit all day and night while they're being kept awake, study for my GED (basically speed learn middle and high school), do ALL of the chores and cooking by myself. And my sister gets violent when shes drunk (which is the case tonight). She hits people and herself, threatens to wreck cars into the house and threatens to kill other people and commit suicide as well as leave everybody aside from her or SIL homeless. She injured me when I was thirteen which I still suffer chronic pain from. Shes threatend to seriously injure the twins (both 5).

I've been denied medical and dental care my whole life as well as all vaccines and any form of social life. No friends, at all. In any way, shape or form. My options are runaway, beg extended family (which wouldn't work because they would just confront my sister and mom about it then I'd get in trouble, and I haven't seen any of them with quarantine and everything).

When they were dating I noticed a few things about him that didn't sit well with me. I talked to her about them and she made excuses for him and since she knew him better that I did I let it go cause there was probably more than I was seeing so I didn't understand.

Now living with him and with being in quarantine I see him more and I still see things I don't like, including the way he treats her. He is definitely verbally abusive. I'm positive that he isn't physical, but he is constantly raising his voice and saying things, sounding like he just wants to start a fight over silly things. He also is constantly interrupting her and saying things to make her feel bad about herself.

I feel like a guest in their house and don't know what to do. Any advice on how to talk to her and make sure she is ok?! I can tell that she knows this is not right and that she is being drained emotionally. I just want her to be happy and it makes me sick to think of her being stuck in this relationship unhappy for the rest of her life.

347,"First, thank you for reading this. I realized that it's a very long read so here's the summary: Friend's habit is to complain and over-share her schoolwork with me for almost 3 years in college, mildly annoying but doable. Did it again today AND complained about having to go to work, pissed me off big time since my mom's store is still closed due to COVID-19 (unemployed basically), and our family is making ends meet. Am I being overly sensitive?

Full version:

This friend of mine (let's called her Tot), who would **often** randomly announces to me her school work status whenever we're in a class together or on the daily when we were roommates (ex. ""Hey I've got a 90% on the midterm"" or ""Just finish assignment x""). Now, I've always find it mildly annoying and frankly, a bit irritating because it feels like she's trying to prove something to me, and making me feels pressured to catch up to her. But I have always managed to ignore my feelings and tried to casually reply back as friendly as possible because I would always blame my insecurities as a student ( I'm a first-gen student, while her entire family has gone to our college) and cranky-nature as a result for these emotions.

Today is different. When Tot did another one of those ""sharing"", I decided not to reply back and instead do school works. Later, when I did reply, Tot continues to tell me that she's so overwhelmed with classes and complained that she has to go to work this week (Yes, her complaining to me is also a very common theme in our texts).

It pissed me off right then when she said that, because my mom's small business has to close due to COVID-19 for almost 2 months now,  and Tot over here complaining having to work on the fucking weekend and how she would rather just sleep? Not to mention, her workplace is her mom's clinic, where all she does is file organization and clean up, so she obviously has a choice whether or not to go. I thought it was the most ridiculous thing ever and decided to not reply back. We're both 21, and I guess I was just tired from her shit.

I just need a third eye on this, am I being a little bitch and overly sensitive to this whole situation???",30Apr2020,1

While Iʻve accepted that I can't control his choices, I asked him to respect my desire to practice social distancing and at least not have people over to our apartment.

I am still going to work (Oregon is not in lockdown... yet) and many of my coworkers are 65+ years old, which I have told him. Additionally, my family lives in Illinois and has been in lockdown for weeks now, which is really scary to me. 

He has a small group over to our place a few times since then, and I have regrettably bit my tongue. 

I am trying to protect myself and be mindful of others, and my roommate is only concerned with drinking with his friends and going out. 1,000,000+ confirmed US cases should speak for its self.

351,"Need some advice on selling Condo and Buying vs. Renting afterwards

Hey guys - I'm a first-time home owner and I got absolutely fucked.

I bought a 2br 3b condo to be closer to my parents (dad is getting older) for $689K ($731K all-in).

My girlfriend and I moved in March 2019. We fell in love with the place. It's close to town so we can walk/bike anywhere and everywhere easily. My brother lives a few doors down. My family's business (restaurant) is nearby, everything is amazing.

There's only one problem - I live on the second floor, right below my HOA President, who is an absolute psychopath (we'll call her, Karen).

When I moved in, Karen, this twitchy old jersey lady, came by to say hello. She begged me to join the HOA. Being a new homeowner, I didn't really understand what HOAs were or how they functioned, and wanted to contribute to my community, so I joined. After 2 meetings, I realized it was an utter waste of time. But I decided to stay on the board in an effort to build a good relationship with Karen... she was my upstairs neighbor afterall, and god forbid, if we ever had any sort of dispute with her, I could rely on the relationship we'd built...

Over the next couple of months, Karen began to slowly unravel and show her true psychotic nature. Every night, around 2-3AM, my girlfriend and I were jolted awake by unbelievably loud stomping right above our bedroom (where her bedroom was also located). It sounded like a person wearing heels stomping on a plain hardwood floor. I decided to contact her and discuss. Initially, I took the nice guy approach - ""hey, we're hearing a lot of noise during the evenings, could you maybe take it easy? maybe put some rugs down to soundproof the floors?""

Long story short, it became apparent that she gained satisfaction from irritating others. She continued to make noise, not soundproof her floors. I spoke with a lawyer friend and he advised I begin to document all of this in case I need to escalate. But she never did it so consistently where it was an every day problem, so I'd often be jolted away on a Friday morning at 3AM, but then forget about it because she'd stop for 2 days. I took my lawyer friend's advise and began to shorten my communications with her and put some pressure by leveraging the CC&amp;Rs. Fast forward 1 year, she still makes noise.

Now you might wonder... well, okay, sounds like a shitty situation, why don't you just escalate to the HOA/lawyer? Well, I was planning to, until today. I didn't attended the last 2 HOA meetings due to work (boss is on pat leave, covering for him and didn't have time). I received a notification from our HOA management company that Karen had motioned to have me removed from the board. Who cares, right? Well, I do, because the ONLY reason that I had stayed on the board was to ensure that if I ever HAD to escalate, I could! I responded immediately and made sure to attend the next meeting.

She motioned to remove me, and it passed. I now have ZERO leverage on her. If I file a formal complaint to the board, even though I have solid documentation and recordings of the noise she makes, she is the board president, so she can basically tell me to go fuck myself. I can't pursue her CC&amp;R violations legally because I would need to disclose that upon any attempt to sell my condo, ruining my chances at a successful sale. My hands are completely tied and I feel like I have no choice but to sell.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do here (stay and fight, sell and move on, etc...)? 

If you agree that my best option is to sell, how do I effectively analyze the difference between renting and buying from here?

I am absolutely terrified of buying a home again.",30Apr2020,1
352,"Obviously for many pet owners (myself included), surrendering/re-homing their pets is an absolute last resort.

It’s a long story, but the short of it is I was supposed to crash at my folks for a maximum of 4-5 weeks while I was in the process of moving and due to allergies I made arrangements for my cat to stay elsewhere. 

Obviously now what was supposed to be no more than 4-5 weeks has now become a series of months due to the pandemic putting everything on hold. However, my cat’s current foster family can’t keep him past June 1st and I still can’t move or find elsewhere to stay. 

Obviously, the first thing I’m going to do is attempt to find him another foster family. This is difficult because a lot of my friends and family are allergic or live with someone who is. Re-homing or surrendering him is the last resort, but still a very real possibility and I was just wondering how one possible handles that emotionally.

353,"My friend, let’s call her Alice, had been friends for years and we made out 2.5 years ago. Almost a year ago we went out as friends and she had problems with her boyfriend of one year, and they were on a break. I admit I tend to act without thinking sometimes, and I kissed her.

That summer, things went further and we slept together twice. We talked about our feelings and although we both had feelings for each other, a relationship would have been impossible because of different lifestyles and the fact that I was going to move abroad and didn’t wanna do long-distance. We agreed we’d still be friends and I’d never ghost her.

I moved abroad in September but we kept in touch. I’ve always been promiscous but deep inside I wanted something serious. In late November, I got into a relationship with a girl I had slept with but rejected twice in the past. She’s from our hometown, so we did long-distance until March, when the pandemic came, and I went to live with her. I’ll probably go back around mid-June. 

I started becoming distant towards Alice since late November, but didn’t tell her anything and we talked like before. I admit I made a couple of dirty jokes. Recently, she texted me again and told me she might move to the country I moved to because she got some good job offers. I knew she was interested, but didn’t know she was that serious. Anyway, she asked me if I wanted to play a video game on her birthday, and I told her we could video call if she wanted.

Right before the scheduled call, I needed to tell her, for the first time, that I had a serious girlfriend. I asked her if it would be awkward. She jokingly said not if I deleted certain texts, and that she got back together with her boyfriend (who lives in the country I moved to, maybe that’s why she wanted to move too?) and, although they still had problems, she wasn’t planning to take off her clothes on the cam or anything. 

I didn’t text back and didn’t call her. My girlfriend was with me and it was awkward. More than a week later, I got a voice message from Alice saying she apologizes if she said anything inappropriate in the last replies, that she was a bit sad because we had planned something, that it’s up to hopefully only me if I wanna keep in touch, that there’s no awkwardness or need to act weird. She then tells me how grateful she is for the time we spent together, that she hopes I’m the happiest and that is what she meant when she told me last summer how she felt about me. “A pretty non-infatuating and peaceful feeling.” She said she hopes we’ll chat and meet again some day if I want to, told me she missed me and told me to take care. She seemed very chill based on the voice. I didn’t reply. Now:

1.  I love my gf and wouldn’t get in a relationship with someone I wouldn’t want to marry. I did reject her twice but then I thought that it might work out.
2. What the heck does Alice still feel?
3. Do I just cut Alice off? What can I tell her?

P.S: Last summer we were so close I even told her to get back to her bf and give him another chance some day, even if at that time we were sleeping together.

It is so confusing. We were always able to make things clear, but now given the situation it is awkward and hard to do it. I don’t know what to tell her. Maybe my ego is so big that messages like these from a girl make me back off. Even if it was very heartfelt, and she is one of the sweetest people ever.",30Apr2020,1

And it does, it really does, because all I really want is to be smart and classy and loved by a nice, nerdy guy who actually cares about me.

Still, over and over again, I feel compelled to post pictures of myself online, have rough sex with people I just met, cam up for old men and strip and do what ever they say. It’s not like I’m getting any sexual pleasure from it, either. I like the attention, and I like hearing that I’m beautiful when I’m feeling ugly. But that’s about it and it’s all very cliche and pathetic. Sometimes just feel so disgusted with myself. I feel tainted.

And sometimes, like right now, I feel so empty and subhuman, like a rag doll. I don’t know how to access the human spirit part of me sometimes. It’s like I’ve objectified myself more than any man has ever, and I don’t know what I can offer to anyone anymore besides a hole to blow his load into. I should volunteer or something.

It has to get below zero before I will even entertain the idea of putting gloves on, and its a pair that took me forever to find.

These same spasms are results of certain sounds, and even just being touched for too long. Things near my eyes send me into the same level of panic.

I called the vet behind my moms back, and the lady who answered the phone said we could bring him him, but in the mean time out a cone on him, so he doesnt lick.

My mom out him on some meds, and it got better, but I think sometimes he still licks there, but these sores just showed up a couple weeks ago, so I dont think they are related.

369,"A friend of mine, both adults in their 20's, that I believe would very much benefit from medical help, refuses to do so or even listen to any suggestions or mentions of it.

I understand that she has had bad experiences of the healthcare system from earlier, and her feelings about it are very strong. 

I try to avoid mentioning it, because I know that if I do, I get attacked instead. She doesn't even recognize that I do it out of kindness and concern, and won't let me explain it because she gets so riled up and starts badmouthing both the healthcare-system and me for suggesting it, and makes it seem like I am the one attacking her.

It's a difficult situation, because I am basically the only one that she turns to for emotional support or sees as a friend, and I don't want to take that away from her. But at the same time, I do think that she really needs to get in contact with healthcare in order to have a functional life. And I, as a principal, don't think I can just ignore her issues.

I'm aware that it isn't my responsibility, and that I shouldn't let it get me down. This contact is generally very taxing for me, and I try to not let it get in the way of me living my own life. I think my only option is to continue being there for her as support, ask If there's anything I can do etc.

But how can I pretend like this isn't a concern. I believe she needs to hear it, because she doesn't seem to recognize her own issues or is in denial, keeps saying she can handle it herself, when that obviously (to me) hasn't worked out for the past 2 years that I've known her.",30Apr2020,1
370,"So, I'm a sophomore in high school and starting the year fresh i moved to a new school. Blah blah blah. First day of school so far pretty good. Then 4th period starts roll call happens. Then I hear this familiar name. I look at him and see it was the guy I used to like back in 7th grade. Me and Jack (not real name due to privacy) we used to be good friends in 7th grade we had quite a few classes together and we have the same last names. And I started crushing on him hard. But then then the end of September of 7th grade he moved to a different school. That I thought I'm never gonna see him again. We talked only at school. We didn't have each others social media or nothing lost all contact. Until I moved to my new school sophomore year and I see him. I see jack again. At first I didn't think he remembered me but he did and we became classmates. Just classmates. Mmmm, well I cant stop thinking of Jack. If me going to that school and seeing him there after thinking for so long I was never gonna see him again really is just a coincidence and nothing else? What do you think?

So I've been through and seen some stuff. Including somekne mentioned above hallucinating, crawling in the dark alley behind my home, etc.

I don't smoke weed or other substances. I drink socially but never to the point I'm sick. I sound old and boring, I know. 

My girlfriend just told me she's high. She's living state away, so I don't have to interact with her directly other than through text message. Her brother offered her weed to smoke, I know she's gotten high before but this is the first time since our relationship began. I don't know how to feel. I don't think it's so much her doing weed as it is my past. I know it's not a gateway drug, but it still rubs me the wrong way. I think those little gummies weed stores (sorry idk the terminology) sell to sleep and relax are okay. I don't mind those, go figure.

When my dad would drink, I'd rather not interact with him. Same thing with alley-crawler, and paranoid mom looking out the windows and peepholes. It just brings bad memories and makes fills me with anxiety. I think I feel that way with my GF and friends, even if it is through text.

374,"F, 22. I used to have an instagram account that i used to connect to people with similar interests, it had over 2k followers, and I had made quite a few friends on there. My family is dysfunctional and I get beaten at home, so this really was my only outlet. Recently, my ex decided to go full-on vendetta against me, and publicly posted screenshots where I opened up to her about my self harm problems. However, she dragged these out of context and said I ""was doing this to manipulate her"", along with some other accusations including, but not limited to: saying I sexually assaulted her, forced some kind of rape fetish on her, got drunk all the time, made out with other girls in front of her. None of these accusations are true, and I have counterevidence for most of these, but I'm too much of a fucking doormat to go up against it.

Even though the only 'evidence' she really had were screenshots where I opened up to her about my private problems, everyone believed in it, and I'm suddenly a rapist and a manipulator. I can't go in against it even if I shared counterevidence, because when we were together, my ex took nudes of me without my consent and might post these online as well. In an attempt to damage control this whole thing, I dropped care about my own privacy and revealed that said self harm screenshots come from a time where my brother had gone missing and my grandpa had recently died, but this backfired too, because people started telling me it was sweet karma, called me a crazy bitch due to my dysfunctional family, and told me to hit an artery next time I cut. My ex also responded to this (publicly), saying that my family being dysfunctional doesn't matter to her, and that that was, according to her, exactly the reason I ""manipulated"" her.

I have deleted my account now, but a lot of former friends on there, whom I also used to meet up with IRL, are now disgusted by me.

377,"Hi r/Advice,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 23 year old, living in France and currently doing a master's in Political Science (Intl Security / Defense spec).

As far as I can remember, I always loved manipulating physical things and designing. This is linked to my type of thinking which is space / 3D oriented. Naturally, I've always loved architecture and urban planning.

I never had good grades and in high school, I used to smoke a lot of weed, not go to class and I barely got the diploma. This was way insufficient to get into an Architecture school here, so I never tried.

Nonetheless, I was good at languages and economics so I managed to get into university and get a bachelor's degree in International Relations. Then, last year, I chose to apply for my current master's and got in.

Even though I have no issue understanding the subjects and finding solutions to security related problems I hate procedure, rules / the bureaucracy and writing and generally what I'm doing. The more I get into it, the less I'm able bear it.

Being in quarantine and working from home made me realize that if I continue going this path, I'll end up being miserable. On the other hand, I'm almost done with school and the sooner I'm out, the better. 

I don't know what to do. I thought about being an autodidact and finding internships in architectural firms / studios but chances of success are slim. Once again : I'm lost.

Don't restrain from asking for more details, I'll gladly provide them.

378,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My parents are extremely racist and have been ever since I can remember. They instilled in me from a young age that black and brown people were different, bad, and troublemakers. Obviously, I've had the opportunity to see the world and I know that is absolutely not the case. I wholeheartedly support racial and all other forms of equality. However, I feel that my upbringing has left some knee-jerk reactions in me that embarrass me daily. Whenever I find out someone I've been talking to online is anything other than white, my perception of them immediately changes. I don't stop being friends with them or treat them badly, but I do make some very unfair assumptions. When I find that a girl I've been talking to online or romantically peruse is black, I immediately lose romantic interest. It isn't something I can help, it just happens. When a black gentleman cut me off in traffic about 2 months ago my instinct was to call him a 'dirty n-word'. I was so horrified by this I cut my trip short and went back home to do some soul searching. I've made an effort to explore cultures other than my own. I've traveled the world, listen to culturally diverse music, enjoy black and latino comedians, and have taken the time to understand the plight of racial minorities. I so desperately want this footprint of racism inside me to go away, I feel like a terrible person. I also can't help but feel bitter towards my parents for so irresponsibly thrusting their unfair beliefs on me as a child. I need help, how can I work to better myself??",30Apr2020,1
379,"I know there is a possibility that we could still be doing online school in the fall, but in the case we are not, I’m in a dilemma. I’m going to be a junior next year, and I currently live at home about 30 minutes from my college. Room and board at my school is around $13,000, so I can’t afford it. I drive an old car with 230,000 miles on it, and it just recently broke down again. I paid $2,000 for it initially but have probably spent around $1,000 in the last two years fixing it. I work with my mom at her work, which gives me extremely flexible hours, but it is an 8-4 job, and they are not open on weekends. So, I am usually only able to work on Friday's which pays me around $90. With the work load I have for school I don’t think I would be able to manage a job where I worked more hours and still pass. This being said, would I be able to use student loans to either fix my vehicle, or buy another used one? I know that your can use loans for housing and living expenses so I didn’t know if I’d get into trouble for this. Whenever I google using the money for a car, it seems to always be referring to using it for a new car you’d be taking a loan out on, and it says it can lead to financial disaster. I just remember my high school teacher telling us that a past student of hers used her financial aid to pay for breast implants. This made me wonder if it could be used for other expenses. Would I be able to use student loans for a vehicle?

""If I said this they will do that."" ""What are they thinking about me?"".

She studies abroad so we meet Christmas and Summer, she does have some feelings and we tried last summer, she said let's see where it goes but I was pushy and needy. We only kissed a few times.

And three weeks ago I had a depressive episode, and I got mad at everything and everyone, my sis, my friend, etc. I had a bit of a rant to her, not about us but a general rant, oh women don't like emotional men like me, blah blah, stupid things basically.

I decided to go no contact two weeks ago to get my shit together, and thankfully I have, I've been working out more, trying to have a positive mindset, and learning stuff.

I happened to mention to her that years ago I used to write short erotic stories but that I haven't done so in years. Couple weeks later she asks me to send her one of the stories I wrote. I searched and looked on my old hard drives etc but it seems that they've been long lost/deleted.

So I've got two choices, either just tell her that I don't have any or I could write one, send it over and say that I found it from years ago. I'm just curious how to proceed. By writing one and saying I found it it'd further the conversation into a good direction and open other avenues of dialogue, but it seems a dishonest and disingenuous way to go about it. 

Alternatively, I could just tell her that I couldn't find any, say I've been thinking about getting back into it (which I have) and offer to send over one when I've done?

388,"Without pulling punches I want to describe what's going on in my life and the people in it and ultimately, how it makes me feel (bad). 

I was raised in a lower middle class household. Both my parents were workaholics. My father was also an alcoholic until about the middle of my junior high stint. I was an only child for the first 10 years until my two sisters were born a year apart from each other. As you can imagine, they related to each other way more easily than I to them. I was their babysitter most of the time because,or course, mom and dad were working.

As a child I was spoiled. I got just about anything I asked for and I was allowed to ""talk back"" without sever repercussion. My mother was overly protective when I was young and until she started going to therapy and working full time she coddled me. Mom would go on to rescue me financially for decades after I moved out. She could never stand the thought of my discomfort and would break herself financially to try and ease my pain if I let her. Throughout the years I had to impose restrictions on myself which included not speaking with mom as much (used to call her several times a week) and eventually not telling her about my negative emotions, complications, and problems in life as she would always try to somehow fix the problem at the expense of her own well being. It is strange to write it out because, thought mothers resources are pledged, her time is not. Trying to spend time with my parents is nigh impossible. Even though dad is retired now and mom only works 3 days a week they are still too busy to establish any kind of traditional family bond. I can count on them to buy me a new car, but I can't connect with them. So, like I said, I'm distancing myself from them in order to be a stronger person. Mom constantly told me how handsome and intelligent I was when I was a boy and it went to my head. I believed I deserved the best the world had to offer because of mom's over assurance, but boy did I ever learn the truth later on in life..

In grade school I had some friends. I went to an inner city public school where 99% of the student body were black. I was one of like 3 white kids there. I only had a few friends then and like I said, it was weird. One of those friends (we were like age 8 or 9 i think) taught me how to masturbate. When mom found out she went nuclear, confronted the kids family and made me go to therapy. Side note: The therapist was a fruedian nutcase who said my crude drawing of a dome structure was my imagination of a breast. Yea.. crazy as mom was she didn't buy into that thank god. One time a kid ran up and kicked me (again grade school) while I was in line waiting to go into the school. Mom saw it (she was sitting the car watching until we all went in) and jumped out of her car to begin running and chasing the little boy around the playground. As she yelled and chased after him all the kids just laughed and laughed. There were many embarrassing moments like this in my childhood. Mom was angry and aggressive. If you cut her off she'd follow you to your house to confront you if she had to and, Little me was right there in the passenger seat watching it all. Like I mentioned before, she eventually started therapy for her depression and rage. Apparently,when she got over herself she found a new friend in work. She went form being a helicopter mom to never being home.. Again, dad, was never there to begin with.

We moved to a ""better neighborhood"" when I was in middle school. The new school was mostly white kids and I didn't understand them. Where my black schoolmates were more open and honest (and violent) the white kids were far more psychological. Rather than shove you or make fun of you to your face, they'd form little clicks and cabals and quietly ostracize you. As much as I hated being picked on in my old school, I utterly despised it in this new one. As time went on my grades went down. I was an honor student in my old school where I was barely passing in this new one. Long story short, I made it through, but just barely. 

In high school I grew more and more abhorrent in my behaviors. My respectfulness and candor went right out the window. Teachers began to hate me, which, though it was understandable I was raised to, how do you say it, resonate with authority figures. My behavior led to their rejection of me which led to more bad behavior. Eventually I was somewhat notorious and just about everyone around me, children and adults alike, had a distaste for me.

About mid high school I finally picked up a friend group. They were academia bound chess nerds. They played Dungeons and Dragons while listening to man-o-war until the break of dawn. They were odd, and awkward, and hilarious! We had a ton of fun. They all kind of looked up to me, or so it seemed. I brought the balls to the bunch. I introduced them to confidence and helped each of them to have more of a voice, to speak up for themselves. They called me their ""leader"" and joked that I'd be the one to show them all to their success. Though they were joking, I took it to heart. I always wanted to be ""that guy"", the leader guy, the inspiration if you will. We all stayed friends through high school and for nearly a decade after. I always worked and so, I always had a place. My place was THE place and everyone hung out there, and we all had fun. It was almost an every day/night experience. Someone was always over at my place. Sure, I always had a roommate (or was someone else's roommate) but everyone was onboard and it was fun. Things started to go downhill when we all started to drink and do drugs.

One of our friends was a big pothead. He never hid it, but in our group there was never any peer pressure so, he just went out and got high then tagged back in and it was always fine. Slowly, each of us became curious on our own, but I was militantly against drugs. So, some of them would head out with him which in time became ""them"" but they knew never to ask me because I had made it clear. Sadly, eventually, I was the only one at the table at times. And, eventually, I gave up and gave it a try. I found out pot was AWESOME! It seemed to enhance everything. Flavors, smells, colors, etc. I had never done anything that was sufficient within itself to entertain me. I could just sit and be high and it was fine. I learned that many of my friends had been doing it for a long time even away from the group. I used their contacts to establish my own underworld relationships and the rest is history, I've been using everyday ever since. But, so had they (my friends). Still, the destabilization had started, the damage had been inflicted and there was no turning it around.

Many of my buds were casual drinkers and the pot seemed to magnify everyone's bad behaviors. Eventually the majority of us ""needed"" to be high and drunk in order to get our night started. Maybe it seems inevitable but, violent behavior/fighting became prevalent at our gatherings. One night, that violence led to me drawing a line. I exploded at my roommate indicating that his rampant negativity would eventually render him alone. A few weeks later I moved into my first solo living experience. I decided to go dry to insure that I could carry my own weight. This is where the learning began, this is where the pain began. Because suddenly, INSTANTLY, I was alone. Within a few short weeks I went from being the ""leader"" to garbage. NO ONE called EVER. NO ONE cared EVER. For six months I sat in broken hearted silence. With each passing day I became angrier and more resentful. Where I was usually the one to call others and arrange get-togethers, I refused. Suddenly a revelation came to light: Without me initiating everything, nothing would happen. Without me calling, no one called. I finally seen my life, my friends for what they were. It wasn't ME they wanted to be around it was my place. It was the drugs and the booze and the games. When my life became inconvenient and sober, they simply didn't see any value in it. 

Eventually I got with my current fiance. We lead a very quiet life. We still smoke pot everyday but we don't drink. But, I'm so lonely. Even with her in my life, which I'm blessed to have, I'm still so lonely. The thought of making new friends disgusts me. I hate people so much. So many judgments, so many expectations. The only reason I'm posting this (and am willing to weather the potential criticism) is because of the anonymity. I went from being told I was the life of the party to literal silence. A simple flip of a switch if you will, and I was engulfed in utter silence. I'm not happy and I'm becoming desperate to change my life, but I don't know how. I see my need for people/friends, I feel it, but I hate them. I know reader, I know I'm saying I hate you too, but I can't lie, I do. LOL. I don't trust you, I don't trust anyone. But, I'm like, dying. So, here I am. I don't even know what I'm asking you. But maybe you have some nugget of wisdom, some magical cure for me.",30Apr2020,1

Me: “I’m done. You always tell me that I’m ugly or fat, and you constantly point out things about my body and I’m through with it.
A while back when you were trying to get in my pants you always told me stuff like “You’re not fat” or “you’re cute” you even called me beautiful once. Was any of that true or was it some sick tactic to get me to fall or you? We had this conversation not even a month ago about you making fun of me or making  demeaning sexual comments. You said you would change, you said you would stop, but here we are again.”

Him: “You’re being fucking crazy dude, Im just joking. Anyways if im not being mean if everything I’m saying is true.”

Me: “I used to have an eating disorder (his name). I am so fucking insecure about my stupid body and your stupid comments make everything worse. I’ll get a little spurt of confidence and day after day you just make a stupid little comment about me being ugly or saying that I have no ass and that little bit of confidence just brings me right back down to nothing.”

394,"Okay so apparently for my whole life I’ve been doing this and it has cause me a great physical deformity. This is NSFW so if you don’t want to hear about it keep scrolling. The thing I’d been doing wrong since I was a kid is the way I’d placed my dick in my pants. As opposed to the normal guy going between there legs, I would always have it point straight up. I found that it made me feel zero pain or discomfort when I got an erection and continued to do this for my entire life. Let it be known that I thought this was normal. I had no idea I was doing something wrong. The downside to this is that over time my erect penis began to curve upward (again I had no idea it was an issue when I was young and innocent) and I am fed up with it. It’s very noticeable when I am in the bedroom with someone and doesn’t cause any issues during sex, however my partners could never exactly put it into their mouth due to the upward angle. This is an issue that I’ll have to deal with my entire life. My last partner stated (not in anger or to hurt me) that I have a “weird dick” and this message is pretty much to tell anyone out there to help their kids out with situations like these. Let them know what they’re supposed to do because I had no one to give me this information early on and it has been detrimental to my love life. Never thought I’d say this honestly.

395,"I am a college student in a 'third world country', and I would like to ask an advice of what you would do in my situation. In my country, it is culture for us to stay home with our parents until our day of graduation. I am around half way towards my graduation in the 4 year program of Accountancy, which is considered to be a very good profession here., despite its average pay. I have my parents, who have helped me and supported me in all my life, and I am very grateful for them. They own a medium sized wholesale business, and they had recently given me a choice: To take over the family business or to find work outside of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an Accountancy student, I have excelled quite well in the subjects, and had learned to love the profession with its numbers, and analytical processes. It would be my dream to open up my own Accounting firm someday, so I can continue to practice this profession. I have been encouraged since I was young to take over the family business as I was the only male in the family, but ever since my childhood, maybe because of the constant push from my parents, I had never felt the desire to take over, despite it being an easier approach. 

This is my dilemma, If I choose to stay in this family business, Things will be easy, I would have a comfortable place to live, the Inflow of money would be great, since it is an established business. My parents will be happy with my decision and would support me every step of the way. If I choose to work outside, I would have to support myself without any emotional or financial support from my parents, they do not wish for me to go anywhere else. I would have to work and gain my own experience and open up my own small-medium firm with the best of my own abilities. My heart tells me to go find my own path, as I feel like I would grow more with the independence, but at the same time I am afraid to hurt my parents, despite our distant relationship. But my brain has told me that what if I do not succeed in my own path? Wouldn't It have been better to play it safe? play it easier? 

I would like to hear all of your stories and experiences, I know I am able to learn a lot from here, so please tell me what would you do?",30Apr2020,1

398,"I was supposed to foster this cat until the end of April, but the owner came back early because of corona. The owner said she missed her cat and was looking for a new place. She suddenly told me that she rented a place for 2 months that doesnt allow animals so she cant take her cat..she asked me if it was okay for me to keep it longer and I wanted to say no because I have to start going back to school and being outside of the house more often and I don't have time to play with the cat. If I don't play with her she meows at 2am, 4am, 6am relentlessly and while I'm trying to do schoolwork or have online class she will come onto my desk and try to swipe at me or bite me. (Maybe territorial thing because otherwise I let her walk on my desk or she wants attention/to play) Right now I give her enough attention at night time for her to at least sleep but I personally won't be able to give her enough attention starting next month/week. 

I felt it was weird that the owner suddenly decided to rent a place that doesn't allow animals and asked me to extend her stay. I wanted to say no but I felt bad because I don't want the cat to be stressed from moving to a different house.. I'm afraid I can't handle her once I start going outside again and doing classes and work.. 

What should I do? Should I just keep the cat until she finds a new place to rent that allows animals..? Or should I talk to her and tell her that I can't take care of her?  How can I tell her respectfully that I can't take care of the cat? 

TLDR; Fostering cat, owner came back early but said she wanted to have the cat back soon. Owner ended up suddenly renting a NO pets apartment and extended the foster period. I don't feel I have time to take care of the cat from next week on due to classes and work but I feel bad for sending the cat to another place (cats feel stress from that).
 What should I do? Keep cat until owner moves again? Tell the owner I cant keep the cat and find a new foster? How can I tell her?",30Apr2020,1
399,"In the house are me, my girlfriend (GF) and our friend (F).  Ages 22,25 and 21, respectively. 

F was originally just GF's friend. GF owns a house and was feeling a bit lonely so invited F to live with her around November time. Having a friend around, as well as a little rent paid, seemed like a great opportunity, and of course F would save money too as it would be discounted. I've been working a few hours away, but when my office said that we should work from home for the foreseeable future (COVID-19) I moved here. Beforehand, I visited at the weekends and stayed for Christmas so F and I are pretty close now.

Anyway, F has depression, and has had it for a long time. She's still a student, but is failing her course and can't really handle more than a single work shift a week, so GF has let her live here for the past month or so for a small token payment (at a loss to GF, considering bills and food) until the next student loan payment comes in for F. We also cook for her, for a period of time dispensed her meds so that she wouldn't overdose, did the majority of the cleaning around the house, went to get her up each morning. Kind of went well beyond expectation really, but we grew to care for her a lot in this short period of time.

Unfortunately, F has shown the opposite of appreciation. She talks about how she hates living here, but would hate it even more elsewhere. She says that the main reason she's here is for our puppy. The same puppy, by the way, that she shouts at and berates a bit when she gets annoyed with him - okay, it's just a dog, but it goes completely against our training methods for him, which we have explained to her explicitly, but of course when we slip up and instinctively shout ""No!"" when we see him doing something he shouldn't she's taken that as permission that she can do it repeatedly. She undermines our training on a regular basis.

F is also really lazy with chores. All she does is the washing up once a day, if she manages it, and she does that really poorly. We don't just do household chores which should be split among the three of us, but also cooking, meal planning, shopping, giving her lifts to doctors appointments and the pharmacy. 

It's really hard to communicate with her. She basically shuts down, makes herself a victim, wants to hear nobody else's opinion on anything - her way is the right way guaranteed. She's even suggested that because we are doing certain things with our dog, we don't care about him as much as her, and she's only giving her opinion to me because she cares about him so much - but of course, my opinion gets cut off and unacknowledged in the same conversation. All she really does is complain.

I'll stop with the background now. It's quite concise, there are a lot more examples I could give, but that's not what I'm here for. Generally, we recognise that the way she is acting could easily be due to her depression; we've both suffered before, I was taken in by GF's parents at my lowest (and did what I could to communicate and show my appreciation every day, at the very least trying really hard to get better), and we care about her and wanted to help. But this sort of thing has grown tiresome. We feel like carers who aren't appreciated, and are paying for the pleasure of caring for someone. We've been discussing this for a little over a week, but have basically decided that we would rather not have this undercurrent of negativity and stress during this time - we haven't lived together for over a year, we're doing extra around the house, and paying for the privilege to do so when multiple other friends have shown interest in the room.

So, we've let F know that in four weeks we would like her to leave. She didn't take it well, as is to be expected.

Thing is, I'm now realising that this is the third friend's house she's been effectively removed from (first one kicked her out because ""other housemates didn't want her there"", second one raised her rent beyond what she could pay). I'm also realising that she's been having a particularly hard time recently as she comes to terms with failing her degree, and just yesterday got a full batch of meds which she could overdose on. 

I'm not sure what to do, or if I should do anything. Advice would be very much appreciated.",30Apr2020,1
400,"Throwaway because my friends and family know my regular account. 

My son is starting high school in the fall. He currently attends a public middle school and has a great group of friends there. His friends are all going to the same local high school next year, but my husband and I do not want our son going there. 

Our daughter went to that same high school and was sexually assaulted in the parking lot by another student. After she reported to the school and word got out, she was relentlessly bullied. Her car was broken into, a student tried to run her over, horrific instagram pages were made about her, and she was harassed on a daily basis. It got to the point where she finished her junior year in psychiatric care and her senior year at alternative school. (She is doing great and thriving in college now by the way)

Now I’m not worried about our son getting bullied because of this, his sister is 5 years older so all of the kids who were at the school at the time this all went down have all since graduated. The problem is the administrators. 

When our daughter reported to the school, admin told our daughter to not worry about filing a police report because protocol was that the school would make one for her. After a few months of not hearing any updates on the case, we went down to the police station and found out a report had never been filed. Long story short we sued the district and found out during the trial that the VP she reported the assault to (unbeknownst to our daughter at the time) was a longtime family friend of the boy who assaulted her. That VP was let go but several other staff members who were complicit in hiding the case are still employed at the school. 

This makes us fear for our son’s safety. We worry that he will be treated harshly by the staff because of his relation to our daughter (we have an uncommon last name). And regardless of relation, we worry that if our son was a victim of any crime/bullying at the school that he wouldn’t be adequately protected. A few months ago, we placed our son’s name into a lottery to get into a magnet school (our son knew about it and was okay with it). We found out a few days ago that he got in. Our son’s “okay” with going but we can tell he’s very *very* upset that he won’t be going to high school with his friends. We feel like assholes for not letting him go to school with them, but that school was awful to our daughter, why would we trust them with our son?",30Apr2020,1
401,"So I'm a 22 year old girl who's desperate for some
advice. I don't really know where to start but maybeI should tell you something about me. I've struggledwith different mental health issues in the past and still am to this day, one of them being social anxiety. Meaning hate crowded places, like party's and I'm really bad at and afraid of approaching new people. Most of the time I'm alone and I feelvery lonely at the moment. Meeting new people is kinda hard for me, since I don't like partys or stuff like that and I'm also not the biggest fan of online dating, since I'm afraid that people I know will see me on there and judge me for it. It's weird, I know. Athing I might need to add is that people in general tell me that I'm attractive, which I don't see cause I hate my body, but that's a different story, and they think, that things come really easy to me when it comes to dating and stuff. Which they don't, since I'm extremely shy and don't meet new people often. Also whenever I actually meet a guy they assume that I, being 'good looking' and 22 years old, have to have a lot of experience, which I don't. I have had a boyfriend before and I'm not a virgin anymore but I'm simply not comfortable with kissing and sex and all stuff related to that. I'm afraid of being bad at it and I'm afraid of telling people that I never have done specific things before, cause again, I'm afraid that they will judge me. I guess what people expect of me and who I really am differs a lot and I'm scared of telling them that they're wrong, or that I'm insecure about it, just because opening up scares the hell out of me. I just don't know what to do anymore. I barley meet new people and if I do I can't be myself. And with every day that I continue to live like that admitting the truth gets harder. An 18 year old girl that had one boyfriend before and doesn't really know how to have sex or even kiss, since that boyfriend just did his thing and she went
along with it with minimal effort, is okay, maybe even kinda cute, but a 22 year old girl who doesn't know her way around might seem weird, and a 25 year old girl might even be considered a lost case. I wish it wasn't that way and my love goes out to anyone, no matter what age, who feels like that, but it's just what society tells us. So I don't know what I want to hear but maybe there are some people who are in a similar position, or were in their past or just have some tips in general. I would be really thankful.",30Apr2020,1

403,"I really need advice here, I'll try to keep this brief for reading.

I've been with my girlfriend for about two years. A year ago her work did a summer trip where all the employees could stay at the bosses cabin for the weekend. I went with and met her Co-worker, who I became infatuated with at first glance. We talked so easy and her eyecontact never broke from mine. That first night we all stayed up drinking and shared a bowl. Turned out our music taste was very similar. And my girlfriend told me later on that her friends ex was a long haired guitar player, which is what I am.

After that she started coming over every weekend. Would even stay over some nights. She often asked me if I would ride with her the store or to pick a friend up. Always laughed at my jokes, and touched me or my hair if we were sitting close. 

One night all three of us were laying in bed watching movies and she made a ""You guys down for a threesome?"" Joke. I stayed silent because I didn't want to piss off my girlfriend, but they both laughed about it. 

Eventually my girlfriend asked me if I had a crush on her friend, I told her I didn't. But ever since it her friend stopped coming over to our place. I never made a move because I didnt want to hurt my girlfriend. But I cant deny that her friend crosses my mind so much. Even seeing her at my girlfriends work and we all talk for a bit, we always look into each others eyes and I feel such a connection with her.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 32 year old male. Currently engage, divorced in the past. I have 2 kids with my ex-wife. My kids are 11 &amp; 12 years old. I run a business that does construction and routine cleaning in a commercial space. My fiance and I make decent money but are absolutely terrible at budgeting and saving. I havnt done my taxes in a few years, have an investment property and over $10k cash in the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently living in a mobile home in what I would call the nicest mobile home park in a few counties. The mobile home is very nice and is paid off, currently worth $20k. We both have new cars and new car payments. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I would say that there has definitely been progress in life. We take a vacation a year and are overall decent people. However, recently I have realized how fucking terrible this is. Am I crazy for thinking that living in a Missouri trailer park is on hell of a depressing future and present?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been considering selling my investment property, my mobile home, and packing our stuff. Gulf Shores AL ... Pensacola FL ... any tropical paradise reasonably close to the mother of my two boys. Just burn down life completely, close the business, no income, just .... reset.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother passed away 2 years ago. She was an extremely hard worker, inhuman one might say. She was a perfectly healthy 59 year old that fell doing yard work and bumped her head. Brain bleed .... coma ... 28 days in the ICU ... she passed the point of having something to fight for. My sister and I had to make a really awful decision. My mother .... the angel of a human that would work her hands to the bone and turn around giving everything she had and more to everyone around her. The one person on this early that absolutely deserved a quiet last few years to live out her life on her own fucking terms.

&amp;#x200B;

The conventional wisdom that we all live by. Go to school, get good grades, graduate, go to college, get a degree, get a good job, invest your money into a smart mutual fund, when you are 65 and OLD ... and SICK ... start living life on your own terms (within your retirement budget). How is this what we are all working toward? A fat bank account and a nice house? A lifetime of suffering and living in scarcity to have a last few years of abundance? My mother never got her abundance. Life didn't give a fuck and was as cruel and unfair as we have all seen.

407,"My adult sibling makes a lot more money than I do (at least double and likely more). She has an undergraduate degree, but the job she has does not require one or use the one she has. She makes enough money to afford a comfortable life in an area with a high cost of living. Through a combination of her own savings and an inheritance, she just bought a house. For some reason, though, she feels financially hard done by. She complains about money all the time. Everything is too expensive and her employer does not pay her enough (she sometimes claims that other employers pay more and that hers is bilking her, but somehow never gets around to applying to any of these (mythical) places that would pay her more for the same job). She has an excellent memory for money anyone owes her, but seems to forget any debts she incurs or see them as favours/gifts rather than debts. She talks behind her friends' backs about how much money they make and how they probably don't deserve that much for the job they do. She got a free car from our parents when they were getting a new one, but complains (to them) about how much an oil change costs. We went on a trip at Christmas that was very generously paid for by our parents. The only cost we were asked to contribute to was a (richly deserved) gratuity for the service staff. She didn't bring any cash. At all. And thus was 'unable' to contribute to the tip.

How does one deal with this? I subscribe to 'ring theory' when it comes to money complaints (i.e. the only people you should complain to about money are people who have more money than you). I just want to tell her to shut up ALL THE TIME. She has found herself a niche where she can make good money (excellent money, actually, considering the education/training required) doing a job she's qualified for, and if she would just be grateful for it, I would do my very best to be happy for her. But she seems to feel she's owed more than that. We don't talk often, and this is a big part of the reason why.

99% of this question is asking what I can do to be okay with this within myself. The other 1% is wondering if there's anything to say to her when she inevitably complains about her financial situation. She's old enough that I don't think she's going to grow up and stop being so entitled. But I spend enough time stewing about this that it has a negative impact on my life and my perception of my own life/financial situation.

TL;DR My sister makes plenty of money but complains constantly about how she should make more or other people should make less. She gets tons of free shit and skates out on her fair share whenever she can. How do I come to terms with this so it stops affecting my life in a negative way?",30Apr2020,1

410,"hi redditors! this is my first time posting on a serious thread and i really need some advice on how to handle this certain situation with a friendship i have with someone. one of my best friends of four years has been really doing something that bothers me but i have been just kinda ignoring it and thinking is normal but i came to a realization that it isnt at all. recently ive noticed my friend, lets call him Tad, has been using me in very manipulative ways. Tad is gay so theres no way of us EVER having a romantic relationship. not long ago Tad calls me and asks me to go with him to buy some weed infused lemonade with him, i agreed to go but it was a very far train ride but i went anyway because he was my friend and he said i could stay at his place after. during the train ride he’s apparently short on 15 dollars but i never insisted on giving him money in the first place, but the way he asked me for it is i dunno, weird. Its almost like i kind of owe him but for no reason at all. and so i give in and end up giving him the money.

we arrive at that far station and the dealer comes up
to us and we get all the weed infused stuff and then we head back to the main station in our city. then all of a sudden he says “hey i just started talking to this girl and she said shes inviting me over now so ima leave.” And i stood there in shock like what? i thought we were gonna go chill at your place i cant go back home this late! and then he kinda just brushes it off and leaves and he KNEW i was upset. I payed half of that stupid weed infused shit, traveled all the way to that crazy far metro station and then he just leaves to go use it with someone else? like dude you could have went yourself then...and so i came home crying and i was really upset. then about half an hour later i hear a knock on my door and guess what, it was Tad, knocking on the door at 1 AM! my mom was really hesitant on letting him in but i told her i had to talk about the situation with him and so she let me.

we’re in the basement and so he says “apparently she couldn’t hang out, it was a misunderstanding.” not until later i realized that he literally came over just because he had nothing else to do. so i confront him about it and he apologized and it seemed sincere so i forgave him, but mind you i never really mentioned the money part, we have never talked about that.

fast forward 2 weeks and we go to the tobacco store, i had just received some money as a gift and i asked him if he could go to the store and get me a stig so i can have change from the money. so he goes in and gets it but then buys a 20 dollar base without asking for my permission??? i noticed this happening but didnt say anything because i have a really bad problem with standing up for myself and having these awkward moments with people. I know i should stand up for myself but sometimes it can be really hard but i would end up being used.anyway a couple of hours later i went into the cvs with him and hes all like “can you get me these chips” when i told him prior to that that im trying to save some money! but he kept asking and saying like “but those are my favorite.” but i still dont buy it. and i ended up not buying it thanfully. 

Everytime and i mean EVERYTIME i would refuse to buy something for him or do something for him he would say things like “oh but i bought you this a while ago.” or  “oh but remember when i gave you that gift.” AND IT MAKES ME SO MAD like you dont give out gifts and expect people to give you one back?? you have to be kind and not expect shit from other people atleast thats the way i live my life! anyway im just really pissed and i never know how to say anything without him getting somewhat defensive or angry. hes my best friend and we know eachothers parents and stuff but there are boundaries that should be set! i just dont know what to do and at times i feel very used and sad that maybe i am too nice and generous.

We continued to talk at every 2-3 days,our discussions were casual,but it was clear that we were getting along great.
She invited me outside once and I accepted to go out with her,it was a really nice walk and I saw that she was visible nervous around me.After this we continued our casual talking,but I didn't considered to call her out.As time passed,after 3-4 months of regulary talking she confessed me that she has feelings for me.I was shocked(even if I suspected that she is interested in me) and I felt overwhelmed.

First I want to tell you all that she it's a very sensible girl and I viewed her as a very special kind of human so I really didn't want to hurt her in any way,confused about my feelings I told her that we should know each other better before anything more than a friendship.
She was okay with that and we continued to talk more often than before and our discussions were getting more deep and personal,but I didn't felt confident and sure enough to invite her outside.Before conffesing her fellings for me she changed her fb profile photo and a lot of creepy and strange guys started to add her(before this she didn't talked with anyone,she is introverted as am I).

She sent me a couple of photos of what those guys were writing to her and we laughed how cringe and creepy those guys are and she blocked the majority of them when they started to tell her dumb shit.
Fast forward 2-3 weeks after she confessed her feelings and I meet with her one day while she was with a guy.I felt sick,disgusted,dissapointed.She clearly became akward and ashamed while she saw me,she saluted me visibly shocked and continued to walk.On my way home I felt as a joke,dumb and I was questioning myself is I should cut her out of my life.Then I told myself that I should calling her out because maybe she thought that I wasn't really interested and she is trying to get over me.

We continued to talk normally(I don't remember if we talked about this event) until I decided to call her out.She accepted immediately and we started to date regulary,everything was great.At one point she told me that when she was with that guy,she was with her mind still on me and one time when she hold hands with him(related to a fear of heighs,not date related) she wished that there was me instead of him.I must say that I felt special and valued.

She dated 3 times(later the fact that she dated with him 1 more time after our first date began to bother me later,I will explain) with that guy,but it was nothing,she told me that she felt some interest first time,then she wasn't feeling nothing,things with him became colder and colder and suddenly that guy got out of this himself and unfriended her.From what I know she hasn't accepted any more friend request and she kept talking with 2 guys from other countries(she was open and told me).

We ended up into a relationship and even if things weren't perfect at the beginning(being my first relationship I was still confused about my feelings and I wasn't sure if it was real love,so she was a little insecure about us,but with time I realised that I really love and care for her).We had some discussions about this subject,but that it's another story and now it's a issue of the past.

She told me about her past and at that moment I was very okay with it(she had just 1 relatonship which hasn't worked) and she told me about that period in which those strangers added her and she talked with them,she said that she accepted just 2 invitations,one with that guy which I saw and one with another guy shich she ended not going to date because her parents considered him suspicious and not worthy.

As I said she kept the contact with just 2 guys from another countries,I was okay with that thing at that time,one of the guy was retarted and sent her totally random and stupid things,pictures,etc she said that it was just for amusement,at one point she blocked him because the idiot sent her a dick pic.With the other guy she was getting along better and from what she said,it was a friend.I was cool with that and I didn't considered anything bad or exagerated,we established our boundaries so I really trusted her.She told me that he began to send her compliments and all kinds of remarks(he knew that she was with me),and that she began to feel a little bad about this.I didn't really cared at that point because the guy was from another country and I didn't even think that he would ever cause a problem.

Just once he really bothered me when I saw his exagerrated compliment and I confronted her about this indirectly telling her that I should find and online female friend too,she wasn't very happy but she treated this as a joke and we moved on,at that point,her lack of reaction was a little dissapointing.Fast forward 6-7 months and on some day she showed me her messages which she had with others(we show each other our messages and things like that,nothing to hide) and while she got away and let the phone in my hands,out of pure curiosity I decided to see what she was talking with this guy(lately they don't talked very often and most of the time he messaged first) and I began to scroll up.I must say that something had shattered inside me that day and it's hurting me even today.I saw their conversations and pictures.Luckily it wasn't something like sexting,nudes etc.

But there was a level of closeness and intimacy which made me to almost puke,while reading those things my heart was stabbed,destroyed I felt cheated.So,what was there.Well,my dear and beloved girlfriend firstly was receiving this guy compliments and innapropiate remarks(like as you are sexy,hot etc) and she responded with things that doesn't sound like she was interested,""thanks"",""okay"",""cute"",I understood that,but still,why she hasn't cut the contact with he if she felt uncomfortable towards me receiving those compliments.Furthermore she sent photos with her(nothing innapropiate) to that guy and he said things like ""sexy"",""hot"" etc while she didn't any action,she let him to continue,even furthermore,the last thing which maybe disturbed me the most,she was disccusing with him some things which I consider not normal to discuss with a stranger on internet while in relationship.They talked about sex,positions,etc.

She jokingly told him that after trying one position will tell him how it is,she talked about sex with him and told him that she it's open to the most of the things and she told him that she isn't a virgin anymore.Well,maybe it's not a big deal for most,but I felt cheated,taken as a joke,hurt,sick.
After this event a lot of bad things were triggered inside me(anxiety,sadness,I can't see her as before,intrusive thoughts).I discussed with her about what I saw and she said that she never considered those things important and she didn't even think when she said them because she never saw that friend more than a friend.About the pictures,she told me that this guy has requested pictures with her(multiple times) and she didn't want to gave them first,but then she considered them not a big deal and sent them(I'm very dissapointed about this considering that she could have blocked him anytime,she didn't because guilt).Well,short after this confrontation she deleted and blocked him,telling me that she is hurt to know how I feel and how I felt and telling me multiple times that it was nothing.I must say that she began to cry when we had the discussion(I was a little salty and ironic while discussing) and she told me how much it regrets those actions.

Well,the problem is,this event caused me to not see her as before(not as clean,special,unique,good) and we digged her past and we found some pictures with conversations with those guys which invited her to a date,that weirdo which parents adviced her to not approach was disgusting,telling her repulsive and innapropiate things in my opinion,I am mad at the fact that she hasn't blocked him immediately when he began to say bullshit and even more,she accepted an invitation from him(she told me that she rejected so many guys that she thought that maybe she has a problem and she said to try with this piece of trash(in my opinion)).

I began to despise the fact that she accepted in the first place those friend request from all of those weirdos and gave them attention and every time when I told her this,she said how much she hates herself for doing that and how bad she feels for hurting me and our relationship.She confessed me that she loved me constantly,even when she talked with those guys,even when she dated that guy.

She even showed me how she was telling her best friend that instead of those weirdos inviting her outside,she would have wished to be me instead.I feel bad for not inviting her outside more quickly because if that happened she wouldn't have been going with that guy and probably she would have blocked all of those weirdos.But I'm hurt because in my opinion 2-3 weeks it's a short time to begin dating others,I was thinking daily about her(she didn't knew) and I tried to show her that I was interested(she didn't picked up my signal),I'm hurt because while she talked with me,she talked at the same time with those scumbags as well.I didn't felt special anymore,I felt used.

Beside this,everything it's okay,but my episodes of anxiety,sadness,intrusive thoughts and despise it's hurting her and us very much,she hates herself so much for those things,she it's so frustrated because she can't go back in time and because she doesn't know how to help me,she often cry.I love her,I really love her and I want to be fine,I want to not be affected anymore,but everytime when I remember something everything becomes gray and I can't look at her as at the girl which I love,I feel so distanced from her and so cold.

We have periods when everything it's fine,but sometimes everything it's messed up,we are trying to work on this problem and I would say that we made considerable progress,but everytime when I remember how she sent pictures and how she discussed with that guy friend I feel again all those bad things and I remember all of this.

So,please give us an advice reddit,we really love each other and neither of us want to end this because,despite of this problems we are so compatible and we have great chemistry.

TL;DR:My girlfriend made me to feel horrible without knowing by talking innapropiate things with a guy friend and that thing cause a chain of unfortunate events for us and I feel very bad

So, I work at a chain pet store. One of the big names. You have a 50% chance of getting it right guessing right now. I absolutely loved working there for the first 4 months... and then covid came along. I found out from a coworker I was supposed to be evaluated for a raise after 3 months, but because of covid, that didn't happen. I accepted a lower pay when I was hired on because I was hired as seasonal and I just needed to get my foot in the door. They ended up loving me and making me part time and training me everywhere, and eventually I just asked if I could have a raise because I'm just not being paid fairly. My boss told me she would try but because of covid she isn't sure she can get that for me.. aside from being underpaid, the way the store is running with this pandemic going on is driving me nuts. It wasn't even all *that* bad until the last few weeks. Our hours were cut.. bad. We are just as busy as before if not more so and we always only have 3 employees working. 2 of us run around like chickens with our heads cut off while one of us stands at the register. Customers are being horrid and impatient and yelling a lot when there are lines when I'm only one person. So many people walk in the door minutes before close and ask me to tell them everything about this animal so they can decide whether or not they would like to get it today... I have to just keep working through my mild panic attacks trying not to cry because nobody can come help. I'm just not cut out for this. Do I quit? Do I try to tough it out longer and see if it gets better? I'm so stuck right now. I'm so stressed I'm crying myself to sleep every night. I'm not really hurting for money as I still live with my parents and they wouldn't kick me out, but I also pay for everything my pets need and I'd like to save up to move out, but this job has started to take so much out of me. I really do want to quit but I don't know if it's the right move, especially because we already keep losing people so I think my poor coworkers and managers would be fucked... thank you ❤

426,"  32m. So for context of why i want to do this and sorry if i jump topic to much. 

I was in a relationship for 6 years with this chick and was always there for her. Loyal, I worked, always did fun stuff and stood by her even though she was bipolar as hell sometimes and would hit me and so on. i'm a good man and did good by her.

She was good to be around and was a trooper, the girl you could do anything with fishing, hunting,camp,boating just chilling you get the idea, She was a dimwit don't get me wrong but a lovable idiot most of the time whom i stupidly feel in love with.

But when i had ONE issue in my damn life! instead of being there for me she was sneaking behind my back hooking up with some loser. Keep in mind this is a girl who wanted me to marry her have a kid, get a tattoo with our names on one another.... Good marriage material right lol ""Sarcasm"" she always promised loyalty and if anything ever got bad we would separate not cheat.

To the point.

 She wanted to return something to me last week it's been over a year.. so i met with her to get it back, Well when she showed up She seen my nice new truck and that i had lost weight and have been working out getting my health back. Oh did i forget i almost died? not long after she left me yeah my ""slump"" was a health condition. i was 200lbs never below 190 in my adult life. i hit 140 pounds.

Either way i've worked really hard to get to where i am and gain back my strength to being able to run again after hardly being able to walk for 6 months.  So when she seen how happy i am and my new truck i always wanted as well as looking dapper with newfound health, lets just say she was all gleeful  She asked me if i wanted to take a walk with her her dong and friend.

I did out of curiosity, i told her about how well i was doing and about the things i'm getting ready to go do this spring and she said she said "" awe you're so luck i haven't done that since us"" among other things she missed,  She ended up telling me her and her new BF were not doing well at all and her life was falling apart around her he family and friends wont help her at all and are fighting with her. 

She was so skinny i mean she was skinny anyways but healthy skinny with me, she looked like she hasn't been fed well. Mind you i always made sure she was well taken care of and always did fun stuff regularly and my family always stood up for her as did i...she never wanted for anything that was necessity. 

So as she was telling me this stuff i couldn't help but feel a sense of pleasure at her dismay and lack of any structure in her life. i mean i would normally feel bad for someone in a situation such as hers but it felt great knowing her life fucking sucks after she left me a man who would do anything for her. i met her in a bad situation and got her out of it and some how fell for her. so she had a rough life before and now after me i was the only good thing to ever happen to her and did so much for her! so it hurt when she betrayed me.

I mean this is really weird for me to be feeling pleasure at someones dismay not like me at all but she fucking wronged me bad for what.... being a good man? and before the dick jokes get brought into this that's not an issue. i was good to her in all aspects.

I feel conflicted, i soo want to get her to hang out again do all the fun stuff we used to do together go explore spend money and so on just to rub it in her face on what she lost on and how big of a mistake she made. i mean i want to go as far as to fuck her so she thinks were gonna get back together just to fucking throw her away like trash.

this is so not the kind of person i am. On one hand i don't want to hurt anyone, ON the other this bitch deserves it bad and i kind of feel like i might be one of the only people that could really get under her skin for once and make her really feel the pain she inflicts on others and teach her a lesson.

I would never put her in harms way or physically harm her just want to teach her how it feels to have your feeling messed with and think you have something good one moment and nothing the next.

Does she win if i become a temporary asshole only to get back at her? i don't want her to poison my kindness for someone who could really be the one and i accidentally keep my guard up because of what others have done to me. though i don't think i would...this is a one off pretty damn sure. I loved that bitch and she did me dirty. i've never felt so betrayed before. i'm happy without her so why am i even considering this? and don;t come at me with any get therapy stuff please. i'm looking for real opinions not some Suit.

This story is ridiculously confusing and long so please bear with me. Also, I am fully aware of how stupid I am for this, I’m not asking for judgment, just advice. Some background info: i am a 17 year old girl, and I look around 15 (this is important). I used to work at a restaurant on and off for a while, and I met this man (let’s call him F) who also worked there who was in his 30s. He was pretty nice I guess, fairly loud and obnoxious and most of my coworkers disliked him a bit, but I like to be “friends” (for lack of a batter term) with people I work with. Anyways, F slowly began to flirt with me pretty subtly (bumping my shoulder, winking, making jokes to/about me). He was fully aware of my age. I thought it was harmless and kinda funny, but it kinda progressed into him asking for my email and writing me weird poems. I naively thought it was funny and would show my friends the stuff he said (nothing sexual or anything, just super weird). I was going through a bit of a depressive period when this was happening, so I found it somewhat entertaining but it made me extremely uncomfortable. I don’t know why I didn’t tell anyone. I felt bad for him and I didn’t want to make him lose his job. Sometime after he started emailing me (and he would see me at work), he ended up being moved to another location thankfully. Unfortunately, my genius self continued responding to his emails and him telling me about his “failing relationship”(I think part of me was afraid that if I didn’t respond he would do something???) even after numerous attempts at explaining how inappropriate it is for him to be emailing me.  Eventually he sent his phone number, which I ended up texting (yikes, I know). This turned into him offering to buy me things, asking when my 18th birthday is, naming his new car after me (ummmm??!!!!). Basically I finally built up courage told him that I never want him to try to contact me ever again and blocked him. This all happened for a good part of Februaryish (don’t remember) and then at some point in March he added me on Snapchat (coincidentally after a random account added me and offered money for explicit pictures) and I blocked him there, too. Fast forward to now, my old boss has offered me my job back (I quit Bc school in beginning of March) and my parents want me to take the opportunity. I’m afraid of going back because that is the only place he would know to possibly find me, and I doubt he would hurt me but I’m just afraid of the possibility. Basically I don’t know if I should tell my parents because then there’s no hiding that I’m fully an idiot.",30Apr2020,1

Well 1, I feel like a failure living with my parents with no job and fuck all friends coming out of a series of failed relationships and 2, and this is the big one driving my writing this, I cant fucking stand living here.  
Its not like the people I live with are shitty people or something, I love my family, I love them all so much I want to help them with their neurosises but its just becoming a neurosis of my own, it annoys the shit out of me that they dont exercise or eat well. If they're getting any real nutrients into them its because I'm the one making food. I'm sick of feeling responsible for these peoples health, and I know that its their responsibilities but it worries me, my mother and sister have fibromyalgia and their lifestyle doesnt help them at all. My little brother is moderately autistic and he's totally sucked into video game worlds, it doesnt matter what I try, its what he does, but I want to give him a bigger life.

I just wanna get the fuck out of here and be a positive influence from afar, I dont want to be in the thick of this anymore but I feel totally stuck.

With the covid-19 lockdown I dont feel as pathetic, I have an excuse to be unemployed and at home. Again, I just want to get the fuck out of here, but what can I do?",30Apr2020,1

My question is; what is the best response to this? I don’t want to seem like I’m dramatic or not up for a laugh but I’m 1/3 females on in a team of 20+ and we all live together for weeks at a time and someone going into my room, leaving something there and not willing to admit to doing it feels like an invasion of my personal space. 

We don’t have keys to our room but they lock; if nobody admits to it, I’m going to ask for a key to lock mine when I’m out. It feels more like bullying when I don’t know who it is.",30Apr2020,1

434,"I hope I’m on the right thread and that this doesn’t get deleted if I’m not.
It’s my senior year of high school and I feel like my world is coming crashing down. It started a few months ago with me not wanting to go to school. I had friends and my grades were good, but some of my teachers were treating me badly (and dealing with it in front of the class to embarrass me). This started by angering me, and then I started crying at school, which is embarrassing for me. It got to the point where I would break down in class, and leave the room crying. I would leave school and drive myself home sobbing, and the school would call my parents later and tell them I left. Through all of this my grades began to drop. I went from a 4.1 top of my class type student to failing some of my classes. I would stay in bed during the day and sleep. My parents would get mad at me and yell, banging on my door and threading me. I finally got agreed to go to the doctor. I didn’t think I had depression or anything. I thought it was just a rough spot in my life and I didn’t want the stigma that comes with all of that. So for the past couple months I’ve been on medication. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, and some of the stuff I thought was normal like constant worrying wasn’t. When I went back to school I felt like I couldn’t get back into it. It used to be that I could just power through everything, even the subjects I found hard and disliked. I ended up barely passing some of my classes at the end of the semester and told myself that 3rd quarter would be better. It wasn’t. I worked hard for the first couple weeks,but I fell back into missing days and work. At the same time, I had a job that I was working 25-30 hours a week and loved going to. If I stayed home from school, I would still go to work that night. I picked up shifts all the time so I was not scheduled that amount, I was choosing to work. I wanted to save money for college and then decided I wanted an appointment. I’ve always been a more independent type person, but the money part scared me. At the same time I was sick of my parents yelling at me constantly, and trying to guilt trip me(I’ll talk more about this later on). That never became the case though because at the time I was 17 and would need a co-signer(on of them). So I stayed. I continued to work the hours, saving my money. I was failing classes and missing school. I felt discouraged when the school refused to give me help on time to make it up, despite me opening up to some of my teachers and telling them my situation, teachers who I know disliked me even. I basically got emails back saying I hope you feel better soon and the due date still stands. I was crushed. I wasn’t asking for a hand out, I was just asking for time. Now that we have started online school, everything is coming down to the wire. I’m failing one of my classes right now that I need to graduate. I plan on getting it done but I just feel so overwhelmed. The school calls everyday and that turns into my mom screaming and throwing stuff. My room it in the basement so hearing her stomp around and slam doors upstairs makes me extremely anxious. She comes downstairs and bangs on my door screaming. I don’t open it because I’m scared she’s gonna hurt me. She’s never hit me other than slam me once a couple months ago, but just the thought of it is what gets me the most. Today she came down to my room and took my door knob off and threw it across the room, then denied she threw anything. She tells me to get an appointment, then says if I leave she’ll take my car (she paid for) and cut off my medication. I’m fine with paying for these things, like my own phone bill etc, if I’m on my own, but I can’t afford medication. She also brings up how much my weekly councilimg was, and how much money I have been wasting her with all of my medication and help. She brought this up before and I stopped going to them in hopes she would stop. Money talk like this makes me anxious and worry a lot. She has also threatened to go to my work and tell them about what is going on and making them not schedule me anymore. In the past she made me take two weeks of by making me bring my manager a medical absence paper from my doctor. I broke down crying at work and said I just couldn’t talk about it at the time. No one at work knows about any of this except for 3 of my extremely close coworkers and friends. Everyone at work thinks I’m happy go lucky about everything, and I wouldn’t want the stigma of depression and anxiety around me. I love working because I genuinely love people and those that I work with. I also like one of my coworkers and I fear that between my mom taking and the stigma of it all it would change how he looks at me if he was to find out. 
Today was a turning point because I just feel trapped. I have been trying to find an apartment but nothing I find is in my price range, and none of my friends are financially stable to get one with me. I can’t move in with any friends because I don’t want to put that on them. I don’t have any family in town. I am still working just not as much due to the virus. I have tried applying for another job but with everyone applying I was turned down. I could get a more expensive apartment but then I worry about money, and college for next year. I got back to just deciding I should stay, and then my mom does something to upset me and attack me. I can’t live like this. I’m just lost at this point. Any advise would be helpful.",30Apr2020,1

436," I (13M) like a lot of other people, have been playing video games because there’s not really a lot to do right now, and I just enjoy them in general. I have a Xbox and a few games but the thing is both my Xbox and a TV are in my little brother’s (7M) room.
  
I hate that because first of all my little brother doesn’t even play on the Xbox or use the TV (he likes to play Roblox on his iPad instead), he’s 7 years younger than me and he still has the TV in his room, about 3 months ago he left slime out on the table where the TV is (also where my Xbox and controller are) and it spilled and got in my controller and basically ruined it, and even he doesn’t want it in his room because he doesn’t want me in his room so much. 
 
Well my dad has still been working even with Covid-19 and so when he goes to sleep, we (Mom, sister, and brother) watch a show (he doesn’t watch it with us, doesn’t like the show) and we can’t watch it in the living room or my brother’s room because they’re close to my parents’ room and my dad wouldn’t be able to sleep. We used to watch it in my room on my laptop but because of the small screen and the fact that all four of us had to squeeze together to fit on my bed to watch it, my mom had the idea to just bring the TV over to my room for a bit, that’s been really great, I’ve actually been on my Xbox less, I haven’t stayed up on it, etc. Now my dad’s work closes the day after tomorrow because of the Coronavirus so he wants us to put the TV back, I asked my mom if we can keep it but she said it’s up to my dad. How do I convince my dad to let me keep it in my room (i’ve tried telling him about how much better it’d be for everyone, about the controller, etc, he didn’t care). Tl;dr I need to convince my dad to let me put a TV only I use in my room, how should I do that. (Sorry for how long this is!)",30Apr2020,1

However the reason I want to move out now or as soon as I can is because I'm sick of having to put up with constant arguments that are nearly everyday between either my mom and sister, my sister and me or sometimes me and my mom.

443,"About two months ago I while out clubbing with some friends I met a guy. He told me he was in the military and I usually stay away from guys in the military but we ended up hitting it off. We exchanged numbers and I texted him the next day. 

The first few weeks we would talk everyday and it was really engaging. When I thought the conversation was dying down he would make it engaging again. Then one day while we were texting he was very nonchalant and then ended up leaving me on read (he has his read receipts on). As much as I hate to admit it, when I saw that he left me on read it kinda hurt. 

He texted me a few weeks later and once again the conversation was good but then he left me on read again. A few days later he messages me on my social media and left me on read there to. 
I sent him something on social media he responded and I simply liked it and moved on with my day. 

Since we are both sports fans I reached out and texted him about the nfl draft last week. The conversation was dull on his part and once again he left me on read.

It bums me out that he keeps doing this and at this point I’m unsure of what to do. He continuously posts on his social media and even likes my picture. So part of me knows he’s not texting me because he’s to busy. Am I overthinking this? Should I just stop putting in effort and reaching out? Any advice will help, thank you!",30Apr2020,1
444,"So my little brother is 6 years old and walks to and from school every day. He knows the route very well and makes sure to look both ways before crossing the street, so our family is pretty ok with him walking alone. The distance is around 15 minutes for him to walk and I keep worrying something is going to happen to him one day if this continues. Like him being kidnapped in a van by some pedophile, getting hit by a drunk driver, things of that nature. I feel obligated to drive him to and from school, or walk him if that isn’t possible. It is inconvenient for me but I would feel worse if I didn’t. I don’t think I can live with myself if something like that were to occur, and I’ve never felt this protective over a person in my life before.

I absolutely HATE feeling bad for people that I know are bad and have done terrible things, but I can’t seem to stop myself from putting myself into the shoes of the other person (no matter how bad they’ve done) and looking from their perspective. Even though it’s most likely wrong. For example, my sister just broke up with her boyfriend of 10 or so months because he was controlling, manipulative, and downright awful to her. Our grandpa was in the hospital and he was upset that she didn’t want to see him and was avoiding him. There was also more that happened but I’m not going into detail. I feel so bad for my sister and I’m so glad she finally left. I want to stop putting myself in his shoes. He’s awful and I don’t want anything to do with him but it’s just sad to imagine losing someone plus most of your friends. I don’t know. It’s just too much. I also feel bad for Thanos in End Game. He was just trying to enjoy some nice soup and then the avengers showed up and decapitated him. I just feel bad. I know he’s a bad guy but I can’t help it. I feel bad for everyone and I wish I didn’t. Does anyone know how to deal with the overload of empathy for others?

449,"So this is probably a tad awkward. I'm 16f and my mother does not allow me to watch porn and or masturbate.

I was doing schoolwork one night and this was initially when it was brought up, I flinched when my door swing open and she got nosy and kept coming back, I was trying to find an asmr video, a very specific wood tapping one.

The third time coming in she said ""you better not be looking at anything you shouldn't""
""Like what?"" I was super confused, my mind was on asmr and my first thoughts went to the black market??? Idk
""Any 18+ sites, you better be doing your homework and nothing else""

I can't say I ever officially had the sex talk with my parents and I just kept the logic ""they probably would rather me do this than fuck someone... right?""
Dead. Fucking. Wrong.

My mother since that conversation has made many comments about how masturbation is wrong, should not be allowed and that sex is the only answer... but at the same time shame on you if you ever get pregnant but don't want children. She's fully pro-life.

I just... what, she tries to get me set up with guys whenever I'm in public (only positive I can think of about this pandemic is she no longer can do this)

And considers me a loser consent virgin.

Am I being like a bad kid for wanting to continue masturbating? I feel a lot of shame knowing I'm not supposed to according to my mom.

But I also don't have any interest fucking any of the local guys, dur dur I'm also sIxTeEn I don't need to rush.

I actually had the awkward talk with my dad and he says he had no problem with me doing that, just need to be careful about my mom finding out. Ever.

Should I just not so then I never have the chance of getting in trouble? And yeah I watch a bit of porn, maybe three times a week, half an hour max so if I got caught doing that she'd probably go through my phone. Again, she does this a lot just doesn't know how to navigate anything. Thank God.

I can't even handle a text conversation without extreme anxiety, leading to ridiculous overthinking, meaning if I do manage to reply to a text it takes me 30 minutes to ""perfect"" the response.

I'm honestly at my wits end. I don't want to keep living like this, but I also feel like changing my life is completely out of my control. I'm too weak to do anything by myself. I feel like at this point I need to be sectioned so I can't find a way to get out of whatever the treatment needs to be. I'm at rock bottom and it can't get any worse, so how do I start building myself back up?

I honestly feel like I'd rather be dead (no, I'm not going to harm myself, maybe if I'm still in this position when I'm 30) than keep living like this. My family and friends all think I'm just lazy, which adds to the guilt and the shame. I need advice on what to do when you're rebuilding your life from absolutely nothing.

The only thing I've got going for me is a university degree that I have no related commercial experience for so it's effectively useless from my experience job searching. 

I was subjected to emotional/physical (not sexual) trauma at a young age by a person in a position of power (teacher), that completely degraded my self esteem and confidence to 0 and I've never recovered from it. I have trust issues with everyone, especially people with power (hence why things like job interviews are almost completely impossible for me). Last interview I had was about a year ago and I ended up having a panic attack in my car outside and driving off instead.

So where do I start? What's the first step I need to make (before anyone says therapy, I'm currently on a several month long waiting list... I can't wait that long)? How do I become a normal functioning human after my brain has been wired up to be a weak willed, terrified little boy?",30Apr2020,1

457,"So ever since I was 12 I’ve been completely obsessed with art. Id draw all the time, constantly trying to get better. At 13 I decided I wanted to be a comic artist and at 15 I changed my mind to concept and thats been my main objective for the past 4 years. 
I took art at GCSE and at Alevel and planned to take it at University as well (a specific concept art course) but my parents kind of gently pushed me away by just grinding me down telling me things like “you only want the university life” “you’re not cut out for living alone” etc. So I ended up not going despite being accepted to my dream university for my dream job...

They’re immediately onto me “You cant live here for free why aren’t you at university” then they start pushing me to join the military. One day I cave in and sign up because I was just being constantly pressured to join. They know I have a history of mental health problems but I’m having to join anyway. I do not want to join at ALL none of it appeals to me I hate the idea of it and I just want to do art. 

My parents even said maybe I’ll want to stay in and never do art as a job. I understand joining the military will “set me up for life” everyone and their dog has been telling me that but all I want is to be happy. I’ve tried talking to them and they just fall out with me and just ask what else am I going to do and that art wont get me anywhere. I think its because maybe my birth dad liked art a lot and he ended up getting into drugs but I’m not my dad. I want this really bad and its been tearing me apart for almost a year.

460,"Hi, I'm hoping anyone can help out with any advice because I'm freaking out and don't know what to do..

I received a really good job offer from a company a week and a half ago and was in the middle of the background check process. I currently have two positions, one at a job that's still functioning and shouldn't have any issue verifying employment for me. The other is an unpaid position at a local arts organization that's relevant to this new job so listed on my resume and application. While I technically still hold this position, due to COVID-19 the organization, while still functioning has ceased the majority of its operations since mid-March and I haven't been called on to perform any work for them since then.

Last week the company let me know that they weren't able to get in contact with the supervisor for my unpaid position. I tried to email my supervisor and call the main business number myself to ask them to respond to the third party company they're using for the background check and still didn't receive a response. I let the company know that they may be difficult to reach due to the pandemic possibly ceasing office operations and even though it's unpaid I can still produce documentation at least proving that I held the position as stated, but they informed me that all current positions have to be verified directly with the employer. So I made sure my supervisor's contact info was correct and they said they would try to reach out again.

This morning however the company notified me that because they still haven't been able to verify the position that they can't continue with the background check and that it would be incomplete until they can contact someone at the organization.

I really don't know what to do at this point. This organization only has 8 full-time staff and no dedicated HR department, so all info and records of my position that could be verified fell under my direct supervisor who again no one, including myself, can get in touch with. I have no idea if they've been laid off or what. I've had this position for a really long time because I enjoy the work of the organization, have relied on its experience and references to gain other employment in the past and I've never had this issue. But this particular new job would be the first one that would actually give me the ability to make a fully comfortable living for myself and now I feel like it's being yanked away due to something out of my control.

Sorry if this is long but if anyone can give any advice it would be much appreciated, if anyone's found themselves in a situation like this and how it resolved, or if there's anything else I can do on my end to help solve this issue? Or am I just utterly out of luck and just assume the offer will be off the table altogether shortly and start from scratch?",30Apr2020,1
461,"I’m panicking and stressing out so much to the point I’m just sobbing. 

so when work closed tonight my drawer ended up being 95 dollars short. I was freaking out and I told my boss to check my pockets and purse. he refused cause he didn’t think I stole anything but I really don’t wanna be on his bad side or him ending up not trusting me. 

this is my first full time job and I wouldn’t risk it over some money when I just got paid 5 times that amount. I don’t want to go to jail either. I wanted to tell him to check the cameras or anything like that and he said he will see what he can do. he also said he will check the money safe tomorrow and see if there’s leftover money in there. 

I told him when I started out with my drawer (it’s supposed to have 100$ in it) I only really had a few fives and not as much as usual. he said that’s weird cause they’re always supposed to have 100$. I feel like he’s not really believing me. 

I love this job and everyone I work with, I would never do something as stupid as that. 

I’m just scared because I don’t wanna be blamed or let go over this. I wanna keep me job so bad. especially during this pandemic. 

I’m not trying to blame anyone else either but I wasn’t even cashing out most of my shift. when I had other things to do other coworkers would take over. I really hope nobody did anything to my drawer. 

does anyone have any advice on how I should handle this? thank you for anyone that’s reads this.",30Apr2020,1

466,"Hello all,

I was supposed to inter in NYC till end of April 2020. But my home country issued a travel ban and I flew out from there on March 21. I had however informed my landlord on March 18 that I will be leaving soon. Which is almost two weeks before but not quite. 

According to my sub lease agreement I am supposed to give a 30 day notice. But considering how sudden everything was and how this situation is not just unique to me buy affecting eveyone all over the world, I thought he would return the security deposit. 

I have messaged him twice. The first time he said he would try to find another tenant by April and then reimburse me. And I messaged him again and he never replied.

New York being New York, the security was $1000. Which is a huge amount considering I'm from a developing country. 
 
I initially felt kinda shitty on hating on him but man I'm s living off of my parents' money. We bought a new house last year and got home loans to pay off. And my dad probably won't even be earning anything this year. (he is self employed and in the tourism industry) 

I am very non confrontational and this makes me extremely uncomfortable. How should I go about it. 

Also, technically I think it was illegal for him to sub let the property while he himself wasn't living in the apartment. He was in another city.",30Apr2020,1

I know it's way too late for a lot of sports, like hockey or baseball. At this point, I still haven't given up entirely, because I know what it takes and I'm willing to take a sport full-time. I also want to push my limits for something, and marching band isn't the place I can do that. I'm not too sure about school sports either, because everyone starts in grade 9 and they get good by grade 11, so I don't think I'd be able to make any of the school teams. Also alpine sports aren't an option because, well, we don't have mountains. I'm really just lost at this point. I just want to be good at something. Another thing is, the Olympics have always been a dream of mine, but they aren't really my end goal anymore, I just want to be good at something. Also, I'm not afraid to look up at a scoreboard and see my name last, as long as I keep pushing myself to do better. I do have a mentality that the only person I really have to beat is myself.

471,"Since i was born my parents have been telling everything to their friends, neighbours and relatives. Every little detail, even my problems with getting my dickhead open and this was when I was around 10yo. When I (male) had feeling for a girl I would and my parents what to do and my father would laugh and didn't know how to answer, my mom would laugh and keep asking me who is the girl, what does she look like and then tell me nothing and call my grandmother (because the girl i had crush on her parents and grandparents know my grandparents). And everyone would make fun of me and i would cry and they would laugh and make jokes even more. This was happening almost everyday.

That's why i stopped telling them think about me or asking them, i felt naked if front of my neighbours, because they know every mistake and everything about me. Because of that I started educating on my own and if I had problems i would go to my 5 years older brother, and when I got older I would listen to him when he was going through rough times. Also when i was 3 yo, my brother would get beat by my parents for knocking something down without purpose, even tho it didn't broke. So i would always run in between and say it was me, so they would beat me. I was really hurt when I saw how they would beat him and him screaming. So after that I was the one that they would beat until I turned 15, for some years i liked getting beaten for some reason but then I realized that that's not how normal people solve issues. I started fighting back and I would be called a monster and mentally unstable because I was wrong for doing so. And my brother was the so called ""golden child"" and i was the ""scape goat"". Now i realized that my brother actually hates me, even tho I'm always there for him when he complains and asks for something. He hates it when I talk to someone he knows and I'm not talking anything bad, I'm just making jokes. I've recently realized that everything is a competition to him and he tells every hobby i start or problem i have to his friends. I feel betrayed and it's my own fault, my parents did it, i should've expected it and be more careful. And all that beating i got for 10 years were worth nothing, i mean I wasn't expecting him to pay me back somehow but at least i thought he would understand.

I just turned 18, I've been collecting every penny since I was a child hoping i would leave the house. I will leave it when I get a job but now I don't have a friend that i can talk to about my past, I can scare them off or even worse they can use my past against me. What can I do in this situation? Btw I'm not getting beat anymore, it's just hard emotionally.",30Apr2020,1

So, it was my first relationship it was around 15 and 16 now it lasted 6 months and I just got out of it. How can I cope with it? 

For context, we met the first day of 8th grade in our home room. She was new to the school and sat beside me, we were pretty much bffs ever since that day. She came out to me and the school that she way gay when it was the last day of school. No one really gave a shit, except for me who was over the moon, I had a crush on her for the longest time as a bisexual myself, I only liked guys untill I met her. I came out to her about a week after she came out to everyone. We are both “femmes” so no one ever suspected I guess. She told the school I was bi by post something on her ig, she said something like “I’m so happy that I can support my friend on this special day” it was pride for anyone who’s wondering. I was not all ready to come out to the world but she told the world anyways. 

My mom took it well but my dad (who is split from my mom) didn’t. We haven’t really had a relationship ever since he found out. 

We started to date in the begging of the 10th grade, she told me she liked me the day before she went on vacation. I said I liked her too and we made it official. We had our first date in the movie theatre and that was the first tour time she mad a comment, she said something along the lines of “why are you looking at that guy, you already probably want to cheat on me with him don’t you” I was taken a back. She had never really done anything except for that time when I came out.

Now for the little more NSFW stuff. Me and her were into light bondage and even at that young age we wanted to try stuff out. She would tie me to my bed and eat me out for hours even tho I would say stop and that it was to much. It happened over and over agiain and I couldn’t do anything about it. She would scratch and pinch my breasts with her one hand which always had long nails. I would have long scratch marks down my arm and just blame it on my kitten when people asked.


She would constantly accuse me of cheating on her. She said because I was bisexual she could never trust me because I would always be looking at both genders which was harder to control. She slapped me and spit on me in sex which I repeated told her I didn’t like. She isolated me from my family and friends. She would slap me when we got into fights. But then after she did those things she would always coddle me, for example make me cakes buy me shit and cuddle me and just eat me out and didn’t want anything in return. She would hold me and tell me that she loved me.

How do I get passed this? And start to trust ppl again? We only broke up 2 weeks ago. I’m devastated she was my best friend and I loved her.

Also sorry this story/rant is all over the place. I just needed to let it all out.",30Apr2020,1
474,"Apologizing in advance; this is long. 

A little back story, I moved out of my moms house at 14. I moved in with my dad and older brothers (let’s call the town Z), a couple hours away from my moms house (her town can be X). I’m 24 now.

I graduated highschool at 18, and moved out of my dads house. I bounced around Z Town living in diff houses and apartments and had a bunch of jobs, just to pay bills and survive. In 2017 (I was 21) I ran from a shitty relationship with nothing but my car, phone, and clothes on my back. Days later, I started working for my dad, I was there about 3 years. During that time I got my own place, bought a new car, and became 100% independent. I wasn’t making $60K but it was good money, certainly enough to get by.

Around December 2019, at 23, I started feeling shitty. Having one of those depressive, manic “what am I doing with my life” kind of episodes. So I call my mom, and I tell her everything I’m feeling. I feel like I’m in a rut, I’m soo upset that I dropped out of college, I’m a failure, this 9-5 job is killing me, I need a change of scenery. She says “move in with me.” So what do I do? I find a job at this amazing place, I pack my stuff and move to X Town. No second thoughts. I had these big dreams of going to med school to become a doctor, my mom supported me 100% and said she’d do everything to help me out. 

So I’ve been in X Town for a few months and honestly, I’m miserable. I miss my dad and brothers, who I saw single every day while working for the family business. I’m closer to them than anyone else in my life. I miss my friends. I miss my independence and having my own place. I miss Z Town. I just miss everything about it.

My goal for moving to X Town was to live with my mom long enough to get through college. My new awesome job helps pay for school at no cost or obligation to me, too. Which is awesome. Can’t beat that. I got accepted into an amazing school, but not the program I wanted. It’s utterly discouraging, and I feel like that’s the universes way of telling me that it wasn’t my true calling. I’ve gotten soo depressed, I don’t even know what I want to do with my life anymore.

Due to covid, school is out for my little sisters who also live here with our mom. Mom works M-F and I work weekend nights. Sometimes I pick up extra days here &amp; there. We work opposite schedules, so I babysit during the week. I don’t have a problem with that, I love my sisters like they’re my own kids. I know she needs the help, and this way she doesn’t have to spend money on a babysitter. I just always get comments made to me like “oh you slept all day?” because sometimes I sleep till 12-1pm, 3pm at the latest. But I also work 7pm-7am, so I can’t help it. I understand the frustration, but this is a new job. My sleep schedule is still whack from the transition, and I’m working on balancing everything. So basically during the week, I babysit 2 pre teens. I clean, I cook, I grocery shop, I do laundry. That’s it.

My mom and her husband argue about everything. They argue about my sisters, eachother, money, the color of the sky; you name it, they’re fighting about it. One of them always tries to pull me in the middle of it, and it’s frustrating. I don’t want any part in it. Her husband also has this weird thing about my dad. He likes to talk about him all the time and it pisses me off to no end. It’s not always bad, but it’s just weird.

My mom is also overbearing. I love her soo much, I would give my last breath to that woman. But I cannot stand being babied, being watched, being told I can and cannot do things. I understand that I live in her house, and I respect that but when I need to go to the grocery store, or I talk about planning a trip, or I just want to do anything, she is always on top of me telling me “No.” For example; when I first moved, I agreed to go to the bar and catch up with some old friends. She straight up told me no. I had to lie and tell her it was a work thing. I felt soo guilty, I later told her the truth and she gave me hell. 

I really want to move back to Z Town. I’ve visited 2 times since moving, (after arguing with my mom about it and her nearly snatching my keys from me) and I just bawl my eyes out on the drive back to X Town. I always make excuses to stay another day, or I’ll squeeze in an extra hour of time by telling her, “oh (blank) wants to hang out for a bit,” or “Dad needs my help really fast,” just because I don’t want to leave.
I feel soo trapped, and just lonely. I feel like I don’t belong here and that I’m in their way. I feel like I’ve disrupted their lives, and their little family dynamic. I just don’t feel at home here. On top of being treated like I’m 12.

I have the upmost respect for my mother, and I do everything I can to pull my weight around here. I pay all of my own bills, gas, food, everything. I cook for everyone as often as I can, I clean, I do everything I can for my sisters, I try to be respectful and do what my mom wants or needs me to do. I just can’t keep crying myself to sleep because I miss my old life. Even worse; I find myself to be hypersensitive now. And that’s just not me. I’m usually cool as a cucumber and super non confrontational, but I find myself snapping at everyone or being short for no reason. Then I wander to my room and cry about it.

Tonight I found out I got accepted into the college in Z Town, and I can start class in August. If I move back to Z Town, and go to college there, I can keep my awesome job. The drive is only about an hour, and it’s just 2 days a week. I can feel normal again. Plus, I have several options when it comes to living spaces and roommates. I even make the same amount of money as I did working my old 9-5 at the family business. But I even feel like garbage for applying to that school. I get sick with guilt because I haven’t told my mom, because I’m afraid of how she will react.

I just don’t want to crush my moms heart. We had a small discussion about me wanting to move back, and all she did was roll her eyes and yell “no, you’re NOT.” She’s not easy to reason with. She wants me to stay and go to college here to make something of myself, which I’m very thankful for, but some days I can’t even manage to take a shower or eat. I feel like if I do go to college here in X Town I won’t even care to go to class because I didn’t get into the program I wanted, and I’ll just drop out again. I feel no motivation anymore.

I don’t want to sound selfish and entitled, because she has done more for me now then she has my entire life. I’m grateful and I really do take every opportunity to thank her, and show her. I feel like she may be trying to make up for lost time, and I have mixed feelings about that. I see her do things for my little sisters that I would have killed for at their age, and it kind of hurts. I know I’m a grown woman, but seeing your mom be a completely different mom to someone else is rough. Although, she has matured and done a complete 180° since my sisters came into the picture, and I’m soo happy to see that. I love that for them, because they deserve it. But at the same time, it upsets me a bit. And I feel selfish and guilty for even thinking that way. I want the best for my little sisters, and who am I to take that from them? Of course, I’ve never expressed any of those feelings. And I never would. I couldn’t.

I’m depressed, I know I am. I feel worthless, and I cry any time I’m alone. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I don’t want to break my moms heart, but I also want to be happy for myself. Things don’t feel “normal” for me, and I just wanna feel normal.
Typing this out and reading it back makes me feel soo selfish. I feel terrible for even considering moving back to Z Town and upsetting my mom in doing so. I’m just not happy here.
And trust me, I don’t need to hear “You should have thought about it before you moved,” and so on. I know. Hindsight is 20/20. And the grass is always greener.

475,"Long story short; im a 23 year old single guy. Grew up as an only child, never had much for friendships, relationships and was always alone. Adopted parents were only there for me for things i need and the type of conversations we ever had was things such as ""what time do i pick you up?""

Thinking back; there was nothing there except surface level contact between my parents and i. Like a corporate meeting with your bosses at work. It's really impacted me in forming connections with people and even relationships. Then i found out last year i was adopted on accident when a cousin from out of town came for a family funeral and told me thinking i already knew the truth. My sense of self.. just shattered with the puzzle pieces coming together.

The man i always thought was my uncle is my biological father. He is my adopted dad's older brother and lives out of state so i only ever seen him around once in a long while for family functions. Now it made sense why my a-mother never had any pregnancy photos, why my family treated me differently and why i always felt out of place for some reason. Knowing i was adopted decades ago would have helped me sort these feelings out but now it just sits with me and i dont know how to deal with it. My identity was hidden from me by my entire family who decided that i should just live my life being only half of myself. It's cruel, it's control, it's manipulation and it's WRONG!

Its been a year now and i just cant seem to let go of this overwhelming sense of resentment and anger. I hate everybody in my family. Everybody lied to me. My cousins, my aunts, my uncles, my adopted and biological parents, my biological siblings and even my grandparents who are dead. Not 1 person has ever tried to help me get through this and ask me if im okay. Not 1 person has took my side and they all proved me right by lying to me. They all say the same shit, ""it wasn't my place to tell you"" or ""we dont want you to be mad."" And not 1 person has ever apologized to me or offer me any sympathy, empathy and compassion.

I find more comfort in writing my story out to strangers on the web than to talk to my own selfish backward minded family. I dont even talk to any of my family anymore if i dont need to. All i hope for is the day where i can truly be free of them all comes soon when i move far far away. Any advice?",30Apr2020,1

477,"My housemate (f24) and I (f24) met on facebook two months ago on a housing group and decided to move in together. We were essentially looking for the same thing and we thought we were a good match. Spoiler, we were not. 

 She seemed very cool to begin with, but it quickly went down hill. We're just too different, and due to the corona situation, and all sorts of different rules she wanted to implement and straight out fucked up attitude; ""her tv ergo she should have the priority even if I watched something"", ""no visitors or ons or dates (prior to corona in our country)"", everything separate, even hers and my pillows on the sofas and shoes on the shoerack, constantly removing and hiding my candles and decor, cutting her toenails in the livingroom, restrictions on washing clothes, all cups, glasses, pots etc separate.  etc etc etc. 

I told her after a silly argument about the TV that I had had enough and wanted out of the lease. I told her I was going to move back to my home country and asked wether she wanted to buy me out of the shared items. She said she would do it and covered rent for my last week, but she still owes me roughly $100. I have asked her multiple times to transfer the money before I hand off the keys on Sunday, but she hasn't responded to any of my texts. She believes I'm going back to my country and thus avoiding me at all costs. Well, I just moved to a cheaper place down the road. I have a few packages coming in the mail as well and I'm so worried she'll steal my shit. 

You see; I contributed to half of her portable aircon and I'm now questioning if I should just walk into her bedroom before I leave Sunday (if she still hasn't paid) and buy her out of it instead. Which means walking into her room take her aircon, leave 100$ (as the aircon was 200 and I owe 100$ of it). She hasn't been around the house lately as we're not getting along (she's a brat and this was the first time she lived outside of her parents home. I've lived in sharehomes for 7 years without any issues). I want to tell her that if she doesn't pay I'll take her aircon, but then i'm worried she'll come back to the unit to ''protect it"" without giving me my money. We also had some other major items together; a shelf and the fridge. But I don't want them nor think I can physically take them with me. 

This situation is stressing me out and it's so toxic. I need some guidance on how to deal with this. What would you do? I have already sent multiple messages with my bank details asking for the money.

479,"Hello. I've tried my best to explain it in the best way. Be gentle, please. 

I've (24 F) been broken up for almost a year. I was the one to break up because our relationship was very toxic and for some reason i kept on ignoring all the red flags.

Some background about the guy (24 M). He was a great person but had very complicated mental health issues which affected our relationship severely. I was always the victim of his anger. He asked me to stay quiet whenever he got mad and then got mad if I stayed quiet. He was very controlling and possessive, asked me to not talk to certain people who were my friends before he came along just because he did not like them. He used to get insanely insecure and always created a scene whenever he got drunk and I ended up crying always. This also happened on my birthday and the next day he told me that he forgot what he did.

I properly registered all of these feelings long after I broke up. Because while breaking up I was confused as to why all of a sudden why this guy felt so repulsive to me. 
I stopped feeling excited about him. I never felt good when he complimented me or tried to initiate anything intimate. I started to see him just as a friend but back then i did not register these feelings. I kept on going with the relationship. 

After graduation when we went back to our hometowns i started feeling immensely weird and wanted to end this relationship. I didn't want to pick his calls or talk to him.for long. Everything got boring and where on one hand this guy was planning for our future, I couldn't bear the thought of spending even a single moment with him but my attachment and care for him made the break up extremely difficult but somehow I managed.

Now that I have my reasons, I want to understand why, when I have completely moved on and am super happy with him being gone, do I start crying whenever i remember the bad things that happened. There were some major issues that should've completely broken me but they didn't back then because I ignored them but now they make me cry and I didn't think they would.

Is it possible that the hurtful things that he did might have triggered my subconscious mind because I consciously ignored it? And when it couldn't handle it anymore it burst and made me feel so repulsive?
Or is it something else altogether.

Please help me out. Any help is appreciated!",30Apr2020,1

Hey reddit I'm Nathan,I'm 14 Firstly I go to an all boys school,well my lover/bully is my mum's bestie's son we go to the same school and he and I were very close when we were little but when we got in 6th grade we grew apart and he became my bully

I never told my parents because I thought it would damage my mum and her bestie's friendship,I was a very quiet and awkward kid(still am),but everyone thought I am very cute(not bragging everyone told me that), so it all started when I was in 7th grade-ish? I was at my now lover/bully's bday party (his mum invited me) I was just in the corner of his room,silently eating cake (cake was tasty tho) as I was getting up to go and get some cola one of Alan's friend(Alan is my lover btw) Put his hand around my shoulder and started mocking and bullying me,then almost all his friends started bullying me

I got wedgie'd but I felt someone's hand grabbing my butt,I broke free and ran out of his room but got back cuz his mom asked is everything alright and I said yes so I had to go back in his room again noone said anything(they might have thought I snitched about them) but after a while it all started again but more casually two of the boys wrapped there hands around my shoulder and I felt uncomfortable and asked to cut it out but they ignored me and started playing with my nipples I tried to resist but they were much larger than me I felt my butt being grabbed once again one thing led to another and they told me if I blew them they let me go I declined and refused but they got very vigorous with my butt and nipples and so to get out I said I'll blow only Alan(I knew he would agree and I'll be out without blowing 8 more guys) So i blew Alan and got out of there but after that at school Alan cornered me and said that I'll be blowing him whenever he feel like it I told him that's not gonna happen but he threatened me that he'd beat me blue and black so I had to agree I felt like a slut that day That day I blew him in the bathroom stall It kept going on for a week or two then his demands raised and he wanted to have sex I WASN'T going to have sex with him but that day he let me leave(i told him I'll start shouting) A few days went by without anything happening I was happy bout it But my mom and his mom made a plan to go to a conference(idk what it was) So I was asked to go with Alan to his house The whole way to his home he kept smirking and it creeped the hell out of me When we reached his house he called his mom to tell her that we got at his house and I just feared my safety I was sitting at his living room couch he came into the room and sat beside me we watched some TV for a while until he asked me to get on my knees I felt where it was going I blew him for a while I was praying that it would be it but as soon as he finished he asked me to turn around and and take my pants off I said a flat NO but I got overpowered by him I had to take my pants and underpants off He started playing with my nipples (and my nipples very very sensitive) so when he started licking them vigorously I couldn't hold it and all my precum and cum started to leak He grinned at me and went all inside me It was very painful and my eyes got all teary and my vision blurred because of it After a while he came inside me I got up and shouted at him,apparently he didnt like it one bit that I was shouting at him so he told me to shut up or next time he wont hold back so I just cried my eyes out the rest of the time From then on I started avoiding him even more I hated him for it Then everything went downhill with him Alan started bullying me it got very psychical aswell as verbal it got to an point I started skipping school and started self harming My mom took me to a psychologist and it helped a bit but I didn't tell anyone about Alan so I didn't get the type of help I needed I started going to school but the bullying was still very bad I confronted Alan and asked him to stop He told me that if I give him what he want he'll stop After much thinking i gave in and agreed that I'll let him fuck me If it wont be hardcore Long story short iv been having sex with Alan 4 times a week at minimum for 2 years it is getting very long and idk if anyone even read it for this long I want him to stop but also not stop at the same time I started loving him too but I do not seek any sexual desires from him I do not like being fucked like a slut I feel like a whore every time we have sex The worst of all the bullying is still going on,he still mocks me and calls me a whore infront of his friends He also have photos of me sucking him me getting fucked from behind and the worst of all is of my face when he was squeezing my nipples and my expressions like I was liking it(my tongue a little out,salvia leaking from side of my mouth,my eyes puffy etc) some videos of me moaning and all his friends have seen those photos and videos so it becomes even more embarrassing  
I feel guilty to have sex with him and also about being gay,My parents will be disgusted if they find out about it and also my parents are very religious so it doesn't help But I do like Alan just is that I dont want to get fucked and at least not get fucked every day at weird places

Please anyone give me some advice

484,"I just turned 16 about two months ago. Around mid 2018 when I basically dropped out of school I lost all ability to talk to anybody. The weird thing though, and I am not trying to brag or whatever I’m just trying to get answers, I was popular, very popular. I could talk to girls without a care in the world and things would just come to me ( words) without putting any thought into it. I was the funniest person you ever knew (maybe not that funny but u get the point) I wasn’t super social but I  did have plenty of friends. At the end of 8th grade I got ISS on the last two days and I didn’t show up for the first iss day. That was my last straw for the school on missing class and they were going to somehow get my mom in trouble for me not going so she decided to pull me out and homeschool me.   
As I said before I wasn’t super social so I was alright with being alone a lot but I continued to text people/ FaceTime whatever. I’d say 4-5 months in i was basically forgot about and I also decided to Stop texting people first. Nobody really texted or called anymore, whatever, I never cared to have many friends anyways. 8-10 months in (prolly a year ago) I couldn’t even text a random ass person online without the fear of them judging me. I can’t think of words to say when people talk to me. I’m very good at “Yea” “yes” “no” now atleast. How can this be?? I just don’t understand it. I’m going through old messages just baffled on the balls I used to have. Ngl I was pretty toxic to girls but the dms were so fucking funny 😂 idek what im saying anymore but

Today my aging parents (66M &amp; 57F) told me they decided they want to move to SF to live with me in less than 3 years. I was happy because I'm always worried of them living far away from me. However they really want me to buy a house for all of us.

My salary is only $70k before tax. My parents said they would help with some down payment but the rest was all me. Also they wouldn't have any savings left so I would need to help pay their daily needs. They were looking at candidate houses of $800-900k.

This whole thing seems unrealistic to me, and the idea of eliminating fun activities and some of the future plans scare me.

Please advice if it's actually possible to do so, or super unrealistic and it's better to rent? I have limited knowledge in buying a house.

492,"Hi

As the title suggests I have strong feelings for a friend who I met half a year ago. I met him through mutual friends and he was going through a difficult time with his at the time ex-girlfriend. We started as friends and had a strong click from the beginning. We would talk about anyhthing, he would send me random pictures of his dogs, funny jokes and puns and of course talk about the difficulties in his relationship with his then ex-girlfriend.

I tried supporting him any way I could, I would listen when he talked about his ex, I would give advice and my opinion and I was generally always ready to be there for him when he needed me.

However I started developing feelings for him in the recent months but I haven't told him yet since I did not want to risk destroying the friendship we've been building the past few months (especially in this quarantine where it's so lovely to have someone to talk with).

Two weeks ago however his ex tried contacting him again. He was angry at first since it was very annoying but eventually he caved and they had contact again. They talked on the phone, through messenger and I started noticing that we did way less talking or doing things together like playing a quick game online or watching netflix together over screen share.

The message I've been dreading to get ever since eventually popped up as well, saying that he talked with his ex and that he's giving her another shot. I've been feeling bad ever since, laying awake at night thinking about him.

Now I'm stuck with this giant questionmark whether or not I should just be honest with him and throw everything on the table, tell him how I feel and my feelings for him. I'm just not sure if this is a good idea since he just got back with his ex and we haven't known eachother for that long.

I'm afraid he'll see me in a negative light if I do, that maybe he'll think I'm someone that goes after someone else's boyfriend or something.

495,"I am sorry in advance if I have made any errors. English is not my first language.

Hi Reddit. I am a 17-year-old junior at HS and we're supposed to start working on our college applications this summer and I have no idea what I want to do. At first, I thought about majoring in Psychology and English, or maybe majoring in Psychology with a minor in English. I had a plan that after getting my BA, I'd move on to med school. My career plan was inspired by the late Dr Paul Kalanithi after I read his book *When Breath Becomes Air*. I also discovered some accelerated BA/MD programs, but I really don't know if I'll be able to be committed enough to any of these.

The problem that has now arisen is that I am not really sure if I'm actually fit for that. I am South-East Asian and have plans of going off to college in the US, Canada, UK or EU. I am a pretty decent student at school and have good grades and a lot of ECAs. But the thing is, I really don't know if being a doctor would be the right choice for me. I don't want to go off into med school and end up regretting it with loads of debt. Money is a huge issue as I'll have to move far away from home all by myself and also need some support.

I thought about majoring in Psychology with a minor in English because of this confusion, but I'm having doubts about that too because I don't know if that's what I want to do and I am not sure if that career will pay enough to get rid of the debt and live a comfortable life. I don't even know what I'm interested in anymore. I am taking a bunch of classes right now to just see what each subject is like but all of them seem dull and boring, but interesting and too difficult to give up. I don't want to end up disappointing my family either, because that would just break my heart. My interests range over a wide variety of things and now my mind is starting to feel like a curse.

Please do ask if you have any questions because I am pretty sure I have missed out on a lot of stuff. Any type of advice is highly appreciated. Thank you if you've read this far.",30Apr2020,1

497,"This is probably going to be quite longwinded. It is difficult to explain where I am without knowing where I came from, so without further ado.

I was born to a single mother; my father disappeared quite shortly after my birth. She raised me alone, and she struggled. From boyfriend to boyfriend, broken marriage to marriage, heartbreak to heartbreak, she tried. When I was a few years old she miscarried a baby boy, and although she always had problems with drinking, it became drastically worse after the aforesaid incident.

Her boyfriend at that time was a man named Keith. Keith sold stolen good and made quite a lot of money, frankly. We lived between Amsterdam and England. Their relationship deteriorated and he started housing Thai prostitutes in our family home; of course, their relationship fractured and was unable to be fixed at that point. Luckily for her, I suppose, she was cheating on Keith with another man named Adam, a try hard wannabe gangster.

Keith moved out; Adam moved in. After a while, Keith found out Adam, who worked for him at one point, was staying at the house, so alas one of my earliest memories is Keith arriving at 3am with a mob of bald-headed and leather jacketed men who kidnapped Adam and beat him into the intensive care unit. We picked him up from a curve in a country park, bloody and unconscious, by the side of the road. It was around his time the police sent me to live with my grandmother for a summer after my mother attempted suicide and I found her; my grandma said when she collected me, I didn’t speak for twenty four hours. The next evening, she said I crawled over to and onto her lap and I cried until I fell asleep. I did not speak up until then, or after, for a little while.

We moved from that house into a house with Adam. He used to beat my mother every other night it seems. I used to run in the night to a neighbour’s house screaming “He’s going to kill my Mummy, please help!” I was around six or seven then, I believe.

My little sister was born to my mother and Adam a short while after. The domestic abuse remained, and he turned on me. We moved together, the happy family, into a nicer house, a larger house. My mother began cheating on Adam with a much older man who owned a country mansion and stables; Adam found out and arrived with a friend, they shot the window out and beat the guy, Bernard, half to death. He also hit my mother so hard that when she hit the pebbled driveway, she had stones embedded in her back that were surgically removed.

We went back to Adam. The abuse remained, until he cheated on her and they broke up. Thus, began the darkest period of my life. I was at least eleven years old by now. My mother drank heavily and was verbally abusive when she drank, to me, never to my sister. One thing that always sticks out in my mind, perhaps as a forebearer of trouble to come, was one evening she called me downstairs at 2am on a school night, drunk off her head and told me to, “Draw her a picture, any picture.” I drew a Grim Reaper wielding a scythe. She said, “What the fuck is that? You’re an ugly freak.”

At this point in my life I was going through puberty; bullied at school; bullied at home, my only solace was to retreat into my bedroom, barricade the door, and hide. At school I was called smelly and dirty because my clothes were often in a bad way. I started finding my mother covered in her own blood, or unconscious from a sleeping pill overdose. I feared coming home, worried she would be drinking. She usually was.

Not long after the first time she tried to kill herself, she got me a dog, Harley. Harley was my saviour, my best friend, my only respite – unfortunately, she would use it as leverage against me. Every time she drank, she would open the front door and allow my best friend onto the main road so he would be hit by a car. I always got him. My OCD would not allow me to not know everything that was going on around me, where was Harley? Was Mum taking pills? Was Mum drinking? Had Mum left the house to go and bother the neighbours?

I had a laptop at this time, and would use it to research drug-dealers, organized crime, and serial killers. It is safe to say I was obsessed with violence. After an incident where my mother assaulted a boy my age, she thought was bullying me, but was being a typical teenager, at least I think he was, we had to move because I started getting really, really bullied at school.

So, we moved. Things did not change. She still drank, she still abused me verbally, but thankfully we lived now in the same village as my grandmother. I was not bullied at my next school but was the friendly weirdo who nobody particularly was interested in unless I made them laugh. I managed to make friends with some kids, who were by all accounts, the wrong crowd at my school, who lived in my village.

They introduced me to weed and alcohol, stimulants, and U.K. rap music. Until this point, I spoke very well, and was quite often ridiculed for my posh accent. I completely gutted it, stopped pronouncing words properly and by all accounts feigned a Jamaican accent. My mother would scream at me, “Why’re you fucking talking like that you little freak?”

I stopped paying attention at school and focused entirely on reinventing myself. The thing is, I call these people friends, and strangely I have an affinity toward them until this day even though I have burnt most of them, they were fucking horrible to me. They hit me, sprayed deodorant in my eyes, made me drink ‘potions’. I just wanted to fit in truthfully, I just wanted some friends.

By the age of 17 their ridicule had largely stopped, and I was an accepted member of the group. We smoked together, drank together, and grew up with one another. Tyler and Nathan were my best friends. However, my obsession with criminality grew, as did my distance from my mother who became scornful and vengeful; she would frequently kick me out in the early hours of the morning in the coldest of winters to punish me.

I became obsessed with a group of Somali drug dealers from a local city. I attended a college there, as it was the closest, and ended up meeting one who’s name was Sicko. Sicko took me under his wing, I am not sure why frankly, and introduced me to the world of crack cocaine.

Two years later I had a £2,000.00 a day drug phone. I was scarred from being stabbed seventeen times all over my body and was a feared and respected member of a Somali drug gang. My old village friends were scared of me and scarcely spoke to me, fearing my new friends.

I ended up in prison in the summer of 2016. I spent over two years in prison. Nobody wrote to me or sent me money, I had no visits, I was by all accounts completely forgotten. I came home to nothing in September 2018. A hostel room and £1,000 I had saved in prison. Two years later, I still have no job. I have a flat and a girlfriend. I have no motivation, no words, no voice, just trauma. I am incredibly lazy. I have no friends, nobody calls me, nobody cares, nobody knows I exist. I haven’t spoken to my mother in many years, nor my sister, however she does sometimes get in touch to ask for money. I’m unemployed, and frankly, feel I will be dead before I reach thirty, whether by my own hand or by somebody else’s. A lot of people want to kill me for my sins against them as a gang-member; I am a marked man who does not care to hide.

Tl;dr a convicted felon, no life, no job, no experience in anything other than misery. What the fuck do I do? I’m close to ending it all, man, seriously.",30Apr2020,1

499," So a few months ago I made my first ""adult"" purchase and bought a brand new 2020 car. I paid a significant amount as a down payment and was told the amount I would then have to pay per month. I knew going in to this I would have times where I had extra money and hoped to pay it towards the principle, so I would pay less money in interest in the long run. I assumed this was a normal thing.

I was wrong, for the last 3 months I have been trying to figure out how to do it, the online portal where I pay is very basic and there is no clear way to pay towards the principle. I have called the bank and talked to someone about 3 different times now, each time the person told me a new way to do it and each time it did not work. I emailed them next and was recommended to go in to a branch in person to sort this out.

So I did that and went in to a branch to talk to somebody. This was like a foreign concept to the lady I was talking to, apparently not many people pay towards their car loan except for the minimum amount due every month. Eventually she came up with a plan and said I had to pay the money on the exact day the bill was due, and that any extra money I payed on top of the minimum monthly payment would automatically go to the principle. This did also not work and the money went toward my next monthly payment which has happened like 3 times now.

I am totally lost on what to do, it is amazing how much time I have spent trying to figure this out and have gotten nowhere. Does anybody else pay money towards their principle of their car loan?  Is what I'm trying to do even possible? I mean I get banks would want customers to pay interest so they make the extra money but I never imagined it would be this difficult, Any help is appreciated.",30Apr2020,1

I don’t mean to crap on the asexuality sub but going on there feels like they try to give an individual label to every single person on there.

Reason I’m posting here is because I wanna know if others relate to some questions:

- Do you find girls hotter with clothes on/skirts/yoga pants.
- When you look at the opposite sex do you think; ‘oh they are so hot I wanna have sex with them’, or ‘wow they are hot I wanna touch them up/get off to them.
- if you haven’t ever had sex, how on earth are you meant to picture having sex with others?

Like I definitely find girls hot and get crushes, but sex isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when I look at them, and I don’t know if this is because I’m a damn asexual gimp or if this is just normal because I don’t know what to expect from sex because I still haven’t done it before.

Abit of a backstory... I was physiclly and mentally tortured by my parents since i can remember. Hanged, chocked, whipped, burned, toe breaking etc. I had come to a conclusion that is break contact once i move out. But i met this girl, and made me overcome my fear, was there for me for every moment. Even if i am socially inexperienced because i never was allowed to have a social life. It was literly school and back home. So i never knew normal things.

But she stood up with me.

After i left my family the relationship went smoother, but wasnt that great also. Because of my insecurities and social problems. I didnt know what was right and wrong in some cases.

I made alot of mistakes without intention to do harm.
So we broke up a while ago. I felt really bad for a while, like a looong period of time. But i found out she had feelings for me still. I talked about it to pshyciatrist about her, my regrets and happy memories. She suggested to write an old fashioned letter and write everything i wanted. I wrote My regrets and thanked her for being the friend, girlfriend and family i never had.

I didnt make it to long only 1 page because i didnt want the reader to get tierd of reading. 

I did not realise what i have done just after the breakup. I didnt realise she was hurt because of me. I think about her everyday. People tell me to keep myself busy and move on. But i know this is the girl, no one else can compare. I want to let her know that i have gotten better but not (great) because i know i will do more mistakes and learn from them. It is the part of learning and growing up. 

I wrote to her and asked if i could call her. But she didnt respond, me as i know she has Still feelings for me came to these conclusions.

1. She is a person who wants an iniciative taking person (she directly told me this always for 3 years), wants me to be more forward and daring and not just text.

My answer to that is it is about respect to that person. I should not disturb her if she isnt wanted to be disturbed. Because she hasnt told me this during our breakup.

2. She has feelings but feels this relationship is Toxic and wants to move on.

I understand that point, but i want to learn, grow Up and make her the happiest. But that is a rough road and a risk for her.


Love is complicated and ive understood that love is like a Rose (IF you like roses) you can be caring and water the rose to let it grow. But once you pluck the rose from its roots it dies after a few days.

Love is like that, if you are caring and helpful you will grow with that person. But once you take that happiness for yourself it Will only hurt both of you in the end.

I wish for her Happiness and if shes happier without me, i understand that. But i also want to be happy, and i know id me the happiest man with her. Not other girls.

I didnt understand that before. Because i thought we were helping eachother. But it wasnt like that, she was hurt and i see that now... When it is to late? I do not know.

One of my biggest regrets is i didnt stand up for her like she did for me. When she had her back against the wall, this keeps me up at nights.

I wish i danced with her, only me and her. Just once...

People tell me to move on, but i can't when i know the Love of my life is feeling the same feelings, Love...

I Keep myself busy with baseball 10 hours a week and take hourly walks. Write poems read philosophy. So it isnt about me not doing anything except feeling bad.

I hope i can get advice from people.",30Apr2020,1
505,"I live in a house of 8 family members and as you imagine it's very crowded. I live with my grandma, aunt, uncle, 4 cousins, and myself.

Normally around this time of year, my 3 younger cousins are going to school. Me and my oldest cousin are at work or college.

Because of quarantine, we're pretty much relaxing in the house. This summer is looking pretty sad with this whole virus.

I have no clue what to do this summer. I normally go to parties, concerts, drink, go to the beach, hang out with my girlfriend etc.

My younger cousins go to their friends houses, roam the neighborhood, go to the skate park, and are just out of the house mostly.

How do I tell them those plans are cancelled? And most of all. How do I make up for it? I don't want them being bored in the house all day playing video games and watching YouTube.",30Apr2020,1
506,"Im a 14 year old boy, my little cousin is a 12 year old boy. He has depression and i’ve caught him cutting and i alerted my parents who told his parents. Side note my side of the family is the normal one that’s not addicted to gambling and smoking and my cousin grew up on that side of the family with a dad whos in jail every other day with an abusive stepdad. He always climbs on me and grabs me when i tell him not to. I’m so much bigger and taller than him so i can force him off easily but i feel bad about it. What i’m trying to say is as soon as i get on xbox he sends me voice messages telling me to play with him and i feel so conflicted because i just want space because he’s so hyper around me but i feel bad if i deny him that because i’m trying to help with his depression. And if i’m not getting it confused with sadist i think he’s a masochist. He constantly begs for us to tie him up to chairs so he can escape which in my experience is normal for a kid but you can literally throw him and he will almost break a bone and he’ll beg for you to do it again. I’m gonna be honest i think he’s gay which sucks not because he might be gay but because his parents don’t approve of that kind of thing but my side of the family is very supportive towards the gay people we know. I’m not trying to paint myself as a perfect angel child because i’m not but idk what to do about this",30Apr2020,1
507,"We’re all in college and living in a house together. I am not on the rent but I help pay for everything and it’s split evenly between us all. Originally my roommates were supposed to do an internship thing this summer in another state and other people were moving in to our house, so I had to find a place to stay for June and July. I talked with my girlfriend and we decided it could work. Now, with everything happening my roommates’ trip was canceled and they’re going to be staying in the house and people aren’t taking over the rent.

I understand this is a unique time so I’m a bit unsure what to do. I already planned to live with my GF, but I don’t want to leave my roommates hanging with extra rent and bills to pay because I’m not going to split it with them. Is it fair for me to still move in with my girlfriend given the situation?",30Apr2020,1
508,"I have a couple of underlying conditions that make me high-risk for coronavirus (heart disease, history of lung problems, blood clot issues etc) and I’m currently living with my grandmother who’s also vulnerable due to her age and her own conditions. I was told by my General doctor to avoid contact as much as possible, and my country is currently on lockdown (as most of us are). I’m staying with my grandma partly because she she goes out less than my parents so I can be safer, but also to keep her company and help her with technology issues and cooking/cleaning. My dad does the groceries for us so we don’t have to go into shops, and just leaves the groceries on the porch and doesn’t come into contact with us.

However, last weekend my aunt called (already on the way to our house) and said she “hadn’t seen us in a while” and wanted to come over. We’d already said no to her earlier that week because her husband is a transport worker and has been at work, and also because I’m concerned about anyone coming in the house at all because of asymptomatic carriers. I explained to my grandma that I was uncomfortable but my aunt ended up coming anyway (I suspect she steamrolled my grandma a little bit). My aunt said “she can stay in the bedroom or wear a mask” which upset me a a lot. Anyway, I stayed in the bedroom and she came, saying they would go for a walk round the block and my aunt wouldn’t come in. 

Later when my grandma returned, she changed her clothes and washed her hands, which I appreciate. But I found out they’d gone into my grandma’s neighbours’ house for tea in their back garden (they had to walk through the house to get out there). 

This really upset me because I made my concerns clear and was ignored. I think my grandma felt bad about it and suspect that she didn’t really want to do it in the first place. However, she doesn’t really share her thoughts frankly, and doesn’t really like talking about difficult subjects, so I don’t know how I can talk with her about it. 

However, May 15 is my grandma’s birthday and I’m concerned my aunt will want to come again. Since last time was sprung on me last minute, I want to think about how I can push back against my aunt if she wants to come again. I was thinking of saying I’ll leave my grandma’s house and return to live at home if my aunt comes again, which is what my dad wants me to do. However, I worry if I leave, my grandma will be lonely and won’t have someone to help her with the iPad or TV. I don’t want to upset her by leaving but I am worried about my health. 

Do you think it’s reasonable for me to ask my aunt not to come, even on my grandma’s birthday? Do you have any advice on how I could ask her not to come? Thank you!",30Apr2020,1

512,"I've never cared for this school, and so because of that i always did the bare minimum to just pass, i know what job i want to get, and what subjects could be useful (1 - Biology, nothing else). My goal is to get as strong and good looking as possible, graduate this school, do some courses, learn about nutrition and anatomy. But now that we're all in lockdown and have to study at home there's nothing holding me back from not doing literally any school work. I don't have that sense that i need to do it cuz there's no teacher to make me. I'm working out as hard as i can because i got a mini gym at home, i love working out and i will never stop even if on some days i feel like not doing it but I can't find literally any motivation to start doing my schoolwork, cuz i honestly hate learning this shit, i like biology but only the anatomy and nutrition part, i don't care about plants and shit which is unfortunately most of my classes, and that's why i'm writing this post. I don't care if i fail the year or not, that gives me even more time to get buff, but the question is whether employers will care.

513,"Hey. 
If you read my previous post, you already know I'm a 16 (almost 17) years old Algerian teenager. 

My boyfriend and I dated for exactly 1 year and 4 months and he already met my parents to ask for their permission to ""date me"". 

Now he wants me to meet his parents and I'M FREAKING OUT. (He is very supportive and isn't pressuring me to do it. He just thinks it's a good idea)  

It's true that my parents like my boyfriend but it took them some time to accepte him and I don't know if they're going to accept me. 

Some important details : his family is very BCBG, they're an upper class family ( my family is an upper middle class family but our lifestyles are VERY different) and I'm kind of scared of not fitting in. 
I've already met his sister and she's lovely. 
I'm introverted and I have BAD social anxiety. 

So I really need your advice. How should I dress? Should I bring them a gift? A bouquet maybe? 

We're meeting them at the end of this quarantine but my brain is pressuring me into making these decisions now.

Thank you for coming to my mental breakdown",30Apr2020,1
514,"So my mom recently made a new friend. I can tell everytime they've met because my mom will always tell the craziest conspiracy bullshit at the family dinner table afterwards. This always makes me sad because it's (kind of)? like watching a person slowly descend into madness. The conspiracies get crazier everytime and she will not stop meeting her friend because they seem to get along better everytime.

I always thought of my mom as a pretty reasonable person. Of course she always believed in angels and spirits and shit but she was always open for discussion and admitted if she turned out to be wrong.

This went full 180 degrees a few years ago when she jumped on the anti vax train. I thought I was able to convince her, that there is no way in hell, that vaccines are in any way even related to autism but as it turns out she just pretended to be convinced so I would stop talking about it. She doesn't want to stress our relationship because I'm like the last person in her life that can uphold a conversation that goes beyond smalltalk. My step-dad is a massive brainlet and my brother doesn't really participate in family activities.

To get to the point: I'm sure you've heard that the corona outbreak is breeding ground for insane conspiracy theories. As you'd expect, my mom bought into the whole Bill Gates pharma thing. She thinks corona is a hoax and she's putting everyone in danger by not following safety guidelines. Also she tries to convince everyone around her about these idiotic ideas.

She's getting constant reinforcement from my step-dad. Not because he believes in it but as I said: he's a massive brainlet and will reinforce her in anything as long as he stays on her good side. I literally got no respect for him.

  
I stopped telling my friends, because I'm ashamed and I don't want them to know how insane things really are. The only person I could talk about it was my granny but as of today she officially joined the club and my mom couldn't be happier. 

I really don't know what to do anymore. There's no getting through to my mom and as soon as she notices the incoherence of her crazy stories she stops the conversation so her bubble won't break. It makes me so angry to hear her talking about corona being a hoax while there are people dying of it out there. I got no one to talk to anymore so I just drink on my own in the evenings and I'm starting to get somewhat addicted to it. 

Did anyone have similar experiences with people they know? How do I handle it? Is there even anything I can do about it?",30Apr2020,1
516,"In one semester of community college 7 years ago I knew a guy named Joe. We both took creative writing at a community college. This guy was really chill and humble. He told me he ""turned his life around"" and  was always saying ""I need to think more positive"". This is what I really needed. I had been home schooled and I have autism and had a lot of anxiety issues at the time. The big mistake I made with Joe is I didn't exchange contact information.   


 At the end of the semester he had gotten a job at Jimmie Johns about 5 miles up the road.  He would bike up there from his apartment across the street and use makeup to cover up a tear drop tattoo under his eye. The last day of our class was May 6th 2013. He walked away, down to the intersection. He was dressed up in a button down type long sleeve shirt and slacks like he had a job interview. I assumed I would go to the Jimmie Johns and reconnect with him there.  Big mistake.   


I went to Jimmie Johns a week later and the workers there told me he quit about a couple weeks earlier. I was very disappointed but felt I would see Joe again. He told me he wanted to take Spanish but I never ran into him on campus.  That summer semester I met a new best friend who was my best friend until 2018 when we had a falling out and parted ways. After a year and a half of mourning this friendship I found another new best friend in a guy called Duane when I began a new job last August. But I havent gotten a hold of him since he was fired about a month ago. Duane hasnt returned my texts and he got himself into some legal trouble (yeah I have requested the police record for his recent arrest too). I went on an LOA from work and had all this time on my hands thinking about my friend and the past. So thats when I began to think about Joe again.  


I had Joe's last name but he is nowhere to be found on social media. He had two mugshots up online though one from 2011 the other from 2012. I recently began trying to gather up all my police records to help in my disability case and I decided since I had Joe's name and his DOB (from the mugshot website) I would try requesting his police records to see if I could find clues to his current whereabouts. He wasn't listed as an inmate in the department of corrections so I know he is not in jail in this state. I paid for the records and they came in.  


Two of the records from 2007 were purged (he was 15 then). I had two records from 2011 and two from 2012. There was one incident where he was pulled over for speeding (60mph) and he admitted to the cop he was taking medication for his ""bi polar disorder and anxiety"". Then there were two incidents which lead to his mother filing an order of protection against him. She said he was under the influence of ""spice and bath salts"" and was punching the garage door lock  and the walls of the house.  


Then I also got a police record from another city nearby.  This was 4 months after our final class in September 2013 when he got pulled over after leaving a known drug house. The officer didn't have a female officer to search the ""persons"" of the two girls with Joe and did not find any drug paraphernalia except aluminum foil . They let him go.

The final record for Joe of any kind was in December 2013 when he went to the courts and ""squashed"" a warrant. There was no details given beyond that and I am wondering did Joe die in December 2013 and thats why the warrant squashed? Or was he institutionalized? Maybe he moved.  But its crazy he just disappeared and as a guy who now would be like 28 isn't on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.  He just disappeared.  


Now I know people might say ""Why do you care so much?"". Well because Joe was a good friend for those 4 months we were in that class. And reading about him struggling through addiction makes me really worry. Given the details I provided what advice would you give me? How do I find out what happened to my boy Joe?",30Apr2020,1

520,"The reason why I gave Florinda a free pass without harsh remark was that I was dealing with severe anxiety prior to going on the medications. However, back in May of 2019, I was able to convince her or persuade her into tapered me off of my mood stabilizer and antidepressant. As a matter of fact, the only reason why I saw my PA Florinda back in May of last year was due to the fact that my normal prescriber, my psychiatrist was working at an inpatient facility at a hospital.

Despite her harsh remarks, if it weren't for Florinda, I would still be on my medications. Ultimately, it is a personal choice. If I decide to taper off my medications and my prescriber agrees, she should at least be sympathetic to my concerns. I do forgive her because she may even more concerned about other things. 

she wasn't heartless because she started my taper back in May of last year because I told her and she noticed that the medications were make me feel like a complete zombie. She saw the observational evidence for herself, and acted accordingly. My PA discontinued the mood stabilizer in October of 2019, and the antidepressant was discontinued in February of 2020. However, as of late April of 2020, my desire for sex, ability to have an orgasm, and ability to feel excited still feels blunted This might be off the medications for a while.

I told my PCP and he told me that since she managed my medications, I had to go to her to request information on what to do in the situation. I scheduled an appointment to see Florinda on next Monday via a telehealth session. Hopefully, I can articulate my concerns to the point where she can provide a solution ideally through granting me a referral letter to my urologist, who said that he will not treat me until my psychiatric PA makes a referral to him, or prescribe some kind of medication to deal with the sexual problems.

However, the notion is that any adjunct medication used to combat sexual problems caused by the fluoxetine but only makes sense if I was still on it. If I'm off it for a while, then it's in my best interest to consider a different however, if I want to see a urologist for your sexual problems, I would need to talk to Florinda the first to see if she can help with these matters.  If she cannot, I'll just suggest that she writes a referral to my urologist so that he can finally treat me come July.

I'm starting to see why these sexual problems tend to be under discussed. since they are sensitive nature, and since some health care providers tend to be less sympathetic than they should be, many patients decide not to share their sexual problems with their healthcare providers. Base off of doing my research online, I've heard many cases through a podcast show on NPR about various Americans who are dealing with sexual problems for several months or in some cases years without even telling their healthcare providers at least once. 

The thing is that if you don't tell your health care provider about your sexual issues, unless if they see any obvious physical symptoms, then they're going to assume that you have no issues. Knowing this, I'm going to do all the speaking of that I can in order to get what I want, hopefully.

Here are my questions.

1. If I'm off my medications and I still have a low sex drive and difficulty having an orgasm, and it still bothers me, do you believe that there's nothing wrong with me speaking out about it to healthcare providers, especially if the fact that if I don't speak out, they're going to assume that everything is fine?

2. Many healthcare providers were telling me several months ago that tapering got off the medications was risky and that I should just accept stay on the medications for the rest of my life. while I do understand where they're coming from and that some patients we need to stay on psychiatric medications and definitely to avoid a relapse. However, I still persisted with my desire to taper, and my PA agreed with me. I've been off the antidepressant and mood stabilizer for about 3 months and I have not experienced a relapse. Is this a good sign that I was right and trusting my intuition?

3. Back in May of 2019, I talked to my therapist about his opinion on the matter of tapering off the medication. He said that The reason why I may be doing so well at the time, is because I'm on the meds, and if I were to come off them, I'll get a relapse. I've been replied to him that while it's true, there's no guarantee that would happen. Overall, I had a weird hunch that while my therapist claimed to be neutral, I always felt that there was a part of him that wanted me to stay on the meds indefinitely because he was more concerned about my long-term stability. What can you take out of that whole scenario?",30Apr2020,1

526,"So a little back story first. I (F22/UK) have been with my boyfriend (M26/UK) for about 3 months now. We have known each other for nearly 4 years now through work and a colleague set us up. Now at first it was really great because we have both been crushing on each other in secret for a while so when it all happened and worked out it felt perfect! The only real issue was that I’m actually his manager, but it wasn’t that big of a deal and we managed to keep it super professional at work. Everything was going great, untill I actually started getting to know him better and I’ve realised now that I’m a relationship environment I actually find him quite repulsive and annoying. Please hear me out, I’m not a shallow person at all. However I’m quite a particular person and especially when it comes to relationships as my first ever serious relationship turned very toxic and so ever since I’ve promised myself to set the bar high and not settle if I don’t feel it’s right, is this where I’m making the mistake? Personally I don’t see the problem in wanting the best for myself nor do I see it wrong to sometimes be selfish and put myself first, as for a long time that was not the case and I really just wanted to please my ex, didn’t care about myself.
So basically, the first thing on my list is he breathes insanely loud, like literally it angers me so much he sounds like he constantly needs to clear his throat even though he’s not I’ll and doesn’t smoke. He eats like a pig, he talks with his mouth open, he inhales and snorts as he chews and honestly eats so fast I’m surprised he hasn’t choked himself. I’m struggling with this especially as I’ve always had a deeply rooted hatred for noisy eaters, that’s just the way I am. I don’t understand how if I personally can manage to eat quietly and not make a mess how can it be so difficult for somebody else? HOW DO OTHERS NOT NOTICE THIS ON THEMSELVES? He also snores super loud, this doesn’t bother me as much because I know this can’t be helped and I can easily put my headphones in or what not and deal with it. Another issue is the sex, thinking about having sex with him makes me feel sick. I won’t share details but he’s basically like a 14 year old that has never seen boobs before and quite frankly I need a man not a boy. I love had a very good sex life in the past and I can’t help but compare him to my ex because it’s just not doing it for me,in fact  i can’t wait for it to be over when we start, I’ve never ever experienced this before. The thing is, this guy has a heart of gold and there honestly isn’t a nasty bone in his body, I just don’t think he is for me, I’m just not feeling it. I’ve known him for so long and he’s had such bad luck with girls in the past and he’s such an emotional guy I’m terrified of ‘breaking his heart’. Not that I’m blowing my own trumpet but it’s just the sort of guy he is, I’ve seen him take 2 weeks off work to get over a girl he’d been seeing for 2 months. He told me he loved me super fast and I said it back because at the time it was exciting and I really was feeling it. But now I just don’t know what to do, and given the circumstances of my last relationship I’m just so upset that I’ve managed to get myself stuck in a relationship that I’m not happy in yet again because im scared to hurt somebody else’s feelings. Imagine how self conscious I’d make him if I told him all of this? I just can’t do it to him. I’m so depressed and lost over this.",30Apr2020,1
527,"My mother is a ''Tramadol'' addict, it's an opioid pain medication, sort of like what morphine is. It's an addictive drug and my mother got addicted to it around 6 months ago. Both my parents are doctors and my mother knows of the risks associated with the drug, but she's naturally a weak and sensitive person so whenever she heard any news regarding her brother's average monetary situation she got depressed and that's how she got into this mess.  
I can't tell you the entire history because that would take hours, the point is my father knows of her addiction and we've all been trying to help her but she as no fucking willpower, we confiscated all the medication she had, made her  swear on our lives and I even promised to give her a little during withdrawal to make it easy for her but just yesterday my father discovered another stash in our Operation Theatre and lost his shit. My mother couldn't buy the medication herself because it is considered immoral for women to go out on their own and stuff in my culture, so she asked members of the male staff and her family members to get some for her, they weren't aware of the addictive nature of the drug. My mum is a kind soul, she has always treated our male staff as her children but my father started accusing her of being characterless, a whore and a bad woman among many things.  
In my country women kill themselves if they get such allegations put on them. Brothers killing their sisters just because some fuck called her a slut is common over here. My father has been living in a separate room of our house, he shouts at every little thing I or my mother say, he doesn't listen to a single thing I try to tell him. He called my sister's brother and ranted to her about my mother's character and now he's saying he'll come over and kill my mother, himself and his younger brother who brought her these medicines unknowingly because my mother fucked with the  family's pride, what will the people say and how our social life has died.   
I can't just leave so please don't suggest that, this is my family. I know my father tried to get her clean but she's too weak, pure but weak man she couldn't do it. She cries every single day, I know she wants to get clean and she has gone 6 days without any medication but my father is being too mean, he won't listen to our side of the argument. He thinks my mum brainwashed the kids to go against and shit, I love them both I just don't want anyone to die. He called my grandmother and shouted at her for the good part of an hour, she's a heart patient and so is my grandfather. They won't be able to bear this but nobody fucking listens to me, neither my father nor my mother. What the fuck do I do here.  
They're both too who gives a shit about pride and social status if you love your kids dad please listen to me I'm 17 I know shit neither of you do but you won't fucking bother hearing. Please people give me something to work with I can't call a hotline or shit man keeping this low-key is the main issue here. Fuck my country, fuck pride fuck the people over here, just give me a solution to make sure nobody dies.  


Thank you for everything you've done for me in the past reddit, I'm here asking for your help once again please help me diffuse this shit everyone is talking about killing someone and dying.  


**TL;DR:** My mother is an addict and my father accused her of being a whore because she's frank with the male staff in our hospital that are all 15 years younger than her at least. Her brother found out and now wants to kill her because in our culture being called a slut is worse than death for women. Many in the past have committed suicide instead of facing the shame.

528,"So I have this this hobby (video editing) that I really enjoy and I want to get really good at, I want to be like the people I admire but the problem is in order to do that I would need to get better equipment/programs but I can’t. Most people who have this hobby crack the softwares and stuff but I don’t like downloading stuff illegally thus my videos can’t improve in quality.

529,"So I have figured out that my dad is cheating on my mum. He keeps this woman under a male name in his phone and regularly deletes the chat. I saw enough of the chat to figure out that he is at least having an emotional affair, if he hasn't yet acted on it. I know it's been going on for at least a year, possibly years. My mum is technologically challenged and there is no way she would find out, that I'm sure. I also have no physical proof because he deletes the chat, it's all just what I've seen. I was able to sneak a pic of her contact details in his phone and I did sneaky detective work to find out who she is.

My mum is quite difficult to handle sometimes and we often clash. Not any excuse for my dad to cheat but I know he struggles with her too. My dad and I have a good relationship. I've come home during this covid-19 period and am spending a lot time around him. Confronting him about the affair is something I don't think I have the strength to do. I think he would completely deny it and it would be a horribly awkward conversation. I have actually noticed my parents' marriage seems to have improved a bit. He shows no signs of leaving her and I believe he won't. When I discovered it, my main concern was my dad leaving my mum and her not being able to cope alone. Knowing that it's unlikely makes me less concerned about it. She notices nothing and suspects nothing and is happy in their marriage. 

My dad is totally unaware I know about it. The thing that makes me furious is that he will text her while sitting next to me or around me. Trying to hide it obviously but he thinks I suspect nothing at all, so he's a bit relaxed about it. I just have great peripheral vision lol. 

So, what do I do?

\-Keep my nose out of it? Do nothing?

\-Talk to my dad? Hate this option tbh but I hate him texting her around me and I hate knowing all this.

\-Contact the mistress? This option is mainly for my own vengeance lol. Surely she'd tell my dad if I got in contact with her and tried to tell her to STOP. 

\-Any other ideas?? Telling my mum is not an option. I wouldn't do that ever, it would just hurt her. At the end of the day, I'd rather keep her in happy ignorance and financial safety with my dad. Maybe it's wrong, I dunno. 

Please give me advice! Thank you.",30Apr2020,1
530,"Repost from another sub to see if the advice here might be different. 

I’m 17f, he’s 18m. We’ve been together for six months and we’re long distance. It’s pretty casual overall, but we’re exclusive. We usually call two or three times a week and talk everyday. He’s a freshman in college, and he’s in finals right now. Over the past few weeks he’s told me that he has a lot of studying to do and won’t be around as much, I said that’s alright. But apparently ‘not around as much’ means ignoring me? He’ll be active on snaps but left me on delivered then open my snap 5-6 hours AFTER he’d already been active. He only sends me 1 or 2 messages a day, and we haven’t called in over two weeks. I asked if he was sure he still wanted to be a thing since he hasn’t been around too much- he said yes and he’s just busy. I don’t get how him being ‘busy’ leads to me being ignored on Snapchat. Honestly I’m really annoyed and I don’t know if it’s more than him being ‘busy’ and I don’t know what to think. 

So is it possible that he IS just busy and still wants to be with me? I hope it is, but I just feel that even when you’re studying it’s not too hard to at least check in a few times, or say goodnight, or respond in less than 6 hours. I don’t mind if the response time is an hour or two, I really don’t, but we haven’t had a conversation in over two weeks because he hasn’t had a response time under two hours and I know that I can’t hold a conversation like that. It’s mostly ‘how’re you’ (two hours later’ ‘ok’ ‘how’s studying?’ ‘Ok’ and idk what to do.",30Apr2020,1
531,"Hi Reddit!

I was hoping someone might be able to help me out with these baby birds I found today. Pictures here: https://imgur.com/a/GSZHp2u.

I found them in the parking lot for my local storage unit centre. I searched the immediate vicinity for a nest but couldn't find anything, and I didnt want to leave them on their own because I've seen heaps of cats hanging around the area when visiting my storage unit.

I've called my local wildlife service who have advised they can have someone out to pick them up within 24-48 hours, so I just need to keep them safe in the meantime.

I've got them in a shoe box lined with an old towel and a small container of water (too shallow for them to drown in). I'm concerned that they need food, however I have no idea what to feed them as I cannot even identify the species.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated! Here is some critical info:

-Birds found in Hoxton Park, New South Wales, Australia.

-No sign of physical injuries, however they seem unable to fly.

-Birds are very vocal and active.

-They were shivering when I found them, not sure if it was due to temperature or fear, but it stopped several hours ago.

-Can provide more photos or details if necessary. Just ask!

Thanks in advance guys!",30Apr2020,1

538,"Hi, this is the first time I’m speaking about this but I just wanted to write down my feelings of the situation and my choices that I have made In the past. I’ve never been a very motivated person especially In school, I’ve always been like this since a child. I’ve had many opportunities to try to prove that I can do better but I’ve finally hit the wall and don’t know what lies in the future. My parents have wasted so much money on me, they sent me to a boarding school (8th grade) in hopes to better myself. I did very poorly and got bad grades and I’m not trying to act like those kids who think a C or B is a bad grade but much worse, they spent $50,000 for the year I was there. You can only imagine the yelling I received once I came back home, and sadly that’s when I began hurting myself. I’ve just been so angry and disappointed with myself and had suicidal thoughts but never actually attempted to end my life. Fast forward to 9th grade, I was in a public school in the US and did again very poorly, yet after 1 semester I moved to Europe, this was the first time I’ve ever been to Europe. The school was an international and was focusing on the IGCSE and IB which as a whole is a diploma program. I will say that the academic workload was much more than what I can handle but I continued. I did mediocre during 9th and 10th grade and once I moved to 11th that’s when it went bad. Not all of it was bad I did actually very high and 2 out of 6 classes, while the rest were average to low grades. I’ve gotten in trouble sometimes for plagiarizing which is my main issue. Again due to laziness and procrastination which led me to doing my work at the last minute. moving to 12th grade, this was problem one of the worst years of my life and I have yet to receive my final grades/diploma hopefully. I’ve done crap, got bad grades and have really stressed with everything as a whole, if I knew what had happened then I wouldn’t have continued doing the IB. Due to stress and laziness I committed plagiarism for the 4th time between the two years, before it was only on drafts yet this one was on an internal assessment and was a final draft, which was found out before it was sent out to be graded. I got kicked out of the program, 2 months before I would have graduated. I’ll never understand why I didn’t confess to my principal when I had the chance, if I did my consequence would have been different. Maybe I wouldn’t have gotten kicked out.  Anyways since the pandemic happened our end of the year exams aren’t going to happen, and I was really hoping of having those in order to boost my grades. Once my parents found out I got kicked out, they yelled and cried. I’ve spent the following days crying my eyes out, contemplating about killing myself and I realize whenever I get into big problems I always want to end it all cause I don’t want to face the issue, Ik this isn’t healthy. Anyways things were looking up for a bit afterwards the university that I wanted to go still allowed me to be conditionally accepted. Yet I have no way of improving my grades cause of the pandemic and there are no more classes or exams. I’m scared that I won’t get the grades I need for my diploma, from what I know is that my last grades were below the minimum grade. I feel stupid and hopeless worried for the future and I question myself on why I didn’t make good choices. I promised myself and even prayed to god for the hopes of getting my diploma and going to university in a different country. I swear I would push myself. I looked at other options if I didn’t get my diploma, maybe go back to the US and go to community college then transfer my credits and go back to Europe. I’m still not sure if there are community colleges in Europe, it would be better if there are. Anyways I’m in a confusing situation, I worry for my future and regret my past, I’m about to be 18 and I don’t know if I want to continue with the future. But I also don’t want to die, tbh I just don’t want to exist. Not In a way through death but in a way of where I restart and live a different life. I love my parents and can’t believe they dealt with me for so long but I don’t want to be seen as a disappointment anymore, I’m tired of being useless.

I'm always there for her when she vents to me and I'm always the first one to check up on how she's doing. But every time I tell her about how I'm feeling she just laughs at me and encourages me to just kill myself. I know she's saying it as a joke but tbh it's really not helping me and I'm left feeling worse after we've talked than I did to begin with. 

I think it would be better for me to stop being friends with her but then if I did that I'd feel like such an asshole and I'd be so guilty. I also only have a couple of friends so I might feel even lonelier after cutting contact with her.",30Apr2020,1
541,"I need to give some context beforehand since this pretty much is a problem due to my past experiences:

When I entered my first grade of primary school everything went smoothly. I had somewhat close friends (As close as you could be at that age) And I felt a state of normalcy in my life. After I entered second grade I went to one of my close friends birthday party, after that my friends mom told the other moms that I was touchy and that I was gay to the other moms at my school (According to my parents I was very extroverted, which I\`m not nowadays, but according to them I had no behaviors which would lead her to think that of me) After this rumor spread around the school most of the boys at my school avoided me and my close friends stopped talking to me. I didn't know how to respond to this and after many failed attempts to try to join in on the other guys fun and repeatedly getting rejected I decided to give up and try to make friends in my classroom. My life in classroom was pretty good a short while since this as some of the boys didn't have a problem talking to me as long as we were in class and I always managed to make one or two friends who I could talk to. But since in recess they all already had  there separate groups I always wound up alone and looking for whom to talk to. I eventually stumbled into some kids that would hang out in a circle to talk in their recess and I tried to join their group. Every time I tried to comment on something or try to tell a joke like they did I would be immediately be shut down or be told I wasn't funny and was even teased but since I didn't have anywhere else to go to and hated the idea of spending my time in recess alone again I kept going back. I tried asking my dad for advice as to what to say for comebacks for when they tried to shut me down or tease me but this just resulted in getting insulted back and feeling more excluded. I eventually became accustomed to be the spectator in groups or to never initiate conversations. This went on onto my first year of high school where at the time  I became friends with two girls in my class. Since I got along well with them I decided to go to their group in recess as a chance to bond with those who were there and hopefully make some friends. One of the two girls who I considered to be my friend shut me down every time I wanted to talk by saying things like""nobody cares what you have to say"" or ""No one wants you here why do you even keep coming back"" but I always stayed silent and felt unable to give a response ( I think at this point I had lost most confidence in myself due to my experience earlier in my childhood with the other group) This went on for over two years and during these two years I began to become close friends with both these girls and eventually made a group chat where we could talk. After a lot of time being friends with these girls one of them ( the one who berated me in the last group and told me to leave) posted an embarrassing video of myself on the grades group chat. After this I was made fun of my most of my grade for what seemed most of the school year. At this point It was stupid of me to keep trusting this girl but I still considered her a close friend of mine. My anger towards her faded as I was fed stupid reasons for forgiving her such as ""that\`s just the way she is"" and ""you shouldn\`t have sent the video then"" which at the time I gave into. After giving her a second chance and continuing my friendship with her I eventually kept talking with both of my friends in this group chat and one day in which we were sending voice notes singing in order to make fun and laugh among\`st ourselves I found out that she was sending them to other people in our grade and eventually the same thing that happened with the video repeated itself. Between the constant teasing and the feeling of exclusion I was almost at my breaking point. I would come home every day to cry and see my two friends going out with the group I was trying to talk to. The thing is these two where the only close friends I had after my time growing up, I never got close enough with the other friends I made in my classroom so as to join their group of friends. This ugly cycle continued for about a year. Which is when I eventually stopped talking to both of them and formed my first group of guy friends, thanks to them I was able to finally be in a space where I felt I belonged and was accepted, that was until the girl who berated my in the past started dating one of my friends in the group until she eventually was added to the group chat. Its been a few years since then and I'm now in college. The thing is were both studying medicine and she\`s in my classroom and shes always hated on my and I\`ve just ignored her. But now since where in the same class shes starting to show the same patterns she showed when we were in school. Shes keeping track of when I make a mistake or something of sorts and sending it to the group chat with all of my friends so that they also criticize me. Another thing to note is that in my fifth year of high school I was in a really bad place mentally due to all the insecurities and lack of confidence that was created within myself and my inability to defend myself whenever someone insulted or poked fun at my expense. I began thinking there was no one that actually cared about or even liked what I had to say and I felt hated wherever I went. The school eventually had to step in and tell my father to take me to a psychologist. I mentioned this because recently I\`ve begun to feel the same way I felt 2 years ago, due to the constant hate and criticism that I\`ve been getting from my friends because of this, and I have all this built anger for her that sometimes takes up most of my day and I cant sleep. I dont know what to do since Im not much of a fighter and she has no qualms with bringing up my past in order to hurt me and win a discussion. I dont hate this person and ive never done anything to her for her to be this toxic and hurtfull towards her. Ive always treated her nicely and with respect and I would never do underhanded things like use someones insecurities as ammo so I really dont understand why she treats me like this, but If I dont do something Im afraid of going to go back to the times where I was depressed and feared for my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this isn\`t a really impactfull story but I wouldn\`t write this if I didn\`t feel I had to. Im finally starting to get the hang of my emotions and trying to be more productive with my time since all these experiences basically made me a walking insecurity, constantly thinking if my friends will abandon me and doubting my self-worth. And I was finally starting to get this toxic mentality out of my head when this happened. Thank you if you read this far I really appreciate It.",30Apr2020,1
542,"I know literally everyone is homeschooling right now, but I was a homeschooler before, and now I need advice.

I am 13, I'm in 8th grade. I've been homeschooling since I was 10, and moved away from my hometown. After we moved, my dad couldn't find any gifted programs that fit the bill, so homeschooling it is!

At first it was fun. I liked it! I didn't even notice how isolated I was, or didn't care. I lived in this world of lax schooling and video games for recess with my twin bro as my only friend. I had extracurriculars sure, but you can't make friends from those.

545,"So this post is mainly legal advice seeking but if you have any advice on how to also move on from what she did emotionally, please let me know! I don’t want her to go to jail, I just need her to go on court mandated therapy and hand the guardianship of siblings over to me. I need her to be a proper parent. I still do care for her. 

So I just read an article about the 4 types of fundamental neglect you can inflict upon your child (For reference)

Physical neglect
A child's basic needs, such as food, clothing or shelter, are not met or they aren'y properly supervised or kept safe.

Educational neglect
A parent doesn't ensure their child is given an education.

Emotional neglect
A child doesn't get the nurture and stimulation they need. This could be through ignoring, humiliating, intimidating or isolating them.

Medical neglect
A child isn't given proper health care. This includes dental care and refusing or ignoring medical recommendations. 

Ok so, I was the result of my mom cheating on her first husband. She made me with my dad while not being honest that she was married and with 2 kids already, she made my father believe that I was their first child. But she was still living with her first husband (and pretending I was his), lying to my dad and saying that she was just living with her family. 

When I was born, she made her first husband come into the delivery and sign my birth certificate, made him pay for the hospital bills and broke it off with him. Stating that he was the cheating one (seriously the irony) and left her 2 children behind. 

Fast forward to my first year, she made a new birth certificate for me. One with my actual dad’s name and all. (Without deleting the previous one) She also married my father without annulling her previous husband. And having 5 kids with my father. 

(Medical)
When I was a child I had extreme skin eczema, she would take me to the doctor’s just to tell my dad that she did get me checked but would never buy my medication as it’s what she would refer to as “too much” but she would spend $100,000 on a painting. I still have scars and damage from the rashes. I have scoliosis she knew this and ignored it as well but only my dad cared for it when I was a teen. 


(Physical)
When I was in second grade until third, my class would end at 4pm she would pick me up at 7pm. And when she paid for my school bus she would still send me to school without lunch or money to pay for school events and food in general. I was in private school so this was so embarrassing. I used to cry every end of school because I was so hungry. One night she came home and grabbed me by my hair and beat me until my face was bruised and I had bald spots because I was so skinny and my skin was disgusting. She said she regrets having me. 

(Educational)
in 3rd grade she was $7M in debt (which got my dad in prison for a little while), she kept on using company funds. So she stopped sending me to private school. she still could have enrolled me to a public school but she chose to stop me. It was better than starving anyway. But I stopped schooling without anything for 3 whole years. When I went back to school I was older than everyone. And I didn’t have a reason why. 

(Emotional and maybe more)
This is where my story gets worse, After 5th grade she was pregnant with youngest sister, I’m not sure if its hormones but she made up this woman in her mind. My dad’s mistress, my dad did everything he could to prove her wrong. (They were long distance) so he would skype my mom 23 hours a day, he would only leave the phone when he has to use the bathroom and shower. She was sending threats to his office receptionist which she believed to be his mistress she was engaged and was filing a case against my mom and got a restraining order. While she was doing that she would leave all my other siblings alone, I had to wake up at 5am to prep all of them for school and come home at 6pm after all the extra schoolwork to make up for lost time. I had to cook dinner and clean and would sleep around 1am. She would beat me when I asked her to stop harassing dad and would beat me when I asked for help. This went on for so long I developed a severe ulcer that I got confined during a city meet. She also prematurely forcefully induced her own labour on the day that my dad gets his salary so he wouldn’t “give the money to his whore” which is so wrong on so many levels. 

There is actually more horrible things that my mom did to be honest but I honestly just want to sue her because she’s doing the exact same things to all my other siblings they haven’t been to school in 2 years now and they can’t apply for other schools because she hasn’t paid their previous school’s fees yet. When I bring this up she fights me. And she constantly tells my other siblings that she wishes she stayed with her ex. This is abuse to them. They have been evicted from 2 homes already.

546,"so, maybe about a week and a half ago, i (F 17) was on a daily exercise walk, avoiding people and generally going to places where i know there wouldn’t be people walking around. i got to a certain area and a clearly much older man stopped me and said something along the lines of, “you look like a hollywood star!” and i was shocked as i 1) never really get compliments and 2) was pretty much in my own world and wasn’t paying attention to my surroundings. he then asked me for a selfie, which i stupidly did because my instincts didn’t kick in yet and he took a picture with me. he then started asking questions like where i lived, (i pointed him in the complete opposite direction to where i actually lived) my name (i used a nickname that absolutely no one in my area knows me as) and if he could have my number (i straight up said no). he shook my hand and held on for a little too long before i turned to leave quickly, i think he said something else as i was leaving but i didn’t hear it because i was starting to get a bit freaked out by what just happened. 

he was a foreign guy, darker-tanned skin with an accent i can’t quite place, he was average height and build, bald but with facial hair and he wore sunglasses with casual wear. i went home and immediately texted my friends about it and they seemed worried. i didn’t tell my grandparents (i live with them) that i had actually made contact with him so as not to worry them too much, i basically just said that he walked past and stared at me and i got bad vibes from him. 

i sent an anonymous message to a trafficking site to raise awareness that this happened and it might be something to do with trafficking as he took my picture and asked personal questions, and i haven’t left my house for a walk since it happened. i don’t know if i should just move on or if i should report it to the police? nothings happened since, but again i haven’t left my house so there’s been no opportunity for something to happen. i honestly don’t know what to do, or even what kind of danger i might be in",30Apr2020,1
547,"I graduated with a BA in psychology in Spring 2019 at the age of 21. I’ve been out of college now for about a year exactly with a degree but still work for Trader Joe’s. I got the job almost 5 years ago when I first started college just as a part time job while I was going through school. Now that I have graduated I have transitioned to full time. I do enjoy my job (anyone who has worked for Trader Joe’s can relate when I say that it really is a great place to work), however, I can’t escape this feeling that I need more out of life. As if I’m not thriving enough. 

I feel that I haven’t found something I’m truly passionate about enough to want to do for a career. I like my current job but I don’t see myself making a career out of Trader Joe’s. However, I haven’t found something yet that I’m ready to make a career switch for. I’m happy for now but I’m afraid of “getting stuck” there in the future. 

In my free time I will spend some time on sites like LinkedIn and Job Monster looking at/ applying for jobs that may sound interesting. So far nothing has really “jumped out at me” where I had this gut feeling it was something I really wanted to do. That being said, I have applied for jobs and had interviews in different fields. The common trend of all those jobs is that they all revolve around some sort of customer service. I enjoy helping others and I feel I possess advanced social skills but I am unsure if customer service is truly what I’m looking for out of a career.

I like psychology and have considered grad school but my problem with grad school right now is I do not know what field of psychology I want to pursue (or even if I want to pursue psychology as a career at all). I was able to get my bachelors degree without accumulating a lot of debt so before I go through grad school and put myself $30,000-$50,000 in debt, I want to make sure I’m fully committed to whatever I’m in school for. 

All through college I told myself that I had time to figure out what I wanted to do but now here I am one year after college and still no clue. I feel fortunate that I have a job where I’m currently happy but I think this can only keep me feeling satisfied for so long. I guess the advice I’m asking for is, has anyone felt similar and can relate? How did you find the perfect career (for those that love their job)?

560,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice. I recently started seeing a therapist in the last 2 months - we have had 5 sessions together. Unfortunately after my last session we realized that my insurance isn’t covered with her so I am stopping my sessions as I now owe her 600+ out of pocket. I really liked my therapist and am having trouble finding a new one I like that accepts my insurance. I had an epiphany last night of some serious, major events in my life that I have repressed and need to talk to someone about it but I’m not sure if I should wait until I find a new therapist or continue to see her and bite the $150 until then. My only issue is I don’t want to have to start all over with someone and relive that trauma that I’ve pent up for 23 years. Better yet, it won’t be something I will feel outwardly comfortable sharing with a new person until at least a few sessions in. Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation? $150 is a lot of money that I can’t really afford to spend bi-weekly. Any advice would be appreciated.

For background, i (21f) come from a strict christian family. my parents own big companies and are somewhat billionaires. growing up is such conditions my parents are extremely controlling, they’d do anything to keep their image but in their minds, they are the best parents. Mom forces us to take family pictures even when she can clearly see that none of my siblings want to ) just so she can show people that we’re a big happy family MAKES ME SICK! 


My mom is the most toxic she often reminds me of how hard she had to work and how much she had to sacrifice to raise me (she was a teen mom) she thinks like i owe her my life, i remember her saying that she’d rather see me dead than see me disobey her. i don’t remember attending a birthday party, i don’t remember inviting my friends over to chill , i don’t remember being able to stay out of the house past 5pm

now that am an adult, i can only stay out until 7pm even when i do mom won’t stop calling and asking where &amp; with who i am. I get extremely stressed when i am out that i can’t have a good time. So now that we’re in lockdown i feel completely overwhelmed i wanna get out but how? I am financially incapable. My parents don’t let me go anywhere and i can’t afford to be cut off. I study abroad but in this corona i am forced to be with them for several months and i feel like i am about to snap.

As far as i can remember, i have been a good Christian child , good grades, making them proud, allowing them to flaunt me around and brag about how intelligent and beautiful i am (which is true).

I find it very hard to accept a friend who qualifies as a slut especially if they enjoy it, but I don’t know what that term even means anymore. So here’s the real questions:
1. What does a slut mean to you? (Does it even exist?)

569,"So, I moved in with some family members, we’ll call them Amy and Tracy. I had anxiety problems so I never got a job before I turned 18 and still don’t have one. We haven’t had a car since December and there’s nowhere close to where I can get a job. The closest would be about a 45-50 minute walk. I’d be walking twice a day, during the day and at night by myself. I have no friends where I live or family members that I can ask. I’m a 5-foot-female with no muscle and there are creepy people everywhere in my town. I have no money at all and I don’t want anymore money from them. They’ve done too much for me. I’m finding it difficult to continue to live with them because I’ve realized that Tracy has narcissistic traits and an abusive problem. I lived with both of them when I was a child and was happiest with them when I was a child despite the physical abuse that was happening. Nothing has gone terribly wrong but there have been times where I literally will have to stand in between them as one screams directly into my ear and the other is putting all of her weight on me. When she yells in my face, I get scared that she might physically hurt me too. She never has though. I just thought that maybe there was like one problem that needed to be solved that was causing all of these hostile actions and that I could help fix. When I was younger, I witnessed my biological mother (who has passed away from a drug overdose) get in physical fights with Tracy. One night, both of them ganged up on Amy who is disabled. That’s a traumatic thing that I’ll never get over and have never talked about. Amy always reminds me about how I never called the police when I was younger and how I never will because “I don’t care about her”. I guess I have sympathy because they went through way worst when they were growing up. &amp; I always felt bad about never standing up and saying something. I was scared and a deer caught in headlights on nights like that, because I guess I knew everything would go back to normal the next day, then it would happen again. Amy would always call me at school while I was living with a different relative (after she’s provoked Tracy or lost Tracy’s things) and tell me that I let Tracy hurt her by not calling the cops, but I lived in a different county, a different city. Anyway, one has feelings they’ve repressed for so long, along with diabetes and PTSD and never got professional help. The other needs constant reassurance even after everything between us is fine and will remind me that Tracy is doing this to tear mine and Amy’s relationship apart. She always does this to Tracy when Tracy is out with friends. Always accusing and assuming. Btw, I am fine. There is no physical abuse going on anymore.

580,"On mobile, English isn’t my native language, quite long so sorry in advance, blah blah blah. 

Hey, quick background story: 
I’ve been together with my boyfriend for almost 11 months now and we’ve been living together for about 9. I know I know very fast, i know. Heard a million times already. So when we moved together, I moved in with him in our home town. 
Now we’re looking towards moving into another city (about an hour away) for my university education and his training as a chef. 

We’re actually looking forward to it as the current apartment is pretty trash and we’d like a fresh start. 
Now here’s the thing: my Bf (probably) has borderline disorder. No he hasn’t been diagnosed but I’m working in the „assistance of the physical/mental handicapped“ field and I’ve educated myself a lot on this topic and every symptom fits him perfectly but he refuses professional treatment, at least not until we’ve moved.
Anyway, it’s not been always easy with him and his mental state but we’re working through it. I’m also gonna urge him again to seek professional help once we’ve moved.

So to get to the point already: 
He says he’s looking forward to moving and the fresh start but I’m nervous. He’s pretty much never left our small town and he’s been living in this same apartment for all of his 20 years of living. I’m nervous that he might be overwhelmed with everything and that his borderline personality is gonna come through even stronger than before. 

On the other hand, this might actually work. He has not been working these past 2 years and has pretty much just been hanging around and living life. Through that, boredom has become his biggest enemy. Boredom is also what almost always triggers his borderline symptoms and makes him hard to hang around with when that happens. 
Now I’m hoping that after finally working 8h/day again, he’s gonna be glad to just not do anything sometimes in his free time or to just chill from time to time. Of course we’re still gonna do stuff together, like explore the new city etc and (hopefully) make new friends.

So yeah idk. We’re also gonna leave our really close friend group behind (which we’re gonna see from time to time of course but still not everyday like now) which might also be quite hard for him. 

Please if you have any further questions, ask right away and maybe you have a few constructive suggestions on what to do or how to play this safe or not be so nervous. Just any advice is welcome. 🙏🏻",30Apr2020,1
581,"Hello everyone,

So I am a 26 year old returning student with an associate degree. I am transferring into a University to complete a political science degree, which will likely be done online. I am passionate about politics and want to be a part of the change we need in the world. However,  it seems as if people think Political  Science degrees are useless and make it difficult to land a job after college. 

I aim to not be one of those people by getting heavily involved while in College and developing skills that will help with getting a job. I haven't even started classes yet as I don't start until the fall, but I have already started reading textbooks on  the subject matter, got in touch with some volunteer opportunities, and am attempting to teach myself SQL and Python because manipulating and analyzing data seems like it would be a very helpful skill to have if you want to get in to politics and policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short: I applied to 3 schools in my state. I didn't get into the one I wanted and now I am going to have to go to a smaller state school. I also live and work in the city of the school that I didn't get into, so I will be doing these classes online. Which is something that is going to be incredibly difficult in itself. Both state schools have online programs for Poli Sci but one is offering just as a Bachelor of the Arts and the other also offers it as a Bachelor of the Sciences. 

Does it really make a difference which one is chosen? The science related one seems like I will get more classes in Data Science which seems more likely to get me a job than something philosophically related.

582,"Well, currently there are none because there is no school, yet I would like to better myself before it starts again. the thing is I have a childlike sense of humour, which ,at the start of middle school everybody had, which was great because I was slightly popular for my cheesy jokes ,while I didn't do this jokes to make others happy and just to make others laugh it made me feel good for other people to find what I said funny,anyway now In the first year of high school everybody is trying to act mature and serious all around, which I KNOW is acting because I have met this people for years and believe me they are not however they think that being mature is being serious and never laugh at a joke unless it is about sex or something, yet I do not believe that, I know what it is like to act mature and serious, to drain that innocence and child wonder out of you I've been there and its not just me its almost everyone I've seen on the internet people talking about how people became emotionally numb after trying to ignore that pain, that's the reason why mature people tell you to cherish this years of innocence and happiness and I believe that that conversion into seriousness should never happen. the term growing up is tossed around a lot with the implication to neglect that childlike wonder and not with , what I believe is more important for growing up which is learning to be kind, compassionate and overall not egoistic , why should I throw away my feelings and emotions and become a emotionless husks just because ""its what grownups do"" who stated that being happy and ongoing and being and adult where opposite? I thinks it come from the idea that pain and suffering were bad because they made you sad, pain is only bad if it had no reason if your pain and sadness has a reason it means that you care for what happened (ej your dog died  )and when you stop trying to accept this emotions as something reasonable for what has happened and instead try to view that as something bad you stop caring as much,the emotions themselves are not bad its what caused them that is,  anyway this belief that you should stay innocent and doings what makes you happy (in the long term while of course not hurting anybody) and accepting has caused me a problem with my classmates who believe that you should be serious and even with teachers for the simple reason that I make jokes for myself to make me a bit happier, so my need for advice Is what should I do? should I just do what makes me happy without secoming to the pressure of my classmate to in their words ""grow the hell up"" or should I stay innocent and care about of my emotions while 80% of the school hates me?",30Apr2020,1

586,"I recently ordered a small electric air compressor via Amazon (fulfilled by Amazon).  Unfortunately, they sent me a very large gas powered compressor.  I really need the small one as it's electric and can be used indoors.  I tried contacting Amazon about it through phone and email, to no avail.  Their self help on their site says I need to ship back the incorrect item, and they will ship the correct one.  

However, the incorrect item is SO large, it was shipped on a pallet.  I imagine that shipping costs for this thing are going to be through the roof.  The item they sent is about triple the price of the one I ordered.  I'm considering going to a local dealer and trying to switch it out, but I would prefer to get this fixed by Amazon if I can.  Best case is to talk to a *person* at Amazon to explain the situation and see if they will cover the shipping.

Basically, I'm 21 years old. In high school when I was sixteen, I met this girl who I was absolutely head over heels for. Now, I wasn't the kind of person to be super emotional or caring. I didn't really like PDA, I was always awkward with flirting, blah blah blah- But this girl had me by the heartstrings. Like, I dream about her.  


We dated for like, four months, at tops. This CANNOT be normal for me to still be thinking about her, wishing for her, hoping some miracle happens where I can start over with her. I get the whole love at first sight thing but, I was sixteen. I tell myself it wasn't meant to happen, I can be happy without her, yadda yadda. But I still find myself thinking about her and it makes me miserable. We're still close friends, and I don't want that to change. She quickly went from a girlfriend to a best friend.  


What makes things worse, is her boyfriend is kind of an ass- But that's a story for another time. So I guess, I'm asking for advice of how to fix this? I've been able to date and stuff fine but, I still always think about her. Am I in a hopeless situation of wanting something I can't have? Is there a way to move on without cutting her from my life?",30Apr2020,1
594,"Hi. New to all this so please forgive me if I do this wrong.
My friend (F) and I (M) had a massive argument in January and she didn’t want to speak to me afterwards. What we argued about doesn’t really matter. 
Since then, I have contacted her several times to apologise (we were both at fault) but she has always replied saying she needed time and she doubted things would ever go back to the way they were (we were very close, spent all our time together - non sexual. We would discuss relationships etc). 
Then about 6weeks ano she contacted me to ask if I would do her a favour and pick up a prescription for her. She is in the category where she can’t go outside. I said ok and asked if there was anything else she needed. She gave me a little list and I went out, got the prescription and the other things, then went to drop them off. 
We spoke for about 45 minutes on her doorstep (keeping a safe distance) and things seemed fine. We laughed and spoke about stuff that we used to, and things seemed great.
Só a couple weeks passed and I called her again to ask if she had heard some news about a couple of friends of ours (again, this information is not important) and we spoke again for about an hour and a half. Things were like normal, talking about the usual stuff, making jokes, discussing relationships and university stuff etc. 
But then a couple weeks passed again and I was wondering what was going on. So I texted her last night, asking where we stood. She said she hadn’t been speaking to many people recently as she was ‘dealing with some stuff’, and that she thinks things happened too quickly and she’s still trying to ‘process stuff’. 
Where do I go from here?  Things seemed much better, but now she wants to back off again. Was I used to get her her prescription and groceries, or am I over thinking this?",30Apr2020,1

I'm in my last year of High School and I realise that I really need to get myself on track so I can get a good end of year score. I've never studied for a test consistently in my time at highschool, I always procrasinate. My day usually goes like this, I go to school, come home at 5pm and feel too tired/unmotivated to study or do homework so I just go on youtube, watch a movie intill i go to bed at 10pm. This has been happening for my whole highschool. When an assigment comes, I usually procrasinate intill the very last day where I grind it out without rarely stopping. I really need help with this, I need to consistently study every night and I need ample time to do my assignments but my brain just wont let me, It always sees the easier option. Even if I do homework, its sloppily done. I really want to impress my parents as they know my grades are bad and they always get angry when I get a report. In class its the opposite, I always pay attention in class, I take notes, listen and ask questions, its just when I get home and on the weekend i obviously do nothing. Ive tried searching online how to fix this and none seem to work or I havent tried all steps together properly. I've tried breaking down my tasks but it doesnt seem to work.

596,"Read paragraphs 1, 3, 6, and 7 for shorter version or tl;dr at the end.

About 4/5 months ago, an ex (17F) that I (16M) had broken up with around that time made up a bunch of shit and was telling everyone. She told people I pressured her nonstop at a party to sit on my lap, she said that I said it was okay for her to hook up with a girl at a party, and she said that I pressured her to have sex with me.

When I first heard about it I was shocked that she would say that stuff because I know for a fact none of it happened, and it made me sick in my stomach that she would do that to me. I treated her better than any girl I had ever been with and it hurt so much for her to turn around and do that to me.

This caused a huge spike in my anxiety, all I could think all day every day for months was “is that what people think of me. Do people think I’m a creep? A perv?” These thoughts echoed around in my brain for months until I started believing the thoughts, I thought I was a monster and that she was right.

I tried thinking of something I could do to help myself so I sought out an ex from school who I’m good friends with, I told her the story and asked her if she ever thought I was pressuring to her when we together or if I gave off any weird vibe. She straight away said no, and said that I was the most caring person she had ever been with and she knows for a fact I wouldn’t do any of that stuff I was accused of.

This really helped me a lot, and I realised it was just in my head, I never did that stuff and it was just as a result of overthinking that I thought it was true. This all happened in around January/February, but yesterday I don’t know what it was. 

The thoughts all came back at once, I was fine one second and the next I felt blue. Those same thoughts started spiralling through my head again. I was curled in a ball on the shower floor crying, I kept telling myself I was a worthless piece of shit and needed to die, I had never felt so horrible in my life. I just wanted to end it right there, I didn’t care about anything.

I am now feeling much better, but I honestly don’t want to experience that again. I know it may not seem like a big issue being accused of something so small, but it has affected me in ways I never thought were possible. It never leaves my mind and I always get spikes of thoughts like “what if she was right?” Sorry for the long post but I just want to know what I can do in this situation, any help is appreciated :))

Tl;dr wrongly accused of being sexually pressuring during relationship 4/5 months ago. It has affected me very badly mentally, thoughts spiral in my mind  to the point where I start believing what she accused me of, drives me to the point of wanting to commit suicide.

I’m a 19 year old female, who happens to be very fascinated with the human mind, how it works, human behaviors, and different realities. A great and fun way that I like to play around with the human brain is essentially by tweaking around with my own. I like to challenge my perspectives on things and test my control over my own mind. Now, it’s important to note the only drug I take every day is weed. And by every day, I mean one light smoke session once a day. I only smoke heavy when I’m with friends and in a party setting. I don’t drink, I don’t take any hard drugs. I allow myself to take one Adderall once a month, and trip on LSD once a month. Other than that, the only drug I do daily is marijuana. However, the reason my boyfriend is getting irritable is because I’m on the hunt for some pure MDMA. I bought a testing kit, and I’m just looking for some pure stuff to jump into my path. I know it depletes your serotonin levels significantly so I only want to do it once. I also want to try DMT just once as I love psychedelics, they’re my favorite way to challenge myself mentally. I personally see my drug use as a hobby and a way to stimulate and better understand my mind. I’m never reckless or dangerous with it, and I make sure very carefully not to step into the path of addiction.

601,"Hi. I realise I'm an asshole for what I've done and that it's okay to hate me, but I'm seeking genuine advice, so please try to help me because I'm not sure where else to turn to.

I've somehow managed to befriend pretty much all people in my workplace, but now I've ruined everything with one stupid racist joke to one of the guards. I really don't know why I did it. It was extremely early in the morning after a night in the office and I was very tired and my brain was just acting on auto pilot. She called me to ask a few questions and I answered her and I don't remember why but we got into a little argument and then I jokingly told her that she was ""discriminating me because I'm white"" (she was black; this may not sound that offensive but with where we live and what she'd been through taken into consideration this was extremely offensive to her and a huge dick move, even if you're not extremely ""left wing,"" for the lack of a better term (maybe sensitive? idk) ). It didn't help that I'm an extremely monotonous guy and that it's near damn impossible to tell if I'm joking or not just from my voice. Of course after I woke up fully and got snapped back into reality I realised that this was an incredibly shitty thing to do so I immediately called her and apologised and we talked and we've kinda worked things out now. But there was this very nosy girl with her in the same room when the first phone call took place, and she probably heard the conversation, and now it's just a matter of time until it spreads and I become the workplace's hate symbol.

I feel that it wouldn't matter to anyone that I'd apologised and made up with her. I really liked all of the people in the workplace, every single one of them. I feel that even if I publicly apologise people are still going to look at me in ""that way,"" and that every social interaction of them with me would just feel unnatural. I feel that I would never be able to crack jokes or just sit with the other guys again. It definitely sucks for the girl, there's no denying that she's the victim of the story here, but I *really* don't want to be ""that guy."" I'm extremely uncomfortable with any kind of attention from a lot of people, not to mention negative attention. For my entire childhood I was ""that guy"" who spoke to at most two people in every social hierarchy.

I've spent so much time and effort trying to just be a generic, unnoticeable, occasionally somewhat funny guy. I know what I did was really weird and wrong, and I've spoken to the girl and assured her that I didn't mean any harm and that I don't know why I did it and that I'm very sorry.

602,"I really want to quit my job, but I feel like I’m bailing on a family. 

Alright so first of all I got a job babysitting back in February for May and the whole summer. The plan was that I would be able to watch the kids, take them places like the pool, park, outside. They’re preteen boys. Well, in March I was laid off from my current job at the time and I needed a job. The mom who needed them for summer offered me a job to watch them then, since schools shut down. The original plan was full time and I excepted to be able to still go to my online classes and do homework. Then, she said she wanted me to leave for class so I would only be getting about 6 hours to 5.5 a day. Then she suggested she didn’t need me for full time. If I’m not full time I can’t pay my bills. I was frustrated because I got unemployment which would pay more just to sit at home then babysit, but I didn’t want to bail on them and I could cover bills if I worked full time. Now, I’m working 4 hours a day which qualifies me for unemployment if she pays me half my rate, which I suggested so I would be able to pay my bills. That was a dumb suggestion. Now I just hate the job cause I’m inside all day doing nothing, and I haven’t bonded with the kids like I normally do. I’m also getting paid $5 an hour for two kids to qualify for unemployment.

Covid-19 has given me a break from having to function in an extrovert's world. I've known peace, and had the quiet I so needed to compose music and read as much as I want. I've been happy knowing that the skies are clear, and that animals are coming to visit places they otherwise feared. 

Now, as the spread comes to a slow in my country, life is slowly returning back to ""normal"". Dust in the streets, the constant honking, the traffic of people and noise everywhere. There hasn't been dreaded construction noise for awhile, and when it returns it's going to drive me insane as it's right across from my apartment.

All of it makes me want to move to a farm and live in isolation. I hate people. What are they gearing towards? Where are they going? Just collecting more to fuel their consumerist egos. Who has everything to gain? The extroverts who love being out and about, as they always have done. Who suffers the most? People like me, who look to the quiet for happiness. For an afternoon with a book, or an evening composing music. Once the world returns to ""normal"", my peace will be lost in the noise, and there's nothing I can do about it.

I've suffered my whole life having to live in an extroverts world, and being told I'm weird if I think otherwise. One month in quarantine has driven them insane, and I see them raging on social media everyday about how unfair it is. The bastards don't know what suffering is, just entitlement.

609,"Alright this is gonna be pretty long.

I’m 16 (M) and I’m trying to decide on what to do with my future. I’ve always wanted to be in the Military / Police but I’m also interested in business and have my own successful mobile car valeting business which I do alongside school. 

At the start of the year I applied to the Royal Marines but found out I have to wait 3 years and then re-apply due to some medical issues. 

I applied to two local colleges, one for an accountancy apprenticeship and one for a Military and Uniformed services course, I have since removed my application for the accountancy apprenticeship since I hate the idea of sitting in an office all day. 

So at the moment it’s looking like I’m going to do the military uniformed services course which I’m looking forward to.

The issue I’m having is although I’m really looking forward to doing the military uniformed services course, I’m still really interested in business. This causes me to change my mind on wether to pursue a career in the Military/Police/Business. And when I decide I want to do something I always do it properly and commit 100% of my time to pursuing it, but it changes between the Military/Police/Business every 3-4 months. 

I would like to join the military then the police and then start a business when I’m in my 30s-40s. But with the recent news that I have to wait 3 years to join the military I feel as if I’m wasting time, since my college course is only a year long so I’ll finish and then have to wait another year to join the military, and even if I do, there is still the chance that my application could be rejected due to the health issues I had last year. 

I don’t know anyone who is also doing the college course that I’m going into so I’m worried i might struggle to find friends, at secondary school I got around and had a lot of friends but I didn’t have any proper solid friendships, I didn’t really meet any of them or do anything outside school.

And I’m also worried that I’m going to go through the college course, wait a year to reapply to the marines only to find out that I can’t join due to the medical issues I had last year (they were only some side affects of some medication I was put on and are no longer an issue).

I went to my brother's house. He lives with his significant other. The house is all right for all 3 of us, so they told me I can stay however long I wish. I was looking for my own place but then the coronavirus happened and there's no way I can move out now, so it's all on hold, but as far as I know we've all been cool with that.

Now the hard part is living  with my sister in law. We get along well as long as we don't spend too much time together, and only being here for weekend or party I was absolutely cool with her - but now that we are in the same house all the time, I found myself struggling. 

She is an outgoing person, likes to spend time outdoors, hiking with her German shepherd I think makes her the happiest. Basically anything involving walking, running, etc, you get the idea. I do like those things, but not to this extent - anytime I go with her it's usually more than I can handle, and I don't like to do this every day, once every week or two is more than enough for me, after that it's just boring/exhausting. 

They both work in the same sector, not affected by COVID, so they stayed in their workplaces, just working from home. I was furloughed, so I don't need to (and legally can't) do any work for my company. I'm totally cool with that, have few side projects going on, so I spend time on them and on my hobbies, yoga and coffee making - neither of those really being outside activities. Since the pandemic started I go shopping once a week, I did go to see two friends from distance, I once went to drive around in my car to soothe myself down - and I'm all right with that amount of outside, especially when it's sunny I spend my days in the garden.

I also struggle with depression and as you can imagine with the recent break-up, the world falling apart, and not much responsibilities on my back - it kicks up. Most days I fight to get myself out of bed - but I have depression all my life, and I just sort of know how to, by now. It's just not that easy and I use all the tools I learned in therapy to not let myself spiral down.

For a reason I don't get, she makes comments all the time on how I 'never leave the house' and tries to take me somewhere. After I repeatedly refused, she now does it in an almost offensive way like 'we're going for a hike, but I understand you prefer to stay in your room unhappy?'. Like how would that sort of thing convince me? And I'm not unhappy about it, I'm really, truly ok staying in my room for hours. There's all sorts of comments focusing on how I'm weird and unhappy and never go anywhere. And yes, it's all during the global pandemic and media telling us not to go out if we don't need to.

What would you say to a person like that, so she understands it's not cool on her side? We're not on a relationship level where I can sit her down for a talk and discuss that. I just need a clever response that will set me free from her mean comments.",30Apr2020,1

615,"I am a graduating senior in high school &lt;insert class of 2020 virtual graduation joke here&gt; I have been struggling with really horrible insomnia for my whole life and I can only feel it getting worse. Recently I decided to do something about it and told my mother that I thought I needed professional help. Fast forward to this morning when I was finally given three options by my new ""sleep doctor,"" one of them was essentially just establishing a good schedule (duh?) Another was only really relevant if depression was playing a factor (almost certain it isn't) and the third was prescription drugs. Problem is that when I take a ""sleeping pill"" it is like dread and horror in a pill, shit does the opposite of help and I'd be better off with nothing. This is all especially frustrating because I know the real reason I can't go to sleep is because my mind is simply restless, and the drugs that I KNOW help me fall asleep are ~illegal drugs that, you guessed it, temporarily dumb the mind. I live in a medically legal state for marijuana but my mother is definitely not keen on going down that path despite the fact that she knows I occasionally smoke recreationally.

So what the hell do I do? (Please no answers like ""you're 18 you don't need her permission,"" I dont have the money to sustain buying my own treatment)

617,"I’ll try to keep this somewhat short but I apologize in advance for length. 

The past couple years have been really bad. I’ve been a rock bottom for a while now. I’ve been incredibly depressed and unstable. It’s caused an immense strain on my life in a lot of areas, basically every area. 

I’ve been working on bettering myself. My boyfriend and I broke up last week, we’ve been together for years and that was kinda the kick I needed. I’ve been doing great this week. I’ve had moments of being down or  negative or hurting or whatever, but overall I’ve been able to start changing my way of thinking - ie if I’m having negative thoughts, i make sure I acknowledge that that’s what it is and try to remember simply facts, or something positive. I’ve been trying to actually understand my emotions and behavior and understand them and change my outlook on myself and a lot of other things. I have a long way to go obviously still, but I’m proud of my progress and my realizations and stuff so far and want to keep down this path. 

The major issue I’m running into is that every day I seem to wake up just immediately feeling down, every morning. It’s frustrating because every day I’ve managed to get myself to a good place and I’m feeling wonderful by the end.. I make sure I get at least 1 productive thing done, I make sure to keep my new outlooks in place and it’s seriously helped me feel better than I have with myself maybe ever. 

But this waking up this way is frustrating. I recognize that nothing changed between last night and this morning, and that if I can go to bed feeling that good, I should be able to wake up and continue that. But when i wake up feeling down I can’t help but to feel like it’s a setback. I try to tell myself “you have a lot going on, it’s okay to feel sad, but don’t get hung up on it” but then I seem to almost obsess over what I can do to change this because I hate it. I try every healthy coping mechanism I can find about dealing with depression and feeling lost and down and stuff, and those coping mechanisms help I’m pretty much every other area.. but I get stuck on I feel sad and want to get back to feeling good about myself and about the direction I’m going and not wake up this way. 

I’m sure that I need some kind of a morning routine or something maybe? But I’m not exactly sure how that will help, because I’m telling you, it’s like morning - eyes open- feeling down. 

TL;DR I’m trying to get out of a major rut and am making a lot of progress but I keep waking up feeling depressed no matter how good I felt when I went to bed.",30Apr2020,1
618,"I'm the best at motivating others, lifting them up when they're down, actively helping them by looking things up they need and holding them accountable, checking up on them and so on. Whatever they need I'm there. In the past this has been exploited by others but also by myself as this was a way not having to deal with my own problems and keeping a good image. I try to best honest to everyone and I tell everyone who has issues to not be ashamed of them, talk about them if you feel like it. Showing vulnerability makes u stronger not weaker. Everyone is dealing with things in their own pace and there is no point in feeling guilty when u can't move forward as fast as you or others would like you to. 

Problem is that I myself, while being perfectly aware of things, am stuck myself. It's not that want to portray that I'm perfect, I do acknowledge my own shortcomings and tell people when dealing with stuff myself. I just try to keep it as vague as possible. I don't want to be secretive but the lack of a supportive family and close friends have made me close up. I'm stuck in life for a while now, which lead me to slowly isolate myself over the years and getting into financial trouble. I'm generally an optimistic person and I don't think about killing myself and but If I was dying now I wouldn't fight too hard because I don't have anything to live for. I'm taking one day at a time, I'm working out regularly, eating healthy, journaling, meeting people (not at the moment due to the corona sitch) and have hobbies but while these things are good for my physical and mental health they don't get me out of this state. The bills are piling up, I don't have insurance and every job I had in the past years I intentionally did something that would get me fired. It's really weird. Even if I like my co-workers, I just hate when I'm being micro-managed. I never go as far as to get in legal trouble with the firm but to get fired. I'm very defiant which I try to control. I can control my actions but not the feeling of hate I have toward that person, policy or procedure that I have to adhere to. I know that with each passing day my future looks grimmer. I know I need to create momentum and focus on things that will bring real change. What would you recommend me to get out of this rut?",30Apr2020,1
619,"So some context. Me and my girlfriend were talking like we always do, it was going normal. Before she posted a story saying “I wish I was dead”. Now of course this seriously concerned me so I asked her if she was okay

She said she was fine but since then her responses to my messages have been 1-3 words with a few heart emojis 

I have it pretty bad when I overthink about certain things, and this is one of them. Did I do something wrong? 

Or is she still going through a tough time and just doesn’t want to talk about it. 
And of course I’ll do my best to let her know I’m always there for her no matter what

620,"Okay guys i wont be typing all the info not that i dont want but because me, myself cant even believe to this mess of a life. Disclaimer: my gf was sexually abused when she was below 15yrs old and now physically abused at 19yrs old by her step father. (Bare with me as my english is only at average)



As you read the title. My girlfriend was abuse by the two things and im gonna start at the sexually abused part..

My girlfriend said that when she was at the age of no knowledge of grown up things. Her step father would often go to her room and touch her breast and sometimes goes to the vaginal part and slowly massaging her ass when she was asleep. At first i thought that was already fucked up, but there is more. When my girlfriend was taking a bath, their house was little(i forgot to mention that they were poor at the time) and has a bathroom but the only thing that is keeping the bathroom from revealing the inside was just a curtain that droped as to see just inches about the feet or so.. their parents would sleep on the floor and when my gf was showering, her step dad would always look at the view that was revealing and peep at my girlfriend's naked body. What the fuck right? It gets more fucked up, in the Philippines we have a tradition that before christmas, there is a mass that start at 4am. One time my girlfriend(14 at that time) got left out from her friends to go to the church, but her step father insisted in accompanying her to go, there was a alley(dark because it was at 4am) and her step father suddenly put his arms inside her shirt then start playing with her underaged boobs. Like what the fuck. He was 40+ yrs old or something at that time and my girlfriend was only 14yrs.(there is more but i think if you want more details ill tell you at the comment section because its getting more cramped in the sexually abused part and you people might get bored and want the more recent stuff)



Getting at the more recent stuff. My girlfriend(19) was physically abused now by the same step-father.

Even though at the age of maturity. My girlfriend was getting abused physically be being punch or was getting threw by stuff, she was punched anytime she backtalks(at the reasonable stuff) because her father doesn't like having rebellious children(?) But anytime at anger he lets it out to abuse my girlfriend. The stuffs was thrown by him was glass, plates, sometimes wood, and a printer. Yes, her step-dad threw a medium size printer at her. My girlfriend doesn't want to get more physically abused so sometimes she doesn't talkbalk to lessen the bruised she had gotten.

These recent days at quarantine lockdown, her step-father, always shout at her unexplainable things like ""get the fuck out of here"" or things that he want my gf to move out. And the most recent thing that has happened is that my girlfriend was about to take a bath but her step-father broke the window of the bathroom's door and now their door has a broken glass window because of him hating my girlfriend for no reason at all.

If you were wondering, Her mother knows all and when my gf was young, her mother went to talk to her husbands sister to alert them what their brother was doing at my gf. But i don't know what happened next at that conversation.

And if you are also wondering, Her mother and step-father is married and has 2 sons (14) (9).

What do you think is the best way out of this mess and lessen the pain my gf is suffering :((

If you have any other things you want to know you can ask me in the comments.

Ps. My girlfriend doesn't know that i am posting this kind of info but i feel so bad at it and lost at words.. will delete if you think that this is inappropriate that she doesn't know but if you can give me advices, i'll deeply thank you for the time and effort you just did.",30Apr2020,1
621,"Hi guys. This is a very sticky situation and I'm unsure of what I should do. 

For context, I'm a closeted bisexual In a very southern religious town. It's very dangerous for anyone to come out of the closet while they live here and I myself would lose my entire family and friend group if anyone found out. That's kind of the norm around here. 
To make a long story short, I often browse dating apps anonymously and while I was browsing a few days ago I got a very sexual message with multiple nudes from a guy who is best friends with my brother and is dating the daughter of a very close family friend of ours. This guy is your typical southern Christian dude. Constantly posting bible verses and very outwardly homophobic. In most cases, I would absolutely never consider outing someone especially given my own situation, but after some digging, I found this guy is kind of a perv. He frequently posts about teenagers he finds hot (he's in his mid twenties) and is very much into d*d/s*n kink stuff. He only posts in gay forums and sites and he has an only fans where he only posts vids with other guys. Some of which I recognized. So not only do I suspect he's gay, but he also seems to be cheating on my friend. I know if he gets outed his life here is pretty much over, but I'm worried for my friend as she really likes this guy. If I told her it would have to be anonymously to avoid outing myself, but I'm not sure if it's even my place to tell her. He sent me d*ck pics so I could always say he's cheating on her and not tell her about the gay stuff. I don't know guys I'm struggling on what I should do. I understand the struggle of being in the closet, but I don't want my friend to get hurt. Advice?",30Apr2020,1
622,I’ve been looking for a job for months and months now. I worked retail on a contract and that contract ended in December of last year. I haven’t found anything since then. Constant walking around and handing out resumes and filling out job applications. For months. Well since this corona thing has come around I’ve gotten literally nothing. Not even an interview. Things seem to have gotten ten times worse. So I did what I really really didn’t want to do. I signed up for corona virus supplement payment thingys. I don’t want to say what they’re called because I’d rather keep where I’m from a secret. But it’s to help with rent if you don’t have a job and staying alive basically. Anyway. I signed up for that ASWELL as an unemployment payment. They are separate. I got approved for both. Depending on the cycle I am getting anywhere from 900 to 130 dollars every payment. It’s honestly too much money for me and I feel really really guilty. Should I feel that way? I honestly haven’t been spending it unless I NEED something. But I’m getting so much that the amount I’m getting is more than I need. i bought something for myself the other day. It was about 60 dollars. I didn’t need it. But I still bought it. And I still feel so fucking guilty. I know I shouldn’t complain about having all this money. But i feel so guilty. I feel like I don’t deserve it. I’ve done nothing to earn it. I’m earning more than I was at my last job by doing nothing. And I feel gross.,30Apr2020,1
623,"its 5pm, in one hour 6pm, I will get back my last grade for this semester

I had 3 courses, I already failed one, and barely passed the other

Im a Law student, 20, female and from Germany

Studying law here is akin to studying in Asia, study till you drop and still fail

Im studying for 10-14 hours a day, and I cant take it anymore

But if I dont have good grades, Im worth nothing, that doesnt mean other people are not worth anything because of bad grades, just me

When i fail this course, I may kill myself

I can tell myself that I failed that other course cause the Professor was shit, his Fail percentage is 50% while other Professors are like 33%

But when I fail this, im Bad, im dumb, and im not worth anything, then I cant tell myself that its the Professor

My Grades are literally everything that determines how I view myself and how much I like myself, I know that its wrong, but I cant help but feel this way.

I also need good grades because when you pass, but with bad grades, you most likely wont get a job in Law, or a shitty one, then I can stop studying alltogether, if I will be unable to find a job in the field, why study it?

But if I dont study, im worthless yet again (agian this just applies to me not other people)

I was always an honors student, and now that im in college im so bad, and its crushing me, people always told me ""youre so smart, best of class"" etc. so that was my whole personality, and now thats gone 

Im such a brat for only caring about my grades, im thinking about how my family will feel when im gone, or my dog, or my boyfriend and im always like ""theyll get over it"" and dont care, but I want to care, but I just dont 

my self hatred is so bad, and when its based on a reason (like failing a class) its gets so bad... 

So my Options are:    get my grade, fail, die     Drop out, feel worthless,die     or i will pass and then everything is good, I dont think that ill pass tho.

When I was running to the neighbors house he yelled that he'd done something to the phone but I couldn't hear what he said. I ended up calling the police from the neighbors house and haven't spoken to him since, and its been several months. The charges were unfortunately dropped, but I've discovered an app on my phone that I can't get rid of that I'm fairly certain he put on my phone to watch what I do (It's called Your Phone Companion- Link to Windows10. I only own apple laptops. His personal computer is a Windows10. It's an app that sends everything you do on your phone to your computer so you see it there).

I called the non emergency line and told the police but was informed that because he did it before we broke up he didn't do anything wrong, basically. I suspect that cop was wrong, and kind of a twat.

I'm less concerned about that than I am about him using information from my phone that he got in the meantime for some kind of revenge, particularly something legal. If I was writing notes and discussing drugs or something on my phone and he took those messages to the police in an attempt to get back at me for his arrest, would that work? I doubt its legal, but it seems like it could be a gray area that he could still use to make my life hell.

When they were dating I noticed a few things about him that didn't sit right with me. I talked to her about them and she made excuses for him and since she knew him better than I did I let it go cause there was probably more than I was seeing.

Now living with him and with being in quarantine I see him more and I still see things I don't like, including the way he treats her. He is definitely verbally abusive. I'm positive that he isn't physical, but he is constantly raising his voice and saying things, sounding like he just wants to start a fight over silly things. He also is constantly interrupting her and saying things to make her feel bad about herself.

I feel like a guest in their house and don't know what to do. Any advice on how to talk to her and make sure she is ok?! I can tell that she knows this is not right and that she is being drained emotionally. I just want her to be happy and it makes me sick to think of her being stuck in this relationship unhappy for the rest of her life.

 A bit of background:

* I'm in Uni  (graduating on the year of 2022 LLB)
* LLB takes a lot of my time and it is a never-ending rat race.
* The only job I ever had was when I was 13, 16 years old.
* I have zero ways of earning any income right now.

Basically, I noticed that we (Asians or the people in my circle) usually leave the nest late (some never do), while people in the west (discounting minorities) seems to leave home early and be much more independent (this is a generalisation). I'm not planning on buying a house or moving out, but I want to be at least able to buy my own food, maybe even go vacation with friends with my own money instead of leeching off my parents.

I have such morbid thoughts. 

It’s like I love them all so much that I’m fixating in the worst thing that could happen to hurt us- the death of one of us.

632,"On this sub I’ve (17 F)  talked a lot about my friends (18/17 Fs and Ms). But I’d summarize everything up: A year ago I met a friend of my friends, he flirted with me the entire night. The next time we met he barely talked to me. And that happened again, the next time we hung out. While all of this was happening I was starting to have feelings for him. Also, I should mention that I’m bi. It’s not like I came out to him, cause most people I know already know I’m bi, but that gave him an opportunity to call me “gay” whenever I spoke. Seriously. For example, I’d walk up to him and say hi and he’d say: “How’s my gay friend in denial doing?”. Or for example, I’d talk about traveling and how far some countries were. And he’d say: “Has anyone wondered how far Rachel’s (my name irl) gayness can go?” I literally have ss’s of every chat we’d had, and there were at least 20 mentions of me being gay. 
Then, last December we all hung out at my place. He was the first to arrive, and we spent the first fifteen minutes or so bantering and making hot chocolate. Then, once our friends started arriving he barely spoke to me, only to ask about the bathroom to throw up. On the same night, he was being very lovey-dovey with one of my friends. Lets call her Leila. He gave her a sweater. Which like, I don’t mind, but I’d have appreciated at least a small gift, since I hosted the reunion, and they all left a mess at my home. 
Then, at the end of the year I told him and everyone that I was sick and tired of being referred as gay, and being the butt of every single feminist joke. (Yes, I’m a lgbt person and a feminist, and this is literally all he can joke about).
Then our friends encouraged him to ask me if I could forgive him. Note that he didn’t want to apologize in the first place. Anyway. I forgave him, just so we could stay in peace. Not even a week later, we all hung out, and a friend told me that Leila and him started dating. They told everyone but me. My friend said they were going to tell everyone that day anyway, but that yeah, they started dating. I felt hurt and betrayed. I wanted Leila and I to be best friends, but after this, I don’t feel that connection anymore. I mean, all of my friends know all the hurtful things they’ve said to me, and they still talk to him. They knew him before me, so I kind of get it. But I’m the one that founded the group chat we all talk in. That group chat solidified our friendship.
Then I got into a fight with him again, because I told everyone that I went to a store that just had opened, he told me “Ok, and?” And then I told him to shut up (I know, not my brightest moment and I apologized) but then we talked in private (this all happened on Messenger btw) and I bursted. I told him that I’m mad that I’m always the one that’s fixing our problems. He told me that he’s not that bad, that he’s usually a very chill and nice guy, and that he’s sorry I got that impression. I told him that he’s been like that after we met. He told me to “f*ck myself”, tjhen blocked me. Also note, I asked Leila on our group chat, so it’s something that everyone saw. 
Then I had to tell Leila if she could tell him to unblock me, and the guy did. I told him that we won’t talk to each other anymore.
We haven’t talked in like 3 months.. I told some of my friends both in person and in messenger that I’m thinking of maybe leaving the friend group since I don’t want to see him. Just one friend told me that he would be on my side if I ever confronted Leila and the guy. Others just saw my message and reacted “sad” to it, but didn’t reply. Then, Leila told me she can’t choose between her boyfriend and me. But what she doesn’t get is that she already did, the minute they both started dating.

633,"I (18F) will be graduating high school next week, as will bf (18M). We will be heading to the same university in the fall and will be going in as juniors (both have our 60+ credits we earned during High School). We have been together for two years and are confident our relationship will be continuing (not positive, but circumstances are great for us). We worked hard and both got into a semi-prestigious university in our state, and should graduate within two years.

We are both Hispanic first-generation (technically, for me) college students. I am going as a Bio major with hopes of med school and he is an Accounting major (and loves it, I have never seen someone be so passionate about accounting.)

His parents are Mexican and married at our age and have been married for 20 years and are going strong. Neither graduated high school, but bf's dad makes an amazing living with his own business (doesn't make a lot but manages his money really well). Bf's mom is a stay at home mom. T

I adore his parents and they adore me. His little brother calls me his sister. Overall I get along with the family really really well. The thing is recently they have been very adamant about us having children. Like soon. Like trying to convince me to plan a pregnancy so I give birth our first summer break. They are already 100% positive we are marrying.

It's not like they're just convincing us to have a baby. They talk about how they would financially support us completely and we could use bf's mom to watch the kid-free of charge. When we eventually get our own apartment they would help and pay for everything.

There is an obvious answer: no. My problem is I have always had extreme raging baby fever. I don't know what's wrong with me. Since early high school, I have wanted nothing but to be a mom and have a bunch of kids. Honestly, I would really be a content housewife, but I love medicine as well.  Whenever I visit they constantly push me to have a child. Bf is aware of my baby rage and wants the same, but obviously, after we are done with school and have a stable income, house, good job, white picket fence, etc. The problem is I have a weak resolve and I don't know what we could do. Every time I politely decline until we finish school (at least) they just keep saying something that makes it even more feasible.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the obvious answer is to not have a kid, but they seem so offended and really are convincing. How can I get them to drop this subject without being harsh? They seem so genuinely happy when they talk about me having a child. I really like telling people no when it's something that really seems to make them happy. :( The problem is they're really starting to convince me!",30Apr2020,1
634,"A little back story: so I have basically hated the way I look for my whole life and just recently I have started taking better care of myself and actually doing things and styling myself in the way that makes me feel better about my appearance.

Today I was face timing a couple of my friends and we were just talking. I had done my makeup because I am interested in it and I didn’t have what to do. One of my friends (Lets call him J) said that I looked cute. I said thank you and said that I though I looked pretty. Another friend (let’s call her Amy) said that it was very narcissistic of me to say. I asked her what she was talking about and then said that what I said was very narcissistic. 

After this conversation I went silent, but Amy clearly could not so she obviously started saying that she doesn’t want narcissistic or self absorbed people in our friend group. All of this because I said that I thought I looked pretty.

643,"Really just looking for reassurance that I'm not being evil or harsh. I believe I'm being fair, in particular considering all of my other students.

I'm a college instructor part-time for a senior-level class. I have about 45 students and this situation applies to only one. I have a student who has not done well this semester. She turned in mostly blank tests and missed a few quizzes and at least one homework assignment. The student told me that she was taking double the normal load of classes in an effort to graduate this semester. She came to office hours twice during the semester (I reached out and offered to meet for times that would fit her schedule, but that never happened). 

After the last test (about half was blank), she e-mailed me and said her grades were dropping very low and asked if I had any advice. I was a bit boggled, as she chose to turn in a half-blank test. I did what I thought was right and I encouraged her to try really hard / do really well on the final exam and pointed out how much leaving things blank has hurt for automatic 0-points.

The department was encouraged to give take-home format exams. Knowing this, my online time limit was quite large, when the exam was formatted to be under three hours. Because our online system reports the time taken, I can see that this student took an exceptionally large amount of time to work on this exam. I don't know if she got help from other individuals (her answers do not exactly match any of my other students). I'm hoping that she just worked hard.

That said, there are still at least 10-12 points of her exam which were left unanswered (no attempt) and several questions that were wrong and showed she does not understand the material. The ending grade was D-low C range for this exam. She needed a 100% to pass this class.

I offered 4 points of extra credit this semester to be applied to the final exam. On the exam, I gave 2 points as a bonus question. She got all 6 bonus points. I tried to help without giving things away. I am trying not to grade harshly. The vast majority of my students have very high grades. Also, again, this is a senior-level university class. Students are supposed to know to turn in work by this stage. 

I know that reporting this grade will keep her from graduating (if what she had told me was true). She also has assumed in her e-mail that I am going to pass her (I did NOT state that, I just said that due to the pandemic, we have an extra leniency if the grade is close and lower than a normal semester).

I feel really guilty and cruel to cause her to not graduate, but I know I have reached out to this student and tried to help during the semester. I did not cause this (I tried to prevent it!). At the same time, I do not want to give this student any more ""extras"" due to still leaving things blank. The pandemic has actually helped her do better, as online classes are more flexible per schedule. I still am boggled that she would turn in more than half blank tests....

TL/DR - Am I in the wrong, particularly with a student's perspective, if a student has a D- or F average and has left things blank on exams, and seems to know about 65-70% of the material from the final where an exceptional amount of time was allowed, am I a bad person for passing them? Answer is probably obvious, but I need reassurance. I feel guilty, but I am also frustrated.",30Apr2020,1
644,"So I recently got into an argument with my older sister. It started with me joking around and taking an ugly picture of me then making it her phone wallpaper.

646,"About a month and a half ago, I started getting body aches, mild fever and extreme fatigue. I'm working from home at the moment, and a bit of an idiot, so I just powered through it.

The fatigue was insane. Like a mental fog. I lost my sense of smell and taste about a week in. My smell was replaced by a very faint smell similar to fish which I have had constantly.

After around three weeks I started feeling better, but then I started experiencing shortness of breath. Some days it was really annoying, other days barely noticeable.

Two weeks ago I felt almost fully recovered. Through the day I had normal levels of energy, only slight shortness of breath. I was pretty happy it was over. 

A month and a half later, and the shortness of breath is still here with varying degrees of severity, from barely noticeable to mild. My fatigue has actually got worse over the last two weeks, and I feel like at work I've still got the mental fog, so it's impacting my work quality. I have recovered most of my taste, but my smell is still mostly gone, and I'm getting bouts of minor dizziness.

Overall the worst symptom is the fatigue. But I'm starting to worry a little. I'm not sure if I can/should call a doctor, since the ""official"" advice is to stay at home if you feel sick. I'm not really sure what to do.

649," 

I had a terrible fight with my best friend, the kind of fight with there's no turning back. I am completely devastated, I loved my friend very much and I can't believe it ended this way.

Long story short... My friend and I decided to quarantine with each other, we wanted to be together to have each others back. We generally had gotten along the first few weeks..There were a few arguments due to drinking a little to much and some stupid shit was said to each other,but I thought we could get through it..

The night of the terrible( I can't believe this shit happened fight) it was a good day for myself I chilled out and my friend had to go out and do a few things, However, we live in NYC and having my friend jumping all over the subway during the pandemic didn't make me completely comfortable. However,he had to do what he had to do.

My friend called me to tell me he was on his way with a mad shitty attitude ( which is nothing new when he has been drinking) I told him if he's going to be shitty go home come back tomorrow and get your shit, I did't want to deal with it. At that moment I've been dealing with my own issues and I didn't want to deal with shit..(plus him being all over the subways didn't make me comfortable)

So I told this to my friend and he accused me of doing him dirty, I said no you can have your shit and I will bring it down.. He continued to be pissed and threatened to call the cops, I told him to stop there was no need to call the cops, I was giving him his stuff I just didn't want him in the house, I went outside to bring his work laptop, I would bring him whatever he wanted just tell me..

So I waited called and text him to see where he was, He told me he was blocks away from house. I waited no sign, I called no answer.. I was feeling that it might be a good idea to go buy a close friends house 10 minutes away just to avoid trouble..

I got to near my friends house and he called he said, I have someone here that wants to talk to you,it was the police, I told the cops I had no problem giving him his stuff I just wanted him not in the house because I wanted to avoid the pandemic and I didn't want his shitty attitude in my house.. I was so sick of it. I told the cops, I will be there in 10 minutes.

So I got there and and it was just my friend, I told him again I didn't want you in the house but I will get your stuff. I had his laptop with me wanting to give it to him. Anyway..... He started to freak out like I've never seen him freak out, He was screaming at the top of his lungs he was going to call the cops

Here is where I went wrong, I grabbed his phone because there was no need to call the freaking cops! That really triggered him and everything went down hill from there. He ended up pushing me so hard that my lobby door lock came unlocked, there is a two small stairs I tripped the laptop fell to the ground and he proceed to slam me against the wall during the struggle I threw his phone and it happened to shatter.. I know I fucked up with that.. Of course that really pissed my friend off he end up screaming at me like no one has ever screamed at me,going down the street telling me how I am a crazy bitch.. The cops ended up coming again,made a scene at my building which I was trying to avoid the entire time.. No one got arrested even tho my friend wanted me arrested for his phone and he believes I broke the work laptop on purpose, which I didn't it fell out of my hands when he pushed me.

Anyway, No one got arrested, cops left and my friend got his stuff..The next day My super did see the video of him pushing me and told me they would no longer like to see my friend back in my building..

I know this sounds weird, I'm not mad about him pushing me even tho I got bruised up.. I'm upset about the cops being called.. I have been also beating myself up, I should of let him in my place to get his stuff, At that moment I didn't want him to.

My issue, I hate how this ended.. I haven't tried to call him or contact him in anyway I know he hates me now. I've been beating myself up, totally devastated my friend meant the world to me,he was my closet confident we spoke daily, I can't believe this had happened.. I'm going to miss my friend so much.. I know when is something is done,its done.. But I feel in time I should write him an email not to convince him to be friends again,but to tell him how I feel.. Actually, I'm not sure what to do, I've cried,had a panic attack,playing that night over and over again in my head..

I know none of this can be taking back,but I adored and loved my friend so much,now its done, I'm feeling so sad and this quarantine isn't helping..

651," 

He’s helping me pay my tuition, I can’t risk having him stop. But I don’t think I can go many more years carrying his name.

I currently carry the legal last name of my father, who my mom divorced when I was 6 months old. I've always lived with my mom and was forced to visit him every other weekend growing up due to custody agreements. I'm grateful for all my mom did growing up, she knew divorcing him when I was young and taking me away would save me from being raised by him. He's an alcoholic, drug user, aggressive, and all-around terrible person to my mother and eventually, me. I tried for so many years to give him the benefit of the doubt, to understand why he was the way he was and just try to have a normal relationship with my dad. Eventually, I learned that it gave me nothing but severe anxiety, trauma, and pent up guilt. In the end, it just isn't worth it, some people aren't worth destroying yourself to appease simply for the sake of ""having a dad.""

Meanwhile In the household I was really raised in, I had my mom and my stepdad, who came around when I was 2. He was always there for me. Every birthday, every after school activity, he watched my high school musical with me on repeat without one complaint, he taught me how to care for my pet hamster and how to move on after it died. To me, he was a father figure. I have a hard time calling him my ""dad,"" since it's more complicated than that. My idea of a dad has been warped, it doesn't feel right to call him dad since my birth father has ruined the word for me for so long. Still, in my eyes my step-dad is the one that takes the place of what a dad should.

I was raised alongside my two younger sisters, who are his and my mom's kids. I grew up in this household, I felt safer here while was always anxious and unsafe when visiting my dad. Yet, I carry his last name instead. There was never any reason in court that would prompt me to change it, and my mom never tried. She couldn't predict *how* he would react, but one would assume it would be difficult. All my life I had to use his last name while growing up with a family I loved that carried another, the last name I always wished I had.

Now I'm an adult in college and rarely see my dad. Occasionally we call, and due to the custody agreements, he helps pay my tuition. His way of showing me affection was always money, which I know I shouldn't complain. Of course I'm grateful for it, but its important to understand that this was what you could call ""guilt money."" When he would upset me or hurt me growing up, he would take me out shopping or buy me a new stuffed animal. I turned it down a lot growing up, but soon learned to be okay with it in a sense. He'll never be my dad, but I'm okay letting him do partial pays for my tuition. I'm not going to let myself get torn up for that because I've acknowledged this won't make up for what he's done or act as a sign of affection.

It really hurts to carry his last name, and I always wished I had the last name of the family that raised me. Now as an adult, I have the freedom to change my last name. However because he does send auto payments to my account, there is the possibility he would find out. I don't know how he would react, and though I don't feel the need to impress him I do worry about whether he'll still help me pay for my education. I know it sounds low to say that, but I certainly can't afford my education without that help, and also he's still my parent legally. He's expected to help me pay that, it's the least he can do after not being the parent I needed.

I'm not sure how to approach this. If I change it and the next time he fills out a check or calls my school, there's a chance I'll have to tell him. If I do change it and tell him, I'm not sure how to approach it? What would I say? However dramatic this may sound carrying his name is really stressful and having to use it every day for my papers and ID and form of identity is taking a toll on my mental health.

The cons are: I work during any weather, and here in Mass that means freezing cold, or really hot humid summers. Its also a sort of dangerous job as Im a Utility collector (shut off gas/electric) for people who are behind on their bills...I fear running into the wrong person at the wrong time of their life and getting shot/stabbed/beat up etc. 

Within my company there is a department that runs all the underground utilities, the pay if probably 10-15K+ more, It has its days where its equally as chill as my day...but sometimes when you gotta hustle, you gotta hustle (which I don't mind) and I wouldn't be put into a dangerous situation of disconnecting peoples utilities.

656,"Hi, I'm a 16 year old, born and raised in the UK with Romanian parents. Just finished Year 11 and I'm starting sixth form at a very good school next year. 

My parents just told me that they want to move back to Romania and this is terrifying to me. I want to pursue law at uni and I was planning on going to a good uni here in the UK. Living in Romania would ruin that dream for me because I don't speak the language to such an advanced level required AND I'm not at all familiar with the system in place there. Plus, I have literally no friends there and I generally don't click with the culture. My mum is willing to to stay in the UK at least until I enrol into uni. She understands that the UK is my best shot at a good future. But my dad is not so sympathetic. He says I could go to uni in Cluj or Bucharest, but that's just not what I want. I just feel like they're being so selfish. It's bad to say that about your own parents, I know, but all they want is to grow old there. They love the fresh air and being with the whole family back home. But all I am thinking is what was the point of coming to the UK, 20 years ago, for better opportunities and education, when you're going to rip that away at the last moment. Literally before I become an adult and grow independent. All of this is just giving me so much anxiety about my future. 

Its not set in stone yet, but how can I convince them to not go back?

Idk how to really explain it. I could say that i have to study a lot, but that just feels like an excuse for being lazy. So then i don't do these things and feel guilty and bad about myself, cause i feel like i *should* do them, bc thats what i like. I also wanted to start learning spanish, but i haven't, bc im afraid that i won't do that too, and it will just make me feel more guilty. Basically i feel bad about myself for not doing my hobbies.

I have no clue what I'm doing, but I tried to correct something my brother did, and I may have made it a little worse. Its leaking to the point were I'm putting bowls in the attic to catch the water, so it's not leaking through the ceiling.  Could technically afford to have it done professionally. I told her that, but she said she wants my brother to keep working on it. Well, this needs to be done asap.

She blames herself a lot for not noticing my ed early and completing me on how I was looking weight. 
Recently after talking to my Therapist more I started to realize a lot of my insecurities and body Dysmorphia is from years of her commenting on my belly. For example in middle school we’d go shopping I would try on a shirt that was a bit tighter and she’d grab my belly and say “Oh what’s that?!”

661,"This is gonna be long and english isn't my first language so I'm sorry about that!

So I (F16) was friends with this girl(F16), I'll call her B, our friendship basically started since we were the only people of our own age at this place where we would get tutored and could get help with schoolwork. When we first met we were both 13.
The other girls where like, 16/18 years old and they would constantly tell us to shut up, basically bully us, ignore us and act like they had any kind of authority over us since we were younger. The adults that supervised and helped us just saw it as teasing and joking around but this basically caused me and B to become friends as we were both the only people that took the other seriously and actually want to talk and sit together etc. 

We didn't have much in common but we didn't want to be alone so we tolerated each other. She is very close minded and very traditionally thinking, she wants to have a husband and kids and be a stay at home mom which I have no problem with, everyone can do whatever they want if they're happy and not hurting anyone but she doesn't understand or like my want to have a career and my aversion for marriage. We've had a couple of arguments as she always found ways of making my opinions sounds ridiculous and stupid and would angrily tell me to shut up when I didn't agree with her. 

I'm someone who constantly jumps from interest to interest. Like I'll obsess over one topic for a while, constantly am busy with that, literally only want to be busy with that to the point of not being able to research it bc I'm busy with something else kinda upsets me and I constantly procrastinate on homework etc bc of that. It doesn't affect my schoolwork that much tho bc I'm fast in understanding stuff and I'm good at doing assignments in the last minute. But like, the longest fixation I had was for a year, and it had been on kpop. Not proud of that, but it kept me busy as there's always something new in the industry, and she used to make fun of me for that. Every time I had a new thing to fixate on, she would either make excessive fun of it or just dismissively listen to me while making it obvious she didn't care. So I stopped talking about the things I was interested in and instead just listened whenever she said something and would just get along with it since that was easier. 

And for a while that helped! I felt like our friendship was getting better and for a while I felt genuinely happy about it. 

But Like basically one day ( one year ago, so we were 15) we were just playing with this piece of ribbon, I was wrapping one end around my finger as she did that with the other end. And some girl just mentioned we looked like we were getting engaged (idk if that's a thing around the world but like in my country you wear rings and there is a ribbon that connects both and to make the engagement official you cut the ribbon) anyway, we thought it was funny so we cut the ribbon and acted like we actually were engaged. It became an inside joke. 

But after a while she would constantly mention it, and even ""jokingly"" act possessive, telling me I wasn't allowed to get to friendly with people she didn't know as well and how I couldn't make new friends etc. Every time I was talking with someone else she would say I was cheating on her and drag me away. The first couple of times I thought it was funny but after almost 4 months of this it kinda started to make me uncomfortable. She is openly homophobic tho so I didn't know how to talk to her about it without her being ""grossed out"" or something bc me talking about it would mean it wasn't a joke anymore. 

While that happened there also was a new girl that was our age. B already knew her so our duo became a trio. But whenever I tried to get to know the girl or when we would get along B would try to stop that? Like she would constantly get into arguments with the other girl, I'll call her H. Like B would constantly mention how SHE was my best friend, and how SHE knew me longer and therefore H should back off etc. But whenever I wouldn't be around or whenever B and I had an argument, H and B would get along really well. In fact since they were my only friends there whenever B and I fought she would drag H everywhere and I would be alone as I have really bad social anxiety and couldn't handle conversation with people I wasn't already familiar and friendly with. 

After a while I started being extremely uncomfortable with Bs behaviour. I told her I would like her to stop the whole engagement thing but she didn't listen and continued for a whole month before she finally stopped after we had yet another talk about how it made me uncomfortable. Instead she started demanding my attention constantly. In the group chat B, H and I had she would constantly send selfies and tag me and basically demand compliments. H would try to appeal to her and compliment her in my place but B wouldn't care about whatever H said. I always had to be available to text her and she didn't stop until I told her she was beautiful etc even tho I told her that I wasn't that comfortable with her constantly wanting that kind of attention from me. 

Whenever we would have an argument she would just blame me and leave the group chat or block me and that act like nothing happened the next day. Whenever I wanted to talk about it bc I wanted to resolve our arguments she would just ignore me. Which caused the problems we had to never really go away so we would argue more often. Look I really cared about her, even tho I wasn't like, in love with her, I really did love her a lot platonically. And like her dismissing me like that hurt my feelings but whenever I mentioned it she would act like I'm the weird one for doing that. 

After a while I put some distance between us, after I realised that I was so emotionally tired and basically kinda depressed about this. It didn't last long as she constantly tried to get close to me again. Even the supervisors would comment on how good friends we were and how they couldn't understand why I was acting that way since I was the only person to tolerate and be able to handle Bs difficult personality as she did listen to me sometimes, and I might have said some pretty harsh things to B when she wouldn't leave me alone. So after that I felt guilty and we were kinda close again. 

It was the end of the year tho so when I mentioned how my niece was gonna join the place we went to she ""jokingly"" said I wasn't allowed to spend much time with my niece as B didn't want me to be friends with someone she didn't already know. 

This year tho, my niece did join us and I started sticking with her. After that two other new girls joined us and me my niece and another girl became really close and I kinda stopped talking with B after we got into arguments about that and she started to constantly talk with me passive aggressively, constantly try to start arguments etc. 

She also treats my niece and the other girl pretty badly, and even started a rumour about my niece a while ago. Bc of that most people who are close to my niece ignore her and dislike her. She even told a teacher at school about it and made it sound as if she was being bullied by my friends and that I was the one pushing my friends to do that

Now things have kinda calmed down as she tolerates them and I have stopped ignoring her and we're on hesitant speaking terms. 

I did end the friendship tho but I do feel occasional guilt about not being her friend anymore. She sometimes looks so lonely and whenever we were good it was kinda fun. Sometimes I also felt like she was obsessive and maybe even in love with me but I always felt stupid for thinking that as she's really homophobic and why would she be in love with me? It feels really egotistical of me to assume that, idk? Anyway

I remember when I was 17. People asking what do you want to do with your life? Don't you have a dream? No. I didn't. At the time I believed that I would figure things out later. 

I got in a university. I wasn't that interested in it but I went. Moved away from parents to be able to go to school. They paid for everything of course. Uni was supposed to be over in 4 years. 

Yet here I am 6 years later with still no degree to show off for everything my parents gave to me. Because I was honestly just slacking off. And back living with my mom. 

I tried to find a job. I did. Went to a ton of interviews but I managed to do nothing. No one would hire me because I was 21 and didn't have any job experience. They wouldnt even hire me as a waitress. 

I tried to get a driver's license. But every time I sit behind the wheel I get too scared that I could potentially harm someone or destroy my mom's car since it's old and there are no money to make up for it. 

My boyfriends mom doesn't want me because I've achieved nothing. Even though he is in a very similar state as me. 

I've lost interest in everything. I was a person with a lot of hobbies. And now I find joy in nothing apart from playing video games all day every day. 

I believe my neighbors have already forgotten my face since I practically never leave the house. 

I signed up for exams to go to another university. But I'm not even studying. At all. 
Because I don't have a goal in life. I don't want to do anything. I don't have a dream. 
I used to be a straight As student when I was a teenager. But I never had to work for any of it. 

And when the time came that I actually had to try to Study it turned out that I was a useless person with zero patience. 
I have nothing. When I think about the future the only thing I know for sure is that I want to become a mother. But to get to that point I need a goal.

667,"Hi -

So my brother and I have been finding dog-shit bags against the fence next to our house and in the wooded area down the block.  We see new bags every day and theres one even hanging from a tree branch because she just flings them into the woods.  There is a pile of about 50 bags in the wooded area around our block because she's too lazy to walk the bag to her own house to throw it away.  We love nature and the environment and this really pisses us off.  We haven't caught her IN the act on video, but we do have her on video going back to pick up one of the bags because she saw us outside watching.  We also know which house she lives in and her name. 

We want to clean the woods and are constantly picking up shit bags on the side of our house.  What should we do with the poop bags?  We want to throw them on her lawn and leave a note or something.

But because of my moods. But I don’t believe that. I noticed that I’m doing behavior that obsess people do...and at the time the things I texted him I didn’t think it was crazy or creepy but now I’m starting to see it and my crush told me he felt creeped out with the things I did. Some of the things I did was text him saying about how th thought of him being a senior makes me sad cuz he’s gonna be leaving and I wanna hug him. I mentioned that I know we aren’t friends anymore. I was just being nice but I guess that creeped him out. We been friends for almost a year so I didn’t think he would be creeped out.  

I asked him what did he think about the message I said and he said was that “A bit creeped out but ik you still like me but I didn’t. So I was like why do you still like me if I don’t like you. And I find it odd.” Another thing I did was text him saying that he looked so adorable holding this big mat thing. At the time I didn’t think anything of it but now I find it totally creepy myself. I don’t know why I said the things I said .

Another thing was that I was willing to buy him $100 pair of headphones and we weren’t even friends anymore. He found it odd as well. And I also picked up the same instrument he plays just because he plays it. He keeps telling me he’s not into me. He left me so many times.

And he finds it a bit odd that I still like him even tho he don’t like me back. I know getting these comments will get me hurt so badly. When he tells me he don’t like me it literally goes one ear out the other. Cuz I heard it so many times it doesnt bother me or give me pain. I just want something from him I can’t have I guess.

I try to best honest to everyone and I tell everyone who has issues to not be ashamed of them, talk about them if you feel like it. Showing vulnerability makes u stronger not weaker.

He’s already refusing to perform them, and pay. I don’t know how to punish him if he doesn’t do either because it’s a cyber relationship.

674,"My cousin reminds me of myself, we have lots of common interests and I think she's the best. She read The Hunger Games series last year and loved it so much that she kept googling stuff related to it which is how she found out about Battle Royale. To be clear, I don't want to keep her from ever reading it, but I don't think she's ready for it yet. She does read some more mature books like Stephen King, but can't watch the movies because she gets too scared. I am much more worried about her reading the manga because of it. To be honest, if it was just the book I don't think I would have such a problem with it because her imagination is kind of PG-13, if that makes sense. Like, I know she won't picture a head exploding in a very gory way because she has never seen something like that before. 

It has been a while since I've read it, but I remember not being able to sleep because some of the manga illustrations and I was very close to her age when I first read it. I found out about it when I called my grandma to chat (we do it every weekend) and she mentioned buying it for my cousin on Amazon. I asked her when it was going to arrive and, since it's an international product (I'm not from the US), it was going to take longer. I don't think it has arrived yet because then my cousin would have called me since she calls me every time she gets a new book. My grandma thinks I'm overreacting. Maybe I am, I don't know. 

I don't want for her to lose her love for reading. Also, if someone told me at her age not to read something, I would only want to read it more. Plus, Battle Royale is a very good book, but it's very very violent not to mention the amount of rape and sexual assault in it. Again, I'm much more worried about the manga because of the drawings. I haven't read the manga in a while so maybe I'm remembering the illustrations to be much worse than they actually are so keep that in mind. What should I do?",30Apr2020,1
675,"I'm a 23 year old male who lives with his parents.  I pay my fair share of rent and try to help them financially.  However, I can read the writing on the wall that this is something they're going to need me to do for the rest of their lives, and at some point (when I'm 33 is the goal), I'd like to get married and move out.     

(1) My mom (in her 50's) used to make good money, but she's now disabled.  She refuses to work on SSI disability paperwork (she has said she'll do it next week almost perpetually for about 8 years now).  I'm honestly not even sure she'd still qualify (she has a pain disorder and depression and it's been almost a decade since she worked).  She spends a lot of my dad's income on groceries, making these way too fancy meals that well exceed what I think we should budget for food (as well as overspending on cigarettes &amp; soda/soft drinks).  She doesn't so as much as she could to help get the house organized and efficient (but tbf, I don't either and I need to work harder before criticizing).  **How can I get her to work on the disability paperwork, and contribute more around the house?**

(2) My dad (in his 60's) works his ass off doing construction, but has never really been able to deal with authority figures well, severly capping his income. Lately, his mental health has suffered as he's been taking in way too much bullshit YouTube conspiracy videos and has becoming something of a prepper.  The videos have affected his mind to the point where he refuses make rational financial plans for the future because he's so certain the money will be worthless (in fact, he often subtly criticizes me for my college degree and desk job that has me stating on a path towards a great career in an essential industry).  He's also driving my mom deeper into depression with his bullshit prepping/politics obsession, and not realizing how that in turn is preventing her from contributing more.  **How can I get him to set aside the prepping bullshit and help us prep for our actual financial realities?**

(3) My little brother recently graduated high school.  He doesn't have a clear plan to go to college nor a real vision of what he wants to do.  He refuses to get his drivers license.  He is morbidly obese and eats only junk food.  He plays video games all day.  I see clearly as day that he is smart and socially savvy, and has the potential to make something truly great out of himself.  I've been in his position before.  And I'm overweight too rn.  I keep trying to get him to work with me on weight loss and offer him my time to help him plan out a career, but he quickly loses interest.  I'm just trying to help him in ways no one helped me.  My parents are no help in this regard.  My dad says he's too tired after work (which is bullshit imo, he is your son).  My mom just doesn't have the mental capacity to help herself, much less someone else.  **How can I help my little brother loss weight and get on a path towards a career?**

(4) I also need to improve if we are to succeed financially. I'm on a track for a decent job, but not one that'll provide for 2 parents and myself, plus allow me to date and live the lifestyle I want.  I'm considering pursuing a more prestigious career in my field that would give me that much money.  I have the smarts and credentials for it, I just need to commit.

680,"Coming up to 6 weeks of this lockdown now and I’ve lost all motivation. Even though my days are completely free as a furloughed worker, it’s such a struggle to turn up to my online classes, I don’t want to go outside for walks and the thought of talking to friends makes my eyes roll. 

Does anyone else have a severe lack of motivation for the smallest things? I’ve never really felt like this before. I’m not even bored, I’ve just seemed to stop caring about things. Shouldn’t I be holding onto the few things I can in this situation?",30Apr2020,1
681,"I've been a college student for 2 and a half years. I was able to pass high school with basically C's and B's, but college has been different for me.

In all honestly, I could never really learn much of anything in high-school. I would just copy others assignments and cheat on tests. It's the same in college, I just cheat and copy off of others because every time i try to study i completely lose focus and end up doing nothing for hours. I try the tutoring my school offers, but I never understand what people are telling me, I just end up distracting others and ruining it for myself and them. This comes with a huge damper on my self confidence. I feel so incredibly stupid. I haven't learned anything this whole time I've been in college. Everybody around me knows whats happening in class, they understand the homework and exams. 

I also feel stupid because i can't have a regular conversation with people. I lose focus of whats happening halfway and end up confused and making a fool of myself. I always forget what I'm doing, I forget so many important things. 

I want to talk to somebody about this, but I feel embarrassed to say anything to a counselor. I'm scared they'll think I just want pills to help me study, I don't want to be told I'm just stupid and I can't fix it.",30Apr2020,1
682,"Hi everyone, I've never posted anything before *and* English is not my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. Also, buckle up beacuse I'm quite prolix: this will be a looong read. 

So, I'm writing here because I don't know how to tell my parents that I don't want to go home after lockdown... and, honestly I don't even know *if* I don't want to go home.

I'll explain the situation: I'm 23 and have been living and studying in a town in Northern Italy (for the past 5 years; my family lives in the south. On May 4th the lockdown will be partially lifted and it will be possible to return to one's legal residence, which in my case is still my parents' house. They are urging me to go home ASAP after the 4th, but they had also offered to come and pick me up (it's an 8h car ride!) in the past two months. I've always turned down the offer because:

1. It is actually [illegal](http://www.governo.it/it/faq-iorestoacasa) to move around town or among regions;
2. I have a very young sister and allmy grandparents are 75+. My mum needs to check on the gp regularly to make sture they're taking the right medications, so if I passed her something, she might pass it to them. 
3. Studying at my parents' house is just impossible and *I really need to study. I*'m currently halfway thorugh my MA and I'm also one of those kids that was constantly praised for being smart and is now an average student with a big overachieving problem (yikes!)
4. I've had troubles with my mental health in the past and being home generally doesn't make things improve on that front. 

Point 3 and 4 are now the main issue. I have a very conflictual relationship with my mother and we get on each other's nerves quite quickly. Both my parents see me as an the help -as soon as I arrive, my mother gives me chores that take out most of my time (like the entirety of the afternoon or the morning) and my father asks me to sort out his online work. If I need to study during summers, I literally have to escape to grandparents' or friends' houses. The difference is: my father can actually stop asking if he knows I'm too busy with school, while my mother wants me to give priority to her requests. It's not like I don't want to help and do my part when I'm in the house, it's just that it's quite difficult to be uprooted from my routine and forced into that of that of suburban family. When I go home during summers I generally spend most of my days outside the house and I generally get told off for this (""this house is not a hotel!"") or forced to participate to family events ""in return for it"".

If I went home now I had to spend 24/7 with them and I don't think my mental health would agree. My little sister, whom I share a room with, would not be a problem and honestly, my father would neither. But  my mother's asphyxiating behaviour (she enters my room without knocking, always wants to know who I'm texting, etc.) and her constant requests would make my life impossible. I know that from experience: I had to delay the discussion of my dissertation last summer because I couldn't finish the work I had to do. She requested I went to the beach/parties/visits with the family nearly every day because ""someone as smart as you should be alright with a couple of hours of study each day"". She's very manipulative and is quite good at guilt shaming you into doing anything, so setting boundaries is not an option: at the end of the day you're left feeling devasted either because you didn't do what she asked *or* because you didn't finish your work. Also, I'm no genius, I need several hours of study a day like the rest of the fucking planet. 

I've discussed the issue with my best friend (we've been friends since we were six and she saw me crying one time too many because I couldn't stand being home) and she straight out told me ""you usually end up regretting coming after two days you're here, just stay where you are"". At the end of this I'll probably sound like an ungrateful whining millennial but alas, what should I do? Should I stay or should I go? And how to explain that I don't want to go?

TL;DR: I'm spending lockdown away from my family and they want me to go home ASAP. I have a difficult relationship with my mother and I'm afraid that being locked in the same place will affect my mental health and my grades. What should I do?    

Thanks for the help! (And all my appreciation if you actually got to the end of the post!)",30Apr2020,1
683,"This is my first post on Reddit. I've been an avid user of Reddit and I love the community here. Figured this was the best place to seek guidance.

I am 26 years old and am currently under the employment of the Canadian Armed Forces as a regular forces member in Quebec City, Canada. Joining the army for me was a stepping stone after graduating with honours in Police Foundations. It was a way to earn valuable life experience before sending my applications to police agencies across Canada. I had it all planned out: finish a 4-year contract as a combat engineer, get out and jump back into my desired career path. That life path all came crashing down when I was caught sleeping in my car, intoxicated, in a residential parking lot. 

The reason for sleeping intoxicated in my car, with it running, was a means of leaving a dangerous situation and seeking shelter from the blistering winter cold. It had been a tinder date gone wrong. She had failed to mention she was still living with an abusive ex, which came back drunk at 3 am and threatened me with a knife, forcing me to leave the premises. It was a rural zone, access to a taxi was at least a 45-minute wait. 

Fast forward many months later, a few thousand dollars down the drain, I had lost the battle of trying to convince a judge to not stain my life with a DUI charge. However, my perspective meant nothing, I had broken the law, period. 

That sent me into a deep depression, my life had come crashing down. However, I was still in the army. I tried my best to resume training, finish it and get posted to a regiment. I chose to make the most out of my situation, get posted in the only French-speaking province in Canada &amp; try to become bilingual. My thought process was that for the 1 wrong I had committed, I needed to seek out 9 rights. I also applied for an expedited pardon process. Just when I thought I bounced back, I had developed a bad habit without realizing it; irregular sleep pattern. It was mostly due to the stress that came with realizing I had thrown my envisioned life away and without any other real skills, I was doomed to stay in the army forever. Sleeping became extremely difficult, going to work was a challenge. Eventually, the effects of this bad habit caught up to me. I would begin to wake up late. Sometimes, I would make it to work just at the last minute, other times I'd be a few minutes late. 

I began receiving warning after warning. I'd look for self-help solutions, and some would work for a brief period of time. But my negative thoughts would always return to haunt me. Once again, the warnings kept coming.

Eventually, I found myself sitting down in front of the top of the chain of command. He expressed to me that even though I fit all the criteria of a soldier with excellent potential, being late in the army is an absolute no-no. The expectations in the army are so low that the bottom line duty is to show up to work, on time. 

My commanding officer would not have me anymore in his regiment since I was such an administrative burden. He recommended me for a 5(f) release, dishonourable discharge to the army headquarters in Ottawa.

I had the option of defending myself, and I did. I poured my heart out on paper. My most compelling argument was that I had met a gem in Quebec City. The love of my life. For the first time in my life, I could finally see right past my negative emotions. She has helped me realize my potential, helped me look at my life from a bird's eye view and examine where exactly I went wrong. Most importantly, she has shown me what it feels like to truly love. I know it in my heart, that my life now is not all about me. I am now not only fighting for myself but fighting for her as well. I cannot afford to lose her. 

However, I have no real transferable skills in the civilian world. My police foundations degree is practically useless with a criminal record on file. My pardon process is due to end in December 2021. The people in Ottawa headquarters have given me another chance to defend myself, a written defence due on May 11th. If that doesn't work I will be in the street in mid-June. I cannot afford to go back to school. At the same time, my french is still not up to standard.

I have no family in Canada, my parents reside in Albania. When I was 10 years old, my mother applied through immigration to send me to live in Toronto under the care of a close friend of hers. She sent me here for a better life and I blew it. 

Nobody knows about my situation yet, I want to at least have a couple of potential avenues or solutions in hand before I reveal my situation my angel, and my parents. 

If anyone managed to read this far down, I am open to any and all suggestions, recommendations, tips or any words of advice.

Thank you, I look forward to reading the responses.



Stay safe out there, cherish your loved ones.

684,"Hey reddit, 

I have been interviewing with jobs recently and I am in a bit of a morally grey situation.  I have a service commitment to the Air Force (10 year contract- I am an officer through ROTC) but I need a job between now and my scheduled date (March 2021). In several interviews, ROTC comes up but the companies never ask for details on my military service because I am not ""technically"" a member of the military. I see two options here:

1. I have a clear conscience, but I work a minimum wage job.  It would be difficult for me to do this because like all adults I have bills to pay and I'm not so sure this would be feasible.
2. I don't bring up the contract, and when I get orders I put in my two weeks notice.  It is estimated that I will leave about 9 months from now, and many of these companies are looking for someone ""long-term."" 

I get that businesses plan for this attrition, but I worry about impacting other working-class people who may suffer due to my inability to remain at work. I was wondering if anyone had advice concerning this moral dilemma.",30Apr2020,1
685,"I'm 19 and home from college until at least late August because of COVID-19. My mom has basically started arguments daily for minor things. For example, the other day I was making chicken nuggets and my dad asked me if I could put 2 extra in for him. My mom then later started getting angry with me about how ""I never asked her if she wanted any"" (when I never asked anybody, my dad asked me to make some). Or today, I was cleaning the coffee filter so I could make some coffee and I had coffee grounds all over my hands. My dog was outside barking and she asked if I could bring him inside. I was in the middle of something and she was not, so I asked if she could then she flipped out and stomped away and slammed the door. Don't get me wrong, I love my mom. But I don't know how to deal with being stuck at home for the next few months with her while she starts big arguments over petty stuff. Any advice?

686,"This is going to be about jobs and life advice..

I am 26 and have recently completed my bachelor's degree. The problem is, when I started 4 years ago - I was in a much different head-space than I am today. I was across the country, as I have now moved, and I was in a city where I was very motivated to become a part of a business management team and/or begin my own business.

Since moving, I have had (seemingly) epiphanies and battles with depression. I have realized that I do not care about nearly anything other than family and the simple things. I do not want to go into work for an organization that I do not care about and that does not care about me. I do not have the funds to begin my own business and my credit tanked and wouldn't qualify me to pull out a loan to do so. I have battled with depressive tendencies around not feeling motivated and wishing I was normal - working a basic job each day and having the discipline to just 'do' instead of think - and especially without the thousands of dollars in student loans.

I don't want to feel bad for myself but I feel like a loser. I am not sitting in my self-pity either, I put on the fake face to apply for jobs and put on my fake face to go to the interview but when they offer me the job, I dread it. I consider not being here. I try to just force myself to go, but suddenly tears will stream down my face or I will become so stressed out that my body physically shuts down. I have never had this issue until I realized that I don't want to work. I would rather raise a family, but that is not a job that pays the bills. Right now, I am lucky enough to have a partner that pays all of the bills and I try not to live above my- er, their- means. I simply have a cell phone bill, a couple credit bills and groceries.

I really want to be normal and shake this feeling that I 'have no motivation.' Even saying it bothers me, because I do not want to reinforce or perpetuate that type of thinking. I quit smoking weed a few months ago because I thought that that was what was holding me back, turns out it wasn't and I feel these things 20x harder. I have tried meditation, looking within, and writing in a journal. I just don't know if someone has been in my shoes before and got out of it. Became normal. Stopped thinking about their lack of motivation and out-of-place feeling in this society that thrives on status and financial success.

Perhaps when people begin to answer, I can add more. I feel as though I have expressed what I am going through to a decent extent. I have a couple interviews next week, that I am confident I will talk my way through because I'm great at bullshitting. It's just when it comes time to do the same exact thing month after month, day after day, I am dreading it and want to stop thinking about it. I want to JUST DO.",30Apr2020,1
687,"So for the last six months I’ve been seeing this guy. We’ve had a lot of issues with him lying to me, he slept with his ex in the beginning of us seeing eachother, and he works a ridiculous amount and often goes out of town. He would leave me on open and delivered sometimes for days and it really fucked me up. I found out about him lying and sleeping with his ex and we took a break for a week. We hung out again and he told me how much he wanted to be with me and his only concern with us being in what he refers to as a “full blown relationship” was time because he works so much, even tho we had already been acting like we were together. Things got better and when I would call him out on shitty behavior he would fix it. We were finally doing really well and I could tell he was starting to allow himself to really care about me and not let his emotional walls stop us from being happy. We said we were exclusive but we weren’t officially bf and gf. But then Covid happened. He had to go back home to a different state since his work would be remote and he could go spend some time with his family and not have to worry about paying bills for groceries and things. He’s been gone for 2 months now. The distance was hard and we started talking less and less. He works in medical supplies and said he’s been incredibly busy which I’m sure he is but it just seemed like he was losing interest. He started talking to me less and less. Promised to call and never did. I seriously started questioning my sanity and felt as if we were in limbo since nothing about our relationship was concrete. I would ask if we were good and if he still wanted to be with me and he would say yes he’s just busy. He said he would try to come down for my bday but didn’t and forgot to call me on my bday even tho he said he would. I drunk dialed him and in the morning we decided maybe we should take a break until life settles down and he comes back home. I’m seriously in love with him and I’m fine with giving us some space but all I do is think about him. It takes every bone in my body not to text him. My friends think this is for the best and the space should be indefinite given what he’s done to me and what I’ve continued to forgive him for.

Background: I will be keeping this as vague as possible in order to hide both our identities. My ex-girlfriend and I broke up a few years ago. During the relationship she was physically and emotionally abusive. After it ended, she filed false police reports, stalked me, and the university we were at did nothing other than issue her warnings and wait for her to graduate (she was older than I was). Flash forward a few years and I log onto a social media app today and I see friends posting links to her “professional page” and other advertisements for something she is selling. At least one of these friends knows the partial story but not the whole thing as I’m kind of uncomfortable sharing the details. Regardless, I block the professional page but for now I’m still seeing the shared links and posts advertising for her. Furthermore, I feel like abusers like her shouldn’t be getting support and I feel like asking my friends to take down the posts and stop supporting her.

690,"I don’t want to be too misleading. I have an undergraduate degree after I transferred, so I’m not exactly sure what to do but I’ll rewind. I used to go to Oberlin College a few years ago for 2 and a half years. During junior year I couldn’t take my stress anxiety and depression anymore there due to personal and outside factors. I had a brief stint of serious mental illness alongside my normal anxiety and depression during that time but have since recovered from the more serious illness.  I took the spring semester off from school because of that and decided it would be best to transfer to another school close to home to finish and take care of myself at the same time. But I always felt that my degree didn’t mean much to me. To me It felt like I transferred from a prestigious school to community college. I went to a state school and finished all my classes online. Still a degree that opens doors, but to me it doesn’t mean as much since it was so easy. (Not that there is anything wrong with online classes or community college or state schools etc. I don’t want that to come across in the wrong way) I always kind of wanted to finish at Oberlin and get my degree from there. But now I’m 24, have a degree and a job and I moved out. Mental health is good and I’m not doing too bad. I could easily ride out like this for the rest of my life. But I want to do more and I want to get into different fields than what I’m currently doing. I kind of want to finish what I started at Oberlin and study arts like photography writing painting film and music. But it is one of the most expensive schools in the US, I already have a ton of loans to pay off and that was with assistance. I don’t know how I could reasonably afford it and I have a decent life even if it’s not exactly where I want to be. I have a degree even if it’s not from where I wanted it. And I have a life here. But I still have that feeling that I want the degree from there for what I want to study even if it isn’t a high paying sector of society. There are so many resources there and connections I feel like I could make. But there’s always that voice that’s like what if this is a waste of time and money what if it goes now where.

It has been hurting for 2 days, and i am sure that its because of that rubbing alcohol and not STD because as i know STDs needs more time to show up symptoms, doesn't it?.

694,"Before everyone starts asking me why I was even looking in my mum's underwear in the first place, I was looking for a box of pastel blue hair colour in my parent's bedroom that I thought she had (I have been considering trying something new to my hair in lockdown). When I reached her drawer I saw a bag of Drum Rolling tobacco barely tucked away out of sight.

This was odd to me because my mum quit smoking years ago, and last year my dad got diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. So ever since then anyone or anything that smokes in the house such as lighting incense sticks etc is not allowed anymore. Anyway, when I opened the bag I was surprised to find a small amout if weed wrapped up in a sandwich bag alongside a few papers and filters instead of tobacco. 

It may just be a false alarm but I have so many questions in my head such as why does she have weed? Is it for something medicinal that she is hiding? Is she hiding it from or for somebody else? How did she even get hold of it in the first place? Is she even considering dad's lung condition? If it weren't for my dad's health then I wouldn't care if she smoked it, but I am in a spot because if I do choose to talk to her I will have to admit I was snooping in her room.

695,"Long story short... happily married and straight 28 year old. However always been curious and never managed to act in my feeling towards pleasing hard cock. Not attracted to men just sucking and peas if thier dicks. Asked for advice before and whether is should act on it. Had a few near misses but come to nothing.

During lockdown I’ve not got the chance to meet any new men or entertain idea of meeting as it would be irresponsible with covid19 situation and sneaking out wouldn’t be as easy! 

Have had time for reflection and cock is still much on my mind. But trying to work out why? Why cock? Why? If not attracted to men. Then I read a post about a women who feels terrible and shameful but can’t not act slutty for men online even men she’s not attracted to and even if it doesn’t match their own sexual desires. And boat towed it down to wanting attention from men and hearing how hot she was from them. 

This resonated with myself and wondered if my obsession with cock stems from wanting attention from men? Trained as a nurse and went into nursing and obviously lends it self to being rather female dominated and meant I socialised and now work along side a lot of women; obviously I see men around but work along side and close friends and family is predominately women. I have friends that are men but Im bit overly close to them and not overly social. Is this my want for male companionship and banter ship and attention from other men. Is this mixed with a lot of porn warped my brain into thinking becoming a gang bang slut bottom to please multiple cocks as a way of achieving it? Just food for thought and wondered what you guys Thought? The human mind is a puzzle and my own seems to get more complex by the day haha.

On 26th August 2002 we buried a time capsule for our baby son to dig up when he turned 18. Friends and family put together all sorts of memorabilia, letters, photos, cd’s VHS tapes (that aged well...) and we’ve been talking about it ever since.

Yesterday he turned 18, and was duly dispatched with a shovel to dig up the box. It took hours but we finally got there! Sadly, despite copious amounts of sealant, the box was completely waterlogged. Some of the items in ziplock bags were salvageable but everything stinks like a swamp.

For a little context, I’m a 25 year old man from the north of Ireland, my education goes no further than GCSE level qualifications, I used to have a really good social life which has disintegrated now for reasons that aren’t entirely my own fault, I’d say I’m an average looking guy, average height at 5’10, dark hair, very skinny, my body refuses to gain weight no matter what I try lol and the main problem I’m having with Dating is that I can’t get a girl that I find attractive. Attraction is the first stage in any relationship, there needs to be mutual attraction between both people. Yet I’ve found my dating experience which is mainly comprised of tinder, consists of me swiping in a pickish manner compared to how most men use tinder. And essentially never getting matches that I want. I have tried talking to women as well who I haven’t been overly attracted to in hope that I’d love them for their personality but, in my own personal experience so many of the women I’ve spoken to are really plain, dull or boring or are just very dry because they aren’t interested in me.

I’m from the north of Ireland, I feel as though there’s a bit of a toxic case here in terms of dating because, from what I’ve seen online, women in countries like America seem to be much less picky and much more forward and will speak their minds more freely. Here, the women seem really old fashioned and i feel like women only look “up the social ladder” if thats what you wanna call it. They will only go for guys who are aesthetically pleasing, meaning a small % of hyper attractive guys with a good career who get the pick of who they want. They never ever make the first move, and having seen girl friends’ tinder accounts for example, the sheer amount of men they are able to freely choose from in comparison to what I’m able to choose from is worlds apart. 

So TLDR. I’m an average guy who can’t get a girlfriend that I’m really attracted too, and I really don’t know what to do. I’m 25, The years feel like they’re going by quicker, and I’m afraid that I’ll be 30 and single in the blink of an eye. I just don’t know what to do. I’m sure I’ll get responses saying I need to lower my standards but A). I can’t help who I’m attracted to and B). I have tried to converse with women who I am not so attracted to and there’s just nothing there, it’s uninteresting and there’s no spark of excitement or anticipation.",30Apr2020,1
699,"For starters, my mom was pregnant with me from 1998-99 and apparently could not quit smoking at this time, even for her unborn child. She continues to smoke till this day. She also does many things out of spite. The biggest of which is becoming an alcoholic. She claims that since my father had drinking issues she retaliated back by drinking even more, leaving their  child to pick up the pieces of the broken family. Even after my father became sober she continued to drink herself to sleep every night, often falling asleep at the kitchen table. A consequence of this drinking was that she was never available to give me rides anywhere before I got my license, even for school events and sports. She also is the opposite of a hoarder meaning any object or thing in her house that is out of place or has no use to her goes in the garbage. Over the years this has included most of my childhood toys, tons of important papers, and many other things. Most recently she has gotten sober and has fixed a lot of the above issues but she is still extremely selfish. She barely gets off the couch unless it is to work or eat. She barely cooks dinner, gets groceries or does anything around the house except clean the kitchen and make coffee. Resulting in me and my dad (who works crazy hours, either overnight or all day) to scramble to get stuff done. The worst part of this is that she uses her personality as justification saying “I’ve always been selfish, you just have to deal with it”. What happened today is the reason I am writing this post. It was the straw that broke the camels back. She refused to go to the grocery store because “it is raining”. I don’t know why but it got me angry and thinking about her past behavior. There are definitely things I am leaving out but you can for sure fill in the blanks.

701,"Hello Everyone, 
So I'd like to start off by providing some context. I live in a state where marijuana is legal and I am of the legal age to buy and use the stuff. Where I live, Smoking weed is becoming normal quickly and like many people, I like getting high. I mostly smoke at the end of the day to relax and enjoy the free time that I have. I never smoke when I have responsibilities to take care of such as work, school, or family gatherings or any other things that I shouldn't be stoned for. I strictly get high on my own time when I won't bother anyone and I'd like to think that I use weed responsibly. 
Now that all of the context is out of the way, On to my issue:
 
My girlfriend and I have a very strong relationship and things are going really well. We are living on our own and recently adopted a dog. 
I have tried having a conversation with my girlfriend directly about my thoughts and feelings regarding my use of weed but she doesn't think that smoking weed is in my best interest. I dont feel comfortable talking about my issue with my family or friends about this because my social circle is very tight and don't really want this topic to circulate among those people. 
My girlfriend is not anti-marijuana, nor is she the controlling type. She actually believes that the idea of being independent but also partners at the same time is an important characteristic in a relationship, as do I (I've expressed this before in the conversation the two of us had). She has said that she doesn't want to date a stoner and to me, That is totally reasonable. 
I am having an internal conflict of trying to balance making her happy but also not limiting what I want to do because of her opinions. I know that she is just trying to watch out for me but at the end of the day I am an adult and can make my own decisions for myself. I am aware that I don't NEED to smoke, But I enjoy smoking weed like someone would enjoy having a beer or a glass of wine at the end of the day. I understand that you get more intoxicated by smoking weed than by having a drink but I prefer weed much more than I do alcohol. (my stomach doesn't like alcohol very much). I don't really know what to do about my situation.
Any insight would be very much appreciated. 
Thanks!",30Apr2020,1

So I was walking around in the city today (no lockdown here) and I passed by a cute guy with his dog. We quickly locked eyes and smiled to each other. But we were walking opposite directions. But 20mins in my walk, so 20mins after this happened, I realise he is walking behind me (I saw his reflection on the glass of a shop i walked by). So anyways, Im a pretty fast walker and I walked some more. And like 30mins later (so like 1h since we locked eyes), i take a left and i notice he is still there. I walk some more and i think he gave up and was like ""fuck it im not walking that much"" cuz i lost him at some point lol.

So a bit of backstory, my dad has gone bankrupt twice before leaving my mam in an IVA. I have 4 siblings and then my mam living in a three bedroom house, surviving off of the local corner shops dodgy low priced food to make do. After all this, finances have become everything to me. 

I’ve deliberately taken a gap year to focus on earning an income to afford a car, insurance and backup. I’m on a solid wage earning ~£300 a week. I’ve been saving £100 a week into a tax free ISA, which now sits at ~£1400, and I pay £80 board a week. This leaves around £120 a week which I usually use on extra food, clothing, etc. I now want to start saving for future (1-5 years) so I can move out and be comfortable financially. The catch from me getting a high interest fixed savings account is come July I’m unemployed and September I’m a student once more.

707,"I have a job as an automation engineer and I get to work from home. My boss just quit and I may have to take on his responsibilities. My boss quit because he couldn't handle the job, he has 10 years in this field. I have a degree in electrical engineering and this job is more computer based with no training. I have a total of 3 years of engineering experience and I want to go back to electrical engineering. I picked this role to have a more focused position where my previous role was to throw me into anything they didn't have an expert in.

The EE jobs in Dallas are scarce, but I still want a more focused role, like schematic drawing in AutoCAD or PCB design, I'm almost finished doing PCB training on udemy. All in all, Dallas just doesn't have many EE positions that I can apply to, I'm wondering if I should move but this pandemic has shut off some borders.

My lease is up June 12th. So I'm unsure if I should move in with my mom or room with my sister, they both live in mesquite (SE Dallas), not a great area for EE jobs. I live in Addison (NW Dallas), it's a middle for jobs in Dallas and Fort Worth.

This job makes me suicidal, it concerns PLCs and HMI at a massive scale with no training. I may need to test IO points at the end of May, I can barely connect to a PLC to do so.

712,"(I'm not a native english speaker so please forgive me if I fail to make it clear)

&amp;#x200B;

So, currently I'm in first year in art school. I met here someone and got quite friendly with her (wouldn't say we're \*friends\* but we were closer than just classmates). It happens that we have in common the fact that we're both trans (I'm a trans dude, stealthy, she's a trans girl, not out, so we're both seen as guys without anyone else knowing we're trans). I know she has some problems with her family and she can't come out and it makes her quite sad. Also, we had a common friend in our class who died in december and we were part of those who were the closest to him (in our class at least). She was feeling REALLY bad about it and ended up having panic attacks.

But

Not long after the friend died, she made a bad joke about it, probably trying to lighten up the mood and it totally backfired.

Aaaaaand she changed school, now apparently living her best life, as much as I can see.

The problem is :

Basically everyone in my class hates her for the bad joke (i think ? I can't really think of another reason).

In our class group chat (where she isn't since she changed school) they post her drawings and basically roast it. They're saying really... not nice stuff. Even one of her friends (if I can say that...) from high school does it, he's even starting rumors about her too...

And I really don't know what to do.

I mean, she's doing okay. She has a new school, she's doing pretty good, apparently she has nice classmates. Do I have to bother her with that ? Do I just try to stop the others while not talking to her about it ? I can't tell them that she has it hard too because they'll just mock her and say that she wasn't even the closest person to the friend who died (which is true, but still). And I absolutely don't want to out her by saying that she's trans and that's why she needs to be treated with compassion since it's not easy. (I mean, she had quite a lot of identity crisis and I can understand very well how it affects her mental health)

I obviously don't participate in the bullying (?) but that makes me so MAD that I don't know what to do. Even when she was still in my school, she didn't actually have any problems with the others (just one time she had one, I helped her with it, but it's the only one I can think of and I thought it ended pretty well). I just happened to hear the others talk badly about her, but it wasn't nearly as bad back then as it is now. 

Should I just let it slide and hope to see them stop by themselves since she's not even in our school anymore ? Should I talk to her about it and maybe making her super sad since she doesn't know about it ? Or just stand up for her against all of my class (and probably failing since I'm not really... ""strong"" when it comes to arguing) ?

My boyfriend and I ordered door dash Popeyes and when the food came I got an incredibly weird feeling in my gut like something did not feel right. We realized the driver forgot to hand us our chicken which was weird and we realized they were probably trying to take it for themselves. My boyfriend had to call twice to get them to turn back around and was outside dealing with it for like 5-10 minutes. I start munching on the fries and biscuits and immediately about 5 minutes later I start to feel really anxious and out of it. It kept getting worse so I was hoping that I was just having a panic attack and maybe I would calm down even though I felt like something was wrong. Almost immediately I fell onto the bed because I felt like I was going to die at this point. I literally felt like I was in a different place and had no concept of reality and couldn’t form coherent sentences and made my boyfriend keep touching my arms to make sure I was really here. I really thought I was going to die. Like my body parts were going numb and I couldn’t form sentences and I thought I was having a stroke or something. This starts around 6 pm. I don’t remember anything from 6-8 and have foggy memories from 8-10 when I literally passed out in the bed and woke up at 1 with a severe headache, nausea, and body aches. We realized about an hour in at like 7 that they drugged our food with something before my boyfriend got a chance to eat the biscuit which is what we think was drugged so he was like conscious to take care of me. I decided not to go the the ER because of the covid stuff and I felt lucid enough and trusted my boyfriend enough to just ride out whatever they put in my food. I called the my school clinic the following morning to go try and get drug tested. They said since it had been more than 12 hours it had probably metabolized out of my system so a drug test wouldn’t show anything. They asked if I had been raped I said obviously not because the people never came back. So they said just get lots of rest and drink lots of fluids and just kind of cope with what went on. My mom called Popeyes and they found footage of our driver picking up the food completely sealed and closed with a sticker (neither of which was on our food when it got to us).

720,"Hi everyone. I have kept it in me for too long and i'm ready to talk now.   
When I was 13 i met a stranger online and we got to know each other well. He seemed nice and funny and thoughtful, so I fell in love with this man yet I didn't know his exact age by the time. This one time we met, he seemed quite old (he was 40) but it didn't matter for me then and we started dating: taking long walks, talking. 

He was married to some woman and had a son a little younger than me but he said that he's not happy at home. I felt that I was deceived but couldn't do anything about it as he made big promises to leave his other family for me. He actually did divorce his wife 3 years into dating me but it didn't make me feel good. When I was 14, I lost my virginity with this man while his wife wasn't home. He always said that age doesn't matter for true love. It felt okay but quite **odd** as I didn't really understand nor need sex at the time but he said he loves me and wanted to kiss me and touch me and all that. Whenever I said I didn't want to have an intercourse with him, he accused me of not loving him. I felt obligated to **love** him back. I was interested in him cause he is a brilliant man, ph.d. and professor at our local university and he used to tell me everything about science. **I thought sex was a way to thank him for his attention to me** as I had no friends at school and difficult relationship with parents and was lonely and he was such an interesting, deep person. Our relationship lasted 6,5 years and just now I realized I was unhappy all this time and broke up with him like a month ago. When we broke up, he told me that I **betrayed** him and he will never forgive me. All this years he took care of me, he helped me and supported me, **nurtured me** and was a big influence. He told me he loved me. And now I am 20 and just wondering what was it? **Did I really deceive him and break his heart? Did he rape me and use me at 13?** Did he make me think that I am the bad one here and he is just a victim with all the sincere love for me?

724,"Hello,

I have been attending group therapy. Since the pandemic, the therapist has switched to using Zoom. Therapist refuses to purchase Zoom, so we get cut off after 40 minutes of meeting--we're usually in session for about an hour, sometimes a bit more. From the sounds of it, the therapist has 3-4 session with people (including the group) per week, so they don't want to ""invest"" in Zoom. Once Zoom disconnects--when we're in session, it's difficult to get back into the right mindset--especially since there's usually complications with getting back on. 

It is my opinion that therapist is being unprofessional by splitting up the meeting because they refuse to pay $14.99/month for the cheapest plan on Zoom (which is more than sufficient for our group). The therapist is already maximizing money by hosting a group session, so it really doesn't make sense to me why they don't wan to purchase the cheapest monthly plan. 

Anyways, I'm not sure if I'm just feeling entitled, or if I have a valid point. Opinions and advice welcome. Thanks!",30Apr2020,1

I have a friend &amp; we became close around January from University (both 1st years on the same course that commute from the same area) and grew stronger up, even resulting in my training her until this lock-down issue occurred. I feel like we've drifting one or two weeks after it started which makes me upset because, just as a person, I like to bond to a select few people and never lose a connection; I haven't before lost anyone (that I regarded as a true friend anyway) and honestly she means a lot to me (i say this in a purely platonic fashion, trust me on that). 

But then I'm thinking, should I let her drift or not? Long story short, she has a man who isn't controlling as such but just doesn't trust guys in general and I think he's been making her suspicious that I might have ill-intent (like trying to 'move to her' for instance, despite the fact I've never met or even talked to him) or just is forcing a wedge between us. And I know it's caused arguments between them about me specifically and guys in general &amp; I want her to be happy, with or without me. Coming off that last point, as an argument for still trying to talk to me or whatever (and she means this sincerely), she says I'm repulsive and every appearance-insult under the sun, which again I feel hurt by **not because she thinks that about me,** but because she says it to my face and it's just rude. Plus she can get quite aggressive during during arguments which she seems to have with everyone but it's annoying and tiring.

In other words I don't know whether to take this slow but definite drift as a consequence of the lock-down or just that our friendship should pass.

So I guess I've got two questions a) should I let this friendship die, on purpose or maybe let it occur naturally b) if i shouldn't, any tips on how to strengthen it?",30Apr2020,1

Come college, I got accepted into the top university in our area. However, in my first year, I took it--again--for granted and didn't take my courses seriously. I spent time on things and relationships which didn't matter. So, I got failing grades and I had to transfer to another degree so I won't get kicked out. I kind of improved when I transferred, but of course I was delayed for a year. In my final year in college, my GPA reached the requirement for the Latin Honors. Little did I know, shiftees from other courses are disqualified for the said award.

I got accepted again to the top law school in our area. The same thing happened. I wasted time and money on irrelevant things, thought to myself that I came from the top university so I'd have ease in law school. Since I came from a top school when I was in college, everyone expected more from me too. So it boosted my confidence that I'd be able to wing it anyway.

Sadly, I got KICKED OUT immediately on my first year.

It took a toll on me and my pride. I didn't tell anyone about it. Only my peers in law school knew that I got dismissed from it.

I applied again to another law school. This time, the school is not well-known in the field. I'm starting over again. But law school is just a different world. I'm trying my best now, and I passed all my subjects in my first term. But my grades so far are just merely passing grades. And even if I study so hard for exams, I just barely make it. Even though I study way too hard, get few hours of sleep, and concentrate... i just merely pass. I don't excel. I feel like I'm behind everyone, and now I think it's karma for me for taking my academics for granted.

Now, with the quarantine and all, I couldn't stop remembering my past mistakes, my wrong decisions, and the what-could-have-beens. I also came across the profile of one of my highschool classmates. She's also in law school now, and already in her third year. She is excelling in it, didn't get delayed at all in her whole academic life, and even graduated with the highest GPA in the whole batch when she was in college. I thought to myself, although she studied in a small school in college, she's still excelling now. I can't help but feel jealous and hate myself for everything I did in the past.

College visits cancelled, internships cancelled, SATs postponed, and upcoming online AP tests have all been weighing down on me. That along with accumulated stress from school work thay mostly has to be self-taught has been a killer for me.

I have been a pretty good student throughout school in terms of academics. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA all through out highschool, but yet I still put pressure on my self, and I don’t what is prompting it. My mom is one of the most supportive people in my life and has never put anything close to the amount of pressure I have put on myself in regards to grades or academics. Yet, I still find myself extremely stressed and overwhelmed often.

Whenever something goes wrong on an assignment, test, homework, or project I start to get nervous, and think about my grades. I have done this countlessly, but it has mainly started in highschool. I don’t know why I do it, but the pressure to maintain my GPA and get into a good school has overwhelmed me, even though I haven’t been pressured by many outside sources. It has recently gotten bad, my entire day can be ruined, and yesterday I found my self so out-of-it I went to sleep right after I ate.

I’m not sure what to do, but I know I need to get better at managing stress, and even avoiding it building up over little things. Perhaps my idea of maintaining a perfect GPA is causing it, but I want to value my happiness more. The thing I’m worried about most is that this will become a habit for me, to build up stress, and that it will cause health problems later in life.

I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone can give me. I’m sorry if this post was confusing or disorganized.",30Apr2020,1
734,"I’m 19 and I am messy and lazy naturally. My bedroom is an absolute tip. When I left for university it was turned into a storage room and there’s so much stuff I really don’t want to deal with it. It’s so overwhelming to me. Plus I’m scared of spiders.

My boyfriend wants me to make it clean and empty. I would love that too but I just can’t deal with all this mess by myself. My parents are too busy to help with it so I’m just stuck. 

I want to make my boyfriend happy but my messy room is getting in the way. 

Plus I have another issue, I keep eating and eating because I’ve been feeling quite depressed and anxious lately and junk food just numbs the feelings. I’m in denial that it’s a problem because I haven’t really gained any weight but I can easily eat 4000+ calories a day. 

I’m not sure how I can fix my room if I don’t want to do it but my boyfriend wants me to so desperately because it’s bothering him. I’m also not sure how I can eat better. I’m addicted to junk food now.

I just want things to go back to normal when I wasn’t an anxious mess. Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve to do nice things for myself because I feel like I’m not worth it because I feel so bad. 

I’m really lost. And I love my boyfriend dearly but my room is just a huge obstacle I cannot get over.",30Apr2020,1

I recently purchases the [Jabra Elite Active 75t](https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-active-75t#/#100-99091000-02), which most websites had stated should be a fantastic fit - they are made for working out, after all.

Both of us didnt communicate at all and we didnt see other on campus. It's been 3 months and I feel bad for ghosting. A big part of it has been me just putting off messaging her until it became awkwardly long.

741,"Before anyone starts reading this, I need to include some important details: My girlfriend has a pretty serious eating disorder and her mom (who she still lives with) has always made pretty cruel comments on my girlfriend’s body and weight almost daily.

I think everything started a few weeks ago when she found out my weight, which is about 4 kg more than what counts as normal for my height. Before she knew my weight she even used to say that she didn't understand how I could think I was fat.

The first comment I remember was ""you need to lose weight"", just like that. I don't remember all the details or what more she said, but I got hurt. We talked about it and she apologized eventually.

But this wasn't the last time it happened. About a week ago, she said something like ""I don't want to gain weight, I don't want to look like you. Just no!"". We talked about it and she said she didn't mean to hurt me and that what she really meant was that she doesn't wanna weigh as much as I do and that it wouldn't look good on her. I let it go since I've seen how this disease makes her obsess and panic over numbers.

Today she said another thing: ""I don't know any girl who wants to look like you or your friend x. Maybe there's something wrong with you""(she was referring to our weight). I told her that she was hurting me with all these comments, but she didn't seem to realize it or care. She even said more things like ""You're overweight. Stop blaming me or society... Maybe you should stop eating so much and lose weight. Having hamburger and french fries for dinner won't help"". (I had told her earlier today that I was gonna celebrate a national holiday today by making homemade hamburger).

I'm telling her that she's hurting me but she doesn't seem to care/understand, and it makes me so angry. She says she just wants to help and that I'm taking things to personally. How is ""I don't know any girls who wanna look like you"" not personal??? I think it's so disrespectful, these things are not something you should say to your significant other. It's one thing to maybe mention that you're concerned about your partner's weight, but that's not what she's doing.

I don' know if I'm overreacting or not, but this is really hurting me. I feel terrible every time she makes one of these comments. It feels like she's not attracted to me and wants me to change not to be healthier, but so that I can be more like she wants. I feel so unattractive and unappreciated. I love her body but it seems like she hates mine. She has said that she's attracted to me on several occasions ,but it's really hard to feel attractive when she keeps commenting like this.

I think she's projecting her eating disorder thoughts onto me... She's a good person and I've seen how terrible she feels when she ends up hurting someone. I really don't think she's hurting me on purpose... But it doesn't make it any less hurtful. I love her so much and she's lovely apart from this, but she just won't stop mentioning my weight or body. It's really putting me down, and I hate that she doesn't even agree that this is mean.

I just wanna know if I'm overreacting and how to handle this…

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend (who has an eating disorder and lives with her mom who constantly makes cruel comments about weight) has started to make insensitive comments about my weight and body since she found out my weight a few weeks ago. She has said things like ""you need to lose weight"" and ""I don't know any girl who wants to look like you"". She says she just wants to help but she's hurting me badly. We've talked about it before and she has apologized, but today it happened again. What should I do?",30Apr2020,1
742,"Hi all, first time posting here and on mobile so I’m really sorry for any weird formatting issues and etc. I definitely would appreciate some advice as I feel like I’m in quite a predicament.

So over the past couple of months, a close friend’s (27m) dog has been having some health issues and been slowly declining. Things came to a head a couple of days ago as his ~11yr old black lab started to refuse food and sleep, and seemed unable to walk around without constantly bumping into things (this is all by my friend’s account - I haven’t seen him in person or his dog since stay at home orders). A trip to the vet two days ago revealed that the dog’s liver was in bad shape and a surgery costing around $2200 was needed if they were to help his dog, and my friend started a GoFundMe late that night. Yesterday morning, he had raised ~$1400, but the vet ended up suggesting to put the dog down in an effort to not make things worse and end the dog’s suffering. My friend took the vet’s advice and laid his dog to rest. Having recently lost a dog myself, I (23f) know how awful it can be to lose a best friend in this way, and I know my friend has been feeling really awful since yesterday.

Now onto the problem. Because the dog never had the treatment/surgery, I’ve been thinking of a way to reach out about the GoFundMe donations that have been raised. I myself donated $200, and while I really wanted to help, I think it would be most fair if my friend, as the creator of the campaign, refunded everyone who donated. I’m not the most tight on money right now, but I also feel “off” knowing my money isn’t going towards the original “cause” to which I donated. I honestly feel like such an asshole for thinking about the money (and maybe I am), but I cannot think of an appropriate way to bring this up to my friend without seeming like a total ass. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to approach this with my friend? I don’t want to make him more upset, but I would also like to be refunded, which only the creator of the campaign can do.",30Apr2020,1

I’m really annoyed. I bought an item on sale from a high end retailer advertised as a “mini crossbody bag” and received a tiny coin purse on a wrist chain. This particular retailer has an issue with sending damaged or incorrect items repeatedly. I’m never buying anything from them again. I was really excited about getting a mini crossbody for a good price and instead, got a tiny coin purse. I emailed them and asked if they’d be able to take this back and send me the purse. They are insisting that they can only let me return and don’t do exchanges. I feel like in this particular case of them sending me the wrong item, this is not even the first time but anyway, they should do the courtesy of sending me what I actually paid for. Is there anything I can say or do? I was quite excited for it and got really upset when I saw a coin purse in the box, rather than an actual bag..",30Apr2020,1

So a few days ago my mom noticed weird behavior on her iphone, like payment for another Spotify account she doesn’t have and her Touch ID fingerprint deleted, which she didn’t delete herself, apps disappearing and downloading by themselves. I think maybe she was hacked by some random hacker controlling her phone remotely, but doesn’t the hacker physically have to have the phone available the first time to do that?

Today she came up to my room out of the blue to ask me to hide her laptop somewhere in my bedroom and told me she suspects my dad spying on her phone with some kind of software (proxy??? I don’t know) and last week my mom said he had suspicious behavior, going to the bathroom, but actually going to the bedroom instead multiple times? And my mom hates Bluetooth, doesn’t want anything to do with it thus never uses it unless if it’s completely necessary, and apparently her phone has been paired with a PlayStation controller??? My brother has one of those so idk.

She called customer support with my dad’s phone because she can’t even make calls with her own now? But I don’t know exactly what they talked about other than someone has been spying on her with Bluetooth and the signals come from our home? I’m not sure, I’m just writing from what I can remember my mom told me.

Sorry for being all over the place and not having concrete details, but my mom is really stressed, rightly so, and I wanna help her as best as I can and find out if my dad actually is spying on her, and also why he would do such a thing in the first place. Paying for another Spotify acc when they share one? Reinstalling apps such as iMovie? It’s bizarre and I genuinely don’t know why my dad would do such a thing. 

They have had big and small fights and I’m home all the time so I hear what they say to each other most of the time and my mom thinks that the reason he would do this is to see if she’s cheating? Dad gets jealous easily according to my mom and my mom is ALWAYS home. She doesn’t work so she can’t actually be out cheating with someone. And still, if this was the reason, why would he be paying for a randos Spotify account and reinstall random apps and deleting them? I’m just very confused about this situation because I don’t know everything, I haven’t used my mom’s phone to look at what’s wrong so... what should I do? How can I help my mom?

Please ask questions if that would help you to figure this out, I’ll try my best to answer.

I don’t cause trouble at all and I’m actually pretty quiet so I don’t really see the issue. They then threatened to turn my WiFi off at 9pm. (They did this before).

750,"Yes I believe that’s right. here’s the backstory, I’ll keep it abbreviated.

I had less babysitters than I can count on one hand as a kid - and the last one, I think, was recommended by my cousin. My cousin had babysat me once but didn’t want to again, and I think that he recommended someone* - keyword think. I’m not sure. My memory of any of this is hazy.

Now, being as this was the last babysitter to take care of me, I was pretty much okay on my own. This particular sitter I remember having come over then I went and played video games all night leaving her on the couch (pro gamer move). We may have chatted and hung out the first time and/or subsequent times, but I hardly remember. Anyway she only came over couple times before she stopped babysitting me and that was the end of me having babysitters. 

Here’s the juice. I’m in college now as a junior, and I have depression. I’ve been seeing counselors and therapists for a few years now. However, because of coronavirus I need to find a counselor back in my home town (I go to college in a different city). 

So, I sent a bunch of emails to psychologists on a website and call it a day. I get a few responses, one with a name/face that seems extremely vaguely familiar, but so vague I easily write it off. Anyway I have my first meeting over soon with her today, and I swear right after I ended the call it clicked for me. The last name, it WAS familiar. I checked her out on Facebook and she’s mutual friends with only one person I know - the cousin I said might have recommended her. 

Now this makes me like 85-90% sure but I’m not certain, but at this point I think it’s pretty likely that my memory isn’t just juking me out.

what do? lol. Should I bring this up with her? How should I approach bringing it up? Is it like even cool for her to be my therapist if she knew about this? Idk this is all very weird for me. Looking for advice on how to handle it.

Hello! I’ve been dating my boyfriend for around a year now and he can be really mean to me. He’s constantly saying I’m a whore because I had social media before I met him and he says I’ll cheat on him. He hates when I spend any time away from him and gets really angry with me and asks me if we should break up.
I desperately want to make my relationship work because other than this behaviour, he is the most perfect man I could hope to be with.

My parents, due to them both being immunodeficient and my dad having cancer, have told me if I go to live with my boyfriend that I can’t come back until this is over. The issue being that every time I stay with my boyfriend, I end up attempting suicide because I see no other way out from him constantly yelling at me. I know I sound immature for wanting to make this work but I’ll never find a better man than him. 
If I leave to save my relationship and stay with him, then I may end up having to be homeless for a few months if he ends up being mean to me to that extent. But if I stay at home, I’ll lose my boyfriend. I don’t know how to handle this and they’re both so angry at me for even being in this situation.

763,"Last year, I was diagnosed with asthma. In recent weeks I've noticed it becoming worse. I mean that it's very very bad.

My coughing at night has only worsened by an incredible amount. I cough and cough until very early hours of the morning and it doesn't stop. If I'm not coughing, I'm having an asthma attack.

A few weeks ago, I probably had the worst asthma attack I've ever experienced in my life so far. It lasted from around midnight to 9:00pm. I was coughing constantly, my chest felt tighter than ever and I just could not breathe. My entire body just felt weak and achey all over, especially around where my lungs are. My blue inhaler (Ventolin) did absolutely nothing to ease it. 

My boyfriend went to Hell and back to help me get through it. He brought me hot drinks, opened the window for fresh air, rubbed my back and even fetched me a huge bowl of hot water to that I could inhale the steam in hopes it would open my airways. 

He stayed up with me all night caring for me and he continues to do so now. For clarification, I don't make him stay up with me. He does it because he wants to and its very sweet of him.

Now, I have not left the house at all during the whole entirety of the lockdown. Sometimes I will go and sit in the back garden occasionally for some fresh air and to play with my dog. 

My work has furloughed me as my boss allowed us to choose whether to continue to come into work as normal or stay at home. After a lot of thinking, the obvious idea was to stay at home. It wouldn't be fair to put everyone in the home at risk.

However, my Furlough has ended and I got a call today asking when I would be coming back to work. With my asthma acting up the way it is and a fatal respiratory virus flying around I honestly don't want to go back just yet. 

I explained this to my work and they asked me to get some medical advice and get back to them. I should mention that my workplace is absolutely not essential work and I don't have the slightest clue why they're still open for business. 

I've been contemplating all day (I'm an incredibly anxious person so please don't judge me) and I don't know whether to go and see a Doctor or maybe call 111 because they're non emergency and can give advice.

I spoke to my mother via Skype earlier (I don't have a great relationship with her) and she told me that I would be 'stupid to end up losing my job' and  'miss out on all the opportunities that my job has to offer' . Her words not mine. 

She said that my asthma 'isn't even that bad' . Again, her words not mine. This is infuriating because I don't even live with her anymore and she has not seen anything I've been through in these past couple of weeks. Now I'm scared and anxious about losing my job.

What should I do? I live in the UK and I'm thinking that the best idea is to call a Doctor or maybe call 111? I honestly don't know and I'm a stressed wreck right now.

We clicked quickly our conversations lasted for 3 months before I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes, but after a months of dating she told me that this relationship won’t work and it’s hard she said. So I respect her I told her that “ Will u wait for me please, I promise you after 10 years I’ll meet you in anyway possible even if you’ll have someone else I’ll keep this as promise.” Then we broke up and I found out she was dating someone else and it makes me so broken.

Then I told myself that I’ll forget about her I met 5 different people for the last years but no matter what I do she’s still in my mind. I know this is crazy but to be honestly I promise her 10 years because of my financial problem, I live in the Philippines and going to another country is hard, and I have to work hard! That time I was in my 4th year of High School and I promise I’ll always keep that promise for her. To be honestly I lost contact with her she don’t have social media anymore but I only have contact with her brother but it’s hard to ask to his brother if how is she? Because we don’t talk that much.

774,"(19 male)

It may seem a bit edgy, “how do I act like a normal kid?”

But I do actually have a good reason for asking this.

From birth, I was abused. Not in the “when I was eight my parents hit me” way. I mean I’ve been hospitalized from the age of three. From three to six I was abused by an older brother, and not in the brotherly way. He would hold me down and pull my arm back until it would pull out of its socket, he cut me with knives, the thing that got him finally kicked out was when he got in my bed in the middle of the night and attempted to strangle me.

From then on it was my parents. From 6-10 I was raised with no rules whatsoever. No schedule to brush teeth, no showers, maybe dinner if I was lucky, and no therapy to help me through what I went through.

After my father died at 10, it got worse.

From 10-12 my mother took out her grief on me, and she was likely too drugged up to remember. We lived in a trailer park where she prioritized meth over food, she even lost her teeth within a year. You can imagine all of the mental growth I’ve had up to this point.

So here is my question.

I’m a college student now, and I never know what I’m doing. We never took the time to help me develop healthy habits or help me process what happened. I’m still hit with horrible suicidal thoughts, and I was too afraid to do it or open up about it because of how it could hurt my grandmother (moved in at 12). 

When I finally opened up, she brushed me off.

Even now I find myself struggling to not think about it. I’m behind, I’m so far behind everyone else because I never had the chance to grow up. What do I do? The only thing I can think of is to stop struggling now and just die while I’m still under a proper roof.

I do not see myself ever being a normal functioning person, and it’s not because I’m an edgy asshole. It’s because I’m probably an edgy asshole.

Anyways, what should I do about this kind of thing?

1. Don’t know where to find mental help

2. Can’t afford it

3. Before you say “get a job”, please inform me of a place that will take in someone who is clearly too mentally unstable to handle a proper job (plus, I’m a bit crippled Chief, no joints and all)

775,"So I just moved out of my apartment (couldn't pay rent due to losing my job because of covid19) and when we all moved in a little over a year ago we all split a household appliance.

It's not that much money, however the one roommate that is on the lease has been so terrible about this being her apartment we're just living in it and an absolute control freak about everything she owns in the apartment. I just asked for money for the appliance and she said she doesn't agree paying the money since we all bought it over a year ago ""for the apartment""

I texted her that if she had purchased it, she would have this thought, and that it's not fair if we all move out one by one she is left with a $100 appliance for only $33 dollars. 

This, along with her shit attitude and the fact that when I go back I'm fully expecting to see a bag I left and have to pick up and the front of the steps has brought me to wondering if I should call the landlord and tell him she has snuck in a 4th person in the apartment and is only paying rent for 3 people. Everyone in the apartment has a job right now, and it would be an extra $100 for each of them a month. 

We lived like that for a few months, I just don't think it's fair that I get the short end of the stick for such a horrible person. But maybe I'm just pissed and shouldn't pull the trigger like that.

777,"This is my first post so please forgive me if I it was hard to read.

To begin with, I really liked computers and thought to myself I'm going to be the best programmer ever(lol) but after starting college,I really didn't connect with any of the classes they taught. The professors would come and read the contents off of the screen and walk away. I thought that this is the start and it's supposed to be like that and after 4 years that's what they did all the time. They would assign projects and everyone in the class would copy/paste the code found on the internet(some of them had submitted the code found literally on the first link of the search) and the professors would accept it without a second guess, so a piece of shit like myself did the same thing.

After the 2nd year of college passed, I thought maybe I'll learn by myself from the internet. So, everytime I would apply for a few online courses and everytime(I never felt it was difficult) but I'd just get demotivated and never complete it and go hangout with my friends.

I should've been an unemployed graduate by now but due to the current situation I'm at home and have only my finals left to complete and soon I'll be unemployed as I have no skills whatsoever.

None of my friends with whom I attended highscool with went to college, they're working at their dad's shops(retail stores) and they're happy with that, they tell me to do the same thing(my dad also owns a retail store) but I don't want to do that. I'm not disrespecting them or the profession but I don't want to be someone that stays under my father's shadows forever and i want to make something out of myself.

Due to the pandemic, me and 2 others went home in late March. I paid for my share of the bill that month. However, there is still one other person who wanted to stay at the apartment to be with their significant other till the semester is over in May.

I said that this person should pay for those two months as they and their s/o will be the only ones using the electricity. In the remaining months of our lease (June-August) we will continue to split whatever is billed to us, as it will be completely vacant so it’s only fair that way.

During lunch today, a conversation with my Asian mom turned toxic which resulted in a shouting match and crying on my part. And I missed a meeting at work (with 2 other person). 

I told a white lie to my colleague that my live-in grandmother had a fall. I did not want want her to know how screwed up my family is. She showed concern about my grandmother, etc.. Then I saw a message notification which my colleague, actually a nice person, sent before deleting that she is convinced I fell asleep and missed the meeting.

We had a call later, where I 'expanded' a bit on the white lie. Like I'm tired of taking care of my grandmother, and my family. And ranted a bit about on how stressed I am with my family. I'm not sure if I convinced her that I was not sleeping. 

We are about the same age and same rank at work. She is also kind and is like a friend at work too. I can let it go but I don't want her to think that I'm lazing at work.  I don't think anything significant will change if I own up now tbh. Not sure what to do. I can probably expand further in the lie by saying, 'You know the time my grandmother had a fall?

So to preface this post I want to make sure the setting is right in everyone’s mind. I am 19 now and I’ve been off in college for a while until I ran out of money due to the corona virus. I had to move back home with my parents who live in a super rural town, my graduating class was probably like 80. 

I am struggling because in college I haven’t had any issues finding girls, but throughout high school I was a pretty depressed guy who kept to himself and just got stoned most the time. I have met some people at parties but mostly everyone knows me as pretty timid and parties aren’t really happening for the time being. I have since then grew to be much more extroverted but everyone from high school just knows how I used to act.

Since the corona virus quarantine doesn’t seem to be lifting anytime soon and online schools didn’t treat me well I’m realistically looking at staying with my parents potentially after quarantine as well, I’m thinking I need a girlfriend to keep me sane staying with my parents. I really don’t know how to even start talking to girls from around here because in my mind they’ll see me as who I was in high school and not be interested whatsoever.

If anyone more experienced in life than I am had any advice or some external viewpoint that I’m just overthinking things I’d really appreciate it.

784,"Kind of a weird situation but I would appreciate thoughts. I’m a graduate student getting my Masters in Social Work, and finishing up my required internship at a counseling agency. 

The way my program works is you’re supposed to get an entry level internship for one semester, take some more advanced classes, and then at a new agency complete two advanced semesters. When I got my starter internship, I was asked by the agency if I could complete all three semesters there due to the client base being high risk and fast turnover not being good. I discussed this with my school and everyone agreed for me to complete three consecutive semesters at this agency for all my internship credits. 

The hiccup occurred after my first semester. I tried to sign up for the advanced internship option, and was told I hadn’t completed the proper pre-reqs. I guess there was one class required to take prior to the advanced internship credits - no one told me that, so suddenly my school was telling me I had to leave my agency, complete that course, and then come back after. That would be impossible to keep the relationship with my agency, since I had clients I was doing weekly counseling with. My supervisor at my agency advocated for me, but I was told my options were to either leave the agency and figure something out after I finished my class, OR “volunteer” my hours for no credits at the agency for a full semester to maintain the relationships while finishing the class. 

I opted for the second option, and for an entire semester worked 20ish hours a week for no money or school credits. I finished that semester and my pre-reqs and began my “official” two semester long internship. To complete this advanced course I’m required to get 580 hours and meet a list of goals written on a learning plan. 

At my current rate I should be done with my 580 hours by June which is 2 months before the semester ends. I’ve already been at this internship for longer than my initial entire three semesters should have been, and figured at least I am finishing a little early and can focus on the rest of my online classes and graduation. I was recently told that my supervisor and school would prefer for me to “stay through August even if I complete all my hours so I can make the most out of the internship.” To be clear this is NOT to make up for any issues or incompetences, I’m doing as well as I’m expected to be doing at this point and have learned how to do every part of a counselors job at my agency. 

Is it fair for my school to ask me to put in even MORE hours after I’ve completed the requirements plus an extra uncredited semester? Is there anything I can do to dispute that? It’s being requested by my internship supervisor and my school, maybe because COVID has messed stuff up and they want to see me in the office more. But I feel like my extra free semester I worked should be plenty, and being asked to stay for another 2 months means that would be 5 months of uncredited hours/extra hours. Any ideas about how to handle this?

789,"TL;DR: I'm in the market for a discrete audio recording device, for use in workplace politics.

So i've always been way too picky about doing whatever job i'm given *right*. This is a problem because I work in fast food, the industry where management teaches you the correct way to do a job, and then never lets you do it that way ever again.
Every time I get a new job and I think i'm just going to bust ass and all the management will like me for how much work I put in... and they do... at first.
But then inevitably someone decides that I should also be getting more side duties done, or not leaving my station to restock supplies, even though I am literally spending 100% of my time at work doing work that needs to be done urgently. Their solution is always ""just do it *faster*"", which of course means doing it *sloppier*.
I refuse to do my job *faster*. I am already doing it as fast as it can be done properly. If there were any way to get the job done faster without compromising the product quality I would do it. There isn't.

I always want to tell these people to fuck off with their trying to get me to cut corners, but they're my superiors, so no matter how politely I word it I know that they'll just claim that
A)I was just slacking and they were trying to get me to work harder
and
B)That I was rude to them for no good reason.

Upper management always publicly takes the side of the superior, but I think that if I were to provide either the owner-operator or her SIC with a truthful record of the conversation it'd go a long way toward them telling IS(Immediate Superior) to lay off that shit in private.

I feel bad about resorting to narcing on another member of the team, but short of murder this is the only way I can think of to get IS off my back... which is not optional. Failing to get IS off my back would mean my job once again, and I refuse to let that happen.

What's a good device for recording every word spoken in your vicinity for the duration of an entire shift? I expect that will require quite a bit of storage space and a sensitive mic.
Also advice on how to go about getting IS to admit he wants me to cut corners would be helpful as well.",30Apr2020,1

I feel so stupid and annoying for posting this but I really am genuinely scared and confused. I don’t want to do anything I’ll regret. I’ll try to explain as best as I can I suck at expressing myself. 

So the only thing I remember from my childhood and I mean the ONLY thing from the age 2-6 is the night my dad almost killed my mom right in front of me and my sister. He was beating her and choking her and she was screaming and I didn’t know what to do I felt so hopeless... they obviously got a divorce and my dad moved on only one year later and I got a new step brother , and now have two more half brothers. My dad moved away to Florida with all of them and I never see him anymore. I don’t even like seeing him because his wife is a bitch. She hits my dad in front of me and my little brothers. Witch cords, a fucking blowdryer, and one time lied and said my dad was trying to kill her which caused us to get pulled over ON THE HIGHWAY and I saw my dad lay down on the ground with guns to his head at age 8. I don’t have any normal childhood memories and I hate it. And I kinda feel like he chose them over me he always said he wanted a boy instead. But I do have my mom and she tries so hard everyday to provide for me and my younger sister.but once I hit age 9 I started to get very angry.. I’d get into fights with neighborhood kids and then in middle school I got suspended a lot for fighting. This fucked me up in school and back then I didn’t give two shits but now I do. And I just wanna go back and beat my own ass instead. After I got expelled I guess my mom thought moving me to Texas from Virginia would be better for me. But when I started high school I was just worse and I realized I liked getting in trouble because that’s how I get attention from my mom. She works a lot and I never see her unless it was in my principles office which is bad. But I’m now expelled from high school too and now I just feel like a total fuck up. I had one fucking job but I can’t do shit right and I don’t mean to do it. I just have no energy anymore for anything all I do is sleep, I can’t eat shit anymore, I’m losing weight, I miss having something to wake up for. Now I feel like I’m just a waste of space, and like I’m literally stuck here in this world. I’m only 18 and I have a while to go it’s so bad right now and I can’t handle this pain. It’s tough but I know people have it so much worse so than I do but I HATE talking about my feelings I don’t wanna tell my mom she just lost her aunt to this virus. And is struggling with her own issues. Yesterday , yes literally yesterday I was in a big car crash which is my second one this year I was in one in January. I didn’t even tell her . I’m so sore all over cut up on my arms but nobody noticed because I wore a hoodie all day. I’ve been hanging around bad people we got in a police chase and they let me and my other friend go because we weren’t driving but the driver tried to pin their pills on us. So I lost my “friends” because I realize they aren’t my friends. They got me into Coke and shit which fucked me up even more because I felt happy on it and now I’ve been off it and I don’t see the point I’m more empty than ever. I’ve been in 3 relationships all were abusive but I guess that’s what happens when I watch my mom get beat... I see the pattern. I’ve been to jail 3 times since I moved here,  twice over night and most recent for 3 months. All for weed and family violence.I smoke so fucking much I’ve smoked weed since I was 12 it’s like my therapy but now my tolerance is so high I can’t even fucking get high anymore and I just feel stuck and confused right now. I have self harmed before in like middle school to see if it actually “helped” but it just got cps called on my mom and she got mad and so I don’t do it anymore I don’t like the attention or anyone to know which is why it’s hard for me to talk to people about how bad I’m doing because I’m very independent. There’s probably so much stuff I’m leaving out but u get the idea. I don’t like talking to my therapist cause she’s forced to act like she cares she just gets paid to be in my head. 


I’m just looking for some motherly advice cause I don’t get a lot of that anymore and haven’t in a while.  Or just someone who went down a similar path and is doing better.. I just need real advice from someone who isn’t getting paid to say shit from a book",30Apr2020,1
791,"My parents have been married for over 30 years. My mom was always one to do everything for my dad, she only bought and wore clothing that he approved of, always greeted him at the door every day with make-up fully done and dressed (even though she worked from home), with a cup of coffee and baked goods waiting on the table. She always packed his lunch for work, and got up with him every morning before work to make him coffee as well. This is just a small list of what my mom has done to be an amazing wife.

My dad has been on imvu for over 10 years. He is addicted to it. Over the last 6 months, he has had over 10 different accounts which all had paid memberships. In these accounts, he writes extremely sexual messages to other girls, as well as says that he loves them and that they are their one and only. He has had 3 serious relationships on there, where they would write sexual messages to each other and touch themselves. They also chatted privately over text, off the game. 

My dad also watches a ton of porn too, I’ve had to tell him several times to turn down his porn several times. I’ve also run across slips of paper jotted down with porn sites like “18schoolgirlz.com” in his handwriting. I’ve witnessed him watching porn many times, since I was 10.

My mom begs my dad to stop because she feels like she isn’t a good enough wife. He gets so pissed off with her, screams and swears that this is all just pretend to him, like dungeons and dragons. He will delete his account and swear to never go on, only to make a new one a few days later. He will hole himself up in the bathroom for 40 minutes at a time with this game to get away and do it without getting caught, including on family days like thanksgiving and Christmas.

It is at the point where my mom is having a mental breakdown everyday because of this game because she feels like she isn’t good enough and that she’s a horrible wife. I’ve never seen my mom this bad, she is in tears every day. Shes collapsed on the floor many times as well from stress and anxiety from this. 

This has all caused me many problems as well with how I’m able to view sexual intimacy and it’s very difficult for me and my fiancé.

795," Has anyone dealt with feeling like they will not find another partner as amazing as the last because you are childfree ?  

I am 24 F, and my boyfriend of 2 years has always imagined his life with  children. I have never ever wanted children, but have noticed myself  attempting to change my mind which probably isn't healthy. I fell hard  for him and it feels silly to predict that I will never want children  ever and break up with him now. But now I feel so  pressured to change and ""come around"" the idea and hoping that I will  change (and in part, really hoping he will change). For example, I've felt physically sick at the thought of having kids and have dreaded the thought of going through labor, only to snap out of it later thinking- ""why am i thinking these things? Why am I so terrified of this- I don't have to do it if I don't want to."" 

It's disappointing that I've caught myself thinking that I will change, because it shows how afraid I am of walking away from this relationship and how attached I am. It also shows how heavily influenced my views are by his goal of being a father.  

I can't see the future- I can't know if I am going to change, so should I stay in this hoping I will change? Obviously if I was fine going through the pain of childbirth and child rearing and was sure of it that would be different. But the only reason I’m considering having kids one day is because of him and that’s a confusing place to be in because I can’t see how my views are going to change.",30Apr2020,1

810,"So this past year my best friend (F/19) has changed her demeanor towards me - not in a positive way.

It seems as if she is always competing with me - about grades, weight, who eats less, who eats more (yes, I know its weird, but If I ate less then her she'd immediately start lamenting about how much she ate, how bad she feels about it, just blowing it out of proportion, etc).

She has the tendency to copy me. I do or buy something and a few weeks later, enough time for me to ""forget about it"" she does/ buys the same thing. Now, I don't necessarily have an issue with her having/liking the same things as me, but if I want to get/do something similar to her she will immediately try to put me off that said thing.  Because of all that, I'm very wary of what I'm sharing with her ( especially when it comes to achievements, new purchases, hobbies, etc.)  

Also, she has always been a bit too self-centered. Always turning the conversation about herself, wanting to be the center of attention. But lately, she only focuses on getting what she wants and completely disregards others' (especially my) wishes. She tries to control others and their preferences on things like food, what we should do, where we should go, etc. It's becoming really obnoxious. She thinks that only her opinion is correct. Another thing that bothers me is her incessant judging of other people - appearance-wise.  It's just ugly and plain disrespectful. Frankly, that makes me quite self-conscious, seeing how effortlessly it is to judge others.

 Usually, when it's just the two of us everything is okay -  I feel like I can somewhat trust her and vise-versa. We have a great time and its just chill. But oh boy is it different when she and I are gathering with other people. She starts purposefully ignoring me. If she is filming the whole group she doesn't include me in the videos. If I say something funny and the whole group starts to laugh she makes a face as if I said the most unfunny thing ever. I would sometimes catch her staring at me with a very strange expression on her face that makes me feel like there's a complete stranger standing before me. I would always feel mentally exhausted after such gatherings. To be honest, there is so much more I can add to the list, but you get the gist. 

I do have to admit that in the past I used to let her walk over me, but I was a stupid friendless kid that would do anything for having a buddy, and as I'm getting older, more mature and as I am finding my inner voice and self-worth, I just can't put up with her bs anymore, especially now that it's getting even more out of hand. Several times I've been really close to breaking my friendship with her, but I just can't seem to do it, because of all the memories and mutual friends we have. 

Should I sever my ties with her or try and talk things out?",30Apr2020,1

815,"Hello. I am new to Reddit...and I hope I have come to the right place.

If you are a freelancer, LGBTQIA+ person, artist, social worker/psychologist I would especially like to hear from you, but all are welcome. I have few people to talk to openly about this, because I am the strong friend and it is eating me alive. This is just one issue I am facing. 

Since COVID19, I have felt myself changing, and I am sure most people have. We are not static. That, and I had an affirmation procedure last month — my chest is now flat and still healing...something I saved my hard earned for, and something I am still adjusting to. I feel so much better now as I had really intense dysphoria, and my quality of life has absolutely skyrocketed. I am transgender, if you are confused.

Here is my dilemma. 

I am an activist and public figure in the LGBTQIA+ community. I am diverse in sexuality and gender, and write and speak often about identity and society. My social media following is small but dedicated , 10,000 followers across platforms. I work with government organisations, universities, companies, researchers and other others in diversity and inclusion, policy reform and creation as well as general outreach work. I am good at what I do, but I am burning out, and this is not the first time.

Lately, I have no idea where to go. I want to drop off all social media but I am afraid of losing all that I have achieved and the following I have already generated on social media. 

I am worried my voice will not be heard.
I am worried that my writing will not be read, my artwork will not be seen and my relevance will vanish. I am worried about the future. I have no partner or assets to rely on, but luckily my family are here for me. 

To be clear, I want to continue activism but the thought of constantly managing social media and my set formula fills me with dread. I have no roadmap and struggle to understand content and audiences. I even made some YouTube videos for a channel I have not even started...I wonder if that would be better.

What gives me joy is creating that which people enjoy... artwork, articles, videos. That is when I feel seen and heard, and I want more of that.  
I thought maybe YouTube would be a good idea, because I don’t seem to be reaching the scope of audience I would like to and I am working so hard for little outcome. It is exhausting, and it’s half the reason I feel burned out— I work so hard for so little. 

Currently I seem to be doing crisis intervention and lots of megaphone problems (campaigns for people affected by discrimination). This is important but I cannot sustain it much longer at this level. 

Of course, I enjoy community outreach when I can help someone, and with five years experience in youth work and community support that makes sense.

I am really just  looking for some guidance here, especially from freelancers, long term activists, LGBTQIA+ people and anyone who has felt overwhelmed, lost and needing direction like I am. Whatever you can suggest; advice, resources, strategies, success stories...I want to hear it. 

Thank you.

I had a crush on him since day 1 and I am a very shy person so I never made a move bc I didn't know how. Life goes on, I move on. I go crazy and dye my hair hot pink and maybe about 4 months later I match with my current bf/front desk guy on tinder. He said he saw me around the gym and thought I was cute and once we started dating he said he noticed me once I dyed my hair and that's when he first thought I was cute. Although we moved past this and worked it out, I was sensitive about it bc idk I had been going to the gym consistently for months and he barely noticed me then... besides the point. I just felt like changing my hair really changed my appearance for the better bc it made me more interesting and I felt more confident. He said he thought I was cute but didn't know how to make a move either.

The other day we went on a walk and he wanted me to brutally honest and rate him without bias, kind of like before we met. Of course I am bias and I think he is a 10/10 bc I love him and I'll always see him that way, but I've always found him very attractive considering I had a crush on him beforehand. So I told him an 8/10 which I find to be good. Although I didn't really think about it beforehand, I asked him the same thing to which he immediately replied a 7/10. Idk I know I am sensitive but it just hurt bc I see that as like a 70% or like a C aka Below Average. I highkey cried a little but just laughed and joked trying to play it off like I wasn't hurt and he apologized. I told him it was a fair answer bc I asked and it's okay...but I was hurt. I know I'm not like supermodel pretty but I don't think Im bad looking either. I just thought I would be ranked a little higher, I guess I just didn't think he would say something that low bc I know he loves me.


But at the same time it just makes me think like he wouldn't have really cared for me and if it wasn't for tinder he wouldn't have ever tried to make a move.

My BF (20) and I (21) are living with his parents right now. We are saving up our money to move to a trailer park that does a rent to own option. Basically, we could have a house that is our own 2 years after we move into it. We have figured it out and we could move out as soon as quarentine is lifted. My BF, since the triler park is in a sketchy part of town, went to a gun store and bought a shotgun not the best use of money right now, I know.) He had the gun store owner holding it for him until we get moved out because his parents are aprehensive about guns after his older brother killed himself. 

His mom, however, has access to his bank account (he opened it when he was 17 and she had access to give him a monthly allowance and to help him if he needed money for gas or parts gor the car). She snooped and saw the charge at the gun store. She cornered him in the kitchen and demanded she be given the receipt to the gun so she coild go pick it up and 'lock it away to keep everyone safe.' I was confused, obviously. Its not here. Its not easily accessible. To anyone. Wtf?

My BF said no, as expected. Its not at the house, its still at the gun store. Plus, its none of her business. Its his money, his decision. Hes an adult. I was behind him 100 percent. She seemed to drop it and we went to our room to go to bed. We're settling down and she comes into the room and stands at the door, repeating her demand. ""Its under my roof that you did this. I have a responsibility to protect my family."" 

I asked her if she was honestly afraid of her own son, expecting her to realize how rediculous she was being and to drop it and let us sleep. Nope. She looke me dead in the eyes and said ""Yes. He has violent tendencies and I dont feel safe."" Like, wtf lady? Violent tendencies? The most 'violent' he's ever gotten with anyone is raising his voice a little when his underage brother kept asking me to buy alcohol for him and a few of his underage friends to go drink at night in the park down the road.

She was relentless and stood there, not letting us sleep. Eventually, to get her to leave, my BF said hed go with her today to get it. She finally left the room at 3 this morning. My BF was supposed to go to work at 6. He called in because he knew he wouldn't get enough sleep to get him through the day. They are supposed to go get the gun later today when his mom gets back from work. 

My question is this: What do we do? I dont agree that she should lock up the gun. I think what she did was childish and unnecessary. I asked a friend about it and he says we could get her for harassment, maybe even theft since she's taking our property, but I'm not sure. What can we do?",30Apr2020,1

826,"After 3 years of memorable moments, fights, and all other typical relationship stufd, we finally broke up. After a series of small fights recently, (mostly due to confusion if whether I was lacking when giving the right amount of attention to give her or if she's asking for too much) I really just couldn't take it anymore. My high school life hasn't really been all that great despite some good memories mostly due to certain topics that we would fight about that really took a toll on my own mental health. Before and early on to our relationship, I used to be the funny guy in class and was filled with good vibes. Till the past 2 school years, we used to argue a lot due to the fact that she had this boy best friend that suddenly came up, and it really just made me paranoid and all that, but I couldn't really complain since I loved her. Then there were times I would wait for her outside her classroom, and she'd just ignore me and never tell me why. But a year later after that, those problems have been settled and new ones came in. This time, we were having petty fights and all that, but with those came a version of me that was always too scared and paranoid that the words I speak will shatter the glass wall that is her vulnerabilities. I always had this feeling that she could talk however she wanted with me, but not me to her. Back to the present, and she broke up with me and I said sure. She said that she expected me to keep fighting on, but I couldn't take her bullshit anymore since she broke up with me 4 times already.

Anyway, looking back, there were still good memories, the problem only being that they were less than the bad ones. Right now, it's only been a few days since we've broken up and all I feel is confusion. I'm not sure if I should be happy that I'm finally free and be able to live the remaining years of my youth with liberty and freedom from boundaries that don't exist anymore, or if I will be living the next few months or the next year with a new, possibly even worse, boundary of regret. Excuse me if it may seem as if I'm trying to destroy her image, but that's all I've been meaning to let go the past few years.

I actually started to make some headway into moving on but a few months ago we saw each other on a night out and I ended up going back to her place. Nothing “happened” and I didn’t stay the night, but she seemed to miss me which complicated things. I haven’t had any contact with her since and as far as I know she’s doing fine and has likely moved on. But I just can’t see to make myself move on also. The fact that I’ve been under lockdown for weeks with nothing but my own thoughts hadn’t helped me to stay rational either. It’s driving me crazy and I just don’t know what to do.

840,"Being home all day with my kids has been tough  and I’ve been checking out periodically on FB and instagram throughout the day. A few days back, some photos were posted to an FB group I’m a part of from high school. My ex boyfriend from HS is a part of this group too. We dated for a couple years - he was my first love. Our breakup (nearly 20 years ago) was terrible and complicated. As a result, I haven’t seen him in well over a decade and I haven’t ever communicated with him online or otherwise. There is no desire to communicate on my end. 

A few days ago, a group post with pictures from the past popped up on my FB feed. It was great to see the photos and the reminded me of good times and I liked them. The next morning, the post was still in my feed and people at that point had commented. My ex made a comment about aging. It was totally benign and I thought it was funny. I replied directly to him in the reply comment without thinking about it.

But later on, a thought crossed my mind that maybe I shouldn’t have replied directly to his comment and I should have just commented to the group and now feeling embarrassed and it’s bothering me. 

It didn’t help that he hasn’t commented back, “liked” the comment or anything, and even though it was an impulsive reply on my part- I didn’t really think about whether or not he would say anything anyway. It wasn’t the type of comment that needs a response- I was just agreeing with him about time marching on.

I think I’m just feeling weird for saying anything at all to him after so many years of complete silence on my part and also that maybe his silence from the post is making me self-conscious that I may have made him feel uncomfortable and signaling that he does not want any contact from me. Which is perfectly understandable- outside of that post-I have no intentions of ever contacting him for any reason. 

Yes, I have considered how I would feel if he had responded or if he ever did. I would feel less self conscious about the potential that I made him uncomfortable at that point, that the past is the past and we’ve all moved forward. I do think I would still feel embarrassed that I said anything to him at all. I would still never have a reason, need, or intent to communicate. 

I know the feeling will pass- and that it’s not really a big deal in the end. Right now, it’s just a nagging me and I think some advice would help me get over it.",30Apr2020,1

844,"Hello,

So i have a couple of problems.  
First  thing is that i was in a 4 relationships, always with a girl in my age.  The first was when i was 16 years old and we were together for 14  months and slept together only 2 times, loved her. Then i was dating a  girl at 17 years old and we were together for 4 months, whith whom i  fucked at every possible oportunity we got, didn't loved her. Then i was  with a girl at my 18 years old and were together for a year and slept  together only 2 times, loved her. Then i forced myself to no  relationships for 6 years and in that time i had sex only 4 times. At my  24 years old i started dating a girl with whom i was for 9 months and  we had a lot of sex, but I didn't felt much comfortable in it. She broke  down and started crying a couple of times during the sex and needed  always shower before and after it, told me that in some positions the  sex hurted her so she wanted mostly only to ride me and over time the  passion was dissapearing to a point where we started only sex when she  asked if i wanted (always tried to seduce her and got rejected over and  over) . She told me that she was feeling like i'm not completely with  her in the sex, i knew she was telling the truth, but that is the  problem, i feel the amount of sex i had in my life wasn't enough. Always  scared if i would be good, if i'm doing it right and that i'm not  really doing what pleases me and focusing on the other person, but only  if it is a girl i have feelings for. I feel like i really need to have  sex outside of relationship, which i had only 4 times in my life and i  feel like a virgin.

With that comes a second problem.

I'm  having a hard time establishing everything other than friendship with  girls. I'm not scared to aproach gilrs i have never met before, can  actually get a number in public transport but that is all. Something is  happening on the dates or conversations after. I'm not much flirty, i  give compliments and showing interest in them, like to listen to them a  lot and then i don't really feel like they are much interested in me. It  is the same on dating apps, I would say i'm having an average number of  matches but the conversations are quickly falling from excited to  boring and i'm feeling the girls are loosing interest to a point where i  am the only one asking questions.

I just want to find girl(s) that i can establish only sex oriented relationship or just one night stand.  
It's really  frustrating to not able to do that, i'm always horny and would fuck all day.  
I'm feeling that if i'm not able to do that i can't establish a long healthy relationship with anyone.

845,"Hello all, if this is too long please tell me so I can try and make it shorter.

Now before I get called lazy the previous semester I got a 3.7 GPA and that was mostly because I wanted to prove my parents i'm capable of getting good grades and I wanted to get into NYU.

During high school I was constantly getting poor grades mostly because I just hated doing work and   
I was generally lazy during high school, my parents knew this so now they think the same for college.

OK so before the spring semester started during winter break I had gotten really depressed because of multiple things, I have bad anxiety problems my parents refuse to acknowledge I just get nervous sitting around people and I skip class just so I don't feel like that. Another thing was I was being forced into a major (computer science) that I did not enjoy doing and I didn't know what major I wanted either, or just what to do with my life in general either. I got into an argument with him one time and he started punching me like crazy and I pushed him back and he tackled me, then he tried to take my glasses off so he can punch me in the face. My mom barely stopped him.

One more reason and my biggest problem is my father. On one particular day I was practicing driving with just my dad and he tells that he's cheating on my mom and that he plans to get a divorce once me and my brother can take care of ourselves. This just f\*\*\*ing pissed the shit out of me I told him what he was doing was wrong but he doesn't think so. His behavior around us has also been getting worse, he leaves the house to hang out with his ""friends"" every weekend but i'm pretty sure he's just cheating, he doesn't even talk to me, when me and my brother get into an argument he comes in and beats the shit out of both of us to the point my mom has to stop us.  I got into an argument with him one time and he started punching me like crazy and I pushed him back and he tackled me, then he tried to take my glasses off so he can punch me in the face. My mom barely stopped him.

What's worse is my fathers behavior is unfair. I told him before that I don't want to do computer science and he went crazy he told me ""WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE, I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR TUITION IF YOU DON'T TAKE IT"". I just lost so much respect of my father in such a short time and now I just don't feel like trying for him.  All this stuff with my father happened in a span of one year.

847,"**tw: sexual assault**

&amp;#x200B;

I (f18) was sexually assaulted by a family friend when I was 6 but didn't tell anyone because I only realised what had happened to me a year ago. I have aphantasia so I cant see the exact experience in my head but, at least once a day, I relive how awful it felt. There is no proof other than my memory of the event, and I refuse to be in the same room as the family friend but no one in my family knows why.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, recently my younger sister confided in me that he had sexually assaulted her too. I won't go into detail but what she recounted was more heart-breaking than what I went through. The family friend was a minor when he assaulted me, but was of age (18+) when he attacked my younger sister.

&amp;#x200B;

She hasn't told anyone else and doesn't want to and still regularly speaks to the family friend because she ""doesn't want to ruin family relationships"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilty because, if I had spoken up, maybe he wouldn't have touched her. But there's no proof other than mine and her memory. 

&amp;#x200B;

The family friend regularly speaks to my sister's dad and they are very close. Her dad doesn't like me and I don't even know if he'd believe me. I also haven't seen the family friend in years but my sister sees him every now and again.

848,"Eight years ago I was a 13 year old suffering with some mental health issues. I still haven't spoken to anyone professional about it yet for reasons that I'll explain below, so I don't feel comfortable self-diagnosing or anything like that. But for a few months when I was 13 I was suicidal and seriously contemplating acting on it. I don't know what might have led me to be in that place, but i'd put it down to a combination of academic stress, feelings of loneliness and isolation, and probably some underlying issues. Thankfully i'm not in that place anymore.

When I was at that point, i'd written a note that I was planning to leave if I ever did go through with it. It said that I had been feeling bad for a while, and explained the reasons that, at the time, I thought made me want to do it. One of the reasons I gave was that I felt isolated at home, and that my life had been made difficult by my parents being too harsh on me. This was by no means the only reason I gave, I was also struggling with my sexuality and a difficult situation at school.

I want to make it clear that I do not think my parents are abusive or anything like that, they're perfectly nice people. Looking back, the fact that I felt unfairly treated was probably just because I was a teenager, but it felt real at the time.

Obviously, a week or so later, my parents found the note, and I imagine they felt hurt that I thought they were partly responsible for my feeling suicidal. They called me down into the living room to talk to me about it. However, rather than asking me how I was doing, or speaking to me about any mental health issues I may have had, my mother yelled at me for making her feel bad. She said that I had really hurt her, and that I should feel awful for what I had done. I can't remember it word for word because, again, it was 8 years ago. But she said something along the lines of ""Imagine what people would think of me if you went through with it, or if they found out what you wrote in this note"". I remember at the time feeling terrible, and she made me apologize to her. After I did, she left the room, and has never talked about it since.

The next day, my Dad asked me if I wanted to get some professional help, and that it wouldn't be a problem if I did. I know now that he was trying to be supportive, but I felt guilty for how I felt at that point, so I said I didn't want to speak to anyone. After that, neither of them have ever brought any of this up again.

At the time I thought I had acted unfairly, and taken out my anger on my parents when it was really my own problem. However, the more I look back at this situation, the more it fills me with anger. Right now, I feel like my mother cared more about her reputation than my mental health, or even whether I was alive or not. It also set me back massively in terms of my mental health. I have only now just started talking openly with my closest friends about how i'm feeling, and I still don't feel comfortable talking about it with my parents. I'm scared that they won't take it seriously, or think it has come out of nowhere.

That brings me to the question. Now that i've started thinking about it again, I can't move past it. Every time I see my mother I get filled with anger about what happened, and I don't know if it's fair. What should I do? Am I even right to be angry?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My mother was dismissive when confronted with my poor mental health 8 years ago. The way she responded has continued to eat me alive for many years, and I don't think i'll be able to move past it without an apology. What should I do?",30Apr2020,1

854,"Hey this is a bit long sorry :)) 
Me (23 F) and my mom (50s), we've always had a weird relationship but we get along somehow. She likes to drink and she's a negative person, always has been, especially about money and putting herself in the victim's place. I need advice on how to communicate to her that I don't want her around, I know it sounds harsh but it is what it is.
 Backstory: My family has a small farm land and property which is not being used right now. My grandma used to have her independent farm and made good money. When her health declined, mom put her in a home and refuses to even call her (nice). With what's been happening in the world, I've realised I don't want to live in an apartment prison and go to work where I sit in artificial light for hours on end, put on a fake smile and earn minimum wage. So, I want to get out into the country, learn how to grow crops and get some animals and be self sufficient. I have a lot to learn from my dad AND my mom, but I just don't want her meddling around in my business. I know she will rearrange everything, complain about things and so on and so forth. If I'm gonna do this I need to find my own way and structure. But she likes to go out there to do some small gardening and be out in the country. How do I balance her rightfully going to her property and leaving me alone if I start my homestead? I'm about to graduate from uni and I want to figure out what to do. But thoughts about her being there make me cautious. My grandma was the same way - she didn't let mom do stuff her own way and that made them upset very often. 

TL;Dr : mom is toxic and I don't want her in my space, but it is shared family space which I could utilise for business/self reliance. How to tell her I don't need her help?",30Apr2020,1

I am a 13 turning 14 in a month or so; female, I live in the US. My parents are split, the have been since i was about 8 months old when this happened so I don't really remember. My Dad is in his mid fifties and lives alone. My mom is in her late thirties and lives with my step father who is in his forties. My mom got together with my stepdad when i was about 3. They had my little sister when I was 4. My Dad has never gotten together with someone else. My mom did almost asap. Then in 2018 my little brother was born in Feb. and got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was about 7 months later. And my mom has wanted me to start helping her with his medical stuff. I do not want to do this yet.

So here is the part where I need some advice. When Corona started in Feb we didn't think much of it, then on March 13 or 14, my dad said I need to stay out of school. ( That was the last day for any school we then found out.)  So then I go to my dads house for the weekend. (The last day was a Friday.)

Then Corona got a whole lot worse, and I decided to stay at my dads house for a while until this cooled down a bit. I chose this for a number of reasons: my dad was actually staying away from people  and wearing masks and gloves. My mom wasn't. My dad had stocked up (not horded) food. My mom didn't. And for a those and a few other reasons I decided to stay at my dads house. My Mom got so angry and I had several phone calls throughout March and April of her screaming at me and my dad, saying we planned this in advance and were ganging up on her, and trying to make me feel bad by saying my little sister was crying herself to sleep every night because I hadn't been there in a month. A. Fucking. Month. I had to hang up in tears almost every time.  Now I need to give my mom a break because of my little 2 year old brother that's life is in her hands almost every second of the day. everyday. But I hated it so much that I just said: ""OH MY GOD MOM! FINE! I WILL COME UP ON MAY 1ST!!"" But she still kept going on me that this will never end and so I should just stay up there and whatever. And almost everytime we call, she wants to know if my dad did anything mildly wrong. at all. ""oh did he yell at you today for anything??"" ""Has he ever touched you??"" and I always reply with no, and thats the truth. but my mom is trying to dig up dirt on my dad and try to get me to stay up there so I can take care of the little brother and sister.

- Met girl 3 months ago

- thought girl was really nice but never saw her more than a friend

- Developed feelings for her

- Eventually confessed to her about a month ago, but said she wasn’t sure if she loved me that way since she develops feelings for everyone and its hard for her to tell (basically rejection in a nice way)

- We became really close friends afterwards. We now consider ourselves best friends.

- Because of quarantine we mostly text, and in the past few weeks she’s been saying “I love you” so damn frequently to the point of absurdity

- She claims she loves me “not in that way” but it just seems really strange for her to be saying it so often.

- Things between us has ramped up so much that if you were to read just a section of out texts you’d assume we were dating

Thats the basic summary of the past 3 months, and now I am at a point where I am so confused. Of course I still have feelings for her, its hard to throw that away but it’s definitely even harder to throw it away when she’s acting more and more like she likes me. What do I do?",30Apr2020,1

872,"Right now it's April 30th which means college decision day is officially tomorrow. I am currently trying to decide between to colleges: UAH, and Centre College. They are two very different colleges, as UAH is a rather small state university and Centre is a really small private liberal arts school. 

When I originally started applying I listed my major as chemistry, but wasn't exactly sure what I was going to do with it. After spending some time with my uncle, he suggested I major in chemical engineering as I'll have a lot more job opportunities and I'll still have that chemistry aspect. The only problem is that Centre doesn't have their own engineering program, so if I went there and decided I want to major in engineering, I would have to do a 3/2 program, 3 years at Centre and 2 at another college. The main problem with this is that for the last year I would not have any scholarships (which account for more than half of the sticker price at Centre) and I would have to pay (go into debt) a ridiculously large amount of money for that last year and I wouldn't even have a masters degree (and therefore meaning I wouldn't get an engineering degree, and would probably end up doing research as a career), whereas at UAH, I have a full tuition scholarship and the Pell grant and Stafford loans would cover the rest of my direct costs and I would be able to get an engineering degree in 4 years.

My problem is that my mom insists that Centre is a much better fit for me and a much more prestigious institution, so I would be able to have a greater chance a getting into a prestigious university for graduate school. I think that it doesn't matter so much where you get your undergraduate degree, and that with an engineering degree I would be able to get a job in the field after graduating and many employers will even cover the cost of graduate school.

Basically where I go could decide my career, and my mom is basically only interested in the prestige of the place where I get my education. What should I do?",30Apr2020,1

I (23F) got into this god-awful fight with my mom (63F) (the evil extravaganza of all our usual fights) where she called me awful names, blamed me for her business failing, gaslighted me, and forced me to work on things for her on my only day off even though I told her I had plans and had made commitments with other people (digitally, dw). She even chased after me to the bathroom while I was crying to try and tell me how awful I was and that she spent 20 years on me, and that I had to work like a slave because I was sleeping, eating, and living here. Like yeah ok mom, sorry you had to parent, and idk what to tell you if you won't accept rent from me. Stuff like this has happened before, but never as bad, and this time, even Grandma joined in on the fun to call me ungrateful and yell at me and my ""tone."" Whatever. It's been a while since I've come to the conclusion that mom and maybe grandma too are abusive or at least very unpleasant to live with, but this fight was the decider for me to get out. 

Anyhow, I'd be out of here in a heartbeat, but my work contract is up at the end of June likely with Covid, and I couldn't afford even the cheapest rent in my area with my low salary, plus job hunting has been a flop lately. Friends live too far away. So I figured I'd ask my boyfriend for help. He was like yeah sure no prob, we can get an apartment, and I thought I heard the angels sing. So he went home to talk to Mom and Dad and they were dead against it because they didn't want him to spend money, but he said they were very welcome to having me come stay with them. He loves them, and takes their advice for everything to the point of annoyance. So here comes the question, kinda. I *really* don't want to live with them. After having met his family many times, I have never ever felt welcome there, plus there are SO MANY SIBLINGS. There is really no room, and no one seems to like me there, and his mom always calls him out to do some little chore whenever we finally get a moment alone, and I have no idea what to do with myself there. To be blunt, I think they're a bunch of bad-mannered, and strange people, but usually it wouldn't affect me because I stopped going over there and I love my boyfriend, so I try to ignore it. 

I don't know what to do now though especially because I feel like beggars can't be choosers. I'm not one to count other people's money, but his dad is a rich corporate bigshot, and my boyfriend has a cushy salary that would be more than enough, so I'm kinda wondering if the parents want us there to control him and make sure they can keep an eye on us. Am I ungrateful to turn down the offer? I can't stay where I am, but I feel like I have nowhere to go, and it seems wrong to insist on an apartment with just us when I could be unable to pay my part for it soon. so",30Apr2020,1

888,"Okay, lets just get to the main of it. Basically, I constantly shit on myself and belittle myself but then turn around and think, for example, ""I should be better than everyone else. Why am I such a failure? You should have a 5.0 GPA and be skipping 3 grades ahead. Why aren't you the best player in the band?"" Obviously it's not \*normal\* to think like that (I think) but I can't seem to stop and it just feels normal to me because I've been doing it so long. On top of that, lately feelings of possibly being transgender have been coming back. Which uh, is a bit weird, because the more I feel like I'm trans the more I start to be transphobic and start hating everyone. Generally just my brain flipflops between hating myself, trying to just live and feel happy, and hating everyone else. Is this normal or am i just fucking crazy?",30Apr2020,1

890,"So my first relationship at 18 I was with this guy. He was nice at first then one day he tried to touch me sexually. It was while we were at school in class he tried to put his hand in my pants. I jokingly said stop at first but then I got serious and I realized he wasn't stopping as I said. I freaked out and tried to remove his hand. Long story short, he was pissed. He basically threatened to release pictures that I'd sent him and while he was saying that I just sat there and stared. I didn't know what to do.

The second time, with the next boyfriend when I was 20. I told him I didn't want to have sex that day when I visited him. Well, I was in his room leaning over on his bed and he was standing behind me. He started taking my pants off then underwear and I didn't stop. For some reason, I didn't think about it. He even went and got a condom and I was still there. He then tried to put it in and it hurt like hell because obviously I wasn't thinking about sex. I tried to push him from behind me but he was stronger and tried to push my back down till I just stopped pushing him off. I have a terrible time wrapping my head around how wrong this was or not. 

Third time. This isn't about anything sexual. I was sitting with my bf and some guy was passing looking at another girl. And I said something to my bf about it and he punched me on my thigh and said how I was looking at other guys while he was here. or something like that. He never really did it again but did seem to have a habit of squeezing my hand in a way that it would hurt or squeezing that part between my shoulder and my neck which hurt too. Am I overreacting about this or was it wrong of him to do that?

Basically, I need an objective point of view on these things that happened because I feel like I change my mind so often about wrong and right.",30Apr2020,1
891,"Right now I know one thing for sure.

I want to create my own universe and make it come to life.

Problem is, I have no artistic skills or literary skills whatsoever. I have no intention of taking art or writing classes because the classes do not interest me. 

However, that does not mean I am not interested in drawing or taking the time to improve the skills necessary to achieve my goals. Although I have no intention of becoming a master artist or anything close to it, I want to be good enough to translate my ideas and imagination on to paper for people to see. This is because I do not want to create a novel either. I want to create comic books/manga.

Right now I am in the beginning processes of learning how to draw. I am learning perspectives, shadows and other lessons online are to come.

I am heavily inspired by people such as Bill Watterson and ONE (the creator of One punch Man and Mob Psycho).

895,"Want to start by apologizing for my grammar or lack thereof, I'm currently a little frustrated with the way my career has turned out.

I graduated in 2019 with a business degree in marketing &amp; management. After college, I was expecting to make 50-60k. I applied to 100's of jobs, and one after another I was rejected or never contacted. From May to November I searched tirelessly each day my standards got lower and lower. At this point, I had even acquired several digital marketing certifications and it still didn't seem to make an impression. I finally was offered my first job at a small company in November. The job offered basically no benefits and pay was 17 an hour or just about 35k a year (in a place with a very high cost of living). At this point. my morale and self-value was so low I just felt like I should take what I could get.  
I was told I would be part of a team of ""highly skilled individuals"" however not to be rude but they are not what was promised and I end up doing 90% of the work for a team made up of 5 people. That's fine, I like to work but I recently found out everyone else in my team makes significantly more than me, went to high school with the owner, and that I'm the only college grad which just has me feeling terrible. I wake up every day sad knowing ill be grinding for 8 hours a day making barely enough to pay for my expenses. I finally worked up the confidence to ask for a raise and my boss said: ""I can do a $1 raise in November after you have been here for a year"".

I know a lot of you will tell me to quit and the problem is I have student loans that I have to pay so I need a source of income. I recently started applying for jobs again and it just feels like deja vu, rejection after rejection. I pride myself on my resilience but I just can't imagine my situation getting any better.

What do I do?  
If any of you are or have ever been in this position, what is your story? Did things change? Im just in a rut and looking for some advice.

899,"OK, so I'm a 16 year old guy living in England. I've suffered with anger issues, mental problems and the like since I was about 10.
At an appointment a few days ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I got A*s As and Bs (in US terms) in my GCSEs and have an IQ of 145. However my processing speed is slightly below average and Ive struggled with concentration for years.
My mum's worked in schools for years, especially with young kids on Ritalin. According to her it is often over prescribed and causes kids to lose their personalities. The doctor said that I should trial Ritalin (different brand name in GB) for a few weeks and see if it helped me concentrate. ESPECIALLY because I've always been top of the class, teachers have always taken a very harsh view of my misbehaviour in lessons, so school was very hard for me for years. I was also socially excluded as a kid- I'm currently 6'3 and 250lb and have been this size in proportion to my age since I started school, so I was never picked on physically. As such teachers didn't recognise I was bullied, and whenever I attacked kids who verbally bullied me and isolated me I was the one who was punished.
So when me and my dad got home from the appointment (my mum didn't wanna go bc of Covid) and I told her about the Ritalin she went crazy- she was genuinely terrified for me. She started screaming at me and my dad. I tried to get her to phone the doctor but she kept saying stuff against me having medicine. Unfortunately I have severe anger issues so whenever she started yelling at me I yelled back, further escalating the situation.
So, Reddit, my mum is now threatening to leave the family and force the doctor to ""get a second opinion"". She also keeps sending me articles about the over prescription of Ritalin- I'm just trialling it, surely that can't do any harm. I love my mum and want her to stay- she's obviously really worried for me. But I'm starting college in September and I want it to not be the hell school was for years.

There was one time this week she texted me first asking what I’m up to. She also texted me that she was horny one night and she sent me a pic of her boobs so we exchanged pics not even joking about that. She definitely could tell I was inexperienced with the whole thing which and I was so bad at flirting she got turned off at one point. I hope I didn’t fuck it up completely.

I'm  20 and rent a house that I'm pretty comfortable in with all my stuff the way I kind of like it. Some days I feel really happy here and some days I don't. I'm trying to finish my first year of my degree at the local uni, for which I hate the course I chose. 

I've decided to leave the uni after this year and so I have applied to the course I really want to do at several other unis, which this local one doesn't do. I've been accepted and one offered me a cash scholarship, £500 a year free money. 

But this uni is an hour away. If I choose to leave I'll possibly have to live in a shared house with strangers which means sharing the living rooms and kitchens etc. So I'll have to get rid of my own furniture. I also have a pet, a rabbit who I love dearly and have had for years, and finding somewhere to live in the city with a pet is painstaking. But if I stay it will be so so hard to get to this new uni where the course I want to do is. 

I don't have any friends in this town but I guess I am comfortable with the house and all. Do I stay and drop uni. Do I stay and try to commute which could be impossible. Do I leave and risk being unhappy with new living situations (I'm too comfortable being on my own). If you've made it this far thankyou so much.

918,"We both are 15F. Let's call my BFF ""X"".

My group of friends consists of 4 people - me, X (my BFF), my other best friend, and one very good friend that we recently met. I've been friends with X for 7 years and I REALLY love her. 

 But something bothers me. I get very jealous when she speaks with other people for a longer time. No, I don't mean just meeting a stranger and having a nice talk, I'm okay with that. But when she spends a while with someone she recently met, no matter online or IRL, I get very jealous of that person, if you could put it that way. 

Remember the ""one very good friend we recently met""? Let's call her ""A"". Yes, she's a very nice person. But when we started talking with her, GODDAMN, was I frustrated. Not at A, not at X, but with the fact that X spent time with her. I cried almost every time we group called and would immediately get angry if X left the call earlier than usual. It's been a few months, we're still friends and now I don't feel that way anymore. X never found out how I felt.

X also has a crush on one boy at school. The situation is similar. I get very jealous when she talks with him, or spends a while talking about him. I feel like shit for thinking that way. I'm still figuring some things out but I'll NEVER have a chance to have a ""romantic"" relationship with X, so why am I jealous??? Why can't I just support her, help her with this crush? X kinda knows I feel that way about him. This one hasn't passed yet.

It happens online too. We love playing video games together but once she meets the same person a few times and spends her time with them I get sad again. I just cried because she seems to enjoy the company of a girl she met a few days ago.

She doesn't know that I feel that way - I do a pretty good job at hiding that, I think. But I feel like the biggest shit of a friend, I'm not good enough to be her friend, not supportive enough, too egoistic, too self-centered. I don't want to feel that way, but I do.

921,"TL;DR: I have idealistic justifications for starting a family, but I also have a lot of doubts about it/find it problematic.

(FYI I use cis-het normative language but with a little bit of modification this all applies to non-traditional relationship and identity types.)

I'm a male in my early 20s. I was the oldest in my generation by four years, and have ten or eleven years on most of my cousins. As a result I did a lot of childcare growing up, and ended up going into K-12 teaching fairly early on (had my first classroom job at 17 for a summer school). I really love working with kids and young people.

My family, nuclear and extended, is really dysfunctional. There's a lot of genetic predisposition to and expression of mental illness, which is compounded by toxic behavioral dynamics. I've been in various forms of talk therapy most of my life.

For about as long as I can remember I've wanted to be a parent/have children/be married. In my gut I want the kids to biological, not adopted--that's kind of the beginning of where I get queasy.

People my age generally seem to not like children very much, and very often don't want them. They also don't want to be traditionally married. (Granted I don't have very many close male friends, even though I'm straight, so really I should say, women my age in my social circles.)

Some people don't want to engage in traditional family structures for very pragmatic reasons: kids are expensive, time-consuming, and more often than not reduce (the mother's, in particular) career prospects; marriage, if it's entered into wrong, is a mess to exit.

But then there are also ethical reasons people give me: why would you bring a child, let alone multiple children, into a future defined by climate crisis and disintegrating global unity? Why would you have children if the social safety nets and corporate structures aren't set up to facilitate healthy families?

Why get married, when marriage is a vestigial patriarchal mechanism of oppression and objectification? 

I have answers to those points, but I'm not sure they hold enough water.

I see marriage (or at least, it was modeled in my nuclear family this way) as a flat, egalitarian structure--it's not the subjugation of a wife to a husband but the union of two individuals in a compact to seed a project bigger than themselves. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Children are an extension of the marriage--if you and a spouse have the privilege of stability, deciding to bring new life into the world is a way of giving back to the world. If you raise children to be kind and honest, even if the world they're born into is cruel, they can be part of the next generation of people to work to make it more gentle.

Is that a fair burden to place on children? Probably not. Are children the only reason to get married? No. But if you do it right, part of me wants to believe that traditional family structures \*can\* in fact bring more joy into the world.

But the dark side.

My family as a kid was broken. Am I just trying to make a family, so I can try to relive and correct my childhood?

I'm afraid of people leaving me. Is marriage just a way of trying to trap people I love?

I mentioned aversion to adoption earlier--is it revealing of something more sinister that my preference is to create people who happen to genetically resemble me?

Is architecting families, children, even in my head, all a perverse exercise in in narcissistic control?

My mother had children, swearing she would be a better parent than her own were. She did her best, I sincerely believe that, and still, the other day she was crying, saying she couldn't understand how her family turned out so broken when she tried so hard.

Speaking anecdotally, good intentions in no way guarantee good outcomes, especially in parenting.

At the end of the day, at a primal level, I really desperately want children. I miss children; the ones I took care of are all near-grown now. But am I compensating for something? 

I feel judged by peers when I mention I want a family. And I think to some degree, I judge myself.

What do you guys think? (Thanks!!)",30Apr2020,1
922,"I (m,24) was born and raised in Germany to my Eritrean immigrant parents. Growing up as the child of first generation immigrants it was always very difficult to try and find an identity. There is a little Eritrean diaspora community but even there I was always kind of an outlier never quite as traditional and immersed in the culture as the other kids, the ""white-washed one people would say. I will never be a ""real German"" either because when people see me they immediately see ""foreigner"".

Coming into puberty I started to become ashamed of my parents' culture viewing it as an obstacle I had to get rid of on my way to ""Germanness"". I saw Germany as the superior in every way. A place of wealth, rich in knowledge and culture unlike the war-torn impoverished mud hole that I descended from. A country no one ever hears of except when hearing about refugees in the news. How could I ever be proud of such a miserable place?

Another issue is the steep cultural divide between my liberal Western socialization and the staunchly conservative culture of my parents. I see myself as a secular *gay* atheist that espouses strongly liberal social values, even for German standards. That means being myself would get me thrown in prison in Africa and banished in the German-Eritrean community for bringing great shame upon my family.

I wish I descended from a foreign country I could actually like. I've been struggling with this conflict forever and keep going in circles. How do I live with a heritage I will always be ashamed of?",30Apr2020,1
923,"I know this isn’t as big of an issue as others have on this sub, but I am really tired of getting my mom the basic perfumes/jewelry/etc. my mom is recently divorced and living in a new house, and idk I just want to get her something special but I can’t come up with a good idea. Would someone mind giving me suggestions?",30Apr2020,1
924,"So definitely **not that bad** as what some other people have done on this sub (pretty innocent actually) but it's just really fucking weird. 

**Background**: So basically I was new to college (beginning of first semester freshman year) and I really wanted to meet some new friends. So a friend on my floor and I went down to all the girl's floors in our building (and one guys floor) and met new people. This was pretty innocent and I genuinely met a lot of people. We weren't flirting or anything, we were just meeting new people. I was the one who came up with the idea of girls floors, and I cringe every time I think of it.

I noticed that the girls floor below me was clean AS FUCK. Our floor was dirty as hell, we actually had someone who came into our bathroom and vomited in the sinks every weekend. I would go down to the girls floor sometimes. I have no fucking clue why I did. I think I tried to convince myself that it was clean but I don't even know why I would do such a thing. Now, when I went down I didn't really do anything. I normally just avoided the bathroom walked a round (I think, but I def didn't talk to anyone) and went back up to my room or down my elevator. I think I did this like 2-3 times and stopped after my roommate told me I didn't want people thinking I'm a fucking weirdo. I remember having pure intentions, I think I actually tried to convince myself that it was because the floor was clean. 

**After:** I remember I asked my friend if he wanted to go to some other floors (don't know if I specified girls floors) to meet some people, but he said no, and I'm glad he did. I'm also glad I stopped. I went from a really small school to a really large university and I think I was trying to get acclimated and find some friends, I don't even know what I was doing. 

I remember I would do a lot of things just to gain sympathy or behaviors just to feel like I was in the process of making friends. One of my friends from high school also died around that time, I was diagnosed with hypertension, and had a huge course load, so I just don't know. Everyone tells me I'm super friendly, charismatic and charming, so whenever I think about this shit I just cringe hard. I'm 19M now and it's just so fucking weird, like I have no clue why I did this. Maybe I'm just overthinking, but this is my super innocent, weird secret.

How do I move on? Am I just being overly critical of myself, or did I do something wrong?",30Apr2020,1
925,"So thinking of quitting my from home work, I work for a Customer service type job. Before the virus I was working in a different department (also customer service) but was moved to a new department for the from home experience, honestly I'm absolutely stressed out, the training was short and due to constant system issues I feel halve train or less. 

The sistem is not ready to work at home, it's the first time the department does this and the system is constantly failing and having to talk to IT for a hour or two, and every time there's a issue and I'm not taking cases I don't get paid and have to do overtime to make up the hours.

I feel stress and like I'm shoking before every case comes in, and the feeling doesn't go away after the case, I've been working this type of job for 5 year's and the first time I felt like this.

I know I should feel lucky that I still have something to do, but to be honest I think I'm in a good position financially to wait until the lock down is over and then apply back in my other department but I'm not sure.",30Apr2020,1
926,"When I was younger I lived in a very competitive environment and while I wasn't exactly bullied I was basically ignored, belittled and taken advantage of by many peers and even several teachers. I feel like there were very very few people who helped me during this time and I think this is the reason that for many years I disliked helping others. I think it was like because of the environment i came from i felt like i always to compete with everyone and felt that if I helped anyone, they would be at a higher standing than me. And since so few people helped me back then, why would I extend a courtesy I never received to others ?

Fast forward to today, I'm in a position when i can influence and help many people. The issue is that i still feel hesitant helping others. The irony is that I would never be where I am today without a few key individuals who helped me get here. I dont like having this mindset.

How can I get over what happened to me in the past and start to truly want to help others succeed and be happy?",30Apr2020,1
927,"Ok so the title may be a bit confusing and it doesn't exactly explain the situation. I (16F) am part of a friend group full of people with mental illnesses(including myself). I have found this friend group amazing and it's full of wonderful people that I love talking to most of the time. One of the people in this group (14M) who I'll call Alex (of course not his real name), has been through some really really tough shit, I don't even know the half of it as I've been told. He is extremely emotionally draining and I never know what to talk about with him. About 4 days ago I said some stuff about him that I shouldn't have said and if it wasn't brought to my attention I wouldn't have noticed how toxic and bad of me it was to say. For context I said ""He's a psychological case,"" and ""we were never friends in the first place."" The second one was just bad wording on my part because I meant that we hadn't actually become friends until after the friend group had formed. Calling him a psychological case was absolutely horrible and I should never had said or even thought something like that. Alex sees us as best friends but in my head I don't really know if I can call him a close friend. I don't think genuinely want to be friends with him and I feel like I'm faking it. It probably doesn't help that a couple months before my partner and I started dating they both liked eachother and we don't really know if Alex still likes my partner.

930,"I don't know how to start this. So for the greater part of my life Ive always been a very happy person. Recently Ive have been going through hell, and I am left with a mix of feelings I feel that I need to talk about with someone. 

So I am in my 20s. Over the past 2 years, I have held five jobs. I feel like this inability to stick with something is going to start affecting me in the long run, but these recent jobs that I have worked have just been so difficult that I found myself hating them after a very short period. Ill go ahead and explain what I did over the past 2 years. 

Current job: This one is real hard. I work for a small grocery store chain in Ontario. My job is to stack heavy crates from one pallet on to another fast enough to meet the time standards set by the warehouse. This job is exhausting, as I usually work 10 to 12 hour days, sometimes over a 5 day period with sporadic off days. Its so repetitive while also so physically demanding that I basically have attained this feeling of being dead inside and strong hatred for my life. Recently I have been forcing myself to stay and just get through the day. I feel like this job is taxing on my youth as well, as I am starting to not be able to move and bend in different ways because of my painful joints. Most alarming to me is the fact that I wake up every day feeling like and elderly man. Its functionally destroying my body.

Previous Job: I worked in a factory that produced chemicals. The work by itself was actually okay to me. It was relatively easy and engaging. I also made very good money for someone my age. Though we were working 14 hour days 5 days a week,  I was bringing in roughly 80 to 90k per year in USD. This was a place that lacked both professionalism and safety standards. In my first week of training the drug addict and alcoholic training me stopped showing up. As rumor began to spread that he was faced with a rehab or jail situation, and that he would not be returning soon, I eventually had to train myself. It was an environment where I was surrounded by criminals and ex cons, and my bosses were the same. Though I had been so poorly trained, I still had to withstand daily berating from my boss.  I'm not exaggerating, the boss would scream at me on a daily basis about things that I would have known better if I had been given proper training. Though all of this I could handle, main reason why I left at this job was the also health related as there was no ventilation in this facility and I would return home at the end of the day with symptoms of over exposure to the chemicals we were working with. My throat would ache and I would have a headache and feel dizzy. It wasn't uncommon for me to cough up phlegm. Science had proven that long term exposure to these chemicals significantly increases risk of cancer and causes nerve damage, so I knew that I would have to leave eventually. My lungs still haven't been the same 4 months later, and I'm worried they will be damaged for the rest of my life.

To keep this short, I'm going to summarize  my last 2 jobs in one paragraph. A restaurant job, which I actually loved through and through, but the money wasn't there. It was actually very hard for me to leave this place. A sheet metal job, which I accepted as a temporary gig. I knew it was going to be bad, it was just mind numbly  drilling holes for 10 hours. 

My first job was for a plumbing contractor. Though a lot of the time I really enjoyed the work, I had to be working outside during the brutally cold winters, where I experienced temperatures of -30 C without the windchill. Though again most of the work I didn't mind, the company was very shady and I found myself working with ex cons and criminals. One guy had an anger management problem so bad I several times saw him go ballistic and start screaming and smashing things in front of my boss who failed do even talk to him about it. This was a regular occurrence, along with checking your paychecks to see how much the owner shorted you that week.

So now here is where I really feel that I need some advice, and I'm sorry for the rant I really felt that I needed to get this out to someone. I feel like because of the amount that have left and found new jobs means that I am unemployable and incapable of holding a job for a long term. I'm worried that Im a trash worker who jumps ship anytime stuff gets a little bad. On the other side of the coin however, I have a feeling that I am justified in wanting to leave and find something better for myself. Im worried that I will never find something I can tolerate, and that Ill just keep job hopping forever. Thoughts?

937,"I can imagine I'm not the only one feeling this now. But this week, more than ever, I've just struggled with keeping myself occupied and having a general motivation to do anything anymore. 

My sleep schedule has become totally ruined and I struggle to have any will to get out of bed in the afternoon. Unfortunately, I'm not able to quarantine with my close family because of closed borders which restricted me from flying home to be with them. Therefore, I'm currently living with my uncle and auntie, which isn't as bad as being stuck in a student accommodation room by myself, but it's still another item on the list that's bothering me.

Additionally, one of my closest friends who lives back home is going through a rough time with depression and other personal issues so not being able to be there for her is taking quite a toll on me. I should mention I do video call them a couple of times a week just to see their faces and catch up with them which kind of helps a little.

Some of my friends recommended me to start new hobbies like learning a new language or new software, but to be honest those things just don't interest me enough and ties in with the lack of motivation to do anything. Not to forget about the uni work I still need to complete... I've been putting that aside for quite some time now. My days just consist of having breakfast at 3 pm now, passing time on YouTube or Netflix (which I've noticed I'm starting to lose interest in too) and racking up hours of screen time on my phone.

938,"I (19F) began university last year February- in another province/ state. Having being a ""quote on quote loser"" in high school, I was concerned about my university social life. I imagined finding closeness with members of my class but this was not the case. 

On the last day of our orientation week, I was acquainted to a male, we shall call Yang (21M). I knew he was trouble- my kind of trouble- the minute I lay my eyes on him. Believe me- I know how cliche this sounds- just hold on there.

Since we were living at the same residence- everything moved at a ,somewhat, fast pace. As the days passed by- the connection between Yang and I grew exponentially. We allowed ourselves to get carried away- in the most beautiful way. Although we struggled to communicate effectively and express our concerns regarding our relationship- things were moving along steadily.

Untill- I got a little too drunk, a little too insecure and very irrational. In an attempt to win Yang's attention: I attempted to sleep with 2 of his close friends (not simultaneously). (According to my knowledge- I was not intimate with either of them, but I made an ATTEMPT to be. However, one of Yang's friends said otherwise to Yang- then later wanted to withdraw his statement.) After this incident- Yang deleted and blocked my number and we split ways.

A week later a rumor emerged. People began twisting the story and said I was raped. When Yang heard this he rushed over to make sure I was okay. I explained to him (and then later everyone else) exactly what I remember happened - but not my immature reasoning behind it all. He went on to explain that the event made him realize his much he cared about me- and that we should try start over, do we did.

Throughout our relationship- Yang always seemed to be on the fence. He was never comfortable with public displays of affection yet he would cling to me when we where alone. We never had titles. We would ooscillate between friends with benefits and ""situationship"" often - so there was always confusion. 

Confusion was the biggest- among many others- issue we had. We constantly struggled to communicate effectively- but always seemed to find a way to stay together- most of the time it was just sex.

Sex played a big part in our relationship and I didnt like that. Yang knew that he was the first and only person I had slept with- he thought of it as ""special"". Being as immature as I was- I wanted to prove to myself that my love for him was not dependent on this ""special"" little fact. I cheated on him repeatedly and justified it- every single time. In fact I used it to fuel my love for him. I would constantly think about him while I was with someone else and that somehow made me think it was okay. 

With Yang- sex was soulful. A big part of me felt like we were genuinely making love and I though that could sustain us. But as soon as my doubts became too much for him, instead of reassuring me- in the way he certainly knew I needed him to-things ended and we became friends with benefits. 

He said he felt as though he was loosing himself when he was with me. He said he was struggling to ""get over the insecurities he had built up with his ex"". I honestly blame myself for not communicating better, for not saying that we could work through EVERYTHING ,because I genuinely adored and loved him.

By this time it was only June and I wasnt ready to give up on dating. I made an effort to meet new people - and I did. Some promised me the world- but just for the night. Some turn into friends. But they all reminded me why I loved Yang- so I stopped searching for ""someone new"".

When I spoke about my encounters with Yang- he would get upset. Regardless of the fact that we were friends with benefits, he would get jealous. This encouraged me to ""stay off the market"" and loyal to him. 

When September came around- I fell pregnant. When I told Yang- he adamantly insisted I have an abortion. However, I expressed my religious and personal views on the subject- and he finally agreed that it was my decision to make. (He added that he wouldnt be a present father if I decided to carry the pregnancy through.)

Tragically, I miscarried late October. I had a terrible break down- after having too much wine- one evening. Coincidentally, Yang was out drinking with his friends- but lied and said he was with his sister. My roommate walked in on me- during my cutting episode - and in a panic called Yang. Because I was intoxicated - I dont remember when Yang arrived to the scene but I remember that he cleaned my cuts and put me to sleep. I just remember him being very calm- maybe because he knew I had been cutting weeks before the break down. 

A few days later, Yang had a panic attack and was rushed to hospital. He said he had been very worried about me and felt hopeless. It broke my heart when he said that. I never wanted to cause him such trauma but I did.

During this time we were also writing finals and wanted to get our minds off everything. We baked, cooked, smoked weed and had a lot of fun with eachother. For a while- we were getting along perfectly and if felt like we were really a couple. Regardless-I never thought this time meant much to him. I hated the fact that I felt so unjustified in loving him, but I realised that I couldn't necessarily control the way he portrayed himself and his emotions. 

By the end of the year we were officially together and wanted to keep thinks going through the holiday apart. We argued about misunderstanding eachother, jealousy, insecurities and everything in between. However- there were still times I really felt at home with him. We knew that our arguments were fueled by social media and couldnt wait for the new year to begin so we could figure out our new relationship schedule and talk out any issues- face to face- as per usual. 

Before we had the chance to do this- he ended things. In his eyes the bad outweighed the good and he didnt want to hurt me any longer- or waste my time. I understood that we had been toxic for eachother but we were supposed to change that when the new year began.

When we broke up - Yang requested that we pretended we were strangers. We walked past eachother -between lectures- many times, but said nothing. It broke my heart to know that I could be thrown away so easily... but I still love him.

It's been 3 months since the break up- not long, yes- but I feel like I will forever be consumed and affected by him. He is the subject of my poetry, dreams and daily thoughts. I've deleted his contact details and unfollow him from social media- as per his request- but I cant help but find myself crying at 2am because I saw a girl in his feed.

A few weeks back- Yang texted me. He wanted to be friends- but I declined. I explained that it would break my heart to hear or see him with someone new- someone that was everything I couldnt be. We havent spoken since- he ignored my (only funny to me) ""3am horny hour"" text.

If you've made it to the end of this post- I'm sure you're wondering why I'm telling this story... I need advice. What do I do? Jump back into the dating pool? Find a f- buddy? Stay single and tough it out? 

I crave emotional and physical intimacy- to the point of crying -somedays. At my core- I believe I am engineered to seek and find fulfill in all forms of intimacy- but I no longer feel safe in trusting myself, desires and decisions regarding my desires. 

Thank you in advance and I apologize for any typing errors made.",30Apr2020,1
939,"I'm 19 years old. A freshman in college and I can't seem to let go of the past to move forward.

I'm not too sure how to start my post, but I'm gonna start off by giving you guys some information about me. Growing up, I've always had a hard time saying no to people. I'm still trying to figure out to this day why this is such a struggle for me. I try to balance and keep everyone happy but usually that causes me to break under the weight of the hefty plate I have created for myself. I'm also very empathetic, which makes me hard to draw the line with others and set boundaries.

Because of this, I have gotten myself into some pretty deep situations, specifically with people. I have an extremely hard time saying ""no"" or setting boundaries when someone doesn't like me, especially if I don't feel the same way for them. I try and find a way to let them down easy but I must admit, I'm not very direct or firm with what I say. And then it drags out. It drags out slowly and the other person becomes attached and then when it all starts piling inside me emotionally, it just explodes and comes out in one big punch, and there's no choice but for me to be direct and straight forward.

I suppose I'm scared of a negative reaction. I'm always scared to be straightforward from the start because I feel like then they won't want to be friends anymore, but deep down, I know that has nothing to do with my personally.

There's so many guys that I have ended on bad terms with because I wasn't straightforward with what I wanted, and I can't seem to move forward. I feel bad for making them see something that they thought was there just because I couldn't be straight forward with them.

Has this happened to anyone before? How have you become direct?",30Apr2020,1
941,"This is a long thread, so be prepared for quite a lecture, and if you take the time to read and reply, thank you so much.

Me and my best friend (we're in our early twenties) used to do everything together. We were very close and talked to each other every day. Then one day, she matched me with one of her coworkers and we've been dating for over a year now.

During our first months of our relationship, which took place in 2019, my friend was also in a relationship and she has been dating that person before she matched me. Even though we were a little less free with our time, we would still talk and hang out as often as we could; it was just like before.

And then, she and her boyfriend broke up. That's when everything changed in my opinion. She was absolutely devastated, and I tried to be there for her; I offered to go visit her, I asked her what I could do to make her feel better, I would ask her everyday how she was feeling... She declined every time I asked to go visit her, so I let her on her own while still texting her, because I thought, that's what she wanted.

After a week or two since the breakup, she became really close friends with someone. She would post things about her new friend (and vice versa), they would always hang out and I always saw them together on social media. I was happy that she had a new friend, but at the same time... I felt replaced. We were supposed to go to a concert together that we have been waiting for since the beginning of the year, and at first I didn't want to go because I've learned that she has been talking bad about my love life and that she shared personal stuff about me to her co-workers. But I decided to brush it off and go enjoy the concert. As I was waiting for her in a nearby spot, I see her arriving... with her new friend. She never told me she was bringing her, I only thought that she was her lift. They were talking to each other the whole evening and I really felt left out.

We barely saw each other during the summer. She didn't make it to my birthday party even though she switched her work dates before to be available for other events (although to be fair, we were mostly couples and my other single friend couldn't make it at the last minute, so I understand why she wouldn't want to come), she said she was too busy to hang out when I asked her when she was free, she left on a trip with the new friend and on the night of her birthday, I invited myself to see her since I was working during the day (and yes, she was with the friend).

The other day, she had yet another issue with a boy and she was really upset to the point that she deactivated all of her social media accounts for a while. I asked her if she was fine and if I could do anything for her; she told me that she was ok, and even left me on read after I said that I noticed she deactivated her accounts. A few days later, while I asked her how she was doing, she told me that she felt depressed and that everybody wanted to hang out with her... but the thing is, she never told ME that she was feeling depressed.

And to makes things worse, my boyfriend and my friend dislike each other, and their tense relationship began around the time of her breakup. After a while, my boyfriend offered to talk to her about their differences (she declined at first but eventually accepted). It did help a little bit, but they still don't talk to each other.

I don't know what to do. She was my best friend for 3 years and its thanks to her that I have my boyfriend. I feel like I want to talk to her about what I've heard, but she never talked about any of this directly to me, so I'm afraid to worsen the situation between her and my boyfriend or her co-workers (she confides to her co-workers). Sometimes I feel like if I did more during the beginning of her breakup, maybe it wouldn't go so bad... maybe I should've told her to hang out more instead of asking her if she needed anything.

People are nice and professional, and the work is very interesting. My manager has asked me for a meeting to discuss a new potential candidate who I used to work with in the old place. Unfortunately, this person was not only an awful worker, they also constantly made others cry, belittled them, and was directly responsible for multiple people quitting. 

I obviously feel like I owe it to my new workplace (and myself) to be honest, however I realize I've not been here long enough to have garnered the goodwill and trust needed to be fully candid. How can I go about explaining why I have reservations about hiring this person without making it seem petty or unprofessional?",30Apr2020,1
948,"Hi

This is my first time posting so I am new to all of this.
Cince the quarantine i have had some problems...
Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 10 months now, i am 18 and she is a couple months younger than 18. We aren't allowed to see each other and she is really taking the rules 100% serious (like everyone should). So if i go to her house so we can walk or take a bike trip, i can't kiss or hug her, i can't even touch her. It has been hard for me. But now that we can't touch each other, there is a distance between us, like a mental distance. Her interest in me is verry slowly disappearing. She thinks it is because we can't touch, and it just don't feel the same. So she thinks it is better to not see each other in the real world, so no more walks or bike trips. I can't really blame her, it does not feel natural. But i don't know how to get her interest back if we can't see each other anymore at all. We text and snapchat but it is just not the same. And i really don't know how to feel about the 'not seeing each other'. It feels like the distance is just getting bigger if we do that. 
Does anyone know what i should do? 
I can't be the only one having these problems, right?",30Apr2020,1

951,"For some background information, I'm currently 16, and the dude I'm trying to break up with is 18. Because I see this a lot, I'm just going to give him a fake name like Dylan. 

Please bare with me, I'm not very good at spelling, and my grammar can be kinda wack, so don't get mad. 


Around 2 years ago, Dylan had left a comment on one of my Instagram pictures. - At the time, I was around 14 or so. The comment was something like, ""You're pretty cute,"" and not long after sending the comment, he messaged me saying something similar. Being a naive and stupid preteen, I kinda went along with it because not a lot of people did that kinda stuff, so I liked it. We eventually started online dating and such. Somethings that should've stuck out to me, like  that he was ignoring me when he got mad at him, but I had been so ""in love"" with him, that I always begged him and apologized. After about 4 months of online dating, he went absolutely silent. We hadn't even fought, he just straight up disappeared on me for a month. I kinda had cried and moved on from that, assuming he had just gotten tired of me. But. I guess I was wrong because a month later, he came back with a typical excuse of being busy with school and stuff. I didn't really pay it any mind, and went back to dating. It had been fine for a while, then it got really weird around 8 months ago. We agreed on going to watch a movie at the movie theater in my town. (I forgot to mention, he only lived a few towns away from me at the time.) When we did meet up, I was a little startled because he didn't really look like the pictures he had been posting, but I decided I'd just watch the movie and leave. We awkwardly watched the movie, not really saying much after the movie either, and then I quickly went home. I felt really disgusted with myself that I went on a date with that guy. - I'm not really one to judge, but when we first met, he tried to hold my hand, and he smelled god awful. - All together, I was just super creeped out. When I got home, I sent him a message along the lines of, ""I don't think this is really going to work out, you said you looked like something else than what you looked like."" Of course, he ended up yelling at me and calling me a bitch because I wasn't open to people looking a certain way. - Which is not true, I was just mad that he lied to me for so long. He told me that he was sorry and that we weren't gonna break up because he'd be more truthful, which I ended up ignoring and blocking his number. 

This is where It kinda gets scary. 
A few months after that all happened, it was summer, and since both my parents are working, I have to stay at home with my older brother. I have a room at the front of the house, so I can see the whole street. Sometimes when I was working on a painting or some art project, I'd look up out my window because I'd hear a car park, and it confused me because the only people other than my brother that had cars were my parents, and they were gone. I could see the car too, it was parked in front of my neighbors. It's like one of those small black cars that a lot of people drive, it's hard to explain, I'm not very good with cars, but it had a sticker on the back window. It was like a legend of zelda sticker, or some green game sticker. - Anyways, I'm getting a little off topic. This car would always park in front of my neighbors house, but they never left the car, and about an hour later, they moved in front of my house. I couldn't really see all that good from my window, so I couldn't really make out the person at the time. I didn't really think much of it, and went on with my life for a while, and that car would sometimes appear, but now it seems like I see that car every where I go now. I know it's his car now because one time he got out and walked up and down the street. I almost shit myself when I saw that. I used to go on walks, but the car would try to follow me, so I'd run back home. I tried to tell my parents, but they think it's the neighbors car, so they don't believe me. I'm thinking I should unblock him and officially break up with him, so that he actually leaves me alone, but I'm terrified that he's gonna do something if I tell him that. He doesn't even bother leaving if I'm not home, he just sits and wait, then goes to do something, then comes back and sits again. I'm on the bottom floor, so he probably notices the pink currants on my window, and knows that's my room by now. I swear to god, I sometimes see him walk by my room at night (Like a shadow) I decided to keep my currants closed, and I'm sleeping in the spare bedroom. I don't know if it's him, but sometimes when I'm in my room painting and such, I hear stuff hit my window, and like hell I'm gonna open my currants at this point. This is getting out of hand, and I just don't know what is going on anymore. I just live in fear now, I don't even want to go to the store with my mom anymore, I just want him to go away. What should I do? Please help.",30Apr2020,1

954,"Get ready for a long lost, 

Okay so I’m in the military. I have 2 huge things going against me which greatly influence the response I’ve been getting so far. 

I came here in aug 2019 ever since then I haven’t been able to do 100% of my job in the military due to a medical condition. For months I just sat there doing nothing until it was time to go home. 

I’m at the regimental level which means, there’s people under us. 3 battalions and they have companies etc. above us is division. What does that mean for me? When I came here I was an e-2 Pfc but right firm the start, since I’m regiment it meant I was in charge of people in the battalions with the same MOS. 

A few months after this whole thing started of me not able to do my job, division gave us their blessing for me to start working in my MOS but a modified version. I’m in charge of everything related to my MOS but on the admin side of things which means, everything computer related. 

More specifically, I’m in charge of maintaining this website my job uses to keep track of everyone’s certifications and qualifications. We have to renew them fairly often so I make sure everything is ready before I send it off to division for approval. Division has been impressed by my work so far. My direct supervisor well, he’s the “more” type. 

Anyways, one of the battalions in particular is causing issues. He’s a CPL e4 and I’m a LCPL e-3 which means I’m lower rank them him but still above him as it’s billet over rank. This one guy in particular is having trouble coming to terms with being monitored by someone of lower rank than he is. I keep telling him to fix his shit at first I was nice about it and I’d do it myself because if you want something done right might as well do it yourself right? But eventually this dude got so lazy that i was convinced no one could seriously be this sloppy so I stopped doing it for him and telling him what to fix. He would ignore me constantly and my boss would have to be knocking down his down for him to listen. 

About a week ago I sent an email to his unit telling him his marines would be disqualified if he did not upload files ASAP to said program. He immediately called me all pissed I remained calm and answered, “cpl, I’m just following orders, trust me this is not coming from me, it’s from division” etc eventually he hung up and it died down or so I thought. Yesterday, he involved an officer in the emails trying to burn us but answered my email with “why do I Harv to do this?, division says we only have to do x y and z but not a b and c” so my boss seeing all of this taking place finally spoke up and responded the email with “cpl name, update your orders ASAP, the order has been revised to blah blah blah if you look at page 3 paragraph 6B you’ll see it says you have to do x y and z” so he got burned but since the cpl involved his officer my boss CCed the main guy, the “CEO” version of our MOS. Said main guy called down to the battalion and wiped the floor with the CPL for 1. Ignoring orders 2. Trying to fuck us over 3. Being salty 

Which brings us to today. I sent out an email again telling them to fix new shit and I was so done with their bullshit that I was like “good morning gentlemen, the following marines are being deleted and or need updates ASAP “named almost all of their marines because said cpl again was a slob and didn’t want to listen to me so he never uploaded their files. And I was like “here are the 10 files EVERYONE needs” and listed them all then, “if you know your marines don’t have these, upload them yourself, don’t wait for me to knock on your door” etc. 

As a result of this, I have been instructed to CC his boss on all emails. He’s 100x saltier than he used to be. He has now stoppped answering all emails but he has his second in command answer them which tbh I really don’t care as long as that work gets done. 

So yeah those 2 things I have going against me? I’m a lance 3/e3 in charge of people up to 2 ranks above me. The other one is my medical condition. I’m not allowed to do 100% of my job just the admin side because well I’m not allowed to. In the marine corps there’s this culture of if you’re “broken” you’re automatically “weak” and pretty much everyone loses respect for you which also leads to the ignoring",30Apr2020,1
955,"So it started in highschool I was a freshman and he was a senior he was friends with my 19 year old brother and so we knew of each other’s existence. We had a class together and our friendship kind of bloomed from there. I did not want to develop feelings for a senior, but it inevitably happened. My parents think freshman dating seniors are sluts and I totally agreed with that before I actually developed feelings for this boy. So we decided to keep it a secret from everyone and dated in secret. We were going strong until I lost feelings because I have commitment issues and it’s hard for me to show my emotions which he wants from me. Then I started talking to other guys which I never thought I would’ve done but I was desperate for attention that he wasn’t giving me. Something traumatic happened and it kind of brought us closer together, but I still wanted to date this other boy that was wayyy closer in age but I liked the maturity of the Senior boy and the way he treated me. Thankfully i didn’t lose my virginity to the senior because i definitely would’ve regretted it. He is kind of a piece of shit human being and I think dating the boy that’s closer in age with me would be a wise decision but I do still have feelings for the older boy. Anyone see my problem here? Or am I also just a piece of shit human being that’s “cheating” on my boyfriend. I do not condone cheating and I never thought I would ever flirt with other guys while in a relationship, but I don’t think i’m happy in this. If I were to break up with him I am worried he would go back to vaping, drinking, and smoking that I got him off of. I do care about this boy but I also want to be happy and make my parents happy. Sorry i’m kind of a piece of shit, but i’m not sure what to do so i’m gonna post my problems on reddit and get a second opinion and maybe some advice. 😅

958,"I have an international friend whom I befriended at my university right before we had to leave because of COVID-19. She is currently one of the few residing on campus. For her, this experience has left her socially isolated, as her base of friends has all left for home. Due to her unique circumstances, she is unable to return to family in her home country; essentially having to live the next several months all by herself.

We've grown close as good friends over the last few weeks, communicating often. Over time, I've realized she's dealing with heavy doses of loneliness and abandonment. I've noticed symptoms of depression have been seeping through. She's burdened with a recent loss that I can tell she hasn't finished grieving over. Alongside that, she has lost a huge sense of self-worth. I find myself well able to care for others through understanding, but I find this situation a challenging one when I can't physically be there for her.

Besides myself, she doesn't have many other friends that genuinely support her. Even her aforementioned base of friends aren't readily available or as genuinely caring. Her familial relationship is not the best so this negatively enhances her isolation. 

Not in a selfish sense, but I'm also unsure if my being there for her to the detriment of my own health outweighs the virtue of compassion. There have been some instances where I don't sleep just to be there for her while she cries through the night. 

All the most I can do is be there through virtual means which has only allowed me to do so much. Even though that's the most I can be doing, I don't feel as though it's ultimately bettering things. More or less I'm asking for others' insight on what I should or could be doing.",30Apr2020,1

But I trust the people and the community :)

Basically, I'm planning to travel the major cities of Europe (Paris, Vienna, Florence, etc). I've been once, but hope to go back in about three years after I graduate college. 

I had the idea to do a travel youtube series that is like an old show I use to watch called Hidden City. Basically, a writer would visit a city and talk about three crimes that make the identity of the city.

What idea for a topic sounds more interesting on paper? 

I was thinking of between two ideas. One was basically revitalizing the show, and making it like Netflix's ""Dark Tourist"" where I go to historians and locations to tell the story of three crimes that make a city.

The other was more of an art theme. I would go to three influential spots for artists and tell the stories about painters and musicians. One idea was going Hospital at Arles in France, and sorta show viewers what it was like to be Van Gough, and show the artworks he painted there in the asylum.

Any other ideas are welcomed! Thanks",30Apr2020,1

967,"I'm warning you, this is a long one.

Ok, so basically me and my best friend met this guy at the university a few years ago. We weren't too close and he didn't pass his year so we kinda drifted apart. Last year we started hanging out with him again. Funnily enough, we first started hanging out together because we three are terrible with girls so we went out together a bit and the chemistry was too good so we very quickly became super close.

Our friend, let's call him Pablito, is an incredibely wholesome person. He's a kind, honest, funny guy, and very down to earth. He's got the personnality of a countryman, (his family descends from farmers) he's a simple man, and enjoys simple activities a lot. (Like harvesting stuff, camping, animals, etc.) He gave up his business studies to pursue a simpler career as a cabinetmaker.

I'm quite different from him to be honest. I have a fairly colorful personnality and was bullied for years, had strict parents that pressured me a lot both socially and emotionally (don't get me started on studies)
I became super shy and suffered a lot from that situation, until I forced myself to move on from that stuff.
Started distancing myself from my parents (our relationship became a lot worse) had bad frequentations (like not dangerous people or anything, but super toxic people)
And I became a weird mix of a funny yet cynical, almost depressed man, and had lost most of my hope in people. Basically, I was a sad, self-centered douche and something of a fairly toxic person myself! I emotionnally hurt a decent amount of people with my frequent idiotic decisions (then again, nothing too serious happened, but when you keep pushing people around you it damages your relationships)
So yeah, I decided to move on once again and started hanging with better people this year and focused a lot on self-improvement and learning to be more empathetic and be thankful to the people around me. I still have a lot of demons to face, but right now, life's better than ever.

Pablito had a weird life of being this very pure person but having a shitty environment. His parents are the owners of a major cosmetic firm and they've got a lot of wealth, but his father's a major asshole and ruined his family, which hurt Pablito quite a lot. His closest friends were assholes and he was too patient with them. Same thing with girlfriends, even his current gf is pretty shitty. 
I think his ability to express his affection has been fucked up through several years of emotional abuse.
He mostly expresses his affection through being super generous (seriously this guy's a lifesaver at times), money doesn't have much value to him, his parents bought him a house and we could literally move in with him with no rent or anything, he's got food whenever we come over (we came a lot these weeks because there's not much to do in this cursed period), he's already brought us to restaurants, enjoys giving us rides to his house, etc. Basically, life with him is a free trial of a wealthy man's life. It's great. But it's been bothering me and my best bud, let's call him Juan, because people have definitely abused him emotionally and used him for his generosity/patience/belongings. We don't have a lot to give him other than our friendship, advice, free time, ideas, etc. He's a messy person so we always end up doing chores at his house or help him in various subjects, but he deserves so much more we can't give him. He lives in a fairly secluded place, we are probably his closest friends right now and he appreciates us a lot, we just spend a ton of time together.

And then the shit begins. I told Juan this week that Pablito wanted to secretly buy him an expensive bicycle for his birthday. (Juan is into cycling)
And to this Juan replied that Pablito wanted to secretly buy me an expensive laptop.

I had told Pablito that I was looking for a new pc because mine was getting old (like 8 years old old) and he had decided to secretely get me one, but not for my birthday. I was suspecting it since he asked me a lot of questions about my wants regarding a computer. I wasn't too worried about that since it wouldn't happen too soon.

However, my pc crashed for the last time this week and I've since been in a major pickle regarding my university projects.
When Pablito learned that, he immediately went to buy me an expensive and fairly powerful laptop for my birthday, which is tomorrow by the way. I know for a fact I'm getting it tomorrow but I don't know if I can accept such an expensive gift (it's probably gonna be over a thousand bucks) and coming from a decently comfortable yet modest family, that's a lot of money for us. I know Pablito's just a pure and selfless goddamn person and he won't expect anything in return but that is too much of a gift and it makes me awkward, it's hard for commonsfolk to accept very expensive gifts. I don't want him too feel like he has to buy our friendship anymore and I want to slowly decline some of his gestures when they're too kind.

We wanted to make Pablito a big painting for his birthday to express him our gratitude, there's not much we can give him that he doesn't have so we though of something more personal. (Doesn't contribute much to the conversation, just that I  absolutely do not have the funds to offer him something that doesn't pale to his generosity)

My parents found me a temporary replacement for my old computer and have wanted to buy me one ever since I passed my first year of business school. I thiught they might feel cheated on if I just get one through a friend.
I made a lot of efforts with my parents during this confinement period and it's been going pretty well between us, better than at least the last 9-10 years.

I then decided to tell my mom about the gift (I mean she would have asked me anyway about the computer since she'd see it) and she was surprised and instantly became very defensive. My parents grew up in a poor country and still have a strong moral code, and it's hard for them to understand that a crazy gift can come without expecting anything in return.
She told me to straight up refuse it and I told her I couldn't promise her anything, that gift still means a ton to me, it's the greatest thing anyone other than my parents has ever offered me and it's truly touching my heart on another level, even if it'd be hard for me to accept or refuse it. I don't want to hurt Pablito, I really really want a pc right now, especially a good one, I don't want to ruin my (admittedly very small, thank you covid) birthday party tomorrow but it's still extremely awkward to me to accept such a gift, as amazing and touching as it is.
I don't want to reject his affection, but people without his financial support (then again, not poor at all, but 1000 bucks is one hell of a gift) will have trouble accepting big gifts. I'd feel very obligated to reciprocate when someone spends so much of a valuably resource to make me happy, when a few beers, a game or even remembering my birthday would have been more than enough.

After telling her I wasn't sure about my decision, my mother became even more defensive about it. She still sees me as the self-centered prick I've been most of my life. (Again, I'm still not perfect, but I try my best) She thinks I was looking for his generosity and actually called me a BEGGAR, thinking I was intentionally abusing and fishing for my friend's generosity but telling him once about my need for a pc (I don't think that's an ok thing to say) and I'm starting to feel even more terrible about accepting the gift tomorrow. I've asked advice from some friends and most of them told me to refuse that pc.
I absolutely want that pc and the intense validation that such a gift would provide, but I don't think I deserve it.
I just don't know what to do anymore, that's why I'm asking you, reddit, for advice. My birthday is in less than 24 hours and I'm completely clueless about what I'm going to do. (Yeah, I was born on May 1st)

971,"So I'm a 19 year old girl, and I have hated my birth name for years (middle names and last name too, but I've my mind set on changing them anyways).

I used to get bullied in primary school (so since about 9 years old) because of it - for a few different reasons though, so I initially just got annoyed with it. During the time I got bullied, I also had an abusive step-father, so obviously he would call me by my name. My mum likes the name, and she would always get annoyed when I said I didn't like it, so I've avoided bringing it up most of the time.

At the moment I just go by Steph - since it's the shorter version of my name but I still don't like it. I really want to not go by this name but I feel selfish for wanting to change my name, since others would have to get used to a new name, and since im not trans I feel like I shouldn't be changing my name at all.

This name has so many bad connotations surrounding it for me, and I just want it gone. But I don't even have a new name picked out, and I just feel others would be annoyed if I did change it.

Should I go for it?",30Apr2020,1
972,"My dad was the person I trusted the most and told everything too as a kid but over time I realized maybe that’s not the best thing to be doing. My parents got divorced when I was 7 and I never really hated the whole situation (I was actually more pissed of at the fact we had to move) and after we moved back to the city my parents were from I lived with my mom for 6 years after that (3rd grade to 7th grade). The divorce was split custody so after school everyday I’d see him and have dinner, the usual stuff, then I’d go home, sleep, then the cycle continued.

During my 7th grade year I was constantly bullied about my sexuality and also my looks, so when my dad found out he could afford to buy a house and get better pay in Oregon he decided to ask me about it. Of course the idea of getting away from it all and starting a new life was amazing to me, almost a miracle. So we moved to a suburb just outside of Portland and everything was great, I saw my mom every two months back down in California, everyone I met accepted me for who I was and I soon became well known at the school. But things were not so well with my home life, my dad would constantly be worried and a little freaked out at the idea that his teen son was accepting the fact he was gay. This soon turned into him saying things like “frame the teacher and get a better grade by saying he asked you to suck his dick” and “just say your school is doing a hate crime with your classes” which made me question him a bit.

Then high school happened and things got worse. I came home one day with a mark on my neck from a guy and he flipped, I had to leave the house and spend the night at a friends due to his anger. I questioned myself, if I was human, if I was terrible, and if I was even safe. He cooled down a little bit, school life was doing great but I would still feel iffy being around him. Whenever I was around him I always felt like if he was questioning if I was gay or not. Admittedly I do a lot of things that a “straight” person would do, I play video games, I run track, I overall am a very masculine person (hell even most of my family was shocked since I didn’t fit the stereotype but they just accepted I was gay and everything was great).

With him questioning and telling me to use my sexuality to my advantage and the disadvantage of others I started feeling like he wasn’t proud of me or didn’t want me around. My dad is also not the greatest when it comes to his anger either, he once took me and hid me at my school one night when my parents were in the middle of the divorce since he was worried he might end up hitting my mom and she’d take custody of me. Things got so bad around Christmas this year I ended up sleeping in the Portland airport on Christmas Eve and frantically calling my mom crying since I wanted some space that night due to him not really acknowledging me that day. Once I told him I needed some space that night he went to a friends house and threatened her family and demanded things like “don’t brainwash my son” and “give him back so I can punish him” when I was actually taking the train away from our city to get to the airport and stay there. I knew it was safe at night since I travelled a lot to visit my mom and so in my mental state I figured staying there for a night and him not knowing would be a good idea. I was wrong.

He called me and threatened to kill me by the time he found me and demanded to know where I was, he tore apart my room and broke half my things and did many other things, I was in shock at that point since I almost felt homeless, I only had a backpack full of school supplies, my transit card, a phone charger, and the clothes I had on. Everything was at the house with him, I was so scared that he’d find me and I’d be put with CPS that I had a panic attack and a TSA agent had to comfort me. Luckily since I was already at the airport and my mom thought it would be best for me to be with her for a week to calm down, she booked me a flight down to SF the same night. Long story short I spent Christmas Eve and morning in a airport, crying and was cold with nothing I owned with me.

Me and my mom call that the Christmas incident (for obvious reasons). And since then both of us have over time came up with a plan if things got worse I move back in with her, with the people who bullied me and tormented me at my old school. But I’m willing to risk that since now I have a better mental state and have actually reconnected with a lot of people from that old school, almost all of them said they would love to have me back and to go to school with each-other again.

But now here is my question to you Reddit, should I risk staying with him and let him try manipulating me but have a good school life OR move back to a place that I dread but am willing to go to if it means I can have a happy mental state and a good family life.
Sorry for the long rant but I have barely told anyone this, most people think my dad is a “cool and loving dude” when he’s just a iffy parent with anger issues.

976,"This is a throwaway account btw, but for background I'm 16f and my grandparents (both are female to help any confusion) stepped in to raise me and my siblings since I was 2 because both my parents were way too drugged up to raise us. I don't know if it's the age difference, the fact that she isn't my mom, or some other underlying reason, but I constantly go out of my way to be rude and show my grandma that I dislike her. 

I strongly believe my life would be much better if I loved them and could feel comfortable around them, but I can't stand being in the same room as them for more than 5 minutes, even on holidays I leave asap into dinner because I simply can't stand my grandmother. I literally plan my day out to avoid seeing them while I get food. I don't know what's wrong with me, neither of them have ever done anything wrong to the point worth mentioning, yes they can be controlling and manipulative which pisses me off beyond belief, but it's nothing compared to my actual mother's actions I guess. 

I can't tell any of my siblings even half of how much I despise my grandparents, I mean they notice when I get snap at them for coming into my room or asking me too many questions, but they don't know that I completely and utterly wish I didn't live with them and hate the sound of my name in her mouth type of thing, sorry if that doesn't make sense :/ I definitely hold my tongue on things like that though, I just ignore them as much as I can and avoid being near them. My problem strongly comes from the fact that my siblings are concerned for me and keep reminding me that my grandmas won't be alive for much longer and I can't make their last years so miserable, and I know I'm supposed to love them and it makes me feel disgusting that I can't.

I've never felt this way about anyone else before, and I can't give you a solid answer for why I feel this way. All of the relationships in my life are relatively stable, I rarely get into fights with anyone and I have good supportive friends, so I don't understand why I feel so completely alone with my parents. My plan is to simply apply for college somewhere in Europe to get away from them as soon as I graduate high school, but I feel kind of sad that I'm running away and don't even know why. 

Thank you so much to anyone that took their time to read this, it might just be stupid and maybe this is just what being a teenager is supposed to be like, but I just need someone else's opinion because there isn't anyone I could tell this to in person, sorry.",30Apr2020,1
977,"Me and a group of people have been in the same Instagram group chat for  like a year and I really don’t like being involved with them. There’s 3 people in particular that would try to ruin my life if I left the GC. 

A few weeks ago those 3 people made a fake account of me and followed everyone from my school. They started posting racist stuff because they thought it would be funny to see my reaction. I talked to them about it and explained how it was extremely messed up to do that to me and I thought they understood they had gone too far.

Then last week I learned that they were trying to get my account taken down because I didn’t let them have admin in the GC. Again, I told them that was going way to far and they said they were sorry. Then maybe a day later they started making fake allegations that I was a pedo (even though I’m a minor) and I even got them to admit that it was completely fabricated. They like making me mad and it’s making me afraid to even go on insta because it’s a 50/50 chance that they’ll try to mess with me again.

My brother is under the illusion that Covid-19 is a mass media manipulation and isn’t real... and so he does not social distance and has his ex girlfriend over every single day. He also hangs out with another one of his friends quite often- car rides, his house, my parents’ house. Complete carelessness. 
I’m not going to lie I’ve lost it and had several panic attacks over this, and yelling matches/meltdowns that end up in me insulting him. I’ve yelled at my parents for allowing it. My brother laughs in my face, calls me crazy/insane and fear driven, he says my fear is what will kill mom and dad and not his actions. He also started going on a full on rant on how Covid-19 is a huge lie made up but higher ups and the symptoms are created by 5G towers’ radiation?? 

I even confronted my brothers ex girlfriend and told her that at least if she’s there, with my dads condition if she can please wear a mask, and gloves if she can. After that, I’ve seen her over and over again there with NO mask or anything, just so careless of her as well. 

I need advice on what to do. I am so full of anxiety and fear that my parents are at risk, especially my dad. My brother is so selfish and doesn’t see it. I can’t stand by and watch as he brings friends over who REFUSE to wear masks and walk/sit/touch all common areas of my parents’ house.

5 years ago my friend group all stopped talking to me with no warning. They said I wasn't a good friend and to stop talking to them.
This moment traumatized me and I still have a hard time opening up to people.
2 years ago I tried to meet new people and became friends with a couple of guys I met at a boardgame day.
I'd go over and play games every week. On Thanksgiving I met my first girlfriend. We hit it off so well we talked until 5am and just enjoyed each other's company.
I didnt get her number and only saw her again later that year in November. I took a risk and I tried dating for the first time. We hit it off really well and I moved out of my parents with her into a duplex with my friends. We were together for 9 months and was hoping to propose to her.
Then i got really sick. Entire days I felt like I was walking in slow motion. I had no friends outside of my roommates and girlfriend to talk to and the relationships started to become toxic.
I had to quit my job and drop out of college. My entire day i would be throwing up in the toilet. I tried to go to the hospital and it took 3 months to figure anything out.
My girlfriend dumped me as soon as my medication started working. I went back the next afternoon to get my stuff and everything was in a pile in the sun room.
She wouldn't let me take my pet fish back and I wasnt even permitted to enter the room that I had lived in for months.
I was completely heartbroken. I was an emotional mess for months. This had brought back all the pain I had when my childhood friends some of 18 years shut me out with no warning.
I was planning on going back to University next year, but all of those people are there.
I have severe trauma and barely trust anyone. It feels like everytime I try to reach out it's just a matter of time until it all crashes down.
I am thinking of just skipping town and moving to a different province.
The people had traumatized me and thinking about them puts me into a panicked state.
I'm not sure if I need to talk with someone or what but I dont think I can handle seeing them again.

Does anyone have some life advice or perspective?

I want independent and private online accounts with the bare minimum info required. I also prefer to sit down, open my pc, and browse calmly FB or news sites, deliberately.

And I don't like apps because I feel they steal the pleasure of little things like figuring out where to go with just a map, or coming up with a meal plan, or calculating how many km I have walked or getting pasta's cooking time right.

**Background:** My gf is 25 (we've been dating for 3yrs), goes to UCSD and has some major problems with sleep. This has been an issue before COVID-19, but has continued and arguably worsened through the quarantine. She lives at home with her parents and we do not live together.  


**The issue:** She's a very deep sleeper and I am not--so it's likely difficult for me to actually understand what she's going through. It only takes me 1 alarm and I'm up, but with her... she'll sleep through all 10, me calling her, and her family physically present, calling for her to wake up. It's gotten bad enough to where she's slept through classes, and almost missed a midterm today. She asked me to call her and I did, 8 times. she hung up every time. I'm more than happy to help her wake up but I can't spend 30-45min of my day trying to wake her up, every time she naps.   


Now she claims not to have memory of her actions while she's half conscious. I'm not sure what to make of that as she's lashed out verbally and completely out of character at family and even myself one time. She's also been a very energetic girl who has been able to survive on 5hrs of sleep a night for a week easily. But lately, she hasn't been able to get more than a couple hours here and there--and it's been worse in quarantine.   


She also refuses to see a doctor at UCSD medical because, depending on the day, she's either doesn't have time, doesn't think they'll find anything, scared they will find something, doesn't want to burden others, or is just procrastinating (there may be more but I think you get the gist.",30Apr2020,1

She talked about subleasing, but only having male people contact her, which she was gracious when I told her no. She then said she might move back in, which I was thinking, great.

I thought maybe I was really good at it or something but one night my GF came over and she heard me. She came to check on me immediately and she was in the same living room with the same loud TV on. 

Last summer, my mom and I spent 5 weeks traveling bc we had the money saved up. My mom refused to stop talking about how she “likes to eat healthy” and she “hasn’t eaten fast food in a year” and she “lost x amount of pounds”. She acts like I don’t exist. And I know she knows SOMETHING was up, she’s heard me coughing, she told me I’m “practically anorexic” more than once (but specifically on my 18th birthday), she found thinspo in my room and confronted me about it and then we never brought it up again. I can literally just say “no, I’m fine” and she’d probably buy into it. Like Jesus, how blind do you have to be? It’s not normal to watch your child do certain things like bike for twenty miles every night or hear them coughing in the bathroom. They locked me in the bathroom one time (before I was purging) and demanded I drink laxatives because I was getting sick or they would take me to the ER. I couldn’t swallow because I was crying so hard. No mention of that?? Sure, it’s been a minute since it happened, but that was kind of traumatic to me and we’re just going to pretend it didn’t happen?? And not a single word about my scars? Or the more recent laxative packages? I STOLE laxative pills from my mom and she never said a single word about them going missing. Am I going crazy?

And that’s all my parents ever do. They watch Survivor or the Tudors or West Wing and they don’t talk to me. I think something’s funny or cute and they act like I’m the most annoying person in the room. I didn’t realize until I got my girlfriend what it actually feels like to have someone WANT to listen to you talk and spend time with you. 

Thank god I’m starting to get better because of my girlfriend but it’s like...... Jesus will you please TALK to me?? You’re my mother! (Please don’t worry too much about my mental health, I have DRASTICALLY improved from where I was.)

I’m so scared to talk to her though. I know that’s the easy answer, but how do I talk to someone who doesn’t want to listen? I’m especially haunted by an instance where she flat out told me (almost unprompted) that if I killed myself, she “wouldn’t be able to keep living without me.” This was a long time ago, but I don’t know how to handle this. I can’t tell her anything without fear of her yelling. She tried to talk me out of being gay a few years back and I got in so much trouble I can’t even tell her about my girlfriend. I’ve even been yelled at to give my half-sister (dad’s side) a chance to come back into my life after basically abandoning our family. Things are better with my sister, but only because she had a baby. Literally, we couldn’t even take normal family photos. I saw my sister for the first time in 10+ years and she and her husband and the baby had to be in OUR photos. I love my sister and the baby to pieces now, but my mom cares so much more about them than me. I can’t show my mom one (1) thing I find funny, but she has to shove pictures and videos of my nephew in my face constantly and I’m not allowed to react in any sort of negative way. I can’t tell her that I’m failing college either.

I can’t handle my mom yelling. I can’t take her to therapy (due to the virus) but I wanted to have a group session with her and tell her everything, but I’m more scared of what’s going to happen in the car ride home. I already feel like the most annoying and disappointing person to live, I can’t handle my mom yelling at me like that. She can be so degrading at times with me. When I was a kid, and even to this day, I’m not allowed to be angry or show anger.  I’ve had to suppress any of my favourite things to talk about because she embarasses me about them. She even told me growing up that she thought I was autistic?? Okay, well, I’ve had plenty of testing for learning disabilities and the like and so far, no one has said that I am autistic, but even if I was, why can’t she pretend to be interested in anything I do for five minutes? This is really making me hate myself.

Is this just a weird coincidence? Am I going crazy? Am I reading too much into this? I feel like my mom is a good person and I don’t want to villainize her. I love her. But part of me feels..... betrayed and a bit brainwashed by her.",30Apr2020,1

999,"Last year, I started a driving job that I *loved*, but I was convinced I needed to make more money so I quit via text without notice. After 9 months of not speaking to anyone from that job, I texted my old boss and asked if he would take me back. He agreed but they were shut down due to the pandemic. I've been waiting since March to go back. I finally noticed they reopened but hadn't heard from them yet. Randomly, I saw one of my old coworkers walking on the side of the road yesterday so I gave her a ride and she told me she'd bring me up to the boss. I got a text tonight of him inviting me back as soon as tomorrow, I agreed.

1000,"We've been best friends for nearly exactly a year, I genuinely feel like we are soulmates and it's always been such a fun friendship where we support each other no matter what decisions we make and always get up to no good. When we became friends some really bad things had recently happened to her with a relationship that has caused her a lot of trauma and she's still suffering over a year later. I feel like I got her through it and I was able to bring positivity to her life because I've always been known to be positive and happy.

Last September I went through a really bad breakup that left me with no closure and to this day, especially now we are in lockdown, I am struggling with it. I felt like she tried to be there for me but we always ended up talking about her. She always used to tell me that I wasn't talking enough, when all I wanted to say was that she was talking TOO much. I felt like I didn't have time to grieve properly and had to still be 100% there for her as I felt her problems were worse than mine.

These past few months the bad things continue to happen and I have always supported her to this day. Because I am still struggling to cope and I have my really bad days, it's hard to hear her be constantly negative. I've come to the realisation that from day 1 of being best friends, from the time we got close, 90% of the time we spend together is spent complaining and talking about her problems. Sometimes I wake up and the first thing I hear from her is about how she feels. About her problems. Sometimes I tell her how I feel and she doesn't reply but instead talks about herself. I understand that she has a certain illness and a crazy ex and she's gone through an unbelievable amount, but I've had a tough time too, always have with my mental health and her negativity is making me negative. To the point I open a 2 page message from her talking about something we have spoke about 100 times and I feel tears coming on because I cannot go through talking about it again and again.

The constant weight of her problems is too much along with mine when I don't have time to deal with my own. And when I do talk about mine, we never properly talk about me. She's a ""pity me"" person and she always has been and I've only just realised this. My mental health has become even worse because I am so depressed in lockdown and had to hear her tell me the other day that I should be grateful for being bored right now because when life is hectic again I won't like it. But she KNOWS that I need to be busy to have good mental health. I shouldn't have to feel guilty for being bored and depressed. She's still working, although not an essential worker, and she complains to me about it 10 times a day along with everything else she can complain about.

I'm awake late at night and losing all my motivation because her negativity is making me negative and making me upset over my past. It shouldn't be like this but I'm not sure if this is overreacting. I just want the best for her and for her to be happy but I think I'm about to crack. I'm finding myself ranting about her and that isn't like me. I sent her letterbox sweets yesterday trying to cheer her up but later that night I cried because I felt so alone with my thoughts AND hers.

What's the best way to deal with this? I don't even know where to begin and I don't want to not listen to her to benefit myself.",30Apr2020,1
1001,"So, I'm trying to keep it short and simple cause I'm beyond depressed and just want answers. 

I was a stripper for 5 years, addicted to heroin the entire time (plus 5 years before that. Introduced to oxy at 14). Towards the end I found out I'm 7.5 months pregnant. Almost no symptoms. (had no period for years due to drug use and malnutrition, thought I wasn't able to even get pregnant) So I find out I'm super pregnant and in my area (Detroit) I'm too far along for an abortion. Super stressed and a friend starts helping me make plans to go elsewhere for a super late term abortion. 

2 days later I'm laying in bed and start having worse and worse stomach pains, literally thought I was dying.. at 2 am I sit up to try to go poop (ignorantly thinking maybe that's my issue) and I have a huge, HUGE amount of blood gush from me and cover my bed.

Boyfriend rushes me to hospital where they say my placentas ruptured and start putting me out. I'm still awake when they start cutting me open for an emergency c section. Pain. 


Wake hours later. Incredible pain. 
They ask if I want them to keep trying to keep my baby alive, as he's VERY unlikely to make it. 
I say no, cause even if he made it, my fucked up life would've led to him having a horrible existence of only suffering due to a million health issues, all from me being a piece of shit. I'm a rotten evil piece of shit. I hate myself. 

I spend a few days in a hospital bed, in pain even tho they're dumping duiladed (spelling?) Into my system while I'm still doing lines of heroin because my addiction was out of control. 

I get out and a few months later get fully clean thanks to methadone. 


So, I'm clean now, 2 years later, and after trying to keep it all buried, idk. But now.. I just, I need to know. I can't stay in denial anymore. 

 I wanna know. What did they do with my babies remains?

Please don't tell me how horrible and disgusting I am. I already know. I just need help. Please. 

Thank you, any and all of you for your responses. I will never find forgive myself. I just want to know what I can do now, to honor my child that suffered needlessly. 

Thank you.",30Apr2020,1
1002,"For at least an entire decade of my life my older brother has called me a name multiple times a day. He also calls me bad, stupid and dumb at least once a day. I have asked him to stop numerous times but he never does.

I think his behaviour is very childish and would not be expected from somebody who is in their twenties. 

When I was younger, I brought up the name calling multiple times however my parents never took the situation seriously. My dad would just tell me to stop making a stinky face when I cried.  Perhaps they believe that I am weak because of my sensitivity.

My family laughed at me after they found a note I had written which said that I had cried five times because of the name calling. (Please cut me some slack here, I think I was 8 at the time.)

It hurts to be sensitive. If I were able to throw away any of my characteristics, the one I would choose is this one. 

Nowadays my brother does not call me this name as much but he has implemented cues that bring memories of this name calling. Usually I can push the negative thoughts that come with these triggers aside but yesterday it was more difficult to cope.

I have one memory which brings tears to my eyes everytime I recall it. I think I was 14 at the time.

I told my brother and mother that I wanted to kill myself. I went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife. My mom didn't say anything but my brother dared me to do it. It hurt a lot to think that the people biologically related to me would not even care if I continued to exist or not. It still hurts when I think about it.

""Do it. I dare you,"" he said as I held the knife in my hands.

I asked my mother why she thought that inaction was the best action to make. She told me that there was no point in talking to me if I had already decided to end my life.

This makes me sad because at that point in my life I just wanted  somebody to empathize with me and not brush aside my concerns.

Now, how did I reach such a low negative state of mind?

I like to think of myself as a strong person but perhaps I am actually weak. If I had been stronger, I wouldn't have cried when my father hit me for being shy and not outspoken. I wouldn't have cried that one time when my brother decided to test my pain tolerance and wouldn't stop when I told him to. I would have taken every hit like a champ. Crying because of a sibling bullying you is ridiculous. I've been told that I should be mature enough to not let this bother me. 

That day when I held the knife over my stomach while kneeling, the only reason I didn't follow through was because I was a coward and it is a sin to take your life.

You would think that after over a decade of being called a name, the name would lose it's effect over you.

Unfortunately, this is not my case. Nowadays, rather than suicide I think of cutting myself. I know this is nothing to be proud of and I have never actually put these thoughts into action but I do fantasize about the nice release it would bring. Pain is a good distraction.

I need other distractions because I don't want to be sad over this anymore. It's pathetic and crying won't change anything.

Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks for reading if you have.",30Apr2020,1
1003,"I’m really stuck here and not sure what to say anymore. My dad recently has lost his job, he is 55 years old and got fired because he was just too slow for his employer. He is a metal worker and has worked very hard all his life, just recently everything has gone to shit. I’ve never seen him so desperate and fed up with life.. The job agencies are trying to push him around and making him apply for jobs he could never even do, it’s ridiculous and draining him.

To make things worse my sister is super worried about having to pay for my parents once they’re too old to take care of themselves. In Germany you have to financially take care of your parents if they need to stay in a home for the elderly. 

A few days ago my sister mentioned how my parents are “ready to go” and it wouldn’t be bad if they died because they already lived a long life. She said that to my dad, right in his face.

I don’t even know what to say anymore, I’m just worried this will push him over the edge. I’m absolutely disgusted by my sisters behaviour and not sure what to do. He even said he was thinking about going to a mental health clinic, so this is serious.

Me and my sister had a very traumatic childhood and I get why she reacts in a certain way, but that was way over the top. What kind of person tells someone to basically give up and that it would be ok if they died. I can’t even wrap my head around this. 
My parents have both changed a lot and especially my dad is trying hard to make up for the things that happened in the past, so I don’t understand what’s going, maybe she is just evil. 

Perhaps someone has some advice for me on how to react and what to do, I’m just a bit shocked. I’m trying my best to lift my dad up and I keep telling him that everything is going to be ok.. it just feels like it doesn’t matter sometimes.

1004,"I am male and I just turned 20. I haven't had a gf or sex yet. I am extremely confused about my sexuality. From the porn I watch and the people I have crushes on, I can only assume that I'm straight, but of course it's more complicated than that. 99% of the porn I watch is femdom, solo, or jerk-off instruction videos. I don't have much arousal to typical female + male sex scenes. Most of the videos I watch involve the female dominating the male, but sometimes I watch these ""forced bi"" or ""forced gay"" videos where the mistress forces the viewer to partake in gay sex acts. This makes me inclined to believe I'm bi, but I am not turned on by gay porn (it basically gives me the same amusement as male and female sex scenes). I'm not disgusted by it per se, but I wouldn't say I'm aroused or interested in it by any means. I'm more interested in the femdom stuff. I also never developed a crush on a guy in my life, so far its been only women, but that's also where it gets complicated. For me, I'm unamused by conventional female beauty; models or celebs do absolutely nothing to me. I'm only really attracted to girls who are average, but my brain is just so weird and inconsistent about it. Say, short and skinny girls are my preference. One day my brain is intensely aroused by this, and another day I will have sexual attraction to plus sized women. There's no actual consistency with my sex drive. Sometimes it's extremely strong, other times it's completely numb to the point of depression. I've tried online dating and when women try too hard to be ""sexy"" by showing cleavage or sticking their tongue out, I'm completely turned off. Another thing about porn that makes me confused.. I never actually imagine myself as myself in the porn scenes, sometimes I just get off to the scene, if that even makes sense.

The problem that I'm having right now is about my state of mind. The thing about me is that whenever I think badly of myself (like, how unlovable I am, how ugly I am etc.), my heart actually twitches in pain. It's like Heartbroken Syndrome, but mild.

Every night, without exceptions, I go to bed thinking of situations (sometimes fictional, sometimes real) that hurt me. I think about being disowned by my parents for being gay, about how I'd never find love in life, how I don't deserve love/affections at all, how even if I die no one's gonna miss me, how everyone's gonna be better off and they'd all leave anyway. It's almost like I can't stop thinking about things that I know will hurt me badly. And so it keeps me awake and I haven't been able to get a full minimum of 6-hour sleep in a really long time.

This happens sometimes during the day as well. I feel like I'm being oversensitive, overdramatic and I try so hard but I can't stop. It's been going on for years now, and I'm just so tired. I cry at every little inconveniences, and that makes me hate myself even more (I hate the way I look, the way I talk, the careless way I act towards others because I don't think before I talk and a lot of times I offend people without meaning to, the way I give literally no shit about the people I love, I hate how I'm never enough for anyone and just, everything about me I hate).

I crave for the happiness everyone else feels, and I hate myself even more for it because I know I should be happy for them instead. Isn't it selfish my first thought of seeing someone else being happy is ""why can't i have that? i'm never gonna have that.""

I have a Brother and Sister who are both older than me by around 5-6 years. As I've gotten older I've been able to hang and chill with them from time to time. However, about a year ago, we had gotten into a heated argument that I caused. Even though we passed through it and made it out as family I always felt like it was never truly forgiven, and my words stuck with them (understandably). Since then my sister has gotten her own apartment and my brother and I both visit her and stay the weekend to hang out. But, whenever I'm there I can't help but feel like an outcast, like I don't belong. They are both so much older than I am and whenever I'm there i just feel almost out of place.  

I believe that maybe I'm only there because they don't want to seem rude, and remove me from the family.

I don’t know what’s happening to me, I’m not feeling anything anymore. Just random bursts on sadness. And there isn’t a reason for it. No big deal, I messed up trying to learn stick shift. But I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to get out of this lump. I’m excited for college but that is months away, and I don’t know what to do until then. I don’t even know if this is a cohesive post, but I just need some advice on what to do.",30Apr2020,1
1021,"I have been running from this for awhile but I can’t get past it. I’m sure I could use therapy but I’m broke so no money to pay and no time to go. Maybe there is something I can do for myself...

I lost my little cousin over a year ago. She was amazing honestly. Super nice, cared and loved everyone, had a future in sports, was looking forward to helping people when she was out of high school, she was always just so fun and happy. I loved her so much. I still love her so much. I was so terrible. I hate myself for it. 

We were neighbors as kids and we were always together. As I started to become a teenager I didn’t want to hang out with her because i didn’t want to hang out with a “kid” (she was two years younger). I pushed her away as far as possible and I hate I missed out on her last years. At family events she would “steal me” and drag me to somewhere private so we could have us time. I got over my ego in her last 3 years so I started to really appreciate how she got so excited to see me and just talk about nothing. We started to snap so we could talk more but I was so wrapped up in my own life that I didn’t even go see her or anything and she only lived like 30mins away. I hate myself for not being there more. I hate that she knew she was going to die. I HATE she was scared out of her mind in her last moments. I hate that the accident took her from me. I hate that I thought I had so much time. I miss her so much and I don’t know how to deal with the loss and deal with not being there for her more. I took her for granted and I’ll never be able to show her how much I loved her. I miss her.",30Apr2020,1
1022,"I have grown up to domestic and verbal abuse. There were mornings where I'd wake up having knives thrown at me, but  I am grateful for it because I wouldn't be who I am today. 

Every morning, I wake up, and I chase my goals. I don't have to do that. But I do. I work my absolute balls off. Although the probability of me achieving my final goal is astronomically low, there still *is* a chance.

I have been crying. I am so fed up of being alone. Not that an event of conflict has occurred (at least recently), but I am so tired of having a dysfunctional family. I hate the fact that I can't look up to my father as much as I want to. I hate the fact that I can't tell my mother how I feel. I hate the fact that my older brother did not show me any better. I hate the fact that I can't trust my sisters. I hate the fact that my cousins do not work hard. I hate the fact that the meaning of family in our world is segregation.  I hate the fact that I don't have a shoulder to cry on. I hate the fact that my resolution to peace in a home is to lock myself in a room. I hate the fact that every single person that I have met doesn't inspire me. I hate the fact that every single person that I have met does not push me.  I hate the fact they do not work hard. I hate the fact that everyone seems to dream so small. I hate the fact that I am only the only person that I know of, who is working my absolute nuts off.  I hate the fact that I am the only one who is actively working towards my aspirations. I hate the fact that I don't have anyone to look up to.

1023,I have 3 best friends and we only seem to argue all the time mainly about our musical tastes. I’m a musician and produce and write music for myself and others. (None of them are musicians) We have been to so many gigs and festivals together but recently when we talk about new music they believe everything I suggest is shit and “production is terrible and vocals are out of tune” baring in mind they are all huge massive stoners. For example we went to see Liam Gallagher and Noel Gallagher separately bc we were oasis fans but when I asked if they liked the new oasis demo they said it was shit and have never liked LG or NG because apparently they have “potential for more in the music industry but are not talented enough” I just find it upsetting how much negativity there is about artists we’ve seen and bonded and have great times together.,30Apr2020,1

1026,"So I live in a crappy apartment and I work for the Army National Guard as an Indirect Fire Infantryman, rent for my place is 350 per month, utilities and wifi is 75 per month, but I have to pay 50 per month because my fiancé is living with me. This has been happening since I moved in which was October. I didn’t have to pay for any utilities or WiFi because I was in Georgia during that time. When I got back he told me since my fiancé would be living with me I need to pay 2/3 of utilities and Internet. I didn’t like it since I barely earn anything from the Army. Maybe 365 a month. I had to get a second job while being a full time student which later fired me because I needed time off for Army Drills. Back to the apartment, it’s not even the worst of why I hate paying this much every month. He is constantly on his PS4 that is tethered to the router. I barely get any internet when he is. My fiancé and I are lucky if we’re able to use more than one device when he is gaming. When COVID-19 was in place he would be gaming for 3-7 hours a day which left us with almost nothing to use. He also has friends over constantly staying overnight. Before you say tell him to stop gaming as much he INSISTS that he doesn’t game for more than 2 hours and that tethering game stations doesn’t make it use more and he’s a tech major about to graduate. My thoughts are “How are you this much of a dumbass?” He also has 2 google homes with light add ons and has the lights in the house constantly on. He also claimed the living room and doesn’t allow us to use it. I have no income right now and he still has a job. He’s having me pay 105 next month for utilities and internet. My fiancé is also allergic to weed and he constantly smokes all the time in the living room to the point where it stinks up the entire room. Luckily she hasn’t gone into anaphylactic shock( don’t know if I spelled that right). I’m about to move out next month and move in with a new roommate who has agreed that the utilities and internet shit that is going on with my roommate is bull fuck and agreed to half it between us. He has also accused me of stealing from him but it was when he had his friend living here for 5 months and moved out. He has also been using all of my cookware without putting it back or cleaning it. I’ve probably had to spend an extra 100-150 more than what I needed to. And I’m not going to bring this to court, the case plus a lawyer would be more than what I would get in return.

I’ve wanted to post this for a few days but I’m really not sure how to word it so I apologise. My boyfriend struggles greatly with his mental health and with the current lockdown (I’m uk) on top of the stress of just moving into our new house and a baby arriving soon he’s been really really struggling. Unfortunately this has resulted in him drinking quite heavily and hiding it from me as best as he can as I hate drunk people due to family trauma. His rapidly decreasing mental health and the increase of him drinking has resulted in him blacking out (he has suspected bipolar) and becoming violent. This resulted in him being arrested for domestic abuse on Saturday night and he’s currently remanded for the next month. I just feel guilty as I’ve only just started to realise the extent he was struggling and I know he needs help and prison isn’t going to help him. I’m not sure whether I should press charges as I really don’t think it will benefit him, if anything it’ll just make him worse. I’m just worried about him. I’m not angry, I wish I was but I just feel sorry for him, I know how naive that makes me sound but I think it’s important to remember sometimes the chemicals in our brain make us do shitty things. I just miss him, I want him to be okay, I love him and I want to help him and for him to get help. I don’t think punishing him will do any good as it isn’t fixing the problem. 
I just need advice from someone that doesn’t have an emotional input as my friends are angry and can’t see it from my perspective. Shall I press charges? Is waiting for him stupid?

In June I will be 23 years old. I graduated high school and went to university for a year but stopped going. I've never had a firm grasp on what my ""calling"" is, or what I want to do for a living. I chose to not take classes I may not need and work full-time. I have a newish car that has less than 5k left to pay on it, and money saved away.

So for weeks now I've been thinking about leaving. I'd tell my family and keep in touch. I want to see more, the world is so much bigger than just my home and workplace. Even if it's just for two months, I want to just pack my car and drive.

1038,"Throwaway for reasons 

I [21F] have been back home from university for a while now and I have noticed my brother [16M] has been acting out in ways I have been getting increasingly concerned about. 

For context I don't exactly have the best relationship with my parents. When I brought up these concerns to them it resulted in me getting yelled at and dismissed everytime I bring it up. My parental figure was my grandparent who died just before my brother became a teen meaning he did not get that bond and was not taught the way I was. 

As for the habits I have seen in my brother:
Lack of basic hygiene - Since I've been home he's showered 3 times and goes days and even weeks without brushing his teeth. He doesn't wash his hands, wears the same clothes every day and never changes his bedding. 
His room - lunch boxes with mouldy food, constantly closed windows and curtains (so it stinks) stacks of sweets, 2 litre pepsi bottles, energy drinks, ciders. You name it he's got it 
Drinking - He's been allowed to drink small amounts of low alcohol drinks with meals. However since I have gone to university these have increased to include hard spirits (vodka, gin, etc). As I was putting some clean washing in his room I noticed 2 empty bottles of spirits on his desk. Obviously he's taken these from where my parent's spare room where they keep their liquor so I don't know if he's drank that full amount but I imagine he's had more than a 16 year old should drink himself. All this in his room has accumulated over only a week since he was made to do a full clear out then. 
NSFW - probably the most disturbing is I've caught him regularly viewing nsfw images in family spaces around the house and when he's doing so he'll keep his hands hidden I'm sure you can guess where, I have no evidence that he's doing anything or not but it's still unacceptable. 

I have attempted to talk to him about this and the only chance I got he broke down and cried, refusing to talk and look at me. I have offered support and outlets for him to talk to other than his family  numerous times all of which he's refused saying he doesn't want to talk to anyone.

Given the covid-19 situation I can't take him to therapy and I don't want to put myself in a position where I ruin our relationship by straining this and making him uncomfortable to come to me in future. Is there anything I can do right now? 

TL:DR My kid brother had no sense of hygiene, drinks a lot, has been looking at NSFW images in inappropriate situations with his family around. Is there anything I can do to help without going through my parents?",30Apr2020,1
1039,"Let me start by saying that I fully understand that people out there are hurting, unemployed and in really bad shape physically, emotionally and financially.  I don't pretend to understand your specific situations, nor do I mean to ask a question that will clearly be tone-deaf to people who are struggling and worse off and would trade places with me in a second.  I care about your suffering(s) and I mean no insult by asking for advice.  Doesn't change the fact that I'm really looking for honest input, and this is my reality.  Also, if you're a ""BuT MaH FrEeDoMs""/Chinese covid is a hoax/science-denier kind-of-person, you're not going to be coming from a place where I can really use your advice because we just don't have a common frame of reference, so please don't waste your time reading or my time by responding.  Let's agree that the internet is large enough for both of us and agree to coexist.  My request for advice is predicated on the fact that Covid is real, it is potentially deadly, and it is being poorly contained in this country.  Also, I'm really not interested in being called names for being afraid of Covid.  If we can't agree on these things, then we're not going to be able to move forward constructively.

Now that I've narrowed the audience down to the right subset: I'm looking for guidance about what I should do relative to two job opportunities. Maybe even just writing this will be enough to help me work things through.  I don't know.  Currently, even though people are out there, hurting for work, I'm stuck between two job opportunities.  I know, I know, ITA.  I should be extremely grateful and consider myself lucky.  I do.  I really do.  But I'm also tormented by the choice I have to make here, and I'm surrounded by people incapable of unbiased advice and/or significantly less fortunate and looking for work, so I just can't lean on the friends and family I'd normally rely upon to discuss this situation. I'm going to try to break this letter into clear sections: a bit about me for context, what I'm currently doing at job #1, what I expect to be doing at job #2, and some of the key points of consideration that I'm weighing.  I'm really stuck.  Any advice would be welcome.

About me: I'm a 30-something hard-working family man in Arizona.  I've had many jobs, in many industries, and found that I have been consistently a top-performer and risen the corporate ladder fairly well.  This isn't because I'm smarter or better than anybody; I attribute it to a hard work ethic, a willingness to give a little bit more than my peers, and being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time and/or know the right people.  I have two children, one is just about to turn five, the other is just about six months.  My wife and I have been together since we were sixteen (not married, but together).  I have a pretty happy life -- money is tight but we're not hungry.  I'm able to provide more than we need, and we consider ourselves blessed.  The past few years have been very difficult personally.  Since the birth of my firstborn in 2015, I've battled viral meningitis (it took a full year to recover), a sinus tumor surgery (benign, thank goodness!), an emergency gall bladder removal, several bad infections related to a weakened immune system (I attribute it to the meningitis), and most recently,  bone cancer (which I am again blessed to say turned out extremely fortunately and was successfully treated).  The bone cancer specifically has been a real life-changer.  The other issues were annoyances: costly, disruptive; the bone cancer was the first time that I had to face mortality.  It took about 6 months to completely diagnose, and the recovery was very painful and took a lot out of me and my family and our finances.  Needless to say, it was a distraction from work, and really changed my focal point.  Before my cancer, I was a really dedicated employee.  I worked hard.  Now, it's not that I don't work hard... I do... but my priorities are definitely shifted back towards my family.  

So, in this context, let's discuss my current job.  I'm not underperforming.  I'm not on the chopping block.  I work for a really large, really genuinely good company and I have no complaints about the company as a whole.  In 2014-2018, I was one of the top employees in the country, and the top employee far and away in the Southwest, despite all the other medical chaos around me.  This leveled off in 2019 and 2020.  Currently, I am a middle-of-the pack-employee yielding middle-of-the-pack results.  I don't get any write ups, but I don't win any awards.  I've switched into a slightly different role that is slower paced, lower stress, salaried (so no crazy overtime being worked, but also lower pay as a result).  I'm coasting.  I'm not under a ton of pressure.  I'm working hard but sometimes get a little bored.  I'm getting significant family time.  Things are good.  They're not exciting, but they're good.  Do I see myself doing this in five years?  I don't think so.  Three?  I don't think so.  Two?  Maybe.  My largest three gripes are that my job is a little boring, my direct supervisor is not really my favorite (and it's probably mutual), and, at least in my current role, there's no chance of scaling my income/making more money/moving up.  I'd have to switch departments to solve these problems.  Could I?  Sure.  But I'd be once again starting over and hitting the reset switch on the high level of stress that I've intentionally and successfully been avoiding.  I do fieldwork - inspections of homes and businesses.  I'm good at it.  But I wanted more.  

Enter job #2.  A work ""friend"" of mine, going back at least 8 years, has been successfully growing his small company into something that started as a one-man operation into a multi-million dollar business.  He's doing great.  He's doing exciting things, and he needs a right-hand man.  I happened upon the job posting randomly, in fact.  We are not close friend, but we know each other well and have crossed paths personally and professionally for a long time.  He told me after I applied that he wanted to reach out to me as he had me in mind, but figured I was content where I was.  He didn't want to make it weird.  I interviewed with his team and crushed it.  It was invigorating!  I had great ideas; they had needs I could fill.  It would be exciting, more stress than my current role but also significantly more money, more responsibility, more freedom, more independence.  Without hesitation, I took the position.  This was in mid-February.  Part of the negotiation was that I was going to start the job on April 1 -- partly because that lined up well with his budget plans and partly because I'd capture a small annual bonus I didn't want to miss out on.  It was all set.  I was really excited and continued to perform my job well, although, truthfully, sort of counting down the days.

Enter Coronavirus.  The whole world seems to have changed since these plans were put in place.  Obviously, since I'm describing being torn, I haven't yet made the move to the new job.  My current job and life has evolved significantly.  I have my kids at home.  Being potentially immunocompromised from my cancer in 2019, and being asthmatic, this disease terrifies me.  I'm convinced that if I get exposed, I will not survive.  People say ""well look how many medical issues you've already beaten?""  I can't help but feel that I'm weakened and that my luck is out.  There's no way of knowing for sure where the truth lies.  Consequently, we've been isolating at home as a family since March 12.  My wife's company has provided her very flexible work-from-home options that we're doing our best with.  The kids are a ton of work and stress, but we're doing our best to provide a loving and educational environment.  Money is tight - my wife did get a pay cut because of COVID, but we're not paying for daycare or gas or other expenses, so we're ok.  Not getting ahead, but not sinking.  We're in a really stable holding pattern for now.  My wife's company thinks they will return to the office by the end of May or June, but they are not going to rush things so it could be later.  Honestly, she might be able to extend it further because of the kids.  Ultimately, at some point, it will come to a head.  Her job is slightly less stable than mine because her company is losing clients and didn't get the PPP loan they wanted.  Layoffs aren't off the table right now, but who knows what things look like in 6 months?  My current job has changed significantly.  I no longer do fieldwork -- in fact, it is specifically verboten.  My company has really been top-notch in their response and their demonstrated concern for their employees.  I must say, I'm really proud of how they are handling things and the messaging around Covid.  I do everything virtually.  My workload is manageable, but the work itself is even less gratifying than before.  My current boss, as a result of the stress he is under, is even worse than before and riding me.  Truthfully, I'm partially to blame as I've been coasting.  But the work and job is stable and I'm doing the right things to course correct.  I've been taking things week-by-week with the new job.  Waiting to hear that things are improving, that it's safe.  But it just seems like things keep getting worse.  I just want to hunker down and stay isolated until there is a vaccine.  But who knows when that will happen?

Today, I got the call I've been dreading.  The new boss, in extremely supportive and polite language, said, ""Today's the day you've been dreading.  Today's the day I say that the work has exploded and we're super busy and I need you. If you still want this job, I need you to rip off the band-aid and start May 11.""  I told him I still want the job, I want to start, and I would discuss with my wife.  You can see from my other posts, I'm terrified of my state reopening too quickly.  Honestly, I thought I would be able to wait this out long enough to make the switch at a comfortable time.  I thought I'd have more time.

Here we are.  I'm an immunocompromised asthmatic who is torn between an unsatisfying safe job with no thrill and a little financial strain, versus a dream job at a dream company that I can see myself doing amazing things for and with.  I have children and a wife and if I got them sick, it would break me.  If I got sick and died, they would be devastated financially and emotionally.  The new job is fieldwork.  I wouldn't be shaking hands or kissing babies, but every day I would get into my truck and go to a person's house or business and be exposed.  People in Arizona are not wearing masks, certainly not in their homes.  People are desperately trying to return to ""normal"" and this lockdown, at least as far as I have seen it, has been a disaster.  I'm terrified that as soon as restrictions are relaxed (our stay-at-home order has been extended to May 15, but unless people are dropping like flies will probably not be extended further) people are going to spread this disease and we're going to be back to terrified.  I want this new job.  I want to work with this team.  I want this role.  I want the additional income.  All things being non-pandemic-times, I'd not hesitate and take this plunge.  But my current role might keep me in my house for the next year.  Safe.  Secure.  Protected.  

On the one hand, I'm going to kick myself and disappoint a good team of people who are depending on me if I don't follow through with this new job.  I'm going to burn bridges.  I'm going to have to live with that regret.  On the other hand, although my current company is treating this situation really well, I'm a worthless cog in a giant machine with little real purpose.  I can't delay this decision further.  There are no more extensions.  I have to make a choice.  Generally speaking, I'm not great with choices.  I really struggle, weighing both sides.  My wife calls it analysis paralysis.  But that's with little choices - what to have for dinner or what paint color to put on a wall.  The big choices (getting married, having kids, picking their names, buying a car, buying a house), they've always been made with a combination of intuition and confident analysis that has made them feel effortless and right... and I've never regretted a single big decision; not for a moment.  I know that staying in my current role is safe and boring.  I know that eventually, my wife will return to an office environment (when I do not know) at which point I won't be able to keep the kids by myself and they will return to daycare, and then we will be exposed as a family to whatever happens.  That may be a month from now.  It may be six months from now.  But eventually, it will happen.  And this opportunity will have been closed forever.  Life will return to status quo -- I'll once again be doing fieldwork eventually.

In this new role, I can see myself being very successful and careful (wearing masks, using hand sanitizer, keeping my distance) and feeling like it was a great decision.  My resignation letter is already written.  I have a cardboard box of office supplies packed up for my new desk, which has been waiting for me since April 1.  I'm going to do really amazing things for this team.  I know in my heart it's the right opportunity and the right time.  But I also see a future where I take this new role and am a nervous wreck about staying away from my family.  Refusing to hold my infant because I don't want to expose him.  Staying away from my toddler who is already suffering emotionally from being apart from his friends and his normal life.  Getting sick, or worse.  Getting one of my kids sick.  Getting my wife sick, and then having nobody to care for our children.  Dying.  Even typing this turns my stomach into knots.  I can't imagine any career, any job, and experiences or any amount of money being worth that possibility. 

I'm surrounded by a hyper-neurotic family that is telling me to stay the course and refuse to leave.  That it's not worth the risk.  That I will die.  My new boss, employees, and all my friends are quite the opposite: 'You'll be fine' and 'You shouldn't stress' and 'you'll have a mask' and 'nobody at the new company has been exposed.'  All potentially true. My wife is leaving this decision to me, but I know in her heart, she'd rather me stay at home. I don't know what to do.  This is tough.  In my heart, I honestly don't know what to do.  Thanks for listening.  I appreciate it.  Any constructive advice would be great.

 TL;DR: Should I switch from job #1 (boring, stable) in favor of job #2 (more risk, more reward, in every possible way)?",30Apr2020,1

1041,"So, I (23M),  I'm in college.

I have never been in a relationship, and never had sex, and was never really interested in any romantic life or anything, but my parents keep bugging me by telling me if I had a girlfriend or not, and when I tell them that I don't have a girlfriend, they act surprised and weirded out, and keep telling me that it's not normal at that age to not be in a relationship.

A girl has asked me out, and I politely declined saying that I wasn't really looking for a relationship right now, and that I'm not interested in dating, but people are giving me a lot of shit for it, they tell me that I'm stupid and how could I turn down a hottie, (she was attractive but that doesn't change the fact that I don't want a relationship).

I then started actually questioning my sexuality because I just wasn't interested in women at all, nor at dating or having a relationship, but then I realised that I wasn't attracted to guys either.

Is this normal? I don't understand what is wrong with me.",30Apr2020,1
1042,"Hello, everyone!

I work for a coffee shop and thankfully had the opportunity to receive paid leave for over a month. I took it and have no regrets taking it. However, this paid leave ends May 3rd and I'm scheduled to go back to work. One of my best friends is one of my coworkers and she said her parents don't want her working after these two weeks (because we're already scheduled) due to our Governor reopening stores, etc. This is because they are afraid the risk of the virus is higher and are understandably worried for their safety. 

So my friend decided that she will take **unpaid** leave/leave of absence for as long as she can. There is part of me that feels like I should do the same because I believe people should stay home if they are able to. In addition, I've recently video-chatted with her and have strongly voiced how I think re-opening so soon is foolhardy and citing info from articles that are credible sources. However, I also want to return to work so I can continue to receive money and be able to have some social interaction since I've been so lonely at home. This money can go towards my future college expenses this Fall and my savings. And, I could stop having phases where I'm very sad, and lonely.

On the other hand, I also feel this would make me appear a big hypocrite in front of my friend if I chose to continue to work. Despite my work fortunately offering gloves, face masks, and has been cleaning the store, there is still a risk I can contract/carry the virus and risk me and my mom. What if the worst happens and she gets it and dies? 

I keep going back and forth on my reasonings and am still unsure what to do. What do you guys think/suggest?

Thank you.",30Apr2020,1

1047,"I'm a 19 y/o female in my second semester of college for my dream major, bioengineering. I got myself into a university known for it's amazing engineering school and got through my first semester with almost a 3.0 (I think like a 2.96 or something). The first semester engineering students usually take Calc 1, but my ACT math score was a little low, so I took an pre-calc class despite taking calc 1 and calc 2 in my Junior and Senior years of high school respectively. This already set me behind since most if not all of the classes I'll take rely on me passing that level of math, so I was set up to take a heavy load to fit everything in four years. 

I took 18 credit hours for my second semester, including a physics class, my calc class, biology, chemistry, bioengineering, etc. It was incredibly hard, especially since we went online the last few weeks. Well I'd been riding the edge of passing and failing the whole semester, getting really good grades toward the end, but I got my calc 1 grade back and I failed the class pretty hard. Below a 50% is a fail in that class with the end of semester curve, most of my exam grades were just below 50's, getting into the mid 50's and low 60's toward the end. I got a 30% on the final and ended the class with a 42%.  

I made myself a promise at the beginning of first semester that if I failed this class I just wasn't smart enough for this program and that I should change my major to something I'm better at. Now that it's happened the opinions of my friends, boyfriend, and family is an overwhelming push to just take the class again and be set back another year or so. 

I really did love my bioengineering and general engineering based classes, got A's and B's in those, but I don't see myself passing Calc 1 or any other calc class with more than a C in the future, *if* I pass them at all. Even if I did change majors, I'm not sure what I'd go into, maybe communications or business to possibly get in the same field of work in a different section. But I'm just not really sure what to do now.",30Apr2020,1

I moved back in with my mum and sister this year while I do a placement year for my university degree, mum found my note- didn’t take it very seriously at all and we haven’t spoken about it since she initially brought it up, nor has she approached my mental health as a subject in general.

1052,"  When I was in my first year of college, one of my 'friends' started spreading lies about me. Let's call him Edward. He was a part of a group of toxic friends that I had up until a few years ago. I believe some of them held a bit of a grudge against me for checking out their 'girlfriends' profiles on Facebook (Edward got my password in first year of college). The thing is they weren't in serious relationships, I didn't even know they were dating. Also, Edward was the person who was most upset by this. I only realised recently how insecure of a person he is.

Second year of college was going well for me academically, and this upset Edward even more. That's when the lies got downright brutal. One of my other friends Troy told me a 'rumour' about someone who was a good friend of his but I didn't know as well. Let's call him Jim. Troy said that Jim was raped at a house party that had happened almost a year ago at my friend's house. Troy was smiling the entire time he told me. Smiling. That his friend was raped. Wtf. I knew this had to be another one of Edwards schemes. They must have been going around saying that I raped Jim. It was so retarded I was sure nobody would believe it, but it wouldn't stop people from talking. The friend of mine who had the house party was a part of a group of college friends that I had made in first year so I presume this lie was to start to disrupt my social life outside of this toxic group of friends. I saw all of these antics as really insecure and petty to be honest. Since I'm not a gossip, I had no clue how much all of this was going to interfere in my life.

Right when second semester of second year had rolled around, the toxic friends introduced me to some new people. We'll call them the 'townies'. These guys were rough. They had dozens of criminal offences they were being charged for between them and they were starting to hang around at my friend Ryan's house (the one who threw the party). There is a ‘party week’ in my college where everybody goes crazy and takes drugs all week. During this week, A LOT of comments were made around me that made me understand how badly all of these lies were affecting my life. I understood that week that these ‘townies’ were hired to bring harm to me. One of them in particular was in a lot of debt, and so I put two and two together; he needed money from my toxic friends to keep his kneecaps.

I finally had enough of the situation and tried to get out of my friend's house towards the end of the week, they wouldn't let me go anywhere alone. I had to text my brother and tell him to come down to the house so that we could go to the ATM for him to lend me some money. My brother walks into the house *with* the money and I hear someone say ""oh shit we can't that's his brother"". At that point I didn't care if he had the money there, I just walked towards the door telling my brother ""let's go"", acting as if I needed more (I hadn’t asked for much anyway).

We get back to my brother's house and I tell him about all of the retards that had been spreading lies about me, for what I now understand, was since my first year of college. He neglected the fact that they had spiked me, instead he asked me; “If there was one lie that you felt they were using against you what would it be?” I tell him the lie that Troy told me about Jim. He immediately goes downstairs and starts talking to his roommate. My brother was being weird at this point, but I figured he just wanted to let his roommate know what was up. When he got back upstairs, he kept going on about mental disorders saying that he had issues with them in the past, that he had studied them. I try not to think negatively about people with mental disorders, but knowing that was not what I was going through, I was pretty furious. The *last* thing I needed was for people to go around saying that I was crazy. Since my brother didn't listen I decided to keep my friends close and my enemies closer and kept hanging around at Ryan's house.

(Excuse the digression, the following narration is only necessary because the people in my life are so shitty that the context will get confusing otherwise):

Since then my brother continued to ignore the lying dickheads, started gossiping about the lies to *his* friends, stole my idea to invest my mother's 250,000 euro settlement in Bitcoin (don't know exactly when but somewhere between 2016-17) realized he is the cuntiest of brothers for doing so, and continued to push the whole mental disorder thing. He even shouted at me on mother's day of all days ""stop talking about Bitcoin AdultMNTurtle"" (which at the time was the best investment opportunity going). Things only got worse.

In late July 2017, my brother and I were walking drunk along the river in my hometown when he said he wanted to stop and look at it. The river is notoriously dangerous, and he knew the scumbags that were hanging around at Ryan’s house had made references to throwing people in there while they were around me. He said: ""She looks awful powerful tonight"".

""Sure does"", I replied.

""Not many people who go in there come out you know"", he said next.

I was shocked. How the fuck could he say that? Especially when there was a 200% increase in 'suicides' via the river right around the time that all of these criminals were talking about throwing people in. He didn't just disrespect them, he showed me that he didn't care at all about my mental health. Then he said: ""There's plenty of them in Utrecht"". Cunt. That's where I was going on a study abroad semester. Now he was really fucking with my head.

After this I didn't want to have anything to do with my brother, but my mother would not listen to anything I was telling her. I had proved many times that he was acting crazy, lying to me and her, involving his friends in his lies, putting my life at risk. Nothing was right. I started seeing a psychologist (which was going very well) and while we were having a group session with my Mom, I mentioned the price of Bitcoin, that it was now 4000 euro. My mom's jaw dropped. This is when I realized that my Mom went through the same sequence as my brother. She started to gossip and then couldn't admit to being a shit mother, and my investment idea made a shit-ton of money, and they freaked out. Mom said in that meeting that she was “never, ever going to come back for another one”, and now wanted me to go to a mental health unit, or psych-ward, for ""at least three months"". What a bitch. She got her wish in the end after lying to my GP.

The psychiatrists did absolutely nothing but keep me there for three weeks which ruined my first semester back at college. Then my brother hired a bunch of hackers to ruin my semester abroad in the Netherlands. I was forced to drop out of college in the Netherlands and find work. I once again went the 'keep your friends close and enemies closer' route and somewhat befriended the hackers (one of them also owed me money). It didn't work out quite as well this time around since they were able to ruin two jobs that I enjoyed, but I needed something that would help get me out of this situation for good. In the end, I was drugged with crack, or some form of amphetamines, and ended up in a canal. This happened on my brother's fucking birthday (almost a year to the day from when he said “there’s plenty of them in Utrecht”. I can't recall exactly how I ended up in the canal, but I remember thinking that my roommate from where I was living in the Netherlands was in the canal and needed help. Whatever I was drugged with made things hazy though. I regained my senses in a hospital bed surrounded by doctor's, nurses, policemen, all speaking Dutch and freaking me the fuck out. I eventually calmed down and the world started to make sense again.

The next day they wanted a 24 hour urine sample and gave me a catheter. Fuck catheters. I stayed one more day and then I really wanted to leave. I noticed that they had my name down wrong on my wrist band so I decided to just gather my things and walk out of there. The Dutch doctor's looked at me as if to say 'where in the fuck do you think you're going as I was striding down the corridor. ""That's not how you spell my last name and so technically I have not been admitted properly here. I'm leaving"". The Dutch usually finding it difficult to disagree with anything rational, they let me walk on.

I strode nervously passed the security guards on the bottom floor who flew past me smiling on electric scooters (Dutch people), and walked out into the open area of the city called the ‘Uitof’. It was around a fifteen minutes cycle back to the city centre, (the Uitof is a strangely built up section of the city I was staying in that is somewhat detached from the rest). I was dreading what was bound to be around a forty minute walk, possibly more, when I saw an old tattered bike that was left unlocked. In the Netherlands, these bikes are actually okay to take. I hopped on it and started making my way back to the city centre. It broke about half way. Just my luck.

I eventually got back to the hostel that I was staying at when I first moved to the Netherlands and the receptionist was nice enough to let me stay there a while. I was beginning to make a plan to sort out my life. I still had enough money to get back to my home country. I was not about to do that before getting a prostitute though, since the lies that had been told about me for what was at that time 3-4 years had stopped me from losing my virginity. Then my family showed up and got me admitted to another mental health unit. I spent three weeks in that mental health unit, and was only allowed to go home under the conditions that my psychiatrist back home, who had been contacted by the mental health unit in Utrecht, contacted me when I arrived back.

When I got back home my psychiatrist from my home country refused to meet with me or even get on the phone with me. The social worker of the mental health unit in my hometown contacted me continuously though. He had an uncertainty in his voice every time I got on the phone with him. He said that since I had been discharged from the mental health unit in the Netherlands, I was not a being treated under the mental health act in my home country. Why were they calling me then?

I tried to get back to college to finish my final year but I did not want to live at home with my mother who was the one who allowed my brother to steal my idea to invest. My brother and mother are both massive gossips, most in my country are, and so by this time it was obvious to me my brother used the lie that Troy had told me to go around and lie about his little brother for his toxic friends so that nobody would know that I went to him for help and he fucked up. Cunt. I thought maybe they were just waiting till I finished college to tell me they invested, and that it was my friends who organised the attempted murder. All of this stress led to an argument with my Mom which led to me being admitted to the mental health unit again.

I eventually got back to college and am currently receiving great marks. Second semester has just started and I am doing okay but things are a bit stressful. I received a message from one of the people that I met in the Netherlands saying that they were sorry if they brought me any harm. They are so far the only person out of all the dickheads that have tried to lie me to death to apologise, so I accepted knowing they were lied to and didn't start the lies so it's not as bad. I responded saying that I know the people who are really at fault and it's enough to hate them. Then they said that the receptionist at the hostel (that my brother booked) is one of the people I should hate. That I didn’t expect. She was a nice woman, but this made my rethink how suggestible, susceptible; vulnerable that people are.

I took my time with this information but eventually I went to the college councilors with it. They wouldn't record the evidence. WTF. Then I went to the police liaison at my college with the evidence. She started to bullshit about how it wasn't clear to her what link there was to my brother. I told her again that he booked the hostel, and that the message clearly shows that the receptionist was part of a group of people who brought harm to me (drugs + canal), and that this mysteriously happened on his birthday, almost exactly a year after he essentially threatened me or at least ""predicted"" that I would end up in a canal in Utrecht. The liaison is in denial, even about the spike in 'suicides' in 2016. She argued about the yearly figures and then back tracked when I brought up Q1 2016. There is no doubt she and the counselor at the college both took bribes. She also called my other (half) siblings, who also followed the path of cunt, and were now committed to sharing stealing my idea.

The liaison eventually told me she would contact Interpol because since I was drugged in the Netherlands it wasn't for her to deal with. That would have been ‘fair enough’, had she not set up what was essentially an ambush. They were trying to admit me to the hospital again. The liaison is a former psychiatric nurse. Go figure. This time however, I knew my rights well enough and they only got me in to see a psychiatrist who had to let me go even though he tried desperately to admit me.

By now my whole greedy cunting family is acting like my toxic friends, and the situation is at a point where it has reached an exponential point of anxiety and pressure; I don’t really feel it seeing as it is so bad already that any new anxiety or pressure is comparatively nothing. It is only a matter of time before they are fucked. My other brother even said in the meeting with the liaison that ""plenty of people have their ideas stolen"". It was as good as an admission of guilt if only the cunt of a police woman didn't take a fucking bribe.

Now my original psychiatrist is asking if I have ""spoken to any other agencies"". She has tried to admit me again and said that she will ""organize an involuntary admission"" which is illegal. She is shitting bricks since she got the situation wrong and I think now is the best time for me to finally get out of this shitty situation but everyone I go to for help is taking bribes (I'd assume the hackers have something to do with that). What would you guys do?

Tl;dr: Toxic friends lie about me, brother starts gossiping about the lies. Then brother steals my idea to invest 250,000 euro in Bitcoin and tries to have me killed on his birthday by drugging me with crack and hoping that I would drown in a canal after 'predicting' it a year before. Now he is using the money from my idea to bribe everyone I go to for help.",30Apr2020,1

We talk everyday, all day. (on and off obviously) We have just so much in common it's unbelievable! Here's where the sticky situation comes in:

He lives In TX, and I live in FL. But we have already discussed that he would move here with me. Which is just so fantastic of him. He is currently living with the woman that he had a relationship with and has a baby with too. (he is 3) 

He wants to do everything the right way and make sure everyone is takin care of and happy without making anyone upset which i totally get and respect. He just doesn't know where to begin. And unfortunately i cannot physically be there to help. He also does not want to lose his son, which I even told him that I ain't worth all of this because I know his son is super important and more important than me. I told him I never wanted to take him away from his family and especially his son. He tells me that he wants to be with me, love me and marry me. Just where do we start?? What do we do? What should he do to go about this the right way without losing his son? 

Also, I told him if he brought his son with him to FL I would GLADLY take his son and treat him like he was my own. I have 0 issues with any of that. I just want to be with this man so much. He treats me like a queen and I haven't felt this kind of connection ever with anyone. He knows of my past and what I have been through as I know what he has been through.

1058,"So some background; I wasn’t born in an English speaking country but moved her at 7 years old, it took me time to learn English properly but I’ve always struggled in speaking and writing to a point I was tested for dyslexia and thinking to get tested again. Anyways in high school, I was very confident speaker and my English became a lot better but as my anxiety got worse so did my speaking. I have trouble with pronunciation of words, I can never say them correctly and this is a huge insecurity. As it’s gotten worse more and more people point it out and that makes me more anxious when I do speak and perform even worse. My best friend is aware of my background and is constantly poking fun at how I say words and what I call certain things, I usually brush it off and sometimes it does get to me. She will constantly pick on me about it, making fun, even public post my misgivings on social media of all our mutual friends. She will pick up on my negatives. I’ve known her since high school, outside of this she isn’t a bad friend, she’s been there for a lot of my situations and we bond a lot over other things. Recently I did something small like cooked and I was really proud of me, as my depression leaves me bed ridden most days so small things to others are huge to me. Anyways I sent it to a groupchat of my close friends and she was the first to point my mistakes in how I worded the name of the dish. I know this is ridiculously stupid and I guess I don’t know why I’m still writing but am I being overly sensitive?",30Apr2020,1
1059,"I went into college as a business major. I have never been a student, and I think the college system is pointless. I am a junior now and last year tried to switch my major to a more artistic field since I love art. I am struggling now more than ever because I just don't want to do the work. I have basically all F's. I just don't see how these classes will help me in any way. I feel like I can't stick it out. My parents are going to be so angry and dissapointed in me and I don't know where to go from here. I feel so sad for all the Money they spent wasted. What should I do???",30Apr2020,1
1060,"As selfish as this sounds, I'm panicking because 1. I haven't dealt with a situation like this before and don't know what to do and 2. It makes me feel much more aware of the mortality of my own parents and this has me in full panic mode.  We are both in our early twenties and have been friends since 6th grade. We're both in college and we haven't seen each other in a month due to the coronavirus. His mom passed away a couple days ago but I just found out about it today. She had been sick for a while but had finished treatments and was expected to recover, so I wouldn't say it was expected, but I don't know the details yet. 

I knew I had to reach out to him somehow, and my dad suggested I call him. He didn't answer (understandably), so I left a voice mail message saying how I just found out and how I'm so sorry and asked him to call me when he feels ready or text me if he wants me to call him back instead. I also said that I would be there for him through this, and my dad asked to get on the phone and left a similar message. I haven't gotten a response  from him yet but it's only been like 20 minutes since I left the message.

I'm afraid I'm going to fall apart when/if I talk to him on the phone, and I'm afraid I'll say the wrong thing that will upset him. If anyone here is listening, I really need advice.",30Apr2020,1
1061,I (26F) wouldn’t say I have extreme anxiety but it’s there no doubt. I used to chew my nails pretty bad when I was younger but cut that habit out but now I pick the skin pretty bad. My fingers are always scabbed because I pick them until they bleed and it’s painful. I know it sounds like it should be easy to stop but I do it and don’t even notice. It gets so bad sometimes to where people will comment on it and no one wants that. I just want pretty hands for once.,30Apr2020,1

I cant *make* myself sleep, the only time i can sleep is if i pass out, and then i sleep through every alarm.

Im not overworking myself, im doing the exact opposite, as in i have below zero motivation. I dont know if this is a result of my depression getting worse or what, but im tired all day every day and the only things i want to do are draw and watch videos, even though i have work to do.",30Apr2020,1
1063,"Ever since high school I've constantly thrown the idea of entering Law Enforcement for a career. I have a fair bit of interest in different parts of LE so it keeps coming back to me. But every time I start to think about it I talk myself out of it usually because I don't want to give up some of my hobbies due to not having the time(it's a terrible excuse I know, but that's how it sits in my head.) and because I can't see myself going to war if that ever happened because I care so little for politics. I've only ever worked mall retail jobs and for a while now have been working in an office to strengthen a resume so I'm not in shape but I'm also no where near too far gone, if that makes sense. I'm a gun owner myself and have taken a few firearm classes as well.  


I've never spoken to my family about it because they're not easy to talk to so I've never really had a serious talk with anyone about it, but I figured here would be a good way to figure things out.  


Anything you guys can give is appreciated.",30Apr2020,1
1064,"I have been doing a lot of thinking about this. My friend and I are both currently Juniors in high school. We were inseparable back in middle school, almost like brothers, but he had to move at the end of our freshman year. We have been playing video games to keep the friendship going, but he's changed *a lot* in almost every way since he left. During our Freshman year, he dealt with depression, and ended up getting in a pretty toxic relationship to try and aid his frustration. I tried to warn him that the girl he was dating was just gonna dump him after she used him as an emotional dumpster, but he didn't listen to me. Before he left, I was already right about the relationship being an emotion dump on him, and as if to support my claim, she ended up dumping him once they were into their long-distance relationship that summer after freshman year. Long story short, my friend is the type of person who learns life lessons through experience.

Before I move into the bulk of the story, I just want to clarify that my friend is very impressionable. Until he got into a relationship with this girl, he was a generally positive person. He always looked on the bright side, and had super great morals. That is, until he started dating the girl. He stopped hanging out with me briefly (for about 2 weeks) once he started dating her, and always got super angry whenever I talked to her. I didn't even realize that he was in a relationship with her until he asked one of my friends to tell me to back off of her a little. I didn't even like her, and only made small talk with her when I was bored in English class. Regardless, I followed suit, and he started talking to me again, but there was a major change, as if this girl had *tainted* him. He started cussing more, and generally pissing random people off for his own enjoyment. I found this super unattractive and didn't encourage that behavior, but still acted as his supportive friend. 

Now, back to the story...

I still care for my friend like a brother, but it's been difficult since he left. We still talk to each other, but he's closed himself off from me almost completely. We always shared (past tense) our personal thoughts and feelings with each other without shame, which is why I consider him a brother, but now the most I can get out of him now is if life is going good or bad; One word answers that give me zero information about what's going on with his life. I still open up to him about *my* life, hoping that we'll once again have another heart-to-heart chat, but it feels really 1-way as of now.

Now here's where I need your advice. I've recently reached out to his parent, because his attitude has been super fishy towards me lately, and I just wanted to make sure he was okay. Apparently, he has been lying to everyone he knows, including me, about almost everything in his life. He doesn't listen to his mom anymore, and has been dedicating all his time to his ***new*** **girlfriend**. I'm 100% not opposed to my friend having a girlfriend, but again (according to his mom), his attitude has been heavily affected by her ever since they've been together, Just like last time. I didn't even know that he was in a relationship until recently, and apparently they've been together since the beginning of March. On top of that, he's been constantly blowing me off saying that his mom was taking his phone away and grounding him, when in reality, he has been hanging out with his girlfriend and ignoring every other plan he makes. I haven't seen his face since he left in 2018, and I'm starting to think that there's a reason for it. For example, we were supposed to do a virtual party together with some friends, and he canceled on me, only hours before it was going to start, saying that it was because his mom took away his phone, which was the only camera he could face-time on. I soon then found out that his story was another lie he made up so he could face-time with his girlfriend instead. 

I know that your guys' brains are probably fried from all this information I'm laying on you, but my question to you is: what would you do in this situation? Losing this friend would be like losing a real life brother. I have been praying on it for a while now, and I've decided to wait for him to make the next move, because I know for a fact that he knows that I know he's been lying to me. But what should I do if he never tries fixing this? Is it really time for the friendship to be over?

If you need any clarification about my story, or simply want to get my personal opinions on certain matters, please leave a comment about it and I'll try to answer you as clearly as I can.",30Apr2020,1
1065,"So my mom is a bitch. I don’t like her and I still don’t like her. She’s a stereotypical mother where she thinks that girls shouldn’t do boy things and boys shouldn’t do girl things. She’s very judgmental as well. She always has something to say. She comments on eveything she sees and it’s annoying. Liek she won’t let people live. 
I asked her if I can slit my eye brows and she’s like “Why? Why would You want to do that to yourself? What do you think you would achieve? That’s a boys thing” and I was taken aback. I wasn’t expecting her to say that shit. I thought she would support my decision. I just turned 16 so she’s letting me dye my hair, her a piercing, get a boyfriend. But she won’t let me slit my eyebrows? There’s worse things I could be asking for and she complains about that?",30Apr2020,1

1068,"I've been talking to a girl for a few months now (half of that in quarantine) but I've been afraid to pull the trigger on asking to date because of a past relationship. Some years ago I briefly dated a girl with HPV. I was hesitant to become sexually involved but gave in when she explained how prevalent it was and how it typically cleared in men quickly without symptoms. We only had sex a few times before I broke it off due to other complications I won't get into.

Since then, I've done a lot more research on it and had I known, I probably wouldn't have made the choice to be sexually involved so easily (and at least made sure the relationship would last). I've never had any symptoms, and from what I've read, even in long-term relationship studies the transmission rate is not very high. In addition, most infections clear within a year and almost all clear within 2 years. It's been a good deal longer than that and I'm pretty sure I'm ok, but I'm struggling to decide on what I should do about this new girl who I REALLY like and want to try a long-term relationship with.

As I see it, there are a few options:

1. Tell her about the past relationship and hope she's been vaccinated and that it doesn't completely turn her off from me as a love interest. 

Pro: I was open and honest about my sexual history and gave her all info about me before she makes any commitments
Con: she could lose interest immediately

2. Don't mention it since it's unlikely I would still have HPV if I contracted it at all and then just hope for the best. 

Pro: we'd likely start a relationship
Con: there's no widely-used method of testing in men so I have no way of knowing which means if I did contract it in the past and still have it, I could pass it along 

3. Ask if she's been vaccinated and then proceed with 1 or 2 from there depending on the answer.

Something like 80% of sexually active people contract HPV at some point so I have no idea what the standard is here, given the prevalence. I imagine if I had never known the girl I dated in the past had HPV, then I would proceed like a normal relationship--but I do know. I really want to date her but if it went long-term, I wouldn't want to put her at risk in the unlikely case I do have it. Please help 😔😔",30Apr2020,1
