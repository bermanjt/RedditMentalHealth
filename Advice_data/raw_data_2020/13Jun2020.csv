0,"During this time of quarantine I’ve been doing my best to stay in contact with my friends via facetime and snapchat like I usually do. Today I went on a bike ride and visited some of my friends at a safe distance. Despite me talking to my friends so often, I still feel lonely. I’m used to being able to hug and be affectionate (in a platonic way) with my fiends, but without that I feel isolated even when around them. My sisters (who are adults) are able to have friends over and be really close with them but me, a minor, can’t have friends over to hang out with without their parents permission. My friend’s parents would probably not let them come over. I’m usually fine with being alone, as in previous years I’ve spent large amounts of time alone in my room without facetiming or talking to my friends, so what’s so different now? I spend loads of time with my family and I’m never actually alone, so why do I feel so lonely? Is there any way to stop this feeling?",13Jun2020,1
1,"Ok so this has been happening for about two years now. My dad talks to himself ALOT. He’s 55 years old. Like sometimes it sounds like he’s talking about killing someone, other times he talks as if he is another person talking to him,  and other times he says some stuff and then starts laughing obnoxiously loud. Sometimes my dad could just be sitting with me and all of a sudden start laughing really loud. I know he struggles with bipolar disorder and depression and he’s on meds for this. But this is starting to concern me, especially when he says things to himself like, “I’m gonna fucking rip you’re head off” Should I talk to him about this? Also how do I even start off this conversation with him?",13Jun2020,2
3,"First, I know I’m far from perfect but I’ve never met someone who is.

With that being said, there’s certain things about people that are more troublesome than others.  I worry about my sister.  she simply doesn’t care.  She doesn’t care for herself, she doesn’t care about others, and she’s just a leech on everyone.

It would be one thing if she was just lazy but she’s an absolute jerk to everyone.  She constantly growls and mumbles to anything.  You could give her a winning lottery ticket and she’d snap at you.  She acts like a spoiled 7 ur old.  

She cares not about other people but also has no care for herself.  She sleeps all day and screams at video games at night like a child.  She never dressed correctly, she never looks like she’s bathed or seen a comb.  She looks homeless.  It’s so bad I no longer invite her to a store even because she’s so embarrassing.  I don’t walk to the store in a full suit but I at least put on a clean shirt and pants.  Her uniform is a dirty shirt and sweatpants, she’d wear this to store or to meet the queen.

That might be a petty example for some, but it’s just one example.  If this was verbal, I could go on for as long as you’d listen on how she’s lazy, irresponsible, immature, selfish, mean, disgusting human being.

With the stage being set, my sister is an adult.  A young adult but an adult no less.  Being a young adult as well I feel like an senior citizen because this worry is slowly killing me.  ( it might be because I can’t sleep because of her late night antics as well ).

I need advice on more or less how can just forget about her.  She’s so far past correcting, I’ve tried for YEARS to teach her how to act like a woman and shes for years yelled, screamed and hit me for caring about her.
I don’t know how to just say “fuck it, the world has it’s assholes and she’s just one of them”

I don’t know if it’s pride for representing our family so poorly.
I don’t know if it’s some part of my brain that still wants to care for a sibling.
I don’t know if it’s that she’s such a ridiculously immature adult that I want to get it through her thick skull that she’s going to screw up her life and others if she can’t do it.

Either way this is unhealthy for me.  I’m riddled with anxiety and feel my self aging from caring about this jerk and I need advice on how to more less just cut my losses and move on.",13Jun2020,2
5,"My girlfriend(22) called me while I was at work. She told me she was going home after visiting my SIL’s(28) home... She sounded upset and informed me of how my SIL was arguing about general parenting skills with my GF.

Next, my GF says her sister got really heated and started punching my GF....Her sister is about 250 lbs and my girlfriend is 120 lbs. First, her sister pinned her to the ground and struck her 15-20 times. My GF did not hit her at all. It didn’t end until a neighbor came outside and pulled the SIL off of my GF

This is the third time the SIL has assaulted my GF. Actually, she has a history of hitting her mom, husband, daughter, and other sister. She is, most likely, very aggressive due to her uncontrollable use of illegal substances.

My GF did not call the police and does not want to press charges. I do but I know it’s not my choice. Although, I feel that this assault should at least be recorded. Should I still alert the authorities?",13Jun2020,3
8,"Two case scenarios. I currently am in my first job out of college (in sales). 25/F.

Current situation:

*At a company that’s been growing rapidly over the past few years (had an IPO) in a rapidly growing industry. 

*Have equity that vests over 4 years and high pay. Have been a top performer at the company and won a few awards.

*About a year and a half ago, I was badly harassed/bullied by a popular coworker at my company. He spread rumors that I was a fraud and turned a lot of people about me

*For a while in the past, others were extremely disrespectful to me and insinuated I was a loser. This behavior was defended by managers. Keep in mind the sales team is 85%+ men. 

*I tried to report the situation but keep it as quiet and contained as possible but it got escalated, I had a difficult time dealing with it emotionally, and was humiliated on a few occasions

*Now, nothing is really going on anymore (to my knowledge) and I absolutely love my current manager. But I can’t seem to get over how badly I was disrespected and embarrassed before, despite my continued success on paper. I also don’t trust the managers who betrayed me.

Alternative situation:

*I got offered a job at Google (only job offer right now)

*The catch: it only offers 2/3 of my current pay and a worse equity arrangement.

*The company does have perks my current company doesn’t, like 401k matching, free meals, etc

*Start date is in September but that’s also contingent on everything going to plan for them (COVID19 not blowing the fuck up to the point it’s pushed out)

I feel fortunate to be in this situation, but the decision isn’t easy for me. Google may be a “prestigious” company but I am not as interested in what I would be selling there (ads) and as a large company, it lacks the equity and growth opportunities of my current job. 

But at the same time, I don’t know how much longer I can stay in a situation that is good in some ways but also so toxic for my brain.

Any advice is much appreciated.",13Jun2020,2
9,"Ok, idk what this is called, but I just can't make myself sleep. 

As in, uhm, it's not insomnia, I could easily fall asleep if I did let myself do it, but I just can't. 

No matter how tired I am, I just feel like I am in some timeless reality and I just keep staying awake for no real reason, with no real goal or purpose in mind, even if I acknowledge the fact that I should and literally could just go sleep in that exact moment, since I've got nothing else to do for the day.

10,"Pretty much what the title says. Last night I had a dream where I had a daughter. It was the most realistic dream I’ve ever had, and when I woke up I was incredibly confused. I want kids eventually, but definitely not anytime soon. Even in the dream I was older.

But a part of me feels empty. I genuinely miss my daughter from my dreams. I forgot her name this evening and almost started crying. I know she isn’t real, and that I’m definitely not ready to have kids (nor do I want any at this time of my life), but I miss that fake baby.

12,"I'm a teenager and a few months ago my now ex boyfriend kept pushing me to have sex with him. I really didn't want to, but I was scared he would break up with me because of this. Eventually I agreed and said I would consent only if he used condoms and pulled out. He ended up driving to my house and helping me sneak out. We got in his car and we took off all our clothes. He told me he forgot condoms. I told him that I'm getting dressed and going home. He wouldn't let me go and raped me. After he was done he dropped me off at my house and my parents caught me sneaking back in. I told them I was just hanging out with my friend and they grounded me for three months. I was worried about being pregnant and I emailed my counselor anonymously and told her I had been raped and was scared. I left my email open and went to the bathroom. Five minutes later, I see my brother snooping through my email account and it turns out he saw everything. He told my mom and she forced me to go to the police. I made up a story about how I was walking to my friend's house and someone pulled me into their car. They didn't look like they believed me. Soon, I'll have to talk to detectives about what happened. They'll know I was lying and I actually met up with him. My mom will disown me and kick me out. I'll be homeless. She kicked out my big brother and she'll do the same thing to me. I got my period so I know I'm not pregnant, but now I'm scared about the investigation. I emailed the cop to try and stop it. I told him that I'm scared to testify and relieve everything and he still hasn't responded. The only reason I have my phone rn is that I figured out my parents hiding spot for it. I think I have to kill myself. I would rather do that, then let my mom find out what really happened.",13Jun2020,3
13,"I know night lamp is a solution, but i dont have the money or the patience to be ordering right now. I found a cute ""chonky cat"" lamp to buy in the future tho.

So, is there any safety protocols i can take so my house doesn't burn down? I usually buy those big white scented ones inside a glass cup but as the candle burns and turns smaller, the edge of the glass blackened so that freaked me out. And they burn out so fast....i love having a couple lit on my side, on a window far away from any papers, where i dont have a lamp.

I don't sleep with these every night, just when i feel like I can't fall asleep so the lighting soothes me.

14,"Hey guys!

So I have a relatively quick question, about 5 years ago when I was in high school I was super attracted to someone, and I always had the feeling that she felt the same way but we never got the chance to talk about it, school ended and we parted our own ways.

But now it's five years later, and last night I was talking with a friend about high school and I remembered this girl and I wanted to catch up or whatever, but I feel like just following her out of nowhere would seem kind of creepy to her, so i'm not sure what to do.

What do you guys think? Am I overthinking it too much? Should I just randomly follow her and see what happens (my account is private btw, not sure if I should set it public so she can kinda ""remember"" who I am) , send her a DM or just forget about it?

Thank you very much in advance, hope everybody is having a great day!

TL;DR: I want to follow my old highschool crush on IG but i'm not sure if it would be creepy or if i'm just overthinking it way too much.",13Jun2020,1
15,"Growing up my mother never really had a career. She went to school to basically work for CPS (Child Protective Services) but hated the people she worked with and the beaurocracy.  So, she quit and never really worked again, aside from being a parent. For the better part of 25 years her whole life was raising me and my two sisters. But, were grown now. Were raised. And we've been raised for some time. She briefly tried real estate but that didn't work out too well. 

Since we all got our adult bearings and plunged forward with life she kind of came to a stop. She sat down in front of the TV one day7 or 8 years ago and she hasn't moved much since. She's put on a lot of weight and now has back problems due to being immobile and is now very obese. She smokes too which doesn't help anything.

On my last visit she walked from the living room to the bathroom and came back to her chair. This is maybe a 15 ft walk each way. She was huffing and couldn't catch her breath. She wiped a bit of sweat from her forehead. I had to talk to my dad outside about it. I told him, ""dude, we gotta do something about moms weight and exercise."" He gave me a sharp, ""what do you think I've been trying to do?! She went three times to physical therapy and gave up, I made her walk to the end of the road and back one day and she bitched at me for a week for it. I can't make her do something she doesn't want to do."" Fair enough. I recommended to him that maybe this is a huge mental thing that we need to take care of first and should look in to therapy. He brushed this idea off (my parents aren't exactly up on the times regarding advancements and regonition of mental health issues). 

I don't know what to do here. I try to ask her if she's interested in anything that would get her mobile and she thinks I'm just making fun of her weight and she blames it on her back. I tell her if she was more mobile she'd lose the back issues and she says it's too much pain (she does legitimately have a back problem now. That's what the physical therapy was for, to correct it). 

My grandmother, her mother, is currently 75 years old, morbidly obese, and has diabetes, high blood pressure, and can't move much more than from a chair to another chair. This is what my mother is heading towards. This is her future. One day my mother will need to be cared for, and we will care for her, but the burden of her health will weigh on her, me, and my siblings. And she has time to correct it, but I just don't know how to get through to her. I actually don't think she'll make it to 75 given how quickly she's gotten to this point.

Anyway, if anyone has any recommendations on dealing with this situation I'm all ears. I don't want her to just give up on living like that, but what do you do?

Sorry for venting.",13Jun2020,3
17,"I'm 25 going on 26 and this is what my beard looks like after 3/4 of growth. I think it's the type of beard you should have by the age 16-17. I'll never have a full beard but...do you think my beard will get any thicker/filled in?

 I know some guys are late bloomers and can't have a beard until their early twenties whilst others can grow it at the age of 16.

I was seated with a bank representative and went through the process of giving over sensitive and private information to him so that my credit could be checked and other things. Everything was normal, I wasn’t flirtatious and I didn’t think he was. Little jokes were made. My account was set. Then he gave me his business card and then wrote his personal number on the back. I didn’t think too much of it because I had a mask on the entire time and then I left.

About two hours ago I got a notification that someone added me on Snapchat. It was him. I know it was him because he has his first and last name as his username. The only way he could’ve added me is through my phone number. 

My mom didn’t really find this inappropriate, more flattering. I’m kind of creeped out and wondering if I should report him? I’m thinking if he’s bold enough to add me on Snapchat merely hours after seeing me, he could be bold enough to do other things God forbid. He has my address.

19,"Seeing how this is a late night post, it's gonna be extremely messy, but it's easier to be open about this at night.

Throughout my life I've always sort of had a habit of thinking that I was fucking up and allowing that feeling to seize my productivity until the very end.
at which point the anxiety of failing would give me the energy to succeed and overcome many obstacles.

I've done many difficult and time consuming things, all for a better future for myself.

I've had moments where sometimes all I really could do for the entire day was lie in bed until 4pm and then just waste time zoning out.
But after every session like that, I'd pick myself up again and continue fighting.

The past few years I've been doing just that and my happiness levels started to gradually increase.
The feeling of dreading things was becoming less common.
I could already taste the emerging fruits from the tree I planted.

No longer would I even waste time thinking about showering.
I had drive and I had the energy.

The biggest thing I was excited for was the start of the university, I knew that no matter hard it could be I'd feel right at home there.
I was awaiting all the new connections and friends that I'd make, but as you all know, that reality soon shattered.

The first few weeks of Online learning was extremely efficient, I wasted no time and did every subject if my major throughly, however due to the lack of actual university life, I started to witness my gradual decay.

It all started with simple thoughts, like I'll just get to it later or I don't really need this right now.
Things just added up.

I was basically forcing myself to eat food in the morning because I had this weird avoidance feeling towards it.
Sometimes it'd literally take me 45 minutes to finish breakfast because I kept standing up and pacing around or just surfing the Web.

Sleep too has become a challenge.
I'm unsure if it's my fault or it's the lack of any form of social intimacy.
I'll elaborate : I've always had phases where I'd sleep less and I felt fine doing that.
Sometimes I'd stay up just listening to music or reading accounts of different people.
I never had the feeling of not feeling like I should sleep, I just would entertain myself for a bit longer. 
But now it seems like I genuinely can't sleep. 
Its like the feeling of unsatisfaction is not allowing me to do it. 
Its as if I can't earn sleep and my brain is telling me to seek something out. 
A sense of longing dominates me. 

I could hang around with older friends but I don't really feel that at all. 
Whenever I force to hang around with people who I don't feel like hanging out with then leads to me feeling more disappointed. 

Truth be told I'm fairly lost. 
Unsure of what would fix this cruel and harsh state of mind. 
And even though I know that I have to catch up to a lot of assignments, I refuse. 
I never felt this decline before. 
I don't even feel guilt for not spending time on my future anymore. 
Maybe it's because my brain can't comprehend it as future. 
Cause in an actual university you end up meeting people, there's a sense of community. 
You get asked something by your neighbor, which makes you wanna know your subjects well to be able to provide something as well. 
All of which makes you wanna not fuck things up so that you could hang out with these people and not fall behind. 

Honestly I'm just tired of feeling this way.
I've had dark periods, as have many im sure.
But never has it been this bad, even though I did not think it could get this worse at this stage of my life.
Seeing how I have the time to change everything.

I also have this childish thoughts about picking up smoking and just wandering around the city during the night.
I have no idea why I think that'd be cool but my mind thinks it is now.
I guess to appreciate the present more and the simple acts?
Would this be the rejection of Goals that more far away and abstract?

Just having written this down and submitting it gives  me a better feeling, so I'm glad I did not write this shit for nothing.
Because it's really annoying for me to put emotions into thoughts in this structured way.
So I'm glad that all of it was not for nothing.",13Jun2020,2
21,"I'm more than prepared to be met with some criticism which is 100% deserved however I feel I need to get it off my chest. I first came online when I was 13 and of course as a child you're told never to give out your name or pictures of yourself to anyone on the internet which I could get away with for around 5 years I'd say until I got into online gaming. It was around then I started being asked for pictures of myself and for my name etc and during that period my mom was going through an extremely paranoid phrase which I think rubbed off on me in a way so I started to use other people's pictures. 
 I'll say this now the intent was never to bait anyone into being in a relationship with me or get anything from them. I had just been diagnosed with an illness which would mean I'm housebound for the rest of my life so the internet and the people I could speak to on it became the only social interaction I would have and so with that the lie just kept getting deeper and deeper with the more people I was introduced to up to the point where I thought it I were to say anything I'd lose everything. 
 Fast forward to earlier this week and someone had found out that I'd been using someone else's pictures which resulted in me basically losing everyone who I spent time with online and made it possible for me to get through the days without being too sad and thinking about my current situation which has put me in th state where I feel extremely depressed and like I don't have much else to live for since consequently I've lost the people who made getting out of bed bearable. 
 I'm not really sure what kind of advice I'm looking for all I know is I came here not knowing where else to to since with lockdown I can't see a doctor or therapist either. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR; I (F/22) came online at a young age and due to both ingrained paranoia and outside influences I ""catfished"" and since I've been found out I don't feel like I have much else to live for since Ive lost my only friends.",13Jun2020,1
22,"She hasn't been talking to me for the past month. We've been friend's for a few years, though pretty casually. I've shared things with her I've never shared with anyone.
She moved across the country very early this year to live with her partner (female) and I miss her terribly.
She has severe depression and is bipolar, as do/am I, and when she is upset she does go quiet for a very long time. We had a serious conversation about it once and she said it's never been anything to do with me, it's just how she is. I'm supposed to fly down to her place to see her next month.

Well in our group chat we made for our biweekly Pathfinder campaign online she said that her aunt may be dying. I gave her my condolences, and she said although she knew I wanted to talk, that she would be taking a while longer but that she still wanted me to stay with her and her roomates next month. 

She's been going through an extremely rough time lately aside from all this and she always turns me down when I need to talk about things that are bugging me. I should mention that she is awesome about talking to me about whatever I need when she is feeling better. Having similar problems I get needing time.

But it is frustrating sometimes and today I did mention that

 1: I was very sorry about her aunt and I hoped she'd get better.
2:that I was really overwhelmed right now and did need to talk. I've been in a really serious depression latley that nothing has been helping. I had tried other outlets but there are some things that only your best friend gets.
3) She said that she still wanted me there next month if we were flying into the state and I said if you're really okay with it I would.

I realize that I shouldn't have brought up my issues to her during such a tough time but everything I've been feeling just bubbbled over. I feel awful and after rereading it seems like a guilt trip. This was not my intention.

I'm really happy with my boyfriend right now and want to stay with him but despite knowing that me and her are opposites, I think in the back of my mind that I may love her (we are both bisexual). Years ago when we first met I thought maybe there could be something romantic, but then I started seeing her more as a sister sometimes. 

It would never work and I know that. Besides, I would never give up the relationship I have with my long time boyfriend. I really do love him and we live together. I'm happy with her as my friend but I care for her so much. I can't bear knowing that I hurt her. 

Her girlfriend is wonderful but it irks me that she can talk to her about all the stuff that's been getting to her latley but not me. I'm worried.

I looked outside and I couldn’t find it. 2 days ago I cleaned my room again and I realized that in my back right corner I could smell it even worse, I came to the conclusion that an animal must have fallen in between my wall because due to some roof work, some of the house was exposed like that ( I knew I should’ve done the roof work myself).

     I don't want to say anything to her about it because I don't want her to think she has to do this stuff for me, but it would be nice if she wanted to look nice for me and not just some strangers. Am I wrong to think like this?

I worked 11 hrs today and will have to work the whole weekend to have a chance of keeping up. I am suplosed to figure out everything on my own and its really stressul because everything is so vague and ambigous and dont think i am doing anything right. I really dont think ill pass probation. Probation is 6 months and its a very high demanding team. I have already missed a few deadlines and no idea what i am doing.

This is severely affecting my mood. I am really stressed and feel really depressed all the time. How can i not stress so much about a job?? I also have really high social anxiety and i am scared of people getting mad at me and starting to feel im disappointing my manager and director.",13Jun2020,1

37,"Apologies in advance for the rambling wall of text. I really need to get a lot of this out and I really hope someone reads this because I genuinely dont know what to do anymore.  


Four years ago, my girlfriend of over two years left me. I had just graduated college and moved back home, while she remained at school to finish her senior year. I have dealt with depression since I was 14 but it got much worse after this point. I have also had my fair share of breakups in long-term relationships, but none impacted me nearly as much as this. I truly loved her, and I couldnt imagine a world without her, and therefor didnt think she would ever leave me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship was by no means perfect. We got in fights often, and they would get pretty nasty. I lied about smoking a lot. She would bring up very personal and inappropriate things in front of our friends to shame me. I was and still am bad about responding to messages. I struggled to find the motivation to go to classes and finish school, as I had no interest or passion in my degree. I relied on her heavily to get me to study and finish assignments. We lived together and spent every day together. I was her first relationship, but I had been dating at least one person or another since I was 11. She had slept with 1 person once, and i had slept with dozens. Consequently, she was just getting into the world of sex, while I had about had my fill. She wanted sex daily, and I did not. This drove a huge rift into our relationship. We started fighting more, I started becoming depressed and started smoking again, which caused more fights and created a vicious cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

 It eventually got to the point that we were arguing one day and it got physical. I cannot even remember what it was about, but I believe I had lied about smoking cigarettes and tried to cover it up. I had grown frustrated with the argument and was becoming unreasonably angry. I wanted to remove myself from the situation to calm down and attempted to leave. She stood in front of the door and refused to move. I begged and pleaded with her to move for 10-15 minutes but she wouldnt let me out. She lived on the third story of an apartment complex and the only other escape was through the window which was a 50 foot drop. Eventually my anger reached a boiling point. I tried to force my way past her and a struggle ensued. She punched me in the neck and chin and I just... snapped. I grabbed her by her throat and threw her backwards onto her bed. I screamed at her to let me out, my face beat red and spittle flying from my mouth. She looked so terrified and I realized what I was doing and felt so ashamed. I then realized her roommate was screaming at me. She had been outside the door the entire time recording the fight. I grabbed my things and left. I didnt go to my apartment, as I knew she would eventually go there to restart the argument. I was a general manager at an indoor playground, and it was after hours so I went there and crashed for the night after hiding my car a block away so she couldnt find me.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were never the same after that day. She and her roommate got into a fight over the incident and stopped being friends. There was another incident where her roommates boyfriend threatened to beat up my girlfriend in her apartment. Rather than escalate the situation myself, I told her to call the police and he was arrested. I think this was cowardly and I shouldve handled it myself, but thats besides the point. In retaliation, her roommate took the recording to the courthouse and used it as a basis to file for a restraining order for domestic abuse. The case was tossed out because while I spent every night at their apartment, I had my own apartment and address. Therefor, it couldnt fall under domestic abuse, as we lived as separate addresses. Additionally, the incident occurred between me and my girlfriend, and her roommate was merely a witness. Therefor, she could not file for a restraining order for an incident she was not a victim of.

&amp;#x200B;

This further put a strain on our relationship. Her family and friends all began telling her to leave me and I became increasingly depressed. She ended up leaving me due to this incident, the distance, because I had started smoking again, because she didnt think I would ever amount to anything more than a stay-at-home dad, because I was gaining weight and because she wanted to ""live my senior year to the fullest"". 

&amp;#x200B;

After the breakup, I spent a year looking for a job with no luck. Getting a job is tough, but its tougher if you dont have the motivation to apply. To be honest, I didnt really want to work, and still dont. Eventually my parents got fed up with my lack of results and told me to either get a job or they would kick me out. So, I took a job at the company my dad works for, and I have worked here for the last 3 years. I feel like I am only kept on board due to nepotism, as I contribute less than the rest of the members on my team and cannot seem to make it to work on time literally ever,. I am aware that my ethic is lackluster at best and non-existent at worst, but I do not have the motivation or care to change. I care a lot about the people I work with but the majority of the time I cannot build up enough motivation to get anything done. I feel like I am letting them down and do not deserve to be a member of the team. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since COVID, I have been working from home, and this has hurt my productivity further. I often find myself watching TV, browsing social media, or playing video games rather than working. Even when I work at the office, I find myself spending 6-8 hours a day browsing social media, even with extremely important deadlines doing. I have no passion for what I do. I am constantly behind and having to ask for help to dig myself out of a hole. I know this is a huge problem and it plagues me with guilt. I want to become a productive member of the team, but I have no motivation to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I have developed chronic headaches, which further kill my productivity. I need to see a doctor about this, but I lack the motivation to make the appointment. When I do muster the energy to make the appointment, I lack the motivation to attend. As such, this issue has persisted for months and is getting worse. I fight the headaches by smoking weed, as it is the only thing that gives me relief. The headaches to me feel like nicotine withdrawal, as I quit smoking around a year ago. I quit because I would vape so much it would give me headaches, and yet now that I gave it up, the headaches persist. I would also have headaches due to lack of vaping, which I would try to rectify by vaping, which would work somewhat but never make them go away. I would then vape too much and get a headache again. Vaping also make me naueseous, which I would rectify by smoking weed. This created a vicious cycle of constantly vaping and smoking weed. I thought the weed was the source of my lack of motivation, and still do to this day. I wanted to end the cycle, and felt it was easier to quit vaping while smoking weed rather than the other way around or quitting both at once, so i quit vaping. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now find myself unable to quit smoking weed. It is one of the few things left that I enjoy. I struggle to sleep or eat without it. My patience becomes non existent and my anxiety gets much much worse, to the point that I struggle to have conversations or do anything in public. I cant even play games like Fortnite or Warzone without feeling anxiety. Therefor, I have struggled to quit and while one side of me wants to quit, another side does not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of working, I spend 100% of my free time watching TV, playing video games and smoking weed. I have not hung out with friends since the onset of COVID outside of video games. I have lost interest in all other hobbies and barely retain interest in video games and TV. I think the only reason I stick with these is because they require minimal effort to engage in. I want to go out and longboard or hike or camp again, but lack the motivation to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried exercising for a while but eventually lost the motivation to do so and have subsequently gained about 70 pounds. I want to lose weight but cannot find the motivation to do so. I also need to change my diet, as I still have the taste pallet of a 7 year old, but I cannot find the motivation to do that, either. I do not enjoy cooking, so I usually eat junk food or just get delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

Following the breakup, I tried dating for a few months and was met with dozens of rejections. I eventually moved across the country for around 1 year for work and gave up on dating as soon as I left home. This continued until about 6 months ago. I had a brief relationship where I was essentially used as a rebound before she found someone she wanted to date long term again. This, combined with my lack of success overall in dating and my weight gain has killed any self-confidence I had left. I have grown jaded and am developing a deep-seated hatred of both women and myself. I know this is wrong and I want to change it, but I cannot find the motivation to do so.   

 I made no friends and was completely alone during this one year period abroad. Because of this, I was excited to return home. However, living here feels the same as it did out there, except now I have my parents to constantly ride my ass like Im 16 again. I am now looking to move across the country again for work, this time permanently. This could happen anywhere from a few weeks to a year from now. I am excited, as I will be independent from my parents again and will not be constantly harassed by them. I know it isnt a great idea to rely on a job that I have no passion in, but I dont feel like I have another option. I just desperately want to get away from my parents, and I feel terrible for feeling that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been given the advice to quit my job and do something I am passionate about many times, but I am not passionate about anything anymore. I thought I was passionate about Fortnite and tried to make a career somehow playing video games. I made a YouTube channel that never took off and a Twitch that never got any views and an Instagram that got no followers. I tried to become a pro and sunk a year of my free time into getting better every single day. I dedicated every ounce of my being into improving but I eventually plateaued and no matter how much I practiced, I just wasnt getting better. Trying to make a living off of video games is about as unlikely as becoming a professional athlete, and so I gave up. After a year of playing 4+ hours a day, I couldnt even break the top 1000 in any tournament and over time, my placement kept going worse and worse. I lost my motivation to improve and gave up playing.

&amp;#x200B;

I now have no goals, no dreams, no aspirations. When people ask me where I see myself in five years, I have no idea what to say. In reality, I dont see myself being alive in five years if this trend continues, but I cant say that to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the obvious answer here is that I need to see a therapist. I have been given this advice from more people than I can remember, including my parents. I have done a lot of research into this and every time I end up getting overwhelmed and frustrated. I have contacted dozens of licensed therapists that I thought could help. I never once got a single appointment. The majority of those who answer the phone arent taking on new patients, but most dont answer or return my calls. One even rudely shouted at me that she had no idea how she could possibly fit me into their schedule and to look elsewhere before hanging up on me. This has killed my motivation to see a therapist, as I believe have called just about every licensed therapist that deals with depression in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people recommend online therapy, and I signed up for this once. The time for the session came and I could not find the courage to attend. I had seen a therapist in high school that my parents took me to see after I became suicidal, but I never opened up at the sessions and lied about nearly every aspect of my life. I am worried that this will continue, that I will not be truthful or that I will be unable to open up, as I have never able to open up to any of my friends or family, let alone a stranger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have only ever been able to open up to one person in my life, but I find myself unable to take their advice. I dont believe their advice to be realistic and what good advice they do give I am unwilling to take, as it usually requires drastic change and taking me far out of my comfort zone, which gives me extreme anxiety to even think about. I lack the motivation to take their advice, and will likely lack the motivation to take yours, should you choose to comment, presuming anyone ever reads this in the first place. As a result, they are usually short with me and appear irritated when I reach out, and therefor we have stopped talking. It probably doesnt help that this was also the rebound person from earlier but I digress. Pro tip: never sleep with your best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

This post has amounted to nothing but me rambling. I dont even know what advice to ask really for. I am hesitant to post this because I feel like I am just attention seeking, and have avoided seeing therapists because I think I am just looking for attention because I am subconsciously lonely. It is likely that half of what is in here is lies, but I've lied to myself so much that I now believe the lies as truth and cannot tell the difference anymore. I hoped getting this all out would help, but I just feel worse. I have thought about suicide pretty much daily over the last four years, but I would never go through with it so long as my parents live. I feel as if I am living life on auto-pilot, and I know in order to change it, I need to make drastic changes in my life. These changes terrify me, and a combination of anxiety, laziness and lack of motivation hold me back from implementing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I think I am over the breakup, I find myself dreaming about her. Every time I do, I dont want to wake up. I still think about her every today but I know she doesnt think about me hardly ever. Our relationship was horrible and toxic and we did awful things to each other and yet I still miss her and love her. I try my hardest to avoid looking her up on social media, but I always end up caving and it makes me so happy to see her following her dream and being generally happy. I just wish I could be by her side supporting her through it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what this all comes down to in the end is that I need to change, want to change, but dont have the motivation to do anything about it. How do you gain motivation to do, well, anything?",13Jun2020,3
40,"I made the dumbest mistake of my life, and don’t know what to do. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for two years. I cheated on her, with my female friend. My girlfriend knows about her and know we’re really good friends. She comes to my house every Wednesday so we can watch wrestling together. Since she doesn’t have cable at her house. My girlfriend knows about this too and doesn’t mind. 

So once the wrestling show was over this week. I asked her if she wanted some leftover food before I dropped her off home. She said “yes” so while I’m putting the food on a plate she randomly comes behind me and hugs me. So I turn around so I can wrap my arms around her. When I do this she kisses me and I ended up sliding my hands down her shorts grabbing her butt. 

When I did that, I instantly knew I messed up and stopped. To avoid making things awkward I just started a random conversation and took her home. Should I just wait until I see my girlfriend to tell, call her, or text her? We don’t see each other often since we live two hours away from each other. I’m afraid to tell her in person because she likes to try and put her hands on me when angry.",13Jun2020,1

He lives with her mom, sister and now ex at a shitty appartment and her mom is gone half the time. Today he was kicked out with no chance to say bye to his son and she told him she was expecting company and to not show up for the next couple of days. My brother is sweet and was more devistated that he didn't get to say bye then her having someone over, not to mention she also is going to make him pay child support when he turns 18 in a month because she doesn't have a way of income to provide for their son.

43," Hello  all, my name is Jasmine, and to give a little bit of context I am 62  years old and have been an accountant at an apartment rental office for  the past 10 years in Miami, FL. My job does not require me to be present  at the same time everyone is because I do not have any secretarial  duties.

Due to my age, I have  maintained a work from home routine ever since the Covid19 lock-down  began. Suddenly, the company owner sent me a text indicating that  starting Monday we will be resuming work activities on a normal basis.  This in light of everyone else reopening their businesses.

I  responded to the message by asking what safety measures were to be  followed for COVID prevention, and after thinking about it for a long  time, my boss replied with ""taking employee temperatures"". I then asked  about social distancing, and my boss replied with a sarcastic ""please"".

My  desk is less than 3 ft away from the area where everybody (including  labor workers) continuously walk about 100 times a day. He even opposes  adding cubicles or plexiglass as a solution. I responded to him saying  ""this is not a favor, I am talking about my health , and life.""

Since his proposed solution was inefficient, I counter proposed to either:

1. Work  in after hours, where no staff is present, including Saturdays to  complete my 40 hours. (I live half a block away and have been allowed to  work at night or on off days before on my own, so it is not a trust  issue).
2. Working from home at their same hours , Monday to Friday, as I have been doing.

He  did not reply afterwards, I'm afraid he's planning to fire me. Is the  business owner right in doing this? Is demanding security measures to  avoid any possible transmission of COVID wrong on my part? Are there any  legal measures I can take in case he fires me?

Thank you in advance.

TL:DR  - My boss wants to start regular business on Monday without proper  COVID safety measures. I have proposed two reasonable solutions but he  has not answered yet. I am afraid he is planning on firing me and would  like to know if there are any legal measures I could take.",13Jun2020,2
45,"Recently i met a girl, and for less than a week we became very close. We could talk for hours and hours, its nice talking to her. She is into my best friend, who is a player. And sometimes we’d talk about him. Today my bestie asked me to make her go over to his place tomorrow and since i am his best friend i did it. I somehow managed to make her go over his place, and we all know what’s gonna happen tomorrow. He is going to be her first. She even was embarrassed to ask for a condom so, i told him get one instead of her. I don’t understand one thing though. Why am i feeling so down. Why is it like something is eating me from the inside. Should i call her and stop her and maybe express my feelings about her. Because i know what my best friend will do. He will just use her once or twice for sex, and she will catch feelings about him even more (she said that herself. She is gonna lock herself inside for months). I don’t know what to do, he’s my bestie so I don’t wanna fuck him up. But I don’t want her to be ruined as the girl she is right now. My best friend is very attractive, while i am not so i’m thinking if i call her and stop her it would go downhill. The reason i’m worried is that, i knew a girl once. I wasn’t into her but we were friends. She was exactly like her, basically the same personality. She was in the same situation. A fuckboy went through her and left her right away after a night. Now she is the type of people you usually don’t like. Mean all the time, throwing herself into every boy she sees, and addicted to drugs.

I'm also planning on reading other books like The Everything Store and anything else I can get my hands on. I really like reading about how the protagonist starts off being average, or even below average, before they find their life purpose and work hard at their business to accomplish that life purpose. Sometimes I imagine myself in a novel in progress, like the main character in my own story. What makes me uncomfortable is that there were a lot of really embarrassing things that happened in my past, with the latest one being about 5-6 months ago, where someone took this pic of me looking at my crush's Insta and it spread through a lot of people. Point is, I look back and cringe on it, and can't imagine the look on someone's face if they ever found out. Idk if I'm even making any sense, but the main thing I'm trying to get across is that there are a lot of embarrassing things in my past I just wish didn't happen, and it makes me cringe to even think about them.

50,"So my husband and I got married in October. We've been slow about getting thank-yous out - with full time jobs and me being a full time student, and then covid craziness hitting the world, it just hasn't been done as soon as I would have liked. But I am working on them and getting them out, and hope to be finished soon. 

We also only recently went to deposit our wedding checks, as it took me awhile to get my name change sorted out and then all the banks closed down for months (we had to deposit in person since both of our names are on the checks, and we wanted to open a joint account to deposit them into anyway). So we finally went and deposited most of them (our bank doesn't care that they're from October), but we saved a few that were particularly generous because we didn't want to pull that much money out of someone's account without asking them if it was okay to do so at this time. 

Since we are still working on getting thank yous out, my husband thought we should text the people to make sure depositing the checks is okay. However, I feel awkward doing this because we haven't sent these people our formal thank-yous yet. Husband thinks it would be weird to send a formal thank you, and then ask if we can still deposit the check afterwards. That made sense to me - text first, deposit check, then send formal thank-you.

Now to the story. I moved out of my moms 6 weeks ago. I talked to my dad about what was going on and he said it was up to me for what I want to do. I made the decision to move full time to my dads. My mom didnt care until she got an email from my dads attorney about the change in child support. I have a younger sister who still splits time. So my dad has 
2 1/2 kids. Now my mom has to pay my dad child support. When she got the email I got a text from her asking for me to move back with her. I was with my dad for 3 weeks before I got the text.

54,"Background: I’m 16. My dad is a dumbass and basically breastfeeds from right wing media. He’s stubborn as well.

I was going to stay home for the week vacation we usually take to Panama City Beach in Florida. For some reason my parents decided that it would be a good idea to go this year, in the middle of a worldwide pandemic, when cases are rising again. Well, I decided that it would be the best if I stayed home because I take this seriously. However, my decision was quickly shot down tonight.

They called me into the living room and said that I would be joining them for the last 3 days. I told him that I wouldn’t feel safe and that I would like to stay home. He paused, then got mad and asked why I feel unsafe. I had to remind him that there’s a pandemic going on and I don’t feel comfortable going out in public. He then shouted at me that I was falling for “Democrat Propaganda” and that “This is no worse than the flu, but the Democrats don’t want you to believe that. They only blow it up because they want to make Trump look bad!” I was dumbfounded. Could anyone ever be this fucking stupid? I started dismissing his claims, saying stuff like “Cases are on the rise: I get my information from non-political sources: It is worse, that’s why we’re in quarantine.” That’s when he snapped, stood up, got in my face and yelled about me being a hypocrite because I have a job.

Granted, I don’t need a job but I would like a computer. Everyone at work takes the necessary precautions to stay safe, and so do I. I try and tell him this, but he keeps spewing this nonsense about how “he’s lived in this country long enough to know he’s right.” This is when my mom stepped in. I thought she was going to defend me, but instead backed my dad up and tried to comfort me and tell me it’ll be ok in a calm voice. She’s not the smartest, either, but at least she’s level headed and easy to work with. After this my dad falls silent and I’m excused to my room.

Why do I feel like an asshole? On a 4-person team, one's on maternity leave and another one was just diagnosed with brain cancer. I realized that it'd put them in a bad position if I left, but a second coworker will probably go on sick leave. That takes a 4-member team down to one. 

If I'm offered the job, and I think that it could go that way, I'd leave in the peak of a campaign. It'd really put the organization in a bad position and I'd definitely burn that bridge.

What would you do?

I might not get the job offer, so none of this might matter. But I'm wondering about the right thing to do...",13Jun2020,5

58,"So I've been dating this guy for the past month and only recently came up the topic: weight. This made me realise that I should've asked sooner but now so far into the relationship there's no easy way out of this and I'm scared that I had been dating someone obese all this time. Some background info: I'm from the u.k. he is from the u.s.

Okay so I have asked him what he weight and he told me he's about 65 kg meanwhile I weight 23 stone and it just sounds like an enormous difference. I'm aware that weight are different in every country but it's probably around the same give or take a few pounds difference. 

Now if he is to be obese what would be the best way to break up with him? I don't want to be stuck with a fat disgusting pig but I'm obviously not going to tell it to him like that, I've watched my friend get bullied for weighing 25 stone and I've seen what it does to a person, they become very cynical and sometimes they even become like their abusers and do the same what was been done to them. I'm better than that. 

Please just tell me if he's an obese fuck or not",13Jun2020,0

I think I found someone to go with me but I’m really nervous so maybe I’m just asking for like tips or like anything to calm my nerves.

61,"I (m23) would like to know if anyone can relate to the title and tell me what you did? Or have any advice anyway

So basically one of my best friends(been friends for 15 years) and her gf (f20) broke up after 2 months (I had only seen her 5 times). But he broke up with her in such a awful way, me and his ex got in contact through tinder. Because we never exchanged numbers.

Long story short we still talk to each other after 3 months and have a really good chemistry. We have stuff in common, text 24/7 and we make each other laugh (mostly memes).

But now comes the annoying part, we talk so much to the point I can’t sleep and we just keep texting. When I wake up after 3 hours of night sleep the first thing I think of is her and when she texts me I just become happy, she kinda makes my day.

I wouldn’t say that I love her, there aren’t any fireworks really. But I’m kinda worried that I will get feelings for her or to get too attached and it probably wouldn’t work out since anyway she is the ex of a good friend of mine and I haven’t talked about it with him.

So I explained to her how I feel and suggested to maybe stop our friendship, which she agreed on. But the next day she started texting me again (I also had the urge to text her), because how routine it had become to text each other everyday. And of course as the weak person I am, I texted back.

So my question is, can anyone relate to this? What did you do? 
Should I just stop texting since it wouldn’t work out and not risk getting feelings for her and getting hurt over it probably? 
Or for you have tips to just be friends and leave the feelings behind?

63,"So let me start this off by saying that I'm not a ""nice guy"". I am genuinely nice to everyone no matter their gender or attractiveness. I don't DM random girls and beg them for nudes, then call them stuck up sluts after I get rejected. I don't expect girls to give me sex just for being nice to them. I don't go for 10/10s, I have very normal standards. I don't see women as sex objects or prizes

For some reason I can't get a date. I am kind and caring to everyone. I am into such a wide variety of tv shows, movies, cartoons, and anime. I am a good listener and I never judge people harshly. I just don't get why I don't have a gf, meanwhile the most shallow and mean guys get the girls. 

Before you say ""Oh you're just a nice guy that's jealous of these guys, they aren't actually assholes"", you're completely wrong. The same guys that get the girls are the same ones that bullied the mentally ill girl into almost taking her own life. The same guys that get the girls are the same guys that bullied the disabled kid, and made him embarrass himself. The same guys that get the girls are the same ones that are disrespectful to the teachers and skip class to smoke weed. 

I just don't get it at all. I'm not even ugly, I'm pretty average looking. I don't even want sex, I just want a loving relationship.

67,"I’m so sorry for the long post but I’m begging you guys for advice I don’t have friends or family to talk to so I need help from you guys.

I’m 14 and I’m 4’11 and weigh 122 and since I’m shorter than my average height it means I’m overweight. And I hate myself for how ugly I look and I’m really socially awkward. And I constantly have to hide from my parents because every time they see me they just shame me and make me look like a monster and it makes me want to kill myself. I’ve been depressed for 2 years now but they wouldn’t care because I’m a kid. And I say they don’t care because I’m a kid is because they don’t see me as a human they see me as a gross monster that they have to raise. Every time I go downstairs they say “you need to workout more you look really unhealthy” and “you don’t even try to get in better shape or eat healthier” and it goes on and on and on and they’ll be nice for about a few weeks but then if one small thing happens my parents get in argument about how to control me and they get mad at each other and my brother and I’m scared one day they’re going to divorce and it’s going to be my fault and I know my dad hates me because of it. My parents are ashamed and embarrassed of me and they don’t even hide it. They don’t realize that they don’t let me try to lose weight or eat healthier without shaming me. I should just die they would be happier I’m just an inconvenience, an embarrassment I’m nothing to them. I hide In my room all day and I only go downstairs to get water if I know no ones downstairs. And I only eat about one meal a day and that’s whenever my parents are either out or are asleep and I chose to only eat one meal. I just want to make it clear that they don’t physically abuse me but if I’m being honest I wish they did so they didn’t fight each other all the time because my house is chaos. Nobody listens to me. During school when it was still in every school year my brother fails all his classes (he’s 16) and they always yell at him late at night and it makes me scared for myself and my brother. And then they yell at me for having bad grades and they corner me in my room and whenever they yell at me I tend to hide under my blanket and tell them to leave and they just say “look at you” and “you’re acting like a child” and whenever they corner me for to long and they yell too much I end up yelling and then it just proves their point. I have social anxiety too and so they constantly ridicule me for not going out with friends but I don’t ask my only two friends to hang out because I look ugly and I can’t trust people too. My parents are fighting right now about how I’m antisocial and I’m scared they’re going to yell at me. They think they’re nice parents and I think my mom’s a nice person but she complains to much and it makes my dad miserable and my dad being miserable makes my mom mad and my mom being mad means she every so often yells and me and my brother and that leads to my brother yelling and it goes on and on and I know no one looks at me like a regular person just a fat short person so they don’t care. I’m sorry this was so long but I don’t know what to do because if I called child services or something it’d hurt my parents but everybody sees them as really nice and overly kind. And I just want to restate that this isn’t a constant thing but if it happens once it lasts for so long and it won’t end and they think that they’re nice because they bought me and my brother consoles and games and stuff but they can’t use that as an excuse. And I just want this to end whether I’m taken away or if I kill myself as long as it ends. I also just want to ask one last thing, what’ll happen to me if I call cps or something and if they do or can take me what’ll happen to me especially during quarantine. Or I might just be overreacting but I can’t tell. if you read all of this then thank you.",13Jun2020,41
68,"So I work a seasonal job at a state park and this is my 2nd season at this particular park (started this season on May 16). I told my boss I would need to be part time because I was hoping to get an internship, and he said he was fine with it. I told him I was for sure okay with working weekends, and would add a couple weekdays if I got the internship. 

Well I got the internship (yay!) and am working 20 hrs a week there. When I told him about the internship, he said ""well we'll see if this works out."" I was confused because he already knew I would most likely only be working weekends when he hired me, so it was a weird sudden change. My coworker mentioned he told her he was thinking about letting me go to hire someone full time. He had not mentioned this to me at all...

Additionally, this all happened right after I participated in some BLM protests in my city. I noticed my boss unfriended me immediately after I posted pictures of the protest (which i realize it was stupid of me to have my boss on fb to begin with). He's a park ranger, so technically a law enforcement officer, so I imagine he's not thrilled about me going out and protesting the police. I couldn't help but notice that his sudden desire to fire me and hire someone full time (after previously being ok with me being part time) came a couple days after I attended those protests... but maybe I'm just being paranoid and cynical. 

Regardless, I hate this job, I'm already getting exhausted from working 4 days a week at the internship and the other 3 at the park. The internship is paid, so I can make enough to cover rent and such, I would just not have much extra to add to savings. But I do have a couple thousand saved in case of emergency. I just would feel bad about the fact I told my boss I could definitely do weekends, and then deciding to quit even though I don't really have a good reason to, other than ""I don't like working here."" I just feel like I made a commitment to stay for the summer and I should keep that commitment, but also I don't feel valued here and actively hate every second of being here. 

What would be the right decision in this situation? Should I suffer through a few months to keep my commitment to this job and make some extra money, or should I quit to save my sanity and make do with less money?",13Jun2020,1
71," 

Isolation during the pandemic has led some unresolved parts of my life to resurface and are now pervasive thoughts.  

Long story short, my dad is quite possibly much worse of a person that I previously realized. Some of the things that trouble me is that I have reason to believe he had something to do with the death of his business partner, and my mother’s suicide(gas lighting). I also have reason to believe that he is in collaboration with his landlord when it comes to some of the shady things that I think they’ve been involved in.  For example, shortly after his business partner passed, the landlord and my father figured a way to resign the business license and lease for the restaurant under my mothers name in order to block his late partner's family out and take all the profit.  

After my mother’s passing my father manipulated me in a lot of ways, pretty much hinting that if I didn’t help him that he might commit suicide. He would never let me out of his sight, and was asking me to take over the family business so that he could move to Korea (which he never did), but I think he realized that I wasn’t the kind of person he hoped I’d become. We fought over a lot of things and he eventually kicked me out of both the house and the business. Overnight I had no income, and nowhere to sleep.

It’s been three years since and luckily, I had a lot of good friends who helped me get back on my feet. During that time I’ve just been focusing on healing and moving forward, but the COVID situation has proven to be quite the obstacle to maintaining peace. I keep telling myself that my father’s deeds will eventually catch up to him, that there’s no way he could just get away with all the things I believe him to be responsible for. However, with how crazy the world is becoming, I think that maybe it’s not that far fetched to think he could be just that lucky.

I tried reaching out to him about a couple years ago, trying to reconnect. We had lunch once and I had brought up things I usually wouldn’t dare bring up when i was younger. Things like when he used to beat me and my mom, how angry I was at how he handled my mom’s mental health issues, etc. He pretty much denied everything and that was the last time we spoke.

I have a lot of anger and resentment towards him and I’m not sure exactly how to move on. The thought of making him pay for the pain he’s caused me and his business partner's family is something that I’m not proud of having, but it is very pervasive and it’s hard not to dwell when COVID is keeping me from resuming the kind of life I’ve built after separating from father that helped to keep my mind off the past.",13Jun2020,1
72,"So issues with my mother have been an ongoing thing but lately things have been getting weirder. She’s always talked to random guys over the Internet on and off behind my dads back, even going so far as to leave my family multiple times for them. She started talking to this British guy about a year or two ago and I just try to mostly stay out of it. That is until my mom forcefully makes me have video calls together with him and tries to get me to “model” for him sometime down the line (I’ve seen the work he does and it’s almost exclusively nude modeling) and trying every which way to make him into some sort of step dad figure. I’ve even overheard her telling him that she wants him to come with me to look at colleges instead of my real dad. It’s gotten so bad as of late that she doesn’t even talk to me anymore unless she’s filming or on call with him to maintain her “perfect mom” record. She even filmed every step of me getting routine bloodwork and a physical at the doctors office today. I’ve tried nicely saying that I didn’t want to be involved with this situation because it feels gross and wrong to me and because I already have a dad figure in my life (my real dad). I just want to know how to get her to stop or treat me like an actual human being rather than the personification of her “hard work”.

74,"So I recently purchased some clothing with a gift card from urban outfitters, but my total went slightly above my gift card amount so I just paid the rest with my debit card on one single order. A pair of shorts came in that just aren’t fitting perfectly, and I was wondering if I were to return them, would I be refunded to my debit card or my gift card? It says that I will be refunded to original form of payment, but there are two forms of payment on one order.

My dilemma is that I need shorts for my upcoming beach trip and I want to order new shorts now in time for my trip and can’t wait for them to be returned, refunded the money to either the gift/debit card, and then buy the shorts. But, my logic is that if the money is eventually going to be returned to my bank account, it doesn’t really matter, and I can just buy new shorts that fit and hope they are delivered in time.

77,"TL;DR - would I get a better mortgage if I had a bank account for 10+ years than 2 years, or would it make no difference?

We’re looking to (hopefully) buy our first flat late next year, so everything in my life is pretty geared towards securing the best mortgage possible, especially as we live in London.

I (25F) currently have 3 bank accounts, 2 savings account (one Lifetime and one ISA) and a credit card:

1) My personal account which I’ve had for at least 10 years. This is what my salary goes into, but I don’t have any regular outgoings.

2) My ‘billing’ account, which I’ve had for 4ish years. My boyfriend (26M) and I both pay a regular amount in each month, and I have direct debits set up so all bills are automatically paid each month

3) Online bank - I mainly use this for when I’m spending money in another country (my previous job required a lot of travel).

I’ve never been in debt, and my credit card is barely used and also set to automatically pay off everything at the end of the month (I’ve had this since Jan).

So what I’d like advice on; neither of my bank accounts are really ‘working’ for me. I find the online one much better in terms of ease of use, tracking my spending and actually saving. I’d like to transfer my ‘main’ account to this, but how much would I be penalised when applying for mortgages if I only had this account for a year, maybe 2, vs maybe 15 years?",13Jun2020,1
78,"My friend just sent me an Instagram video about a guy leaving his kid to school and hearing other kids say “let’s play house” so he took his kid away because he knew “exactly what goes on in that game.” And my friend sent me a screenshot of the comments saying “some people had really traumatic childhood this is fucked up.” Everyone was saying how those games were sexual some said it wasn’t for them and they just did normal things like pretend to go to work etc but a lot mentioned it was sexual and then mentioned the “doctor” game. 

Im having a panic attack rn trying to stay calm and collected. I remember playing those games with my cousins when I was around 8-12. Some my age some younger and I vaguely remember it being sexual. Idk why. I don’t know who introduced us to it. Idk who started it. Idk. All I know is for my whole life I’ve felt guilty and ashamed of that. Everyday of my life I feel like killing myself because we did that. Yeah we were all kids, we didn’t know any better but I feel like I’m to blame. Idk why I feel like that.

82,"Ok here's the story

About a month ago my gf and I find a dog in our driveway, he was terrified of us at first but after some coaxing and pets he warmed up to us, not thinking anything of it (random dogs running around isn't out of the ordinary where we live) we left to run some errands. When we returned he was still hanging around and we decided to feed him ( mistake probably I know). After a few days, some of which where days that one of us had off so we could monitor him, the dog was still hanging around so we decided he was probably lost and put up an add on our local Facebook lost pets group. After about a week of the add being up we pretty much figured he was abandoned and thought maybe we could take care of him. We really did have the best intentions to care for him the best we could, which included taking him to the vet to check for a chip which he did not have. 

As the summer heats up my job is pulling more of my time and my gf was already working 12 hour shifts (the days of one of us having schedules that allowed at least one of us to be home are gone for the next 6-8 months) so we hardly feel like we have time to care for him and ourselves. Money is also pretty tight right now as we just moved to this city with practically nothing in our bank accounts and shots and neutering where quoted to cost about 3-4 hundred dollars. Not to mention the fact that while me and my gf have a pretty solid relationship and we've talked about getting a dog in the future we're just not ready to be fur parents.

So the advice I'm asking for is, what can we do with this dog? -Taking him to a shelter would cost more than we can really afford right now -We asked everyone we know around us if they would take him, all answered no -We can't just leave him outside and hope he goes away because he will just sit by our front door and bark until we let him in and obviously, we are not going to drop him off in the woods like someone has probably already done to him

83,"I just finished my freshman year of college and am having this really difficult dilemma. Ever since i started school at my current university, i knew that I wanted to transfer to this other college that I had previously gotten rejected by. I was pretty obsessed with transferring for all of first semester; I worked super hard for good grades so i could transfer and I did not take many opportunities to get involved because I wanted to put my energy into applying for transfer / getting a good GPA. and obviously, getting involved was not a priority since id probably be leaving. I wouldn’t say I have a “dream” school but in comparing schools alone, this other college has many more opportunities for me to pursue my hobbies/passions as well as a club culture that would better help me solidify and explore the career options im considering. I can better explore neuroscience &amp; technology together and the school in general has a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary studies. 

However, as much as i tried to resist creating attachments to my current college, my bf was persistent in chasing me even though he knew i wanted to transfer and now we’re pretty in love. It couldn’t be helped, and now we’ve been together for 4 months, albeit half of that has been in quarantine LDR bcuz we live across the country from each other. For a month+ he’s been trying to convince me not to go. He has some trust issues and really values an in person S.O experience. But he says even though it’ll be hard and he’ll always carry some sadness about it, he’d try LDR because he doesn’t want to let me go. 

Naturally, I don’t want to include a boy in my decision. I usually say career &gt; love, at least at this point in my life. It’s also only been 4 months so how am I to know this is forever (although it feels like it really could be)? 

At the same time, it’s not like my career goes down a hole at my current school. It’s ranked pretty equally, and their emphasis in pre-medicine is arguably stronger than the other school. The neuroscience department is very good as well, but there is much less emphasis on interdisciplinary studies and much more on just getting into med school. It’s arguably a more straight forward path with less exploration. I am pretty sure of what I want to pursue, but no where near 100% as i still don’t know enough to really say that.  That’s why i wanted to go to the other college in the first place. 

As for this hobby (dance) that I’ve practiced and love for my whole life, it kind of disappears if i stay at my current college. If i go to the other college, it’ll become a really big part of my life like it always has been. I can always dance by myself of course, but a team and community makes a HUGE difference and that is what im most used to and what will help me grow as a dancer. 

What do you think I should do? Ik my BF said he’s willing to do LDR but I have a feeling his negative attitude towards it might be detrimental. Also, we would barely see each other, probably around 3 weeks per year if we consider conflicting break times, summer internships, etc...  thanks in advance and plz help lol",13Jun2020,1

I'm almost out of savings due to not having a job anymore(pandemic). I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I have no will to live. Nowhere to move forward. Even when everything opens up and I get my job back it's still not a career and I can't stay there forever. College isn't for me, but my whole family pushes me all the time to go study even when I don't want to. Nor do I have the money and getting into debt is not a plan.

89,"Yeah, another case of momma's boy. I've been sheltered a very large part of my life thanks to my mom, who has practically controlled every aspect of my life except who I date and my college major (architecture if you're wondering). She dictates a 10pm curfew even though I live a quarter of a mile from my gf, always strikes down plans because it ""cuts into family time"", watches my bank account like a hawk (despite me always being shrewd), and pretty much has control over every aspect of what I do. Her excuse for all of this is the classic ""I'm your mother"" trope, sputtering about how she pays for my tuition, phone bill, insurance, living conditions, and other minor contributions. While I appreciate all of that, she lords it over me and uses it to guilt trip me into what she deems acceptable. My gf has practically had enough of it and has threatened several times recently to stand up to her or else. If I stand up to my mother, I fear the repercussions of being shunned and practically being cut off from my family (3 little brothers, dad, and grandfather), and losing the financial support. If I don't, I fear losing my gf, who has aside from this been there for me 110%.

But lately they’ve been saying that I should transfer to Louisiana next year.

91,"This is kind of a long story, but I'll attempt to make it brief.

I (21M) started dating my now ex-girlfriend (21F) in highschool. We started dating halfway through our junior year, and we were really happy together, but when it came time to go to college things got really bad. She wanted to go to a school out of state she had her heart set on for a few years, and when she got in, we didn't really know what to do. I offered to move out there (I was taking a semester off to handle things financially - I won't get into it here) and then go to a school nearby the next semester. She thought we should break up, but she never full on told me not to do it. I ended up moving out about a month after she left, and we were still together. When I got there, though, she broke up with me right away and she said she knew she was going to break up with me from pretty much the start of the summer.

I was obviously heartbroken, and since nothing was officially on paper yet for the new apartment (all verbal agreements), I moved all my stuff back home (multi-day road trip just to get there). We kept talking on the phone every night after that, but it was pretty rough. I was having a really hard time with the breakup, and although she said it was hard for her too, she was handling it much better thanks to her months of prior notice. I'm not proud of this as it clearly made things harder on her, but I would still occasionally say ""I love you"" and things like that. Eventually things slowed down a bit communication wise, before picking up again about 2/3rds of the way through the semester. Her roommate was out of town for a long weekend and we ended up having ""video chat sex"" a couple times (no coercion involved, we were both pretty into it). We then kept sending nudes back and forth and were talking as if we were a couple again. We were pretty much back to dating, although neither of us flat out said it. Then, out of nowhere, she slept with a guy from her english class that she first talked to a few hours before it happened. She then said we never got back together as a reason why it was ok, and she pretty much ghosted me until she got back from winter break.

When she did get back, I asked if I could head over to her place so we could talk. Once I got there we talked for a while (it was so good to casually talk with her in person again, it was the best I had felt emotionally since she left), but one thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping together (once again, no coercion). I though she must have had broken it off with the other guy, but no, she had now cheated on the guy she cheated on me with, with me. I shit you not. The rest of winter break was then a lot of us having genuine fun together, some sexual fun, and her deciding what to do (I didn't know she was cheating on the guy because after the first night she said they were purely casual, which turned out to be a lie). When she went back for the spring semester, I had 0 clue where we stood, but we video chatted pretty much every night and she said she broke it off with the other guy (without mentioning me) and that she wanted to officially get back together.

There were obviously some issues with the relationship, long distance is not easy and a few specific moments (such as her having ""dinner"" with the other guy) definitely didn't help. We had our share of really miserable nights, some of them my fault, some of them hers, but it was mostly a lot better. Her coming back for breaks also really helped. Now though, it's the summer before our Junior year, and another big shitty twist just happened.

She recently told me that pretty much since we got back together she felt like long distance wasn't sustainable and that none of this would ever work out. She said she regretted everything over winter break and what we did before she got together with the other guy. She even said she knew she was going to break up with me since before the semester ended and that she simply didn't know how. She also said that she just wants to be friends, but we can't even be in the same room anymore so that what happened over winter break doesn't happen again. I gave her a letter saying that I'm so sorry she's felt this way and that if there's anything I can possibly do to make things better and more sustainable that I would do it, she would just have to say the word. She read it, and without even thinking about it she got mad and told me to leave.

I don't know what to do anymore, I need advice. I need a way to stay with her. I know many of you may say that I should just leave (especially since she's cheated on me 1+ time(s)), but assuming that's not an option, what can I do? Please help me.",13Jun2020,1

100,"Recently I had a long talk with my sister about my brother who confessed to me he sometimes feels suicidal, she got really upset at me and told me I should’ve given him better advice or acted like I care about him. I really tried to show him I care and that I’m here for him but I have no idea how. However, that isn’t the point of this post but I feel like her reaction is worth mentioning. 
She pretty much started to rant about how he has no reason to be depressed because atleast he has something to his name (by something she really meant his degree). I told her that his feelings are still valid and he’s sensitive but she was so angry that he had the nerve to be depressed. This really hurt me because I’ve struggled with depression since I was 13 (I’m 19 now) but I realized how hurt she is. She has struggled with a drug addiction since we were in middle school and is now a pending felon. She got put on academic probation in college and then had to drop out afterwards. Now she’s living with my stepmom and working 7 days a week trying to pay for a lawyer. 
Growing up my brother was always the focus for our parents because he was the oldest and played sports. I’m the youngest child of our dad’s children, and he always stayed on me about my grades and set high expectations of me. Like I mentioned earlier, she has had a drug addiction since around 7th grade and everyone pretty much gave up on her. I felt like I tried my best to be there for her and help her, but she still felt/feels alone. Now she is going through a lot and I don’t know how to help her. She doesn’t trust me now because I wasn’t there for her when she needed me when we were younger.
I told her that I’m here for her and that if there is anything in my power that I can do to help her situation that I will, but that I won’t know if she doesn’t tell me. I always tell her that I care about her and want to see her succeed because I don’t think our parents gave her that enough when we were kids. 
All of this is a long winded way of asking, how can I help her feel not alone? Do you guys know any people with a felony that are happy and successful? What is some advice that I could give her that is actually helpful? She hasn’t officially been charged with a felony but she isn’t very hopeful and at all and thinks her life is over.

102,"Around 4-5 years ago my step dad passed and my mom had to rent rooms in our home for us to be able to live there. I often hung out with a guy that rented a room in our basement I guess because I was curious about him. Things were fine at first, but eventually he started calling himself my “big brother” and wanted me to lay in his bed by him and he made weird comments too about things. Like one day my friend and I were in his room talking to him and he mentioned how he wished we were older so we could play some sort of stripping game with him. I ignored how weird his comments were even when my friend told me that he was a perv. 
One day while my mom was out at work (she worked late at night until morning) I was in the living room watching a movie with him and he had his arm around me and was rubbing my side and stuff and I let him. He would ask me if i was going to tell my mom and i never even looked at him. I would just stare so hard at the tv and just let him touch me where ever he wanted to. I craved for the attention so much and anytime he stopped i felt just cold and lonely and would beg inside for him to touch me again. I don’t think i even cared how inappropriate it was, i just wanted to be touched ANYWHERE by someone. All i ever did during those times too was stare at the tv and be silent. He did it almost every night until one day he slapped my ass while i was trying to get laundry out of the washer and i snapped at him to stop. 
I feel disgusted at myself because I craved so much for it and i feel like I practically asked for it as I just let him continue doing it for so long. This whole thing has just fucked me up and i just don’t even know what to do about it. I never told anyone at the time and only a few close friends even know about it now. I want so badly to message him and ask him why he did those things to me, but i’m just so afraid to. I was only 12-13 year old at the time too and he’s like in his mid 20s-30s??

Hi, this is obviously a backup account. Also it is more rant than advice? Advice would be greatly appreciated, but I feel like I’m a total basket case here

   

I (16M) back before quarantine hit had been talking to a girl (16F) I really like for a few months, we were becoming friends and had done a few projects together + hanging out afterschool (we both did sports so we’d sometimes sit together waiting for them). Like she’s genuinely a great person and a good friend, and I had kept putting off asking her out because I was scared.

And then quarantine hit, and it all came crashing down. I have her on snap and insta, and we talk a little bit, but she doesn’t really talk much on there and for the most part it was 1-sided convos. Also her parents don’t let he stay up past 9 (Her parents are Ukrainian, they moved here when she was in 1st grade) &amp; don’t like her using her phone too much. I’ve been telling myself we weren’t having conversations like we did in person anymore because of those reasons (limited social media access and otherwise strict home-life). 

We haven’t talked in about 3 weeks now, and I am worried to message her again because it really feels like I’m forcing thongs. It’d be entirely bad to be like “how come you don’t talk as much online” or any less offensive version of that, and I feel like I’m just not letting myself recognize she saw me just as an acquaintance. We had pretty real chats irl, about parents &amp; school &amp; clubs/programs. She talked a lot about how restrictive her parents were, but it feels like a completely different ball-game now and I have no clue where I stand.

I’ve never really had a crush on anyone before, hell I literally have 3 real friends, and I have too much anxiety to even text them. Like I don’t know how to have a conversation not in person, and I think that’s a big part of my problem. I haven’t spoken like with voice to anyone since quarantine hit (like haven’t face timed anyone or zoomed with friends). 

Idk what to do and for the past few weeks I’ve been a hot mess as I’ve tried to make myself communicate with people and socialize, and it isn’t working, and then that confuses me even further over if my crush actually doesn’t like me or if I’m just a shit communicator over message",13Jun2020,2

111,"So I’m leaving as many specifics like names and ages out of this for confidentiality. 
About 4 years back my girlfriend and I set up both of our best friend up to start talking. 

(This is all coming from my gf’s friend)

Keep in mind her best friend and mine didn’t really know each other at the time. 
So we exchanged their numbers and introduced them. Things seemed to be working out at least to my knowledge. 
They set up their first time to talk in person and this was a few days after they met. It was at my best friends house (male) they met at the door and he showed her around his place then went to his bed room. 
Then things get bad he grabs her and kinda brings her to his bed. They then cuddle and he groped her with her being too uncomfortable to stop him he then Tried to take her pants off she redirects him and says no they kiss for awhile he then says “ I love eating pu**y, I could do it for hours” he tries to take her pants off again while she is telling him to stop, then she has to literally kick him in the chest to make him stop she then grabs her things and leaves. 

I am leaving out some details however this is primarily what happened. 

In my eyes my friend tried to rape her. 
I am completely torn on what I should do this information was told to my girlfriend and she was told not to tell me as he friend doesn’t want to hurt my friend and I’s relationship as we’ve been friends for many years before this incident. 

I’ve know for about 4 days and it’s all I can think about my girlfriend and I are so sorry for setting them up and I haven’t spoken to my friend yet as I can’t stand him after knowing this. Since this incident happens I am better friends with my girlfriend’s friend and I really want to apologize for what happened. But I no longer want to be friends with him.

That and he's a functioning alcoholic, I honestly can't remember the last time I had a sober conversation with him. So he started going out with some coworker and we ended up telling Y about it just because we didn't want her to like be trying to work on their issues and he still be going out and sleeping with other girls while she's doing what they had discussed and working on her side of the issues which are mostly like gut issues she has and finishing school.She ended up confronting D about it but he blatantly lied to her and said they just hung out and they were just friends.

  During that time my boyfriend my baby and I left to my moms to spend the week and we're damn certain he brought her over and didn't tell us anything even after we asked him.

I’m more of a feminine guy. I’m sad that society doesn’t accept me. But you may be saying: “But there’s people who do accept you!” That’s true, but not in the way I want it to be. It seems like all boys who are more feminine are constantly fetished, constantly seen as objects to be used instead of being treated like people. I know that other gay people won’t accept me for who I am and will instead fetishize me and assume that I’m obsessed with sex like them. They don’t want a relationship, they just want to use me.

While there may be some that are more into relationships and *actually* accepting me for who I am, it just seems like most gay people are sex-obsessed with a bunch of fetishes and just want to be used/use someone.

One of the games they play together is Minecraft which I don't own (apparently). There really wasn't much of a variety in the games we play together and Minecraft seems to be the perfect game for that. However, I also have my eyes set on a cheap graphic tablet (because I can't afford a more quality version yet and I want to practice my skill on digital art).

Also just to let you know the context of my friendship, I actually met them at one of my lowest moments. For a long time I was an outcast due to my uniqueness, so I never a friend group of my own. I then got invited into a reunion GC in Messenger where my old friends/classmates would catch up and I realized that the old friends that I had grew up to be different people from how I knew them that they felt alien to me (if not, then it probably took me this long to realize they aren't for me), then my last bastion one of (if not the greatest) best friend I had just ghosted me. So the fact that these guys fully welcomed me and even considered me a best friend already healed me so much and filled a gap in my longing heart.

Now with that said, I'm in a conundrum where I can't decide if I'd get this thing where it would benefit me and my friends and allow us to share wonderful moments (and have a new game to play on top of that) or another thing that'll hone my skill and give me more opportunities later on in the future (and I could also use to bring joy to others, like my friends).",13Jun2020,1
131,"I’m male(16) My girlfriend(17) broke up with me in September; I really liked her. She wasn’t the most attractive girl, but I consider myself rather sapiosexual and I found extreme attraction to that. She lives in Manhattan, New York City, recently got into Colombia university and got free tuition because her mother works there. My dream has always been to move to Manhattan one day and I feel like she’s blocking my goal as I’m moving closer to her, but I want to distance myself from her too! I still feel like I think about her often and all the success she has and I think wow, I really missed out on her.  I’m trying hard but all I do is ponder on the times we had together. All the Central Park walks or pretending to be at the movies for our parents, but really we were making out in her apartment. Those moments stick with me and make me sad I’m missing out now.

132,"To start: I’m 17F (nearly 18) and will be a senior in high school come August. I will have 2 classes and will be leaving very early in the day. 

I’ve had my permit for about 3 years now. When quarantine started, I actually driving because my parents have been forcing me. I’m able to stay calm behind the wheel but as soon as I finish driving I’m overwhelmed with such bad anxiety. I feel like I can’t breathe or walk, I start shaking. I hate it. If I know I will be driving later in the day, it also happens. Right before driving I will be sweating profusely and my chest starts beating.

I absolutely do NOT want to drive. I’m perfectly fine having a full schedule and riding the bus home. My parents refuse to let me do that. They do NOT understand how hard it is for me to get behind the wheel. It’s so draining and exhausting for me. It hasn’t gotten better over time, nor has it gotten easier.

The actual fear I have is hurting someone else. I don’t care about what happens to me or my car, I just truly don’t want to be responsible for hurting anyone. 

They are expecting me to get a job and go to school, totally not an issue. I’d love to work.

139,"Throwaway as my friends use Reddit. 

Hi r/advice, please hear me out on this. 

A friend of a friend of mine couldn’t keep their 4 month old kitten for the summer due to changes in their living arrangement, and this mutual friend connected us, as they knew I’d grown up with cats. 

Since getting the kitten at the end of April, I’ve come to love her so much - I *totally* did not expect this when I agreed to care for her, as I wasn’t hugely attached to the cats in my childhood home. I think a big part of it has been that I’ve been working from home for the entire time, and thus we spend every hour together. She is extremely loving and clingy, and we are always close to each other, snuggling or playing. 

I want to ask the owner if they would be willing to let me buy the kitten off them. I understand that I have no right to the kitten, but I hope that, because by the end of the summer, I will have spent 4 months with them versus 2 with the original owner, they may be willing to part with them. The owner does not check in very often, and I am not being compensated for my services, so there’s no re-negging on compensation to consider. I am willing to pay the owner $1,800, or buy them a new kitten. 

I’d like to ask your advice about how to approach this situation. I want to clarify that I do not by any stretch feel that I’m entitled to keep the kitten, I just want advice on the best way to ask. 

TL;DR - unexpectedly became extremely connected to a kitten I’m watching for the summer. How can I ask the owner to let me buy the kitten off them?",13Jun2020,3

My parents usually fight and have been recently been trying to stay apart from eachother but it has never been a huge matter, or so I thought. My dad came to me today and asked to talk to him in the garage, my mom and my dad told me that they were going to separate and that one of them would be moving out shortly. This was really shocking and I had no clue how to feel so I just sat there staring at the floor while they spoke. I didn’t listen to a word they said, all I knew was that they were getting a divorce.

145,"Made a throwaway account, I think if anyone reads this it'll be clear why. I'm mostly just embarrassed tbh. Sorry if this is jumping all over the place.

So, I already know that this will come across as a spoiled or privileged, for lack of a better term, first world problem, but if there's anyone that can offer advice, I'd appreciate it. 

So, my immediate family, there's four of us (I'm the youngest 24m), is in a position where we can afford to take a vacation in the Caribbean islands. Sounds pretty sweet right? I should be excited to go. There are two main reasons I'm not and this is probably what makes me a shitty person, idk. 

First reason, which is legitimate, is that I was just recently able to start my job after all this covid stuff and I've only been there for about two weeks now. Basically, in order to go on the trip, I'd need to request time off (like a whole 10 days) which would be shitty considering we all just started back up and each one of us is important to the job (not gonna go into the details of my job, but suffice to say I'm expected/needed there). I don't want to do this to my coworkers. They don't deserve to be left hanging literally as soon as we started back up. 

I guess the second reason is emotional. I'm not gonna go into great detail, but I'll just say that the real reason my parents want to go on this trip is because they want to use it as a means to bond with their children before it's too late and they grow up forever. Heavy empty nest syndrome from both parents. But here's the thing, we are already grown up and have lives to live. It's literally impacting my job and relationship with my boss basically to please my parents. Does that make me a shitty person for thinking that? idk.

Here's the real dilemma, the trip is already booked and I already told my family I can go. That was before I thought I would get my job back so quickly. I seriously thought it would be much longer before things returned to normal. I also seriously thought the trip would get postponed or refunded or something because of covid/international flights. So jokes on me, I tried to please everyone assuming neither would happen at the time that they did. 

So my dilemma, what should I even do? How do I tell my boss I have a tripped already planned without damaging my reputation and without telling her it's to go on a fucking 10 day caribbean vacation. This problem is so ridiculous I can't wrap my head around it.",13Jun2020,1

I play in a small DIY band called ORange Peel. We’re from Sacramento county and now that things are opening up again, we’re trying to figure out how we want to do our “comeback” show. 

We found this abandoned military munitions base (heavily graffitied, has been abandoned for the last 20-30 years, roughly 3 acres) that would be almost perfect for playing a show. 

My question is, how much trouble, if any, would we be in for playing this show? I know technically it’s trespassing, but the place has been abandoned for more than 20 years.

I’m 17, I’m a guy, I’ve never been in a relationship, and one of the reasons for that is because I have a terrible fear of being cheated on. I don’t know why but I just feel like it’s bound to happen to me, no matter what I do. I get anxious about it now and then and I get pissed off thinking about it. (ok now it gets a bit strange) I’ve even thought of cheating on my partner (if ever even get one) as a “preventive measure” so that when they cheat on me it’s not as nearly as humiliating. If I ever get cheated on I feel like the only way of getting rid of that burden is to commit suicide or isolate myself from society. I really don’t understand why I’m so afraid of this, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me, physically or psychologically, I think that I’m fairly attractive (at least I like to believe that) and I have a normal social life.

let’s call my friend ‘fred’
so backstory: me (F) and fred (M) have been friends since kindergarten, and he’s helped me a lot through the years finding friends, giving advice, etc. 
the thing is : he is goddamn manipulative. usually not to me, but he tells me everything he does to his friends/girlfriends and it’s terrible. fred literally has the power to ruin relationships and fred’s done it plenty of times before, in order to get the guy to be his friend or smth like that.
so... fred actually did it to me and my ex, who had a really good relationship and manipulated me cutting this guy off cold turkey, ruining our chances of being friends after our breakup. 
I’ve begun to hang out with this girl who seems to like me as a friend and i like her as a friend too. keep in mind this is a pretty big deal for me cuz i don’t have many friends. the only thing is, fred’s really close with this girl too. i’m scsred if i get close to her, he’ll ruin our friendship too, and i’m left with no one, again. what the fuck in gods name do i do?

note : i can’t cut him off completely because all our friends r friends with each other, we hang in the same group of friends, it’s just way too difficult to not be friends with him. fred can literally ruin lives and i’ve told him so much about my life and what i think abt our friends and he will actually ruin me i’m so scared",13Jun2020,1

159,"My boyfriend and I had to put our beloved dog down last week. She was 6 and a half years old and such a sweet loving little weirdo that made bad days better and good days great. In August of last year the vet discovered she had lymphoma. 

With the treatment course we settled on, Zoey's prognosis was onky a few months. So to an extent we knew the day was coming, especially because she ended up out living the prognosis by several months. Her wellbeing tanked within a day so the decision to put her down came very suddenly and at the gentle guidance of our vet. 

It has been about a week and a half since we had to say goodbye and I have been dealing with a lot of symptoms of anxiety (trouble sleeping, upset stomach, general nerves) which have been exacerbated by coping with my heartbreak. The most difficult issue I've been having is a complete lack of appetite, at times a total revulsion of food. I have never experienced this outside of dealing with stomach flu. I've been forcing myself to eat what I can tolerate but it has been a struggle and I am worried about my health going forward if this continues. 

Have any if you experienced this, whether or not it was after a loss? How did you deal with it and how long did it last before your appetite went back to normal? I guess maybe more than anything I am just looking for reassurance but also advice on the best things to try to eat to maintain a healthy caloric intake and enough nutrients.

What happened in the US was so incredibly heartbreaking, but as a white person who has never experienced racism I don’t feel fully equipped to explain it.. I wanted her to know that what happened was so terribly wrong, and isn’t it amazing that the whole world stood up to say the system needs to change. But the more I said the more she hurt.. what did they do to him mummy? Why did they think he was a such a bad guy that they didn’t let him explain himself? Was it only because he was brown?

Then I went home for the winter break and things were ok at first. They seemed to genuinely miss me, but then everything started back up again like it had before I left for school. I almost had a breakdown because I had become so accustomed to being cared for and not abused. I went back to school and started to feel happy again. And then covid happened. 

Initially I was able to stay at my Aunts house for the duration which was good. But I have now returned home and this time there was not even an inkling of them missing me. (Except for my dad who is alright sometimes I honestly think he lashes out because he is disabled so I often forgive him). I have often gotten into arguments with my parents but now I have just stopped. I don't even feel angry anymore.

 I am usually an avid gamer and yesterday I couldn't bring myself to play anything. I have nothing new to read, I feel uninterested in doing anything. I have been blowing off my friends because I just feel like laying down in bed all day so I can sleep and make august come sooner so I can be where I feel good again. I am constantly forced to do chores which leaves me little time to text my girlfriend and she is feeling neglected which at first made me feel horrible but now I am just numb to it along with every other bad thing happening in my life right now. I know this seems dramatic and I couldn't really explain myself well enough in text format. But idk what to do with myself. I just feel totally apathetic towards everything and everyone in my life right now. I feel empty I guess is the best way to explain it. I appreciate any advice you feel will help.",13Jun2020,1
178,"I (26f) have a fiance (36m) of eight years and a 5 year old daughter. I am white and he is black. We both work two jobs each and just bought our first home. 

Background info:
-My sister has two kids and announced she's done having kids....my grandparents were LIVID. She's two years older than me and married.
-My grandparents are very religious and believe you need to be married before living with each other. 
-Our daughter is very light skinned and I can't help but to think if she was a darker complexion then my grandparents would treat her differently. 
-When my grandparents first found out about my fiance they said that dating a black man was ""just a phase"" for me. 
-I am the only family member left in the state to ""check up"" on my grandparents. 

Story:
I went over my grandparents by myself for the first time in a while since this Covid-19 stuff. While I was over there, my grandmother and I were alone and she begins telling me how she feels about the protests and ""all lives matter"". I quickly changed the subject to the positives that have come from the protests. Then, I changed the subject completely when she wouldn't let up. There's no changing their beliefs at 75+ years of age so I don't even bother. 

A few minutes later, my grandfather joins us and says ""so your mom told us that your IUD is no longer in"". 😳 I'm dumbfounded and look at my grandmother like wtf but she just looks back at me like 'explanation please'. They both said I cannot even take care of the child I have now so I absolutely don't need another. They questioned me about birth control and what I've been doing to prevent pregnancy. They even offered to pay for birth control! When I declined that offer, my grandfather said ""well...just...just stay away from (fiance)"". I was so mad that I said none of that is any of their business and left soon after. There was even some mention of an abortion or having to avoid having to have an abortion if I didn't use protection... I was so mad I don't remember exactly they said about that.

I have not told anyone that my fiance and I are actually trying for another child.

I can't help but think that this all has something to do with my fiancé's ethnicity AND us not being married (I could care less about that piece of paper). 

I'm kind of over trying to be civil with my grandparents. They're fucking rude and they don't even know it. I'm too nice to cuss out some old people or stand up to an elder. Should I be mad at my mom too for telling them about my vaginal health?! I'm at a loss on what to do. I have a ""cut them off"" attitude right now, but then I remember that they'll probably be dead in the next 5 years...ADVICE?!",13Jun2020,1
179," It was the ultimate betrayal. I cared for this girl, I invited her into my home and into my life wholeheartedly. I did so much for her and really loved her.

My bf was my first true love. It was intense and we were planning a future together, to move in together, marry. After I figured out about the infidelity, I ended things with my ex and I read the texts between him and my friend that had gone on the entirety of my relationship.

They were flirting behind my back, talking about genitalia days before Valentines' day, revelling behind my back that I knew nothing.

To this very minute, almost a year after I found out, I still feel this burning hatred towards her that I can't seem to really quench. I cry, I'm still traumatised and I want to bash her face in.

I managed to end things, and find peace in letting go of my hatred for my ex but for some reason, her name and face still haunt me in my dreams.

184," 

Right ladies and gents, first time posting no idea if it's in the right area, etc, etc.

but here is my deal.

So we have 3 main people in this story, yours truly, Ross and Rachel we have all been friends since like 2 there is literally baby pictures of the 3 of us holding hands learning to walk together, So Ross started dating Rachel when we were like 11, I'm 22 Ross is 24 and Rachel is 25 (not real names in case anyone is wondering yes the last sitcom I watched was friends) So unknown to Rachel Ross is about to propose to her, he has his full setup on, car, a good job has been saving up or the ring since he was 18 nothing wrong with Ross the man is a legend, So now we get to the crux of the subject after the back story, and before we begin to insert I have a girlfriend too. but to begin, Rachel has always been flirty with me, call me the work husband the guy she would come to when she wanted to bitch about Ross or her dreams or whatever else she didn't want to tell her girlfriends or she would be crucified. and that was fine with me many years of the same practice, but onto the incident, I have cooked every Friday for this pair and anyone else that showed up since we were old enough to move out together. and this one particular night when the coast was clear, and I was out for a cigarette she essentially came out dropped my pants and ( insert your imagination here) for all of about 2 seconds before I dunno politely refused, the girl my best friend was going out with since birth, with him in the room with all our friends, even if it was my thing to do that, could you ask for a shorter rope and a taller tree, So I said no, forget it never happened let's go have a drink eat some food and leave it at that. cool, I thought.

4 days later out of guilt or something, I have no logic or reasoning to offer here.

but she decided to tell my best friend since birth that we had slept together, and I know what you're saying warframe3464 you were holding hands with your friend while they cut the cord, even if they were going out for so long why would he not question that? well the answer is simple my random strangers I will call my friends for this post, she turned it on, bursting out tears, begging for forgiveness making excuses its because warframe and i were so close for so many years, it was just stupid feelings but I really love you. my god ladies and gents I nearly believed I was a scumbag, and my friend's reaction? well, I haven't actually spoken to him he walked up to me in the middle of our local and just bust my nose I fully accept it a complete sucker punch I got caught. all this transpired after this btw, but now neither of them are picking up phone calls or texts and I am the town dirtbag, So my question to you random stranger is how the polite word, do I resolve this, and if one more person tells me to sue either of them, I'm going to kidnap your hamster.

191,"My Sister is 14 years old and she is the 2nd youngest amongst my Sisters. We have a very long history of fights and arguments to the point she threatened to ""Kill Me"" 

Background on how we grew up, We are from The Philippines we grew up in a very dysfunctional family... I and My Sister grew up in a household where we see 

• Our Dad violently beating our Biological Mom
• Shouting every night
• Mom and Dad Arguing and Cursing at each other
• My Parents pulled a Knife to each other
• My Dad would get very violent
• My Dad Punching my Half-Sister
• My Mom had a Sex Tape released because she had an affair
• Which Made my Dad furious

This all stopped when they filed for annulment when  I was 7 and my Sister on 5. We moved to another province with my Single Mom and lived there... My Mom couldn't afford to raise us and gave us to our Dad.

My Mom abandoned us and went to the Middle East and we haven't seen her since. And when we're with our Dad my Sister hates my Dad.

Fast forward (I'm now 16 and my Sister is now 14)

We moved to Alaska and started a new life here...

My Dad told us that we can't contact our Biological Mom. honestly, I was mad at first but I don't care anymore about my parents.

After all of that, I chose to forgive but never forget. Sure I still have a lot of anger to my Dad and my Mom but I won't hold a grudge and I just want to finish my education and focus more on improving and pursuing myself. I don't want to hold on too much of the past. I do have very bad anxiety and depression and tendencies of taking my own life. Nobody knows about this.

But My Sister. She holds a very deep grudge and doesn't love my Dad and she still dwells into the past. I told her to get therapy and seek help for trauma because she might be suffering from PTSD. But she got mad at me because she thought I was telling her that she's crazy ...

Growing up she becomes more &amp; more aggressive, distant, sensitive, and defensive. Every time I would talk to her we would end up arguing and she always brings up our Biological Mom who abandoned us.

My Stepmom didn't help either, my stepmom is kind of a b*tch... She is very strict and she doesn't have a sense of privacy for us... She would check our phones if we ever contact our Biological Mom.

My aunts, grandmothers, cousins, and siblings are very against my Dad and Stepmom. But they can't do much of it.

My Sister is also being brainwashed by my relatives like doing shit like drinking Alcohol or whatever... And they would encourage her to act shit like don't come to us in dinner, she would not talk to any of us, she would be mad at our dad, shouting at my stepmom, etc.

My Relatives also encouraged me the same but I refused to act like a child because doing those things would just add more problems. They called me Weak and a Scaredy Cat but I just don't want to be involved in issues anymore.

My Sister is still brainwashed, abusive, and very violent... She would curse at me... And I'm just very worried about her future and She will not change.. What do I do?",13Jun2020,1

197,"These are usually the same ones who accuse me of being too quiet. My bf says that I do not try, but when I do this always happens. 

This is not just one or two times, but almost every time. I do not know what I am doing wrong, but it really affects my self worth, especially when it takes a lot to speak up. 

The fact that my efforts are not recognized is even more disheartening. When I talk it isn’t meaningless ramble, but usually getting to know the other person or relating to them. 

His parents say I am quiet and have been kind of had judgements about it. But any time I tried to speak up they would interrupt or talk non stop about themselves for extended time. I usually don’t mind because I do not like the spotlight, but is everyone like this? 

His friends say I am standoffish but are the same. Usually I go unacknowledged, even if I try. What am I doing wrong and how can I be better? 

I am starting to think it is all my fault or that there is something very wrong with me. I was raised in such a way that my voice never had mattered and I do not really have any friends of my own, but I really do try. 

I have known and been with him since dec 2018 and it has been the same in his crowd the whole time. 
It 
has also been that way in past encounters before him. I will say I am awkward, but I can’t imagine doing that to someone. Even if I am not interested, I try being polite. 

Most of his friends are outgoing types and I am the opposite. But I really try... then when I stay quiet I get accused of being standoffish. This is effecting my self esteem so much. 

Come to think of it, no one has ever really cared when I speak.

201,"TL;DR- Seeking advice on relief for localized pain in jaw. Pain meds don't help, and I am hoping to find a drug-free solution to help me out until I can get to the dentist. 

I have had this super persistent localized pain in my [23F] jaw for at least 3 years now. It's exactly where one of my wisdom teeth used to be that I had removed a few years back. Since then every couple of weeks, for a period of a few days to a week, I have super deep pain in my jawbone right where that tooth was, that comes and goes in waves all day. 

Ibuprofen doesn't touch it, and I'm severely allergic to Tylenol. I'm pretty confident it isn't a TMJ problem as I have no pain in the joint or any other symptoms of TMJ issues. It's extremely localized and there is no swelling or inflammation in the gums. No pain in the closest tooth. Super weird. 

I have a dentist appointment  in a week to get x-rays for the first time since I got my wisdom teeth removed (I haven't had dental insurance and couldn't afford any extra visits) to hopefully see if there's anything causing this. 

In the meantime, I'm so fed up with this keeping me up at night and causing me so much pain. After several hours of pain in my jaw it starts to radiate to my whole head and cause a tension headache. The only brief moments of relief I can get are if I'm eating something cold (like I was eating refrigerated watermelon today that helped a ton) or holding something warm up to my face (like a heat pack or taking a hot shower.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for help with deep localized pain like this?? As mentioned, I'm allergic to Tylenol, but I can take Ibuprofen and that didn't help at all. For context I don't drink or do any drugs (including marijuana) and I need to be able to work on my feet all day as a hairdresser, so I can't really seek out any stronger pain meds at the moment.

Hi all, heads up this will probably be a long post.

I need some advice. I’m a first year university student currently studying architecture. Upon graduating high school, I wasn’t sure of what to do and architecture was recommended to me so I went with it. Although there are some aspects of it I enjoy- I’m not sure if it’s really for me, as it’s not something I’m passionate about. I considered doing an animation and game design course before, however, I feel that there aren’t many job opportunities or demand for the game industry where I live (Western Australia). On top of this, I come from a household that values practicality and security over personal interests and passion etc. 
The reason why I’m still pursuing architecture is because I feel that it is more likely to secure me a job and because my parents approve of it. However, I feel that if I continue through until the end, I might regret it, and I really don’t want to waste any time. My parents think that it will be difficult for me to find and job and earn income from it if I do anything games or art related, and I can understand where they’re coming from. 

To me, it’s not as simple as “following your dreams”. Like I said, I come from a household that values financial stability and security over personal interests and preferences. So it’s extremely difficult for me to go against my parents wishes :/ .

I know that at the end of the day, these are decisions I have to make myself. It’s my own life and responsibility, but I’m super stressed out as I’ve always been indecisive. Any advice/opinions and thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Moving around to find employment isn’t really an option

Edit 2: I was considering doing graphic design too or digital experience and interaction design. If someone could tell me what the career prospect / demand is like for these two majors in Australia, I’d appreciate it.",13Jun2020,1
205," I know my mom is cheating on my dad. (She admitted it to me one day after I asked her why she was going out so much at night and I saw it on her phone.)She’s cheating but my dad is abusive so I’m in this weird mindset where I don’t know what to think of either of them or what to do. I learned about his abusive behavior and the cheating at around the same time. 

Their marriage was always messed up as my mom accidentally got pregnant at 18 with me and my dad decided to get married to her right then, even though they were only dating before for about 4 months. (My mom has told me that if she hadn’t gotten pregnant she would have married someone else)This led to a lot of family problems on both sides and more strain. They have fought and argued almost every day for as long as I can remember. I knew he had a temper but it was only until recently I found out he actually hit her sometimes. He’s extremely controlling and doesn't want her going out AT ALL and gets mad when she talks to friends or anyone besides him or me.

He supports the family and has always treated me relatively well but my mom doesn’t love him. She doesn’t want to divorce him because he handles all the money and she’s scared he’s going to take every thing away from her if she leaves.  (He’s threatened her to take away everything, including me, and leave her with nothing) so I’m guessing that’s another reason why she decided to cheat.  She admitted she only likes his body and money at this point. She’s just not happy with my dad. 

I’m under the age of 18 so I thought that I should just mind my business and this has nothing to do with me but it’s causing me immense pain and distress knowing these two things about both of my parents. I try to play it off like nothing’s wrong but it’s always in the back of my head, especially when their both around. My image of both of them is ruined and it’s eating me up. I have no one to talk to about this as I have no siblings or friends who have experience on this type of thing, I really don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t know if anyone can really give me advice for this but it’s worth a shot.",13Jun2020,2

I want to be able to educate my parents and hold them accountable with the same standards and values they raised me with. First I must educate myself.

There is more racism festering and I have to at least try to make a difference. 

Can someone provide any guidance or advice to get myself from point A to point B? What are the best news sources? What is good practice when reading or absorbing news?

217,"Someone who I think (thought?) of as a mentor who is about 10 years older than me. I really admire (admired?) her as she was strong and brave and had over come many things and felt like someone I could trust and go to with issues. She has similar interests and she's achieved a lot of my goals and really helps me get there.

But here's the issue. Someone anonymously forwarded me a hardcore BDSM porno of her. I feel bad saying this but it was like a car crash I couldn't help but look away.

She was all tied up and doing the whole ultra sexual talk thing and it was just the hardest core BDSM you can think of. Crying and all. She even had to piss on her own face. And then the afterwards interview part came and she was raving about how much she loved it and graphically described her favorite parts and.... god it just kinda broke me.

worst part is that because of her haircut, it had to be only last year. We've been close for 3.

I again feel bad that I watched it. I was just skipping through it for several minutes. I was shocked.

She doesn't know I know. But I seriously feel so weird now. Idk what to do. Any suggestions???

Edit: I'll confirm part of why I'm so scarred is because of major sexual trauma I have in my past

Edit: I also just sent the link by the same dude to another video. similar, but she talks about how she was a ""collared slave"" for 6 months ""a couple years ago"" so most likely before we met. I only watched the intro this time to check if it was rly her again. i know i shouldn't have. i blocked the account. im in total crisis rn.",13Jun2020,1
218,"First time posting sorry if it’s a bit incoherent. Okay M22 here and either I’m going crazy or I’m living with people that are. 

So I live with my uncle, aunt and grandfather (been living with them since 10th grade). I’m not allowed to stay out later than 10ish and if I do I get the silent treatment for like a week or two and some passive aggressive BS. I had a very rough childhood/life in general (dad died, estranged from my mom and little sister cause they couldn’t make it to the US) so I’m grateful for them opening their home to me but this is ridiculous. 

My uncle is paranoid beyond words. His explanation is avoid any risk as much as you can. So if I want to stay out late I’m “risking” getting hit by a drunk driver cause it’s more likely or more bad things happen at night (we live in a safe suburbs of Texas). Their excuse is “all you need is family”. THEY’RE ALL OVER TWICE MY AGE. I just want to hangout with friends and have some friendships like a normal person. It’s taking a toll on my mental health. It’s like the only love they know is the codependent and clingy kind of love. Very toxic. When I try to use logic and try my best to do dw respectfully they guilt trip me and call me selfish for “risking my safety”. I know you’ll ask why don’t you move out? Well I’ve tried talking about it but they always go off and start with the selfish and immature (can you believe it immature ?) and just try to convince me to stay.  I’m 2yrs away from graduating college so idk what I should I do. 

If I move out I feel like I’m just trading one stress for another because it’ll be financially hard since I don’t have any savings. Also idk if they’ll cut me off cause they pay for my phone bill and healthcare. I’m conflicted and any help of advice would help. Thanks.",13Jun2020,2
219,"First I wanna thank everyone reading this and I hope some of you can help me help my friend in need.

Here's the thing.. Last week my friend was in a job interview across the city from where he lives and he bought a bus ticket on his phone to get from his house to the company for an interview. Few hours later, after the interview, he realized he didn't have any money and decided to do something dumb. He simply sent the SMS phone ticket he bought earlier and changed the time so it matches current time and therefore making the ticket legit for travel in the bus.

While in the bus, he got caught by the employees that occasionally check for people's tickets and they figured he edited the ticket and called the Police. Police came, asked questions and ended up putting handcuffs on my friend, and took him to the police station where they stripped and searched him completely naked and put him in a detention cell ( a cold room with a bench and nothing else. Like a isolated concentration camp room.

Hours later, and multiple crying from my friend that he was scared, had anxiety and panic attacks they ignored, the cops that arrested him, came in , took his DNA from his mouth with swab, multiple fingerprints and pictures of him, his height / weight. Meanwhile they were informing him how the document forging (editing bus ticket) and FRAUD is what he will be sentenced to and COULD possibly go in prison for UP to 8 years as those offenses are very punishable by law. (Fraud and Document forging)

They gave him his phone and wallet back they took before putting him in the cell for hours and told him he should find a job as it is suspicious how he can have nice clothes but no income. Anyway, he was released and is now awaiting trial and court. Police told him he will wait about 8-12 months before he gets called in court.

TL:DR My friend wants to kill himself now as he is convinced his DNA, fingerprints and criminal record will haunt him till he dies and any possible future where he could be wrongly accused of a crime he never did but his DNA was randomly found. Example; He have sex with a girl and she claim rape, his DNA would be found and life destroyed.. just to mention one of many possibilities of what DNA can do.

How do I help my friend? Simple as that... How? In the bottom of my heart I agree with him and I know he is right but I kept lying to him and I know he knows its bullshit. We are childhood friends.",13Jun2020,3

Everyone in my state has been going back and she’s posted photos of the office and how’s she’s getting it ready to open (posted these 2 weeks ago) yet I haven’t gotten a call...I’m an admin and I noticed she recently removed my admin permissions on the business Facebook page but kept me in the business’ secret page. She also deleted my roster code and time clock credentials but still no call about it. My fiancé says she did that because she was supposed to in March when she laid me off and probably just now realized it but I don’t buy it. Out of curiosity, I began perusing the job boards to get my name out there and found a really great position. I applied and got an interview. My question is, when (if) they ask if I need to give a two weeks to start, should I say yes? My employer technically said she would bring me back and although she hasn’t called I don’t want to burn any bridges by just up and quitting. I also don’t want to look like someone who just leaves without a 2 weeks to the interviewers. What do you all think? Thanks! :)",13Jun2020,1

I’m just mentally wrecked. I was bullied in preschool, elementary school, and high school. I think about the past and just get anxious and enraged. I try to let it go but I just can’t. I’ve failed a lot of dreams and I’m not doing as well as I should have in school now and even though I’m pushing myself, I’m on scholarship probation. I see other people doing the things I wanted to do and I just get jealous. In terms of the bullying, I try to just let it go, but the sheer lack of respect I suffered I can’t get over. People intentionally tried to get a reaction out of me. I try to just let it go but I know deep down I want those people to suffer horribly by my hands. I know some of y’all will say “those people are different now and they’re not doing anything to you now, you’re doing this to yourself” and I hear you but that’s not doing anything for me. Ive been constantly trying to just be nice and let things go but I wish I had just let loose and beat one of their faces in. People just don’t understand that I want these people dead. Only the apparent wrongness of killing people is what keeps me from doing it. I’m always amped up on adrenaline and I’m jittery and my heart is beating fast. This happens at least once a day. Everyday I can call back to something that gets me like this, and I can’t help but remember it all. I just want these people to suffer. People never apologized. They don’t understand the shit they put me through. I run through scenarios in my head of hurting these people everyday. I just have so much hate, I try to act chill as if I’m not affected but in reality I want to see them burn. Whenever the shit comes to mind it just sucks all the enjoyment out of what I was doing. I was just trying to do some physics problems but I literally couldn’t concentrate and keep my pencil still. Can someone give me some advice?

EDIT: another thing that disturbs me that is sort of ongoing is the fact that I once got my tooth knocked out in a fight with a crazy guy who harassed me, my little brother, and my friend on the bus for 20 minutes when we were 16. The bus driver just sat and watched while he brutally -and loudly berated and threatened to kill us for no reason. He spat on my brother as he was walking off the bus and I jumped back on the bus and started beating his ass, but as I came to him he hit me with a baton he was holding, knocking one tooth clean out and breaking another. My parents sued the transportation company and the state for not giving me money for the victims assistance program, and the lawyers tried to frame me as the bad guy. It really infuriates me that my integrity is at question there. I wasn’t looking for trouble, we were just on our way to the gym to play basketball.",13Jun2020,6

Ever since I moved to college, I've been trying to make better friends but everyone has gotten busy with their own studies and their own friends and plans. Even though I'm a part of a friend's group we have, I am not a person anyone bothers to check up on, no one messaged me first, no one asks me to meetup for dinner (unless it's the entire group). I'm the last person to find out about a piece of news literally EVERYONE knows. I'm not a person they want to talk to first. I understand that they have their own lives and priorities, but I feel like it doesn't really matter if I exist or not. 
I keep trying to reach out and meet with them but they're too in bed with their own lives. I don't blame them, I know they're busy or have their own people and plans. But I don't know how to make myself matter more, I wish I could be someone people would get excited to talk to or hang out with.

 I think that my folks may have a small suspicion that im gay and I dont want them to think that. The reasoning i have for thinking this is cuz I wanted to watch some movie about someone gay cuz it has a decent plot(this caused one of them to be annoyed I wanted to watch a ""gay movie"") and i have a friend who they think is gay and I hang out with him a lot cuz we both like video games and I dont have the money to get a console or computer myself. He has a bunch of things like a Nintendo switch a PlayStation 3 and 4 a playstation VR and a decent computer.
And also i dont ""use"" him for these things we mostly just play fortnite (me on switch him on PlayStation) or I play farming simulator on his playstation while he shows me movies or shows that he likes and wants to show me. No its not a ""netflix and chill"" kinda thing, I just never watched movies and things when I was younger I am more the country outdoors kind of person. Anyways im getting off track. When i go to his house it is for an extended period and I mostly end up spending the night cuz hes the only friend i got in this quarentine s*** and i dont like being stuck at my house in the middle of bfe so thats where i go to chill and play video games and stuff. And to top off the last perfect f***ing detail... I havnt showed any interest in girls and stuff cuz when I talk abt anything like that it gets all awkward and quiet so I just dont.

This person manipulative, a liar, and does not take responsibility for their mistakes; they are someone that  never finds fault at what they do, and will source a Biblical reason to defend their decisions, actions, and reasoning. They are abrasive when confronted, and will attack you personally.

How do I vicariously tell this person to ""fuck off"", but in a manner that is not overtly confrontational? In other words, how can I tell this person to leave me alone, in a way that they will come to realise as a ""fair"" reason to agree with, and not attack me for.

238,"I am a 22 year old male looking for advice on how to move forward regarding cutting off a friend of several years.

I met this person in my freshmen year of college and we have been in the same classes ever since then. Over the years we have developed a close relationship. We stuck together and helped each other get through the toughest classes and times. I would have never imagined we would end up drifting apart.

It all started when we were studying together during finals week. We came into a disagreement over a course assignment under which I believe was a misunderstanding. This ended with him yelling at me and accusing me of copying his assignment. I was in return mad at him because he had yelled at me in front of other people. I told myself at that point I would never speak to him again until he apologized. Later that day, I spoke with my other friends about the situation and they recommended me to just apologize and move on. The next day I decided to apologize and we shook hands and left it behind us. I thought that since we were friends for so long we could just forgive and forget. (He did not apologize)

The following semester when we saw each other,    the energy was tense and I knew he had not forgiven me. Every time I would see him, I would try to start a conversation but I could tell he didn’t want to speak to me. I spoke to friends of our group and they told me that we had some kind of “beef”. I felt like a fool for apologizing and at the same time I was furious.

I decided to cut him off completely. It has been a few months and I still can’t seem to forget about my former classmate/friend. It is very difficult cutting off somebody you see everyday especially in class. A large majority of our classes are small and we often end up seeing each other. To make matters worse, I have been distancing myself from our group. I felt that hanging out with our group would just bring back bad memories. I have made some new friends but have been cautioning myself to get close to them because of what has happened. It has been a few months since the incident and I can’t seem to forget about what we once had. Sometimes I can’t help but feel so alone.

So my cousin, who is 15 and we’ll call Max, is currently the victim of harassment and cyberbullying. It all stems from one girl, who we’ll call Gia. Gia has come out recently and said that she just doesn’t like him. That really isn’t an issue as Max doesn’t like her either. Unfortunately all of Max’s friends have basically backstabbed him and taken the side of this girl who has made fun of him and his family, created a snapchat account where she’s been posting embarrassing pictures of him, slashing the tires in his bike and manipulated his friends into joining her in the cyberbullying. 

This may not seem like a big issue to many but the way Max has talked to me about it leads me to believe that this has causing him to become really depressed. He made it very clear that he doesn’t want his parents to get involved and he feels very uncomfortable with me talking about it here. He doesn’t use reddit so he’s very skeptical and anxious. I’ve talked to multiple friends of mine asking for advice and they’ve all basically said the same thing. Cut ties and get new friends. It’s what I told him but he still feels completely helpless and just wants to go back to hanging out with the friends that have caused all of this shit.

240,"Hello Reddit,

I am currently 17 years of age and live a double life. I fake almost all interactions with family, friends, and strangers to fit in more so i don’t look like an outcast loner. I remember doing this for as long as I can remember. I have never really felt “sad” or “happy” - just a constant blank emotion that I carry with me everywhere I go (unless i have to interact with others).

Loneliness has never bothered me nor made me feel anything different. I spend most of my time by myself and occasionally hang out with “friends” to avoid suspicion. I have never told anyone about the way I am and are afraid to be looked upon different if they knew the truth about me. 

The advice i am searching for is if anyone feels the same and if so what remedies have you done? Also what can I do to try and reverse the way I am (if that makes sense).

Due to an incident in 2018 and going through mental torture for 2 more years, I have lost all ability to feel emotion towards most people. I have tried to stop being this way, but nothing works. I tend to use people to my own advantage and go in and out of relationships with multiple different people. I was able to sort of stop the flirting in late 2019, but since quarentine has started the flirting has begun again. I never like anyone I'm with and I use them just to feel validated or to become more popular. 
I don't know how to feel about the way that I am. Sometimes I feel accomplished for being able to manipulate people so much, and other times I feel awful for hurting them so much. I almost caused a suicide but luckily everything turned out okay for them.
I've faked my personality to so many people that not even I know who I am anymore. I've went by multiple different names, and faked multiple different interests. I can't open up to anyone about this though because I'd rather not have anyone I know personally think about me differently.

My cat, Lewis, is 18 years old and has cancer in his ear. I am 17, and up until now I've been listening to my mom as to we can do for him, because... mother knows best, right? The original plan was to have him get some sort of treatment for the cancer before it spread any further, such as surgery or chemotherapy if it came to that. It has been about half a year since then. During that time, I was battling my own problems, and was unable to do the research I would have liked. When I was around, I would frequently ask when we would make an appointment. I would pay for it. And, sometimes, we'd set a time and date to go to a vet. But... that never happened. There was always some reason that prevented us from going at the last minute, and as much as I'd love to go and bring Lewis to the vet myself, how could I? It's just me and my mom, without a car or any of that jazz.

Recently, Lewis has not been acting himself. For the past couple of years, Lewis was there for me in my darkest times; I felt that he was the only one around me as I battled my crippling depression and was in and out of the hospital. He is the friendliest goodest boy around. He likes cuddles and constant attention, and I'm always happy to oblige. For the past few days, however, Lewis's appetite has decreased, he hides all day and only comes out for brief periods to take a nibble of food, and has a limp. His ear is also really bad; We have something that supposedly helps with the pain, as well as ear drop medication for cats, but it's still bloody from him scratching and who knows what else is going on in that ear. I frequently groom Lewis, clean his ear, give him ear medication, etc. I am beginning to worry that there is not much else I can do for him, and I am fearing the worst. I feel selfish for saying this, but I've been very dependent on Lewis for making me feel better. He was always there for me, and I was for him when he needed it too. But, I don't know if I'm ready for him to go. I have never experienced the grief of a close passing family member before. If there's something we can still do to have him live a little longer, I want to know, but at the same time I don't want him to suffer. I don't know what to do. I just want my kitty. What's the best course of action as a 17 year old? Is there anything I can convince my mom to do? If the worst happens, what should I do?

Today I feel a little shaken up and whatever I'm focusing on my mind always goes back to yesterday.

260,"I (F) am friends with this really great guy, and I’ve started developing feelings for him.
Traditionally I’ve dated the classic macho assholes who will make their intentions very clear. But this guy is different, he’s so confident in himself and doesn’t feel the need to perform all of this crap. I also have reached a place after a lot of work now where I’ve come a long way with myself and realising that I deserve someone who has a much higher quality of love to give.

The problem I have is that because I’ve never dealt with this kind of personality before, I’m struggling to tell if he’s really interested in me or if he’s just being a good friend. He goes out of his way for me a lot, invites me to his house and often cooks me lunch or dinner. Recently I had a death of a family member and he checks in, every couple of days to see how I’m going. 

Also one time we got really drunk together and he went on a big spiel about all of these great qualities about me. But he has never ever made a move which I guess I find confusing.

Do what do you think? Is he interested and super respectful or just a really great friend? How can I find out without ruining our friendship? Ideas please!",13Jun2020,1
261,"Okay so now... Before you guys go ""WTF??? THAT'S SO WIERDDD"" lemme explain

I just turned 18 and my long long crush (let's name her J) of like 7 or 8 years (which we are super duper close friends) started texting me again after being grounded for a year (she is bi and is dating our friend T and has been for a year and a half before being grounded)

So my birthday has recently passed and a week before this random insta account added me and turned out to be J! I haven't talked to her since last April so I was super happy! We went to the same classes 6th and 7th grade and she moved in 8th and we kept close touch. 

So basically we've been on the phone for almost the past 2 weeks NONSTOP giggling and ""shit-talking"" (basically talking smack about each other jokingly with nothing harsh EX: shut up u stupid ding dong) and talking about her moving into an apartment with me next year once she gets enough money to move and buy furniture (I just moved into an apartment 2-3 weeks ago)

I have loved every second of it we constantly wake up and text about our days with heart emoji's and everything. I've talked about her to my friends in my (in the time) new school district and legit my closest friend from that school district is in love with how I and J are arm

Thing is... I can't call her mine and be the HAPPIEST guy alive because T is still in the picture. T is like a Lil sis to me so I respect her and J's relationship a lot. And J is talking about how T is a little over-controlling at times but she still wants to be with her. 

While I'm pretty sure T is beginning to start sneaking around behind J but it's all rumours and doesn't want to ruin anything

I am so scared to REALLY love people because of my trust issues and it's ruining things for me.  Awesome friendships were people genuinely seem to like me have been almost ruined.

When my best friends seems to be getting too close with someone else, it kinda scares me. I really do know I have no right to feel that way and so I never say anything to them. I let them do whatever they want and never interfere in their social lives.

So, how do I trust people? How do I believe them when they tell me that they love me? How do I not get mini heart attacks everytime I hear that?

Signed and all, but haven’t made the first payment (the bank barely finished up the loan paperwork and sent it to me (complicated story but it’s sorted out)).

273,"So a couple of months ago while getting everything together for the next semester of university, financial aid decided to screw the pooch. Whenever the FAFSA makes it to the school they have to review and process everything. Well, they were apparently extremely backed up on this process.

The due date for all of the semester dues were coming up really soon and I wasn’t seeing any of my loans and grants hitting the books. I went to financial aid and they told me what I described above. They also said that it was more than likely not going to get processed before the due date and that I would need to come out of pocket for the total amount and then get reimbursed after everything was processed. 

Long story short, my family and I were not able to make up that kind of money. It just wasn’t possible. At that point it was also too late to receive any sort of loan for the amount.

I was also at this time living on campus and had already signed another 10 month lease. Since I couldn’t afford the classes, I wasn’t eligible to stay on campus so I had to break my contract. The fee amounted to a little over $3400. 

The corona virus has totally depleted my savings and since it’s been over 6 months I have had to start paying back my student loans. I’m in a really tough spot and don’t know what to do. The due date is very soon.

278,"So me and my best friend, also F(16), have been close for many many years she’s out as a lesbian to everyone but her father and her family back home ( her family are immigrants and wouldn’t take this lightly at all, very homophobic ). She has had practically no experience, besides talking. Me and her are ridiculously close, we’re pretty much each other’s only close friends and practically don’t know how to act when the other isn’t there. Our friendship is so good, we’ve never really fought, there’s no toxicity, and we trust each other with everything. We’ve both been through a lot over the years, I was the first person who knew she wasn’t straight along with many other personal issues she’s dealt with.

 

I couldn’t ask for a better friend, and honestly I love it, out of all the friends I’ve had over the years I’ve never had a connection with someone like this. These past few months I’ve really been questioning my sexuality, I’ve noticed myself being more increasingly attracted to girls which I never imagined myself to ever be. But at the same time I question if being with a girl would “be enough” for me. Like yeah I’m attracted to girls but there’s certain things I feel I would really miss from being a hetero relationship. Now the part that makes this situation one thousand times more complicated in my mind is my best friend. I don’t know how to explain it, but there’s always been a certain kind of tension between us.

 

When we’re alone it’s very obvious that there’s somewhat of a sexual attraction there, but nothing has really ever happened before. Recently I’ve told her I’m kinda questioning where I stand with my sexuality and ever since things have only been heightened. She’s been making subtle comments alluding to her being interested in pursuing something with me. This is really scary for me because I know once we cross that line there’s no going back. I keep kinda brushing these comments off and acting like I don’t pick up on them but it’s kinda obvious. I mean everyone at our school already questions if we’re together, which never really bugged me because at the end of the day I knew it wasn’t true.

 

I don’t deal with scrutiny very well, and in a very conservative town, it’s very scary to think I may not be straight and even be in a lesbian relationship. Never mind my family ( I don’t necessarily think they wouldn’t be supportive, more so weirded out and see me differently, I have much older parents ). My friendship with this girl means so much to me and I never want to jeopardize that, and that’s why I’m so hesitant to even think there may be feelings there. I’m confused about everything and I don’t want her to be my lab rat either to find out how I feel. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated, if there’s a better place to post this please let me know.

I dont get good grades and upto grade 7 i was really lazy and didn't bother to study and as such i was painted as a failure by other students and this made me want to change so i decided to ask my parents to transfer me to a private school becourse at the time i was thinking that better teachers means that i would start studying and fast forward to today i start panicking everytime i think of school and iam starting to think of sucide due to me being unable to understand any of the lessons plus failing my first term tests (which could get me expelled) and due to this pandemic my school shut down and as of today i didn't do any of the works given or participate in any online meetings i asked my mom for advice on how i could deal with school and the answer is always something related to my religion which doesn't help me at all cause i stopped believing in god.

285,"Hey guys, so two years ago my best friend decided to cut me off after a year of living as roommates. At the time I was going through some issues, and during this period my best friend (lets call her C) became really close with our other two roommates, who didn’t get along with me because of some cultural/daily habit differences. C had to leave school unexpectedly, and this is when she started distancing herself from me, ultimately blocking me from social media. 

The thing is, I don’t know why she decided to cut me out because she never said anything and wouldn’t respond when I asked her if I did something wrong (prior to being blocked). Its still driving me a little nuts— its not just that I miss her as a friend- I want to know how to do better in the future and maybe fix things between us. After 2 years of wondering what I did, I’m almost certain it must have been that I was too absent when she needed me (although she never said anything or tried to talk to me about her issues that led to leaving) and I still feel horrible. If only I hadn’t dealt with my depression by shutting myself in my room...

Anyways, since its been so long, and she clearly doesn’t miss me enough to reach out, should I even bother trying to talk (through email lol) and apologize? I know I’ve been cut out for a reason, but I need some closure because we were so close and I don’t often lose friends because in general I try really hard to maintain relationships.

Another thing is that like I never argue with anyone except for this one person and I always get annoyed with her and what she says and that’s why I always end up with arguments. Like non of my other friends are rude to me or say bad stuff so there’s no reason for me to get angry at them but this one specific person has made me angry so many times it’s kinda a thing of mine to get into arguments and I hate that because it’s only with this one person and so if I ever tried to tell her that she hurts me a lot she’ll just reverse the argument and say that I always argue with her.

My GF before that I met on a dating app. She was 19 and lived out of state so it was a bit hard but I fell completely in love with her and knew she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Since there was so much distance, it was the typical FaceTime, talk on the phone for hours, send each other naughty messages, and then 6 months in, she admits that she’s been lying to be that whole time and she’s actually 16(later found out she lied and was actually 15) I immediately ended it, but still felt heartbroken because she was the girl I saw my self marrying one day. Before that I dated a few girls but it never ended well. I’ve tried dating apps, but nobody ever seems interested in me.

292,"Exams is in quotation marks because instead of exams this year they gave us giant fucking assignments bc corona. 

Basically, I have been doing utterly horribly since quarantine started, but even more these past weeks. 

I started quarantine strong, always handing in stuff on time, with work that I felt was good enough to maintain my *stellar* grades. I worked extremely hard the previous semester, and finished it with a 94 average, which is the best I've managed in my life. It was gruelling but worth it. My parents were extremely proud of me, but they don't know how hard it actually was.

Essentially,  I was gifted as a kid, but crossed into average territory by the time I got to 8th grade. In order to keep pleasing my parents with good grades, I started taking caffeine pills to keep myself chemically awake in order to put together super elaborate and detailed projects and assignments. I would only take one pill at most, and only during hell week. 

As quarantine went on, shit got worse and worse and worse. I started getting super suicidal, but didn't want to tell anyone, because I didn't want to endanger my family by making them go to the hospital and possibly get covid. I felt like shit. I pretended to do homework for two weeks, when I was really browsing reddit and doing shit all, and got super behind (though I eventually caught up).

For our ""exams"" we had two weeks to do our final assignments, and I wasted the first one being lazy as shit and unmotivated and generally just mentally ill and unwell. I now have one week left  to complete them, and I managed to get one done by working literal entire nights. I would take a caffeine pill whenever I started getting tired to keep going, and then I would take them throughout the day to stay awake and fool my parents. 

But, I just can't do it anymore. I just can't. My body is giving up on me, the caffeine doesn't even work that well anymore, I have to take such a ridiculous amount to feel awake that I'm scared I'll legitimately overdose. My brain is also just fucked. Can't even think at a normal speed, can't come up with any creative ideas. 

I know I got just fudge them/not hand them in, but my parents will be so disappointed in my marks going down. I need to get my exams *waived*. I have some leeway with the school administration because they know I'm mentally ill. My options are basically: badly attempt suicide, stab myself in the leg with scissors, or throw myself down the stairs and hope I break a bone. It's manipulative but it's my only way out.

I’ve had my learners for forever. The moment I sit into the drivers seat I have the most intense panic attack and I cannot make myself put the car into gear. 

It’s so fucking tough because nobody understands. Everyone says I’ll get over it the more I try, but it just doesn’t ever seem to go away. Every attempt ends in a huge, long panic attack and many tears. I don’t know what to do. I need to get my license and time is running out.",13Jun2020,1
294,"So, I'm a theatre kid. I've been working in theatre for the last seven years, and I decided to get my undergrad in theatre. I have not had a single good experience working a show at my college, and the last show I did was so actually so bad that I am now suffering from severe anxiety and depression, going to counseling, and taking anti-depressants. I can't even go to my college campus anymore without having a panic attack.   


This last show was my senior project. I needed this in order to graduate. I was working props on the show and it was my first time doing props. I thought this was manageable because the props list was only a page long -- then it just got bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger.   


Anyway, I was constantly being critiqued about how I wasn't taking initiative, despite showing up to our shop and rehearsals almost every day and staying in almost contact with the director and my adviser. I got critiqued for not asking for help -- though when I was clearly struggling with something and came up to people, the response was usually ""it's YOUR senior project."" I was in constant contact with the director through email, and I saw him everyday -- however, he would not tell me the bulk of the important things that I needed to know until we were in a production meeting, when we were in front of the all of the other students of the faculty, where he would then throw a bunch of stuff on me right then and there and I'd end up fumbling in front of everyone while trying to process a bunch of new information. I was frequently receiving mixed information from him, the stage manager, and my adviser -- which in turn, usually made me look bad because I ended up being given the wrong deadlines for things.  I was being questioned on my research almost all the time. It was just bad, all around.   


I ended up having a confrontation with the director during on our tech day, where I ended up having to walk away and collect myself because of another instance of miscommunication that again, made me look bad. He followed me out, told me he took care of a couple prop things for me because he knew I had a lot on my plate and I kind of shrugged in response -- which made him go ""Okay.. so you're mad that I'm helping? Because that's like a big fuck you to me."" I ended up getting fired from the show two days later, forced to withdraw from my project, and I was no longer eligible for graduation.   


It was crushing and it's taken a huge mental toll on me. I keep getting encouraged to fight it but I just get very badly triggered at the idea of pressing into any further, because this isn't the first instance that I've had to fight my professors for their support.. My mom decided to go ahead and email the president of my college, and they think it's a big enough of a situation to open an investigation and see if I can get my degree this year after all. Still though -- the thought of going through just makes my skin crawl.   


My question is -- do I give them the go-ahead for an investigation?",13Jun2020,1
295,"
I’m only 18 so bare with me as my knowledge isn’t that vast on this subject sadly. So when I get a good income I’m planning on wanting to buy around 5+ acres of land with a house already built and remodeled, for $300k and less in the US In states like Georgia, North and South Carolina. 
I look at houses all the time so I know this is feasible. My question is though, what would my bills look like? Do I pay extra tax for having acreage? And I plan on having my business on my land but can I do that? Or no? What should I expect from acquiring this future house compared to a house in a residential neighborhood.

298,"Hello, I ordered a hoodie online off of Metathreads and I never had any issue ordering from them before.  However, when I track my package it says ""out for delivery for 8 days""  currently going on 9.  I have reasonable doubt to believe my roommate and her boyfriend have stolen the hoodie I ordered as a way to ""get at me""   I am moving out Monday and have till then for the hoodie to either come in from the post or for it to magically turn up.The evidence?

1. Early morning on Thursday June 11th I heard them say something about ""Monkey's Hoodie"" now I was half asleep still at this point so I don't know what the whole discussion was.
2. My friends boyfriend is spiteful and his character is weak.
3. The app I use to track my packages ""shop"" says it's been out for delivery for 8 days.  The company supposed to deliver the package is FedEx.
4. FedEx says it should arrive at more door by the end of the day but I never receive it.P.S.  I have received other packages during this time as well. Including but not limited to clothes and a new computer.

TL:DR: If I never get the hoodie what should I do?  I don't want to confront my roommate and her boyfriend and I don't want to go snooping through their stuff.  Without a for sure YES they have it

312,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. Also I apologize in advance for how long this is going to be; it is the first time I'm fully laying this story out and I'm bad at figuring out what is relevant and what isn't. TL;DR at the end.
My boyfriend(m 27) and I (f 22) had reconnected last year at my brother's wedding after having lost contact for quite a few years with some messy history of bumping into each other every now and again. 
When I was 13, a friend of mine was in a sticky situation and it lead to me being somewhere I shouldn't have been. I was raped and no one knew about it aside from a couple of friends and my now boyfriend. He used to live with me (he is my brother's best friend and he had a shitty home life so he unofficially lived with us for a few years) and he was home when I got back and I just lost it and told him everything.
One thing lead to another and my stupid school girl crush on him and his protective feelings for me seemed to culminate into us having sex (not immediately after but maybe 2 or 3 months after the night I was raped.) I know what some people are going to say which is why it has taken so long for me to post this. I'm aware that what happened was statutory rape and I was also in a very vulnerable place but all I could think while I was having near constant nightmares and panic attacks that my family didn't understand was that I wanted control. I wanted to feel like I had power and that I wasn't helpless because of what happened.
Naturally, shit went to hell real soon after and my now boyfriend was caught with pot (it was actually my brother's but when my parents found it, he blamed my boyfriend and my parents told his parents) so his parents packed up and moved to Missouri where he was sent to an all boys private catholic school for the end of his last year of high school.
I didn't hear from him again until three years later when he came back for his mother's funeral (his parents moved back after he joined the Navy.) He had apparently written me letters while he was away and had left them for me before he went back.
He told me that he loved me but what we did was wrong. He went on and on about how much he hated himself for doing that to a child especially knowing what kind of metal state I was in. Given that I never actually saw him that time I wasn't able to tell him that I had been pregnant before he left. Realistically I know the chances of the baby being his were very minimal considering we used a condom and while I don't remember with perfect clarity, I don't think my rapist used any kind of protection. Regardless it was a moot point because I only found out when I miscarried and honestly I was pissed at him and didn't feel like I owed him shit.
With quick little glimpses of each other in the following years, always with my oblivious brother or the rest of my family present, we were kind of out of each other's lives for good it seemed. Then last year my brother got married and we met again for real for the first time in years and I fell hard for him. It helped that we were in Disney, away from home and all the complicated memories attached to that place.
It was all sorts of awkward at first but things seemed inevitable for us. He ended up moving back shortly after the wedding to be near his father and sisters again to see if he could fix his family and have the life his mother always wanted for them and we started seeing each other. I know that it seems like there is some sort of Stockholm thing happening but years had passed and we both worked on ourselves during that time and we have had multiple long conversations about what happened and how we felt about it (excluding the pregnancy, I don't know why I didn't tell him aside from the fact that I was scared though I'm not sure of what.) 
Quick side note, I always disliked his father. He was a mean, angry drunk and he was the main reason my boyfriend stayed away from his home as much as possible. I know his dad used to hurt him and my bf never told me but I think he used to hurt his wife as well. I always disliked him and I have a tendency to hold onto gut feelings, especially about men so when I ran into him a few months ago at a supermarket and I had a sudden urge to both run away and stay and scream at him for all the shit he put my boyfriend through, it didn't really surprise me.
Despite the fact that he had stopped drinking for years now and was doing everything in his power to put his family back together according to my boyfriend, I didn't like him and he made me feel fucking terrified. Even writing this I'm fighting off a panic attack which have been becoming increasingly common again.
My boyfriend had told me about a book his father had written to him and his younger twin sisters shortly after their mother passed in which he talked about all the shitty things he had done while his children were growing up and how the death of his wife, who he claims to have truly loved, woke him up to what was most important to him. My boyfriend mentioned the book periodically and he is clearly very proud of his father so I decided to read it in hopes that I could get over whatever issues I clearly had with his father. It seemed like if my boyfriend could forgive him, who the fuck am I to hold onto that anger?
I read the book and I learned that my bf's father wasn't just an angry drunk but he was heavily involved with drugs, both dealing and taking, and aided in human trafficking although he claims to mostly be unaware of what was going on at the time. As I read I started to see some weird similarities and ties to the trouble I found myself in in my teenage years. While he never said anything specific about raping me, things started to line up including my intense fear of him. Part of what I felt was anger but a lot of it was terror which didn't make sense at first but I guess part of me knew who he was before I fully realized it.
I didn't have that moment you see in movies where repressed memories come flooding back in full clarity and I think I'm mostly glad about that but something in me is just positive that he is the man who raped me when I was 13. I can't see his face or anything like that but I just know it somehow.
I obviously haven't mentioned this to my boyfriend because a tiny little part of me is wondering if I'm making it all up because if it was him, why can't I remember? The rest of me is just petrified of losing my boyfriend. He is fiercely loyal, almost to a fault and I think that if it came down to me or his family, he wouldn't side with me especially if I'm questioning it myself. I also don't know if I could take it if he didn't believe me or if I lost him.
To make matters even more complicated, I found out we were expecting early in January and he freaked because we haven't come out to my relatively conservative family (My parents are Muslim and they already look down on my brother for marrying a white women despite him being male and that being way more acceptable as opposed to a female marrying out. They would rip my relationship, with a white man who is slightly older and someone who lived with us when I was a kid, to shreds. I know they would question every interaction we ever had and unfortunately we do have certain things to hide.) We were already having issues when I came to my realization and my sudden increase in anxiety and panic attacks wasn't helped when I miscarried again late this April. Now I'm dealing with this shit with his father and the loss of a child my bf never wanted, along with the reminder and memories of the baby I lost when I was a teenager that my bf has no clue about.
I feel like I've made a mess of everything and I don't know what to do.
Part of me just wants to leave and move on, away from everything I know including my bf. He said some things that really hurt me about my pregnancy that never fully got resolved due to being separated by quarantine and sometimes I feel like I am better off without him, but then that sends me into a panic because he is the only person that really knows me and knows (most) of my life and yet he still loves me. I know I don't need someone else to be happy or complete but the thought of losing him makes me want to die quite literally. I am not actively suicidal and I genuinely believe I would never do that but I fear the lows I would have without him.
I don't know what to do. Should I just break up with him and cut my losses? Should I stick it out and tell him everything and let him decide how he feels? I just feel so helpless and I fucking hate it. Sorry for ranting but I just needed to write and maybe get some advice from someone I don't have to look in the face when I mention the tougher parts of the story.

316,"He was in one of my classes a few years ago. I know of two people that told me that he was a dick and I did find him to be rude. He would always smile and look delighted when something bad happened to someone and he had an advantage over them. I could tell he was jealous of other people. 

Despite all this I was always nice to him, but it was clear that he didn't like me or others as well. 

**Some background detail**: I have tourettes syndrome. My tics aren't verbal, but they're all to do with movements. I've been pretty successful at hiding them throughout my life, but he did see me on one occasion and knew there was something wrong with me. 

The next occasion that this happened was so embarrassing. It was the most embarrassing tic I've ever had, but I simply couldn't control it. It's a malfunction of the brain and not something that I have conscious control over. 

**He recorded me and made sure to record my face**. 

About a year later I developed a serious anxiety disorder because that memory came back to me and I thought he would plaster that video all over the internet which in turn would ruin my life. 

**I HATE HIM**.

I hate him for what he did to me. There's no justification for what he did to me at all. I understand that he had a somewhat difficult upbringing, but so have I and I've known other people who have too but don't  behave in such a manner. It still doesn't give him an excuse to do what he did because he didn't do it in the heat of the moment. He had a long time to think about his actions before he took them because I was ticing for 30 minutes straight before he recorded me, and he saw me ticing the entire time. 

**Is my hatred of him justified**? 

I can't get over what he did to me. How low can you be to think that recording someone with an embarrassing mental illness and recording their face is an acceptable action to take?

**To make it clear I'm not going to do anything illegal**. I just want to know if my hatred of him is justified.",13Jun2020,1
317,I (16m) haven’t cried in 6 months. I never see a reason to do so anymore and I think it’s starting to affect me. Before these 6 months I was almost crying daily over a girl. It was because she was my crush and she seemed to be leaning toward another guy which was my best friend and my dumb self didn’t know how to respect that. When I cried over her was the first time in my life I had ever felt pain over something emotional and it was all new to me so I didn’t know how to cope with it besides crying a lot. Eventually we ended up dating and after I asked her to go out with me I have not seen a single reason for me to cry. But I keep having sort of memories or flashbacks of when she was getting close to another guy and it starts to make me feel worthless and i take it way out of proportion to make myself feel bad. Ever since I last cried I’ve been scared to let a lot of tears out at once because I feel like I’ll lose control and feel way worse afterwards. Since I’ve started dating her I’ve been forcing myself from crying because of this. It’s caused me to laugh whenever I feel like crying and is starting to cause me to get random attacks of laughter when I think of a not so pleasant memory. I’m too scared to think of what would happen if instead of laughing I tried crying. I’m tired of keeping everything tucked away but too scared of what will happen if I let it all out.,13Jun2020,1

320,"I'm  planning on going back to university in September (2020) after dropping  out and spending a few years working and experiencing life (I graduated  high school in 2015, I'm 23).

I  have decided to become a philosophy teacher, which will require a first  diploma in 3 years, then a second diploma in 2 years. I've been admitted  to the universities of my choosing, but I need to make a quick decision  and settle with one.

In my  country, universities are almost free, but living on your own is always  costly. I can't have financial help for the first diploma, so I'll have  to use my own savings to survive for the next 3 years. Here is my  problem :

The first university is a  great university, with wonderful teachers, many club activities, a rich  student life and many profesionnal opportunities, but the cost of life  of the city is so high that all my savings would be gone in one year.

The  other university is a regional one, a top student there would be  considered average in the first university, but I could live there with my savings and a small part-time job for the whole 3 years.

I  know the answer seems obvious, but I'm not wise and I really need to  hear your opinions on this.

323,"My MIL-to-be can't visit us anymore and we can't visit them anymore. She loves us to pieces and would like to see us and cries cries cries whenever an attempt to visit fails. It is just that whenever a visit is upcoming she falls sick (well, she thinks she develops symptoms such as a sore throat). She is quite the hypochondriac and most of her social life is going to various doctors. She hasn't travelled for a decade (they only did it for my partner's sake when he was a child, and even back then she'd get sick the day before but eventually went), she can't stay overnight anywhere, she has no friends, family besides her husband (who also suffers but does not see her psychological problems), or anything to do. We are planning a wedding and know that she (and thus also not his father, because they would never do stuff alone and she can't stay alone overnight) will likely not be able to attend and cry for the rest of her life that she missed the wedding. We are so sad. And she does not understand it is psychological (she's perfectly healthy), she is not able to reflect on herself, she just thinks she has bad luck all the time and cries. Does anyone know a solution or what she could have? I have thought about agoraphobia. But it is more fear of the unknown I think. Back when she could still visit we just knew we had to go to the same restaurant always, if we changed that we knew she'd get so anxious that she'll get sick (tried and tested, and no she has no clue about this herself).

As of now, I’m turning to Tinder as a last resort, but have no idea if it’s a good idea or not. What can I do? How do I end this loneliness for good?

329,"So my boyfriend and I have been together almost nine years. We are not engaged. We have lived together for about eight years. We spend major holidays separately (Thanksgiving, Christmas etc). He goes to his parents and I stay home. Whenever his friends have parties or social events, he goes and I stay home. We also do not attend weddings together. 

The why: a few years back his friends girlfriend messaged me and asked my professional opinion about something. She then went and told her boyfriend and he was angry etc. Even though she came to me. So his friends do not like me. And it is not in my head. The friend actually messaged my boyfriend and said that he was talking to the friends and their opinions of me got even worse than they already were. He made a point to include my boyfriends brother and his girlfriend too. 

After that when friends would have parties etc they would leave me off the FB invite list and only invite him. But I noticed they would invite each person out of a couple, so I was intentionally not invited. My boyfriend thought I was overthinking that and told his friend we would be coming and they said ""oh, i didn't realize i put her on the invite list"". Their way of emphasizing I wasn't invited. So I haven't gone to any friend parties since. Its been a few years. He goes by himself and I find something else to do. I am not going to add conflict and show up where I am not welcome. 

I had a bog fundraising event planned out of state. Took me and some other volunteers months to plan. Two weeks before the friends decided to plan a bachelor party for his friend the same weekend as the fundraiser. My boyfriend cancelled going with me last minute and I blew a gasket. I was completely livid because this event was planned first and he already made the commitment. So he tells his mom about it and he was then messaging his friend about it. Her response was"" even though I can't stand her I have to agree with her"". I was never anything but nice to his family and thats how they felt about me. Which is why we spend holidays apart. 

I was invited to one wedding by another friend who strays a bit from the group. At their wedding I was ignored by the rest of the friends. While at the table the one friend asked if we were both going to his (my boyfriends) destination wedding a few months from then. I didn't even know his brother got engaged let alone that they were having this wedding. And I also found out from the friend that the invited had gone out six months prior. So I wasn't invited and my boyfriend didn't tell me about it. Needless to say it caused quite an argument and he went to the wedding alone. I think that was the straw that broke the camels back. After that when we got invited to his cousins wedding, i refused to go. If I wasn't good enough to even be told about his brothers wedding then why is it suddenly good enough to go to his cousins.  So we haven't really gone to anything together since. 

At this point it might be better to leave and he can find someone his parents and friends like.",13Jun2020,1

When I have talked to her about it she is very laid back really only expects that I try my best, she could care less how stellar of a job I do. I want to be the very best for her though.

335,"Ok, so before I get into it, I need to address a few things. Yes, I'm on Android, and it's 2:56 am, so please excuse any mistakes. I am 17 living with both parents. My mom has online class during the day, and my father has a business, but isn't getting much or any costumes due to cov-19. I typically have summer school, due to a issue with keeping up with school work. This summer is the first I've ever spent without having to take a make up class. Along side just finishing my classes for the semester a few weeks ago. Now to get my issue.

I feel like the only one taking on any chorus around the house. I do the dishes, try to keep up with clothes, and cleaning after the two small dogs we own. I seem to do most of the work, yes I get praise for the work, but most of the time both of my parents are lazying about. Out side of school work, my mom and dad set around watching a show off a not really legally allowed website. Typically staying up up to sunrise. Aways watching it with the volume blasting. I finally had enough last week, after I asked my dad who was just walking around to put up some of the dishes, mostly plates. He refusesing and telling me that he won't know where the plates go, despite grabbing the plates Everytime we have a family meal. I asked him to help clean up some poop from the laundry room, he told me he would get to it in a few, only to deny it later, and saying he couldn't do it because of this or that. While he sat watching YouTube. 

I want to get stuff done around the house, but Everytime I get something finally clean, and get halfway through the next, or take an hour off, the mess is back. As I lay in bed trying to sleep for the past hour, with a head aech,  being keep up by screaming people talking about vimpers. I know realized why I can't get anything done. 

My parents are very old fashioned. They bearly listen to me, despite them telling me that I am mentally an adult comperd to people my age. I tried bring up my poblem multiple times to them, they never listen. Do I even have a right to bring it up the issue? What can I say or do to prove my point?",13Jun2020,0
337,"Hi all, 

Not sure if anyone will really see this or reply but I’m not sure where else to turn and I can’t express my situation to any of my friends without receiving judgement.

Around November of last year I (F22) really liked a guy (M22). He is smart, nice and just overall a great guy. A little bit of conversation is missing but I have a good time when I’m around him. I waited for him to ask me out thinking he liked me or was somewhat interested in me for a few months but he didn’t do anything. I quickly moved on and focused on other things.

In January, I was in an online chat room and I met a man (M40) and we hit it off. I mean, really hit it off. The same humor, the same sense of sarcasm, tastes, likes, dislikes. He seemed perfect. Except he is on another continent. I know what he looks like, sounds like, and we have been talking for 7 months now (every single day). We can talk about almost anything, and to be honest, I’ve been developing strong feelings for him.

Fast forward to last week. The guy (M22) I was interested in initially, tells me he is interested in me. I don’t really know what to do. He doesn’t compare to the man I’ve been talking to for the last 7 months, but he’s here and nice and I was interested in him before. Plus, it seems like I can actually form a relationship with him and I’m very curious to explore it. I really am falling in love with the guy that is across the world but even in my wildest dreams, I could never be with him. 

To answer any potential questions:
1. I cannot go to my friends as they will judge the way I met the second guy and the age-gap.
2. I have not told the second guy about my feelings because I’m afraid they’re not reciprocated. Or that they are. 

What should I do? 

Tl;dr: I’m thinking of leaving the guy I’m head over heels for in order to be in a relationship with someone closer to me.",13Jun2020,1

344,"I have a friend I recently met online that lives in the United States and we’ve been talking closely for over 6 months. I come here because I really care for her wellbeing and it’s worrying me what is happening at her home.

Her step-dad is constantly on her case and whilst barely physical abusing her it’s definitely causing her mental problems like depression and anxiety. Recently his daughter moved in (she’s 9) and had to share a room with her, which isn’t a problem except she needs to sleep with the light on. She has a really bad problem with this because it affects her sleep and she values alone time so when she told her step-sister to turn the light off she refused and threw a fit. Her dad came in and got on my friends ass and physically pushed her around and gave her shit. She told him that she needs to grow up and she can’t sleep with the light on and he proceeded to put his finger on her head pushing her back. She retaliated and slapped his wrist, which triggered him to grab her wrist in a strong hold. This clearly freaked her out since she is a 7th grader and he is a full grown man. 

With mental abuse, she plays on XBOX and it’s kind of her way to escape from the reality of her situation (the XBOX was her Christmas gift) and he’s recently kicked her off and claimed it as his. Her mom, (although a nice person) does absolutely nothing and says she can’t do anything about it which i understand if there is something deeper going on. 

She is scared of him and is currently locked in a bathroom as he has kicked her out of her own room to accommodate for his daughters needs. 

Please tell me what I can do as an outsider to get her help, or if I can help her in ANY way.",13Jun2020,3

This was over a year ago. I hooked up with a guy I met through our mutual friends. The sex wasnt terrible, but I didnt have any feelings for this guy and I wasnt that attracted to him, so the whole experience left me feeling empty and dirty. I just wanted to try casual sex for fun, and with someone I knew I wouldnt get attached to, and it was a mistake. He was the second (and so far, the last) guy I had sex with. The worst part is, he told our mutual friend that we had sex, and that friend told his girlfriend etc so i think everyone knows what we did. I feel so embarassed that I wanted to try something different for once, and now everybody thinks im easy and a slut.. It destroys me, because I dont sleep around at all, except for that one time which I regret very much. I know now that casual sex isnt for me at all. I ghosted my friends bc im to embarrased to show up to any parties, events etc knowing that hes probably  gonna be there.. plus I have destroyed my reputation.

347,"I’ll try to keep this short. I [22 F] really need to talk to a friend but I feel like all of my problems are so menial in the grand scheme of everything that’s going on right now. I feel like I’m taking little hit after little hit and it’s really taking a toll on me. To spare you from a whole story I’ll try to just list what’s been making me feel so depressed. 

School: I just graduated from a state college in May (no ceremony obviously, senior year cut short). I lost both of my part time jobs due to covid 19 so I had to get a sublet for my apartment and move home (I can’t afford it without an income). I left all of my friends in my university city so I get to watch them enjoy their summer together from my social media. I can’t find a job right now and  I recently realized my degree pretty much requires additional education to make it worthwhile. 

Career: After years of uncertainty with what I want to do for a career I finally decided on one I think will make me happy, but it’s been questioned by nearly everyone when I tell them. I ignored them and decided to pursue it anyway, so to gain experience before applying to grad school I decided I want to work as an EMT for a year. This is the first thing I’ve been excited about relating to my future in a long time, so I was very proactive about it. I was accepted to a local EMT program, pending I receive a vaccine booster. I made an appointment for the next morning, and as I got in my car after I got the vaccine I saw an email saying I just missed the last spot in the class. Pushing back this EMT course to the fall will push back my grad school plans by a full year. I now have no job, no income, no plans, no friends at home. 

Life: My mom is immunocompromised so for her safety I can’t go out and hangout with anyone. The only people I hangout with are my parents. My boyfriend moved halfway across the country for a job, I’ve been on the fence about our relationship anyway for a couple years but because nothing is “wrong” with us I don’t feel like I have any valid reason to end it. I love him but I’ve often had a feeling it’s not “it.” I find myself thinking about other men sometimes. I feel so stuck. 

Financial: My student loan debt is hanging over my head like crazy, I have a credit card bill that I unfortunately mistook an auto payment setting and it tanked my credit score. 

On top of this, my grandma died unexpectedly a few days ago and I’m so stressed (like everyone) about the state of the world and the racial and political tension in my country. 

I feel so dumb complaining especially because I know things are a lot worse for other people. I just have never felt this sad, useless, and unmotivated in my whole life. I love my parents but as a 22 year old college grad this is not where I thought I would be. I have nothing to wake up for in the mornings and no future plans for my entire life. I feel like I’m watching all of my friends lives thrive from a little hole in my hometown.

I know this is a lot of rambling and I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to even glance at this. I just want to get back to my happy self.

Edit: clarity",13Jun2020,4

349,"So almost a year ago one of my bras went missing. I didn’t give it much thought and eventually forgot about it. Well, over the course of this year another bra, three panties, a thong and a bikini top have gone missing. I started to get worried someone had broken into our house. I forgot about my missing underwear and for a couple of months nothing else disappeared. That was until a few weeks ago when my mom mentioned to me that she couldn’t find two of her bras. 

Fast forward to two days ago and I’m in my brothers room looking for batteries for my tv remote. He has this large cardboard box under his bed where he keeps random stuff so I figured he could have some batteries there. As you can probably guess, I did not find batteries but instead found a bunch of women’s underwear. I immediately recognized my red bra that went missing almost a year ago, as well as my black bra that disappeared a few months ago. I didn’t want to assume what he did with my underwear but the questionable stains on my bras spoke for themselves. My red bra was covered in stains both on the inside and outside of the cups. My other bra had some stains but they weren’t as bad as the red one. My panties didn’t look stained, but my Calvin Klein thong that had gone missing about 6 months ago was disgusting. It was crusty and smelled terrible. I also found my mom’s two bras, a black one and a grey one. The black one had a lot of stains in the outside of the cups and the grey one didn’t look like it had any. But what I found the most disgusting was my 9 year old sister’s trainer bra. It had the most stains out of anything in his box. The bra had huge yellow stains on both sides of it. I’m not even lying I almost puked. I could still see some white on the bra but most of it was yellow from what I can only assume is my brother’s discharge. I put the stuff back in the box and left his room fast. I haven’t told anyone about this because I don’t know how to approach it. My brother is 17 turning 18 this July and I’m 16. What I’m asking is how I can tell my mom about this without affecting our relationship as a family.",13Jun2020,5

365,"Here's my drama:

&amp;#x200B;

I was fired on May 1st, 2020 and am still working through the whole situation. I was the Membership Coordinator and the head of the membership department right under the CEO &amp; COO. One of the key tasks for my job was actioning change requests for accounts. With the closure of the gym in March due to Covid-19 the Exec's decided without my input to effectively leave all members for themselves without any care for what situation they may be in themselves. So if a member wanted to make a change to their account whether it was credit for the gyms closure, freezing, or terminating they would have to submit a change request. Normally I was able to process all requests each month for the thousands of members (because on average it was maybe between a hundred to a couple hundred a month), but with this decision to close out of the blue without taking care of members first caused my inbox to be flooded with hundreds on hundreds of requests at once. By the time I was fired several thousand members had been individually processed. Complete malarky because we could have mass processed all members freezing their accounts and crediting them for the closure from the get go.

&amp;#x200B;

I was agonizingly trying to help every member and still deliver my above and beyond customer service. It didn't help that I was also damage control taking a lot of flak from members because it didn't land well with the CEO asking members to continue to pay for their membership to help us as a ""small business.""  I was putting in well above my 40hrs without getting overtime because salaried employees are FSLA exempt, and was getting so stressed out that it was affecting my health. One day the CEO asked me why I only processed 4 change requests, which I very openly told I was feeling sick the day prior and bluntly said ""I was pissing out of my asshole with going to the bathroom 5 times that day."" They responded that I needed to figure out how to not be so stressed out and be more productive so I'm not shitting myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I set up a meeting with HR to express the need to use my PTO, because I desperately needed a leave of absence. They said that they were not letting anyone use their PTO at the moment and that I needed to figure out how to work with the CEO and COO better. My mental state got so bad that I wanted to get the Coronavirus, so I could get the two weeks paid sick leave under the Families First Corona Response Act  (FFCRA). Ultimately a coworker tested positive and since I was their main point of contact I was placed under quarantine by the county for two weeks. I thought my wishes had come true, but I then had to take my work remotely. I again expressed with HR my dissatisfaction with my working situation and that it felt like I would be working up until I was on a ventilator. I did test negative I should say. Their response was that each position has its pros and cons. Finally my emails slowed down enough to where the COO said if I got through them all I could have off the remainder of my quarantine giving me 32 hrs of paid sick leave through the FFCRA. With those 32hrs and a weekend I was able to right myself in many ways and was ready to return to work well rested.

&amp;#x200B;

My first day back I was blindsided with a meeting between the COO and HR where they gave me three options. First, fired immediately with nothing. Second, fired immediately with a two week severance (another full paycheck). Third, was stepping down which the COO stated that this option wasn't desired by them because ""they felt I would start a fire at the front desk and turn staff against them."" The grounds they stated for my firing was fostering toxicity towards the CEO &amp; COO (who are engaged), and that I didn't think they had the best interest of members &amp; staff at heart. I'm honestly happy to be fired on the last accusation, because I do believe they could and should have done better for their community and staff through this whole global pandemic. In February, I expressed to the COO my concerns of Covid-19 coming to our state and they just responded; that we don't do anything for flu season, its not that bad, and that there's a vaccine (a little back story for the type of people I was working under).  I shot myself in the foot when talking about the possibility of me stepping down saying that this would likely be the end of the run for me and I would start looking for new work. The COO then told me then that if I stepped down I could only work there for six weeks. I asked ""Why six weeks?"" They responded that if I was looking for new work I would have no problem finding a new job because I'm a smart kid (I'm in my mid 20s and they're in their 30s). I asked if I could let them know the next day my decision which they said was okay.

&amp;#x200B;

After a night of a lot of thinking, I decided that I would be fired immediately and take the severance. I knew that I couldn't continue my work with my heart in it if I only had 6 weeks. I asked HR if I would get my PTO paid out or if that was part of my severance. They told me that they don't pay out PTO, and that my severance was if I had given them two weeks, but instead they were giving me two weeks. Now talking with friends about this whole mess I learned that it is illegal to deny PTO and that it is illegal to not pay out PTO earned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I pursue anything here and if so how? I love the community around the gym and plan to still go there now as a patron. I know this will likely burn any bridges left but I don't care to list any of my supervisors as references considering the circumstances.  Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, was in a very toxic work environment which affected my health. I asked to use my PTO but was denied by HR. When being fired effective immediately I asked if my PTO would be paid out which HR said they don't do that.",13Jun2020,1

368,I've always seen relationships with huge age gaps. The people I have dated were always the same age or a few years older than me. I dont understand why people always shun upon age differences at all. The person I'm with I've known for years. We have also been together over 2years and we have a 10year difference. I'm literally the happiest I've ever been and I'm completely in love with them. I always see posts about how gross it is or that its weird when an age difference that big is involved. Sometimes it makes me feel like the biggest piece of crap or a huge creep because of it. I always end up feeling guilty because some people can be really rude and nasty about age gaps. I guess my question is why do people shun upon age differences? Love is love and we cant help who we fall in love with. I also dont think we should be made to feel guilty for it either.,13Jun2020,1
369,"About five hours ago I posted to r/amitheasshole (wait for it), the backstory of Snape from Harry Potter. I made him a science teacher and everything. In this post, I said that I yelled and perhaps even slapped a child.

People didn’t see it, and were probably rightfully calling me a terrible person. I messaged ever commenter back saying that it was a joke.

But what if one of them called the police? I could get a criminal record, and never achieve my lifelong dream of becoming an actual teacher myself.

I haven’t been able to sleep. I threw up from the sheer fear half an hour ago. When I do fall asleep I have nightmares and wake up. I’m terrified.

I’ve always thought myself as a good person, I was just trolling a bit, having fun. I’m debating on deleting my Reddit account.

370,"I have a very hard time being willing to pay for expensive therapy.  Insurance doesn’t cover it.  I’ve tried multiple times.  I recently ended up trying talkspace because I heard good things about it.  But, ultimately, it was really expensive to pay for someone to give me a one paragraph response each day.  I thought the idea of unlimited communication sounded good, but that doesn’t seem to be how it works in reality...the therapists generally only respond once a day.  Why should I pay this much for this?  

It’s been several weeks, and the process of answering questionnaires has been so slow that I still haven’t even really started anything.  Paying so much for someone to give me a pat on the back has always left a bitter taste in my mouth.  

I didn’t ask to develop PTSD from child abuse.  Why should I be punished further by spending all my income on this and getting nowhere?  Professionals should certainly be paid fairly.  But I just can’t help but feel vulnerable and exploited from this system.  People rally behind affordable healthcare...why not therapy?  I don’t have the money to “be patient.”  That’s the harsh reality.  I just feel angry with life...everything.",13Jun2020,3

373,"I know it's stupid. I won't disclose his name (regardless of how well known he is) because if I *do* end up telling him, I want it to be on my own terms and I don't want to embarass him.


Everytime I see his face, I break out in a full face smile. I can't help it, even in public. I feel a tingling in my chest and a tightening in my throat. Shivers down my spine. It's not purely based on attraction (I find him utterly appealing now, but initially I found him somewhat off-putting and only began watching for his content. The physical attraction developed- he isnt traditionally attractive). 


I blush everytime I think about him, and want to squeal into my pillow like a teenager. I've felt like this for over a year, and had a growing crush before that, which came from a growing admiration and respect. I find him hilarious, intelligent, his content makes me think and want to learn more, and his talent is incredible. I want to speak with him, learn everything about him. I've tried to find out everything I can about him without being stalkerish. Even as i'm writing this, my heart is pounding in my chest.



But I know it's a problem. Regardless of my dreams and deepest hopes and desires, he doesn't know me or love me. He likely never will. Even if we did meet. I may not be his type, he may not like me. I know the odds. And we probably will never meet anyway. He has a decent fanbase so even if I messaged him to at least get some closure (not that that is his responsibility) he may never see it and I would feel humiliated.



I am also aware that my attraction and love is based on what he has filmed and uploaded- it could all be an act. He has shown flaws and problems I don't like before in videos, but that doesn't mean he hasn't got more. I don't know him in real life. I don't know his thoughts. I KNOW these things. It's something I put so much thought into when I had a crush to try and get over it. But I just can't. I cannot tell you all the tactics i've tried to get over him. I don't find other men appealing anymore, I haven't had a crush on anyone else in nearly a year. Any sex feels like a betrayal to my heart (not to him, given we aren't together). I've been in love once before (I've had relationships, but love feels different), and only ever got over it after we broke up. Because there was *closure*.



I tried to stop watching him and move on. I swear, I tried. But I couldn't. His voice soothes me when i'm sad, his videos help me sleep and overcome my insomnia, his content makes me giggle when I think there's nothing to laugh at, he's taught me things, and I just.... Love him. And I know it's stupid. I know it's pointless and one-sided and childish and baseless, but I can't help it. I do love him.



And it hurts me. Because I know he doesn't love me back, and he probably never will. He doesn't fucking love me, and i'm tearing myself apart trying to get over him. It hurts. I don't think i'd mind being in love with him if it didn't hurt so much.



Please, regardless of how stupid I sound. Please give me some advice. At least in most unrequited love you *could* ask them if they like you or not. Regardless of anxiety, its still a *possibility* so you can either be together or move on. But that doesnt feel like an option for me with him.",13Jun2020,1
375,"Hello everyone. Recently I started noticing more and more, that my mind most times went blank when I talk with some(not every time) and when they say something I just agree and go with my things, but after interaction or conversation, I came up with great ideas what could I say, something funny, sarcastic, or even tell a story about that topic, I don't consider my self as boring person, it just comes to me after.

376,"Welp, I never thought I'd be posting in this subreddit given how petty and minor my situation is but here I am at last. I don't mean to come off as a douche for posting about my issue here when there is more serious things happening to other people, but I'm all out of ideas on what to do. So, here's what's happening.

I used to a lot of sports when I was younger, and actually did karate for 4 years up until 2015 and was a yellow belt (yellow being the 4th level) and kept me in overall pretty good shape, and also made me pretty strong in general and a proactive person, or at least that's what I would consider but that might just be my own appreciation of it. But the year prior I had started to go less than usual (I used to go 2-3 times a week) and by the end of that year and the beggining of the next one I was already going very little, sometimes only going once per week and then skipping a whole week entirely, and since I used to train in the afternoon when most of the adults would go to train, it was pretty intense and without much rest either, and so it started to become more of a pain to go and I'd have to argue with my mom all the time about me not wanting to go and her telling me I had to, but I know she did it with good intentions. So I started going less and less until I stopped going completley after I had a pretty bad bike accident and I had to have a plaque installed in my upper teeth for two months, and after that I never went again since I'd lost almost all shape and just wasn't ready to go back to commit to that level again.

Over the years I've tried to do other things (with the support of my parents who I've always counted on for these kinds of things) to stay in shape and live a healthy lifestyle. I've tried other sports, I've tried being with a personal coach/trainer which actually helped me a lot for about a year and a half but we had a fallout and I haven't gone with him again, I've tried electrotherapy, and I even tried to do a starvation diet (I know, terrible idea, but i've learned my lesson) but I haven't been able to keep up with any of them, one for lack of motivation and self discipline, and two because I didn't watch at all what I ate and just kept eating whatever, plus adding high school to that which didn't give me that much free time either, but that's the lesser part of the whole problem.

Now I'm 19 and in college, about 5.9 ft tall and weight 251 lbs, and I'm afraid that number is gonna keep going up if I maintain my unhealthy lifestyle. These past few months I've done little to no exercise other than doing a few things in the house to help my parents and walking the dog a few times a week, but that would be about it when it comes to physical activity. I eat without watching my portions and eat whatever I can find in the kitchen throughout the day (which I already did but nowadays its much worse), and although I know when to stop, I still eat a lot of food, which only adds up more to my fatness. I might not look super fat on the outside but I have a pretty considerable belly and my body mass index is 35.2 which makes me obese type 2.

At first I could live with it but now it's gotten worse, I can't stay sitting for too long because then my stomach and abdomen hurt, same when I sleep on my side or on my stomach. I get tired more easily than before, and It's starting to get to me psycologically too because my dad Is a type 2 diabetic and has to take a lot of medication and also injects himself with insulin, and I don't want to end up like him when I'm older, but I don't really know what to do at this point. I feel lost and so unmotivated to do anything that it's hard for me to pick myself up and stay on a good pace for long before I just give it up and go back to my regular lifestyle. I just wish someone could tell me **exactly** what to do and exactly what to eat and when to do it and what I gotta do to lose weight, but I know that's never gonna happen, and because I still have some dignity for myself I wanna do the change myself, but I just don't know how.

I understand and apologize if this is not the most appropiate subreddit for this kind of advice, but I'm gonna hear and listen to and (try to) asnwer to everything you guys tell me, whatever it might be. I really wanna make this change because I know I brought this upon myself and in the future I'll be facing the consequences of my own wrongdoing and for not listening to my body's needs, but I feel so lost on what to do and really just need help. Thank you for reading up to this point and I hope everyone has a great day.",13Jun2020,1

380,"It’s really important that everyone reads this thoroughly, this is a lot to explain and I’m super scared he’s going to see this. In this story is going to have made up to names to help keep it a little more anon.

  Last year around October I had a friend named Zandy who introduced me to her ‘cousin’ Daniel. Now at the time I was going through a really rough patch with my ex Jeremiah (physically and mentally abusive) and I was trying to find something somewhere else, emotional wise. When I met Daniel that first night at Zandy’s, I thought he was extremely attractive. His smile, his laugh. His humor... even still his humor is so adorable! I didn’t see him again until 6 months later, his parents (and ironically with my aunt and uncle, which I didn’t know until this year) went to San Felipe, Mexico, leaving their house vacant to Daniel and his younger brother, Miles. 

  Miles decides to have a party, he invited Zandy and her friends, Rose (my bestfriend in which Miles was seeing at the time), myself and obviously Daniel. I had admittedly forgot about Daniel for all that time until I saw him again. All of us except Daniel were hanging around the hot tub, drinking and laughing. And not even an hour later, Daniel comes out. I’m already feeling myself at this point, I drank a little too much. I try and coax him into the hot tub with us, everyone was chanting for him to take off his clothes and it was so cute. Guess what he did? He sat in the hot tub, fully clothed. Now his brother told me that, that should have been a red flag. It wasn’t. I thought it was the funniest shit I’d ever seen, Morty. (Sorry, haha.) The night goes on and we’re all having a good time, Zandy leads me to the bathroom and before we passed the door she started with “You know his girlfriend died right? Back in 2017. He hasn’t been with anyone since then.” I was shocked and I felt so bad, she told me he was mentally unstable and all this other bullshit that my drunken mind couldn’t comprehend. 
  
  Fast forward to later that night, I’m in his bedroom, Daniel and I are making out, I have the absolute worst cotton mouth and apparently so does he. I wasn’t interested in having sex either. But those things weren’t the only thing distracting me, I was worried about his feelings. I believed at the time (which now I know both of them lied) that he hadn’t kissed or touched anyone in two years. So without a doubt, my unsober and unfiltered mouth spouted out and asked him about ‘her’ and instead of him becoming sad, he made a joke about it. (Don’t judge, people joke about pain differently, mostly for coping mechanisms.) I didn’t tell him how I lost my brother when I was 14 right in front me in what could be considered a car accident. I just let him spout of and tell me how he’s okay. That was the last night I saw Daniel.

  UNTILLLLL; March of 2020, almost a year later I posted some CRINGE ass stuff on Snapchat, almost forgetting I had Daniel added there. He swiped up, we talked for about 15 minutes, I griped about how I so badly wanted to drink and he invited me over. I’m not gonna lie, I almost stood him up. Mostly because at the time, my ex Jeremiah and I were suppose to be attempting to fix things but my mind told me to go. We drank and talked, drank and talked until eventually, like before, I ended up in his bedroom. I thought it was gonna be like before, where we just kissed and fell asleep. But it wasn’t like that, at all. It got deeper and more intimate (if you know what I mean.) that boy practically snatched my soul, but my stubbornness refused to see it like that. The next morning I woke up and went to dip out because I was absolutely terrified and embarrassed of opening my body to someone.. But he caught me and he kissed me. And ever since March him and I have been seeing each other practically every day. He knows about my brother who passed away, he’s met my mother. (I swear to god I’m getting to the end) But most importantly, he met my 11 year old Autistic (low on the spectrum) sister and she fell in love with him. My sister has never been a fan of my choices in men. But Daniel? She’s absolutely head over heels for him. On Thursday afternoon I was telling him I wanted to head over to the CHAZ (look it up) and he asked if I wanted him to babysit my sister. And at first I was worried but he is a teacher, so I allowed it. She had a rock in’ time and so did he! She came home and told me that she was asking Daniel if he knew I liked him, he said that I’ve told him a few times and then he proceeded to open up to my sister, telling her about how his girlfriend passed away in a accident and that it’s not that he doesn’t want to be with me, it’s that he’s scared to lose me like that. And Thats completely valid! Don’t get me wrong, I’m never going to invalidate that. But here’s my concerns.

  I have voiced my emotions to him about 4 times, not too deep. Just claiming that I really like him. Yet not once (maybe slightly?) has he admitted to his feelings about me, and I can see them in his eyes, I can see them when he does things for me, I can see it when he touches me. But I’m in fear, Reddit. I’m in fear because I’m insecure, I think he’ll find someone else. There was a point in time when we were showering and I thought he was pointing out my weight and I became more insecure. My mind, because I have certain issues, my mind tells me to leave and move on. Or go back to my ex, or download tinder and fall in love with someone who will give me the same notions although for then often those notions are fake and lust filled. (Not him, the tinders.)
But my heart? My heart is telling me not too, it’s telling me to stay and see... even if I get hurt, even if this goes wrong and even if I’m being used... I sound like a child, and I’m not. I just spent 4 years of my life in practically tortured and the moment I find someone who is the closest thing to perfect that I’ve ever seen, my ass wants to go insecure and ghost. What the hell do I do? I don’t want too lose him... and I don’t want to tell him anymore times that I’m in love with him. Why does this feel so big when nobody has felt this big to me before?",13Jun2020,1

386,"It's all I want. I want to tell them I'm sorry. I want to give them an explanation as to why I acted the way that I acted. I want to let them know that I struggle a lot with mental health and I'm sorry that got in the way of our friendship. I want to tell them I'm sorry for acting the way that I did to them and their family. I've grown a lot as a person since then, you know?

I was talking to some other people about it and they agreed I should apologize to them if I really want to. Tell them things that I should've told them before. Be vulnerable. And I did. I wrote out things deep from my heart. Things that I've been feeling for the past 6+ months. Things that I've been working through in therapy. Finding out more about myself and why I do the things that I do because of my childhood.

But they've blocked me. Almost like... everywhere we knew eachother. And I don't want to be *that* person, but I did make a new account for facebook. I did try to friend them so I could send my apologies to each of them. But the instant I friended them the account was disabled.

I tried friending them on steam so I could send the apology there, but one of them has me blocked.

I just feel so empty right now. Writing the apologies gave me such a feeling of... calmness? Like, I felt at ease after I'd finished writing what I wrote. I felt good about my decision to apologize to them. I felt the closure I'd been looking for. It almost felt like I was able to move on.

I still had this bittersweet feeling. Like I knew things ended badly, but I felt like maybe that's okay, and I don't need to stress about that anymore. And maybe we aren't going to talk to each other or be friends anymore, that's fine, but I want them to know I've grown as a person and that I wish the best for them. I want them to know they deserve better than people half-assing it for them. I want to explain why I became so distant and closed off. Because it (mostly) wasn't their fault.

It feels like this is always how things turn out for me. The moment I find some sort of stability in something, it gets messed up.

I know I probably seem like a creep from all of this. I don't want to be a creep. I don't want to be creepy. I just want to apologize to them. This is such a hard position to be in. I don't blame them for having blocked me, but I wish they'd just unblock me for like a minute so I could send them the apology and then be done. I know I'd still be curious what they thought about me. How they felt about me. I'd wonder if they hated me, or maybe if they missed me too. But at least I'd be able to tell them how I felt, you know?

I feel like almost a part of me is glad that I wasn't able to contact them. Maybe it's better if there's no hope of me apologizing or being friends with them again. It's probably better for them, to be honest. If they're doing better without me, I'm very glad, and I wouldn't want to mess that up.

God I'm so lonely and sad. I don't want to say I've given up, because I hate giving up, but I feel like if I were to keep trying I'd be crossing boundaries. Maybe it's best nothing is said to them? I'm not sure. I feel like I'm always going to feel like something is missing. Like there's a piece that hasn't been put back into place.

I'm gonna speak to my therapist about this next week, but I just needed to get this off of my chest. I'm in a really dark mental state right now and I just needed to say it somewhere.

387,"It’s actually very hard to focus on making this post since it hurts so bad, but the problem is, it doesn’t feel like a normal headache. The pain is mostly coming from where the back of my neck meets the back of my head and it started hurting so bad in my sleep that I had a dream about my trying to find comfort before I woke up just to have a slightly dazed memory of where I was.

At work yesterday it wasn’t really a headache as much as it felt like I pulled something in my neck or I slept wrong. I was trying to stretch my neck and everything but I also felt the back of my head having a slight pain of what felt like a headache. Except I’m pretty sure it was making me extremely grumpy at work, and I work with dogs...

Right now I’m soaking in the bathtub with warm water around the area but it isn’t helping too much and when I went to move my head back into the water I could hear my spine sort of pop and sizzle",13Jun2020,2

392,"It's stupid. I am in love with my best friend. We have known each other for a while. You know, doing the thing friends do. Concerts, bars, girls, all of it. He has been the best person in my life for I don't know how long.
We got to the point that he needed somewhere to move and I wanted to move aswell. Which is a messy situation that I got myself into anyway, and I accepted what could happen going into it. So many good things, and he'd cook for me, we got super close, and one day, he was super close to me.

We danced, drank, talked, sang, cuddled, and more one night. We sang songs we were in concerts alone together that he put on. And after the girl that he talks to occasionally left. I went down on him. For a while. Like over an hour and a half. Both drunk, but he all the sudden got up and left. ""Goodnight"" talk to him a few times days after that, and he says never again.

He moved his bed against my bedroom wall, and bangs this girl against my room loudly. Has sex on my blanket in the living room. I don't know for sure so I can't say anything, but nothing spilled on it, and it's the couch blanket, and it was dirty the day after.

I don't talk to him for two weeks. And he doesn't even ask what's wrong. He knows what's wrong, and he just let it hang for two weeks.

I confessed to him last night. To know how he felt, and let him know how I have been feeling.
I told him that I didn't need anything from him, but please understand how it feels. It would be selfish to ask of anything. Just flat out not going to happen. He doesn't feel the same in any capacity. We hugged each other in less than barely any clothing while he told me over and over again (that one night) that he loved me. I just don't understand. It was the closest I've ever felt to anyone. 

Now just an hour ago, I walked out to the living room, and the blanket was pressed up against the couch. He had sex on my blanket again, on the main couch, louder than ever before. 

I don't know what anyone could tell me, because I knew of the possibilities before going into it. I can't go anywhere though. Coronavirus and even if we didn't have to stay inside, I don't know anyone else. He's my friend that I go to for everything. What did I do wrong? Why is he treating me like this after pouring my heart out to him? Is he mad at me because I was just his friend? Why did he pursue me? I still love him.",13Jun2020,6
393,"Hi guys, True Story

I've been having these dreams all my life but lately with more regularities. In my dream, I see people that are going to die in about 3 days from the day I dream. I have always had these dreams, Sometimes I tell people about it, other times I let it slide.

I know what you are thinking, You are saying please don't dream about me.

I see your point and I understand you but wouldn't you rather have the option to be able to say goodbye to your loved ones, Dad, Mum, Sister, etc..

There was a friend I told his mum is going to die in about 3 days, so he needs to make peace with her.

He was not on talking terms with and I knew that but he wasn't impressed with what I have just shared with him.

Anyway he did go to his mum and she die after 3 days.

After about one week had passed by, he came to my workplace to thank me for sharing my dream, even at the expense that other people might call me a freak.

This has happened many times to me.

I have never spoken so open about this before but this time it's different.

Do you know anyone out there that's been having similar dreams to mine?

394,"NOTE: do not make any nasty comments about my bfs decision. he had every reason to do what he did. 

My bf is 21 his ex is 20. When i met him she was 16 weeks pregnant and with someone else. From the start is was obvious he was uncomfortable with her being pregnant and being around her. 

Come to find out that she admittedly babytrapped him for money. she lied about being on birth control and threw out his condoms. She blamed him when she fell pregnant and refused abortion. She then left him at 10 weeks for someone else. 

Eventually at around New Year, my bf decided he didn’t wanna be involved. He couldn’t cope with being a dad yet. He told her from the start that she could expect this and she didn’t care. 

Fast Forward to April. Baby is a month old and i’m getting a load of shit from her friends because of him not being involved as if it’s my fault. i started getting instagram messages from him ex calling me loads of names and turns out her friend took a pregnant test photo from google and claimed it was mine. They had this whole story of me being pregnant. i’m not nor do i want to be.

I have/had its really unclear feelings for one of my best friend. I've asked and she said no.

We've stayed good friends since we were really close and I like it that way.
However last week we ended up holding hands for a long time we were both drunk and it wasn't much but those things just seep into my mind and make me feel what I know is a false sense of hope. I talked about that with her while I gave a birthday party for her.

I'll admit I'm an idiot for the timing since we once again were both not sober. But she panicked and later just repeated that she can't do this anymore like being friends. It's the following morning and I don't know what to do.

I don't want to lose her friendship.

I haven't been using reddit for very long, but I felt the need to post on this sub.

I have a general plan, but I'd like any advice, big or small, you guys have to offer! :)",13Jun2020,2
407,"Today I've decided that I need someone to help me figure out what's really wrong with me. I'm going to be as honest as I can be, and you don't have to be kind when you comment. I want the advice you give me to be 100% real, even if you think I'm a horrible person. 

For as long as I can remember, I have never truly trusted anything enough to confide my feelings in. Even when I had attempted to write in diaries, I had never wrote how I really felt. When I try to be vulnerable it seems that I always subconsciously put up a front and don't let my true feelings show. 

In all honesty, I can admit that I'm not a very good human being. Even saying that now I know that later on I will feel superior to other people. I never show this grandoise behavior though. Despite this, I always find myself feeling very jealous and vain towards other people. Even for the littlest things. Maybe it's an inferiority complex? 

I'm honestly not sure what's wrong with me psychologically. I've been to a therapist before when I was in the 5th grade. However, I had found that I couldn't make it through the session without lying. I've also found that I'm very good at faking emotions, not that I don't feel them, but for some reason I always feel the need to pretend to act a certain way. 

I also have a tendency to lie and manipulate those around me. I even do this to people I consider to be close to me. As for how people view me, they see me as this cute, funny, and kind person who lives a very horrible, sad life. 

The truth is, that's not the case at all. In fact, by societal standards my life is quite good. I have a mother and father who are still married and they care  about me and my siblings. Together, they make about 7,000$ a month. 

Despite all this though, I often play the victim and convince people that my mother is abusive. I also pretend I don't know who my real father is and that I have all these step dads because my mom's a whore. I make my life out to be so terrible to gain sympathy from others. 

Now that I see what I've done typed out, it kind of sickens me that I do that. Why do I feel the need to lie and manipulate people? Why did I end up being so messed up? I had somewhat of a decent childhood though. Well, despite the fact that I was beat and screamed at quite often growing up, by both my parents and siblings. It's not as though I hold a grudge against them for it. Actually, I'm not angry at all for that. 

So why did I turn out like this? I've constantly pondered that question for some time now. But for some reason, I can't see myself stopping this behavior. It's not as though I can talk to anyone about this and gain insight. I'll be viewed as a horrible person by the people I know. 

I don't ever want people to see the real me. Actually, I'm not even sure there is a ""real"" me. I feel as though I can block out any remorse for my actions at will. 

Maybe I should mention this too but, when I become infatuated with someone, or in other terms, ""like"" someone I try my hardest to be close to them. Although I don't show it, I get very angry and jealous when people of the opposite sex interact with them. I think about the person I like constantly. I always fantasize and think about different scenarios with them. I'm aware about how much I tend to obsess over said person, but I just feel such an emotional connection to them that I can't help it. You probably wouldn't even be able to fathom how much I adore this person. 

And this isn't towards just one particular ""crush,"" this is towards anyone I've ever ""liked"" even growing up I would feel this way. 


I really do want to change this behavior. I just feel as though my brain is stuck like this. No matter how hard I try, I just can't change, even though I want to. 

I would love to hear your opinions, good or bad about this. I would like to finally hear what people think of me.",13Jun2020,1

412,"Hi Reddit, this issue has been weighing on my mind for some time now and I would really appreciate any feedback. This is my first post so I'm sorry if it's long.

**Backstory:** 

I (20F) have been trying to heal and process the anger/ mental trauma that my parents' terrible marriage had on me. I recently had a heart to heart with my mom about how this period of our lives had impacted us. I was able to forgive her and start to clearly understand what had happened between my parents. 

I always understood that there was something amiss with my father.  When my parents aggressively fought almost daily, I was too young to comprehend what I was hearing and seeing. I sort of locked my emotions and everything away, festering an immense hatred for my parents which I am still working on dealing with.

**Why I Dislike My Father:**

My suspicions regarding my father were confirmed by my mom during our talk, and it was even worse than I had originally thought. I found out that every night till 5 am he had gone out with his “buddies” to party and drink etc., he did this on Christmas and important holidays too (I was told when I was younger, that he was out for business). During this time he would also cheat on my mom countless times.

Among other atrocities such as preventing my mom from divorcing him, being a spineless coward to speak up when his friends harassed her, and many others which are too personal for me to share here. I was truly disgusted with how my dad treated my mom in their 20 year-long marriage.  

A year ago, I decided to forgive him for the personal issues *I* had with him for my own sake of moving on (which I won't go into in this post) but I can't forgive him for being a dick to my mom, especially as a young woman I can't imagine overlooking his actions.

**The Issue Now:**

My mom, now separated from my father, has started to live her life peacefully. She told me that he had been a bad husband, not a bad father. And that I have only heard her side, thus I should continue to love and hang out with him as he had his reasons in the past too. Which I understand. He had always supported me and listened to me during my darkest times. He tries to hang out with my younger brother and me once a week, packing lunches and planning activities. He is now putting in the effort to be present with us. **He also actively supports my education and sends me a couple of hundred dollars every month to help fund it.** 

Now with everything that I know, I don't think I can view him in a positive light anymore. Which I'm saddened by as I honestly thought that I could start to move on and develop a relationship with my father. 

I haven't seen him for a month and been ignoring his calls and texts. Since I work and have gotten scholarships + loans, I thought I could just not talk to him and eventually cut him out; living without his support. However, my grandma has been pushing me to quote: **“leach off him as much as I can because we never know when he would get a new mistress and stop supporting my education, and that's the least he can do”**

Please help me as I'm so conflicted with my emotions. 

**TL;DR** I found out that my dad was a huge ass to my mom and want to distance myself while still getting money from him for my education, even though we have just started to get along.",13Jun2020,3

When I was in my first and second year, I wanted to get into companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, etc. I knew that a CS graduate should always avoid getting into companies like Infosys and TCS because the projects offered in these companies is not of the best quality.

I explained this to him and he was totally dismissive about it and cracked a joke even though he knew I was rattled by it.   Wanting to avoid an altercation I mentioned how disrespectful I thought he was being and just drove off.   A few hours later I got a message nitpicking about something totally irrelevant which I was shocked at.   When I said I was disgusted at his reaction to my friends death he dismissed it again didn’t apologise and kept his back up and said not to bother coming to his again.  We have a business arrangement which makes things sticky.,13Jun2020,2

Hello everyone. I recently moved into a flat and I really really like one of my flatmates. The situation is a bit weird though, so I have no idea how to approach it.

I’m 23 and he’s 20. He’s generally a very open minded person and he’s never stated his sexuality. Yesterday though, I found out that he apparently has only had sex/relationships with women. 

Here’s some stuff he mentioned during our conversation yesterday:

1. He said that he mostly goes to gay clubs and he’s actually kissed and (non-sexually) messed with lots of guys there (he said as many guys as girls.)
2. He (jokingly?) said twice that he’d like a sugar daddy.
3. He said he hasn’t particularly enjoyed the sex he’s had so far(which is with women) and he hasn’t really been able to stick with one/he doesn’t really believe in “love”.
4. He actually said he’s happened to try pegging 2-3 (with a woman obv) times and he enjoyed it a lot.

I’m not saying he’s not or can’t be straight, but he generally comes across like a guy who could try something with a guy and some stuff just add up. 
I don’t know if he finds me attractive or not or if he has even thought of that because he knows about my sexuality but I’m not sure if he’d consider anything anyway due to us being flatmates and we’ve both stated we really want to make more friends. 

He generally appears (and he’s sort of said) to be high/tipsy often and he actually said that he’s always been under the influence of something whenever he’s done anything sexual, from kissing to actual sex.

How could I possibly make any moves to see if he’s or could be interested to try? I feel like I could only approach him if we went out and got wasted. 
We’ve only been together for like 10-12 days in the flat by the way. 

Thanks fam. Hope you’re all safe.",13Jun2020,2

431,"I am 19 years old and I live in the Netherlands. I feel like a total loser,I have no job and I haven't even finished highschool yet.

I was born in the Netherlands.My sister and I were about two years old when we moved to the U.S.Despite the constant bickering between my parents, I enjoyed my life there.Long story short,my parents got divorced in 2012 and my mom, my sister and I moved back to the Netherlands.At first I did fairly well at school, but then in my third year, I started to lose motivation and I skipped school a lot.That lead to me not passing my third year, but instead of doing the year over I decided to go to a new school.This school allowed its students a lot of freedom, we had no classes and were basically free to decide what and when we wanted to study.This did not work for me either as I need structure and organization so I ended up dropping out from that school as well.After that I went to yet another highschool and I dropped out again.Now I am studying from home and I am taking state exams. These exams are slightly different from the ones you'd take if you were attending a normal high school here. They consist of a central exam, which is just a normal written exam and oral exams. Since I dont go to school and thus don't have to take tests, I am never entirely certain if I comprehend what I am studying correctly. Also, I have trouble concentrating on studying because I get distracted very easily.Whats more is that state exams are quite challenging because I have an oral exam in all subjects.I am taking exams in 2 subjects this year and if I pass that leaves 7 more left.I will be taking exams in the subjects English and Economics. At the start of all my oral exams I will receive an article which I have to summarize and be able to answer questions about, then I have to have a conversation with the examiners about whatever it is I have been expected to work on at home (presentation,book report) .For my English oral exam I have to give a presentation, answer questions about the 4 novels and 3 short stories I read and analyze 3 poems .For my economics oral exam I have to make two reports, one regarding the economical consequences of climate change and the other about how a shopping district might look in the year 2050.Although that may not seem like much, it feels like a lot to me.I have missed so much school that I feel like im too far behind to catch up. Going back to school is not an option for me, so I dont know what to do.Im not moving forward in life and I feel like I never will.I have no motivation left and I'm constantly tired. Even if I were able to finish high school, I highly doubt I would make it through college. I am very shy and awkward and I'm quite dumb as well. I just don't know what to do anymore.",13Jun2020,1

438,"TLDR at the bottom

This is a huge problem for me...

Looking back on a past relationship, I realized that I didn’t have very strong and definite boundaries. In my efforts to build that over the course of the past few of months, I’ve been trying to be assertive about my wants and needs and making an actual list of my values to go back to on my phone.

Unfortunately, people very dear to me have been commenting on the fact that I’m becoming ‘pushy’ and ‘aggressive’.

That wasn’t exactly the effect that I was going for, and I’m obviously very new to this so other than saying “I don’t appreciate when...” or “I feel upset when you do...” I really don’t know how else to voice my needs without sounding like a whiny b****.

Help? Is it my tone of voice? What is it?

TL;DR I’m trying to be more assertive when it comes to my boundaries but it’s making come across as pushy and aggressive to people close to me. 

How exactly can I be assertive without sounding aggressive? I’ve been reading a lot on this topic online but I need a *practical example* of this.",13Jun2020,1
440,"tl:dr at the bottom !!

my grades are good. i’m not a very bad student, but i’m not the bestest most amazing student ever either. i’m just your basic female student that get a’s but can’t explain basic math to the boy who sits by me and never pays attention and then needs help on homework at 9 pm. 

the problem is, i don’t think that i’ll get accepted into the schools that i want to get into. my dream school is Stanford, but when i compare myself with the accepted students, i feel absolutely terrible about myself. it seems like the admissions process for selective schools is so holistic, that unless i create 10 organizations, am president of a club, publish a book, and have 200+ leadership positions, i won’t even be considered. 

this puts so much pressure on me because i don’t know what i’m doing and i’m afraid my mom will be disappointed in me. i know what i want to study but i don’t know how to do extra-curriculars that are focused on my desired major. i don’t live in a place where i have endless opportunities. my mom knows nothing about higher education in america or america in general. none of my friends really help me. i asked my counselor about volunteering and she said to “google it.” i’m not confident or popular so i don’t get leadership roles. i don’t have a lot of money. i’m at a loss most of the time. i don’t know what to do. 

so when i think about college and realize that i don’t exactly have the highest chance of getting into a “good” college, i freak out because i feel like a failure before i can be one! my mom moved to america (and has a hard time here) to make sure i have a better life than her and i fail her? just thinking about it makes me want to cry. i value my mom so much and she doesn’t even know it. the only reason why i’m so worried about college and break down about it is because of her. i want to make her proud at least once by telling her “mom! i got into ______” but i’m afraid that i won’t even be able to say that sentence. 

i don’t know what to do. how do i stand out when i’m already a rising junior and don’t have much help? how do i make my mom proud when i don’t know how? i know that she loves me and that she’s understanding, but i can’t help but be so anxious to the point where i would rather die than disappoint her. 

tl;dr: i doubt that i’ll into a top college and inevitably make my mom disappointed when she’s already not too proud of me and it’s really scaring me. i don’t know what to do to get into the colleges that i want and make her proud.",13Jun2020,5

442,"I know it’s not illegal to move, especially away from your abusive family, but this really skeeves me out. There’s a long story behind this stalker (online ex, broke up ~2 yrs ago), but ultimately it is still on going after two years. I can’t even begin to get into the details, but I know for a fact that they are still watching my recently reactivated social media. I’ve had to pick up a lot of clues to come to these conclusions, but it’s very clear.  
  
Background for this specific incident,  
They texted me another apology about a few weeks ago, and it looked pretty sincere. The apology coincided with my reactivation of Instagram, so there’s the first clue about him watching. But it looked sincere, so I brushed it off, without even thinking about the number.  
  
This morning, something triggered a memory about him.  I previously hadnt replied to the apology, as advised by everyone. But after thinking about how much he tried to reconcile, I kind of wanted to text him forgiveness (just thinking). I went to reread the text, saw the #, and decided to look up the area code. He is WAY too close for comfort. I’m in a big city. But he knows my neighborhood. I was a stupid 16 yr old online.  
  
It’s closing into 2 years since I tried to sever the relationship. However, throughout this period, he has crossed my boundaries multiple times and tried to use my friends to reach me. As a teen, I just want so bad to live a regular online/plain life again, not constantly feeling like I have to hide. But I don’t think that will be possible.  
  
I don’t think my parents would help me. They’d kill me for having something go this far, and I don’t want to bring trouble for them. I don’t think this guy would be the type to hurt me physically, but he is definitely the type to try to “run in” to me, and I am terrified. I don’t know whether I should change my number, or continue keeping tabs on him. All of my social media except the private Instagram is not searchable and using a google voice number. His known accounts are currently blocked, as well as his new number, so Im blind. What’s my next move? Should I just wait and watch?",13Jun2020,1

444,"I'll try to make this as short as possible because the amount of detail I could go into would span into a small book.  For context: gf and I are in our mid 20s, with a 3 year old child.  We have been together almost 4 years.

To start:  my partner has a mother and 4 brothers.  Her mother is very care free about anything including her sons and daughter.  She works a minimum wage job and doesn't own anything except her car.  She's a bitter woman and won't go out of her way to help anyone without moaning about it.  I could tolerate her just fine up until the baby was born, same with the brothers.

The baby: our baby is born.  Everyone, including my own family, are telling us how much they cant wait to see our son grow.  It's comforting to hear it from both sides, especially from her side.

Within these 3 years, the mother has been a nightmare.  She consistently berates my partner over  the phone while cussing her for the smallest things, makes excuses as to why she cant spend time with her grandson(and godson) and has seen him a total of 10 times for about 10 minutes each time since he was born. 

 She speaks lowly of my own family, who are hard working, proud and very responsible people.  My family dont have much, but they value family and hard work.  They are always looking to spend time with our son and consistently make an effort without ever being asked, it is their choice.  She is obviously jealous that my family make the effort despite working 3 jobs and managing a household with twins.  My partners mother pays nothing in rent and spends everything on alcohol and dates with random men. 

The brothers: one is a stoner that is going nowhere in life and keeps to himself, one is in his 30s and is genuinely nice, and helped raise his own siblings.  

The last two brothers are the problem.  The first one cussed at my partner over the phone, claimed our son wasnt worth visiting by their mother, claimed my family were a joke and were miserable people.  

The second has a partner that accused my partner of being a pedophile, despite it never happening.  She said my partner could not look after a child properly and was an unfit mother.  The brother defended his partner and we are expected to join them at their sons christening next month.  

The problem: my partner constantly makes time for these people despite being called every name under the son, gets angry if I try to tell her it's okay to leave them be but she can't resist it.  She has been trying her best to mend her family but nothing ever comes from it, despite how much they insult her, our son or my own family.  Currently, I warned her that if the brother that insulted me and my family ever set foot in my house, I'd show him to the pavement.

I dont know how I can get it into her head that cutting family for being utter cunts is okay, without coming across as inconsiderate.  It brings unwanted stress to this house and our relationship.  

Bless anyone that reads this and gives me their opinion.  If anything is unclear I'll be happy to help describe it in further detail.",13Jun2020,5

449,"Bit of backstory to hopefully understand the situation. I'm in the UK, living in a council house. Before I was homeless for nearly two years, living in the dining room with me friend's who helped me get this flat. I signed up January of this year and movies in about February/March. In that time I was signing up to Universal Credit, a benefit I get because I cannot work due to mental health issues, and it took ages for it to finally be set up, resulting in me being behind on rent

Ive talked with the council several times to try and sort things out, and they understand that, due to me payments, I'm struggling as if is. However I got a letter today saying that, due to the debt, I could not only be taken to court, but I'd have to pay the over £300 court fees and that I must pay the £818.41 in full in seven day sto prevent this. I cannot do this, it's take me months too save up that much to pay in a lump sum

I have tried to explain to him why he’s a bad president, I mean how can you justly serve your people if your citizens are largely from demographics in which you do not like. Every time I’m in the room, he bring up the fact that trump is a great president or that the blm movement is bullshit.

I could take the time to focus on writing my novel (I can crank out a draft in one month, work on marketing, create content for an author's platform and schedule posts...) and get my license while taking care of the house more.

With the funds I have, I could take a writing class or skills class in one month or two. I have years in customer service and seems that's all I qualify for at the moment, a skills class can change that.

Or, I can just get another job that makes me miserable.

These are the options I'm considering, or the only ones I can clearly see, but I absolutely despise customer service. I can't keep doing it. I want to be an accountant but need my degree, I want to go into marketing, need a degree. I have a sincere, unhealthy contempt for the masses of society.

457,"She has been a very good friend but I think I’ve outgrown her. Now I feel like I can’t stand her anymore. She’s a very materialistic, “controlling” person who doesn’t seem to conceive life and people change. Here are some examples:

I broke my phone and had to use one that was literally crap. The day I met up with her and showed to her the new phone ( I bought in a second hand page she recommended to me) she picked the phone, took the case off and analized the phone looking for exterior imperfections. The phone didn’t have any but I don’t think its nice to do that. Then she inquired about the price and the stupid me told her.  I don’t think it matters.

One day when I was to go about to the bathroom she took my bag. No problem where we live someone can pass and steal us. But when I came back It looked like she revised my entire bag and told me it was messy. Hey! It’s my bag my problem! I feel now is not the first time she does this. Besides when I go to the bathroom while we are somewhere she also looks at my phone too. I have an iphone and whatsapp and instagram messages can be displayed without entering. She has no right to do that. (I’ve seen her doing this, sometimes she even deleted everything not to be caught)

Last, two years I had lost my virginity with a guy I was chatting during two months. However he lived in another country and that didn’t last long. The truth it’s the most “serious and stable” thing  I had with a guy. Meanwhile my friend has been in a relationship with her boyfriend for 4 years. ( We are both pretty young) She doesn’t stop remembering me about him knowing he stopped talking to me. It’s frustrating because it’s the past! And she knows perfectly it’s something I don’t like to talk to. 

On the other hand, I haven’t travelled during the summer in three years. The other day we were talking about contraceptives and I told her I would choose one if I had a boyfried because if FOR EXAMPLE I went to vacation with him during two weeks that one would be more comfortable. She told I just would need one because no one goes to weeks for vacation with a very “it’s impossible to for you to do this” face.

466,"His Facebook is full of 5-10 DAILY posts about police corruption and brutality since George Floyd's death. I mean just today at 8AM he already started posting things like as soon as he wakes up. He seems to revel in the anger and is arguing with people on Facebook left and right. When I think we are having a productive discussion about how to overhaul the system, he calls me pig-lover and ""too trusting of the system"" (which is funny because I've been a social worker for 5 years and am FULLY aware of the failed system). It's like he wants to be pissed off and when I suggest there are small things that do work, that maybe we can build upon for more police accountability, I'm suddenly a pig-loving shill. 

This is effecting his personal relationships as well. He punched a hole in the wall of his friends house (he lives/pays rent there) over an argument with his parents who I guess are pro-police. He publically shamed and called out his parents on Facebook and called them pieces of shit for their views. He's obviously stopped talking to them as well. It's gotten to the point I'm just going to unfollow him on Facebook.

 On any other subject we can have interesting, open conversations and we can peacefully disagree with each other. I get the anger dude, like I said I've helped people deal with the consequences of a failed system for five years now since graduating. But he's so enraged and intentionally feeding himself stories to keep the rage going I am worried about his mental and emotional health.

I’m confident I could pick up a job to work part time (he’ll, full time if need be), but I cannot make sense of any entitlements I’m available to. Am I able to collect a New Zealand student loan and / or allowance? Am I even entitled to study there to begin with?

And what are living expenses like there? I know that’s a broad area, but everything’s so expensive here comparatively, from what I’ve seen.

468,"I was having a shower this morning, and about 2 minutes in, my mom tells me she needs to go to the toilet. I shout for her to wait, I'll only be 3 minutes more. I end up taking about 4. My mum has been banging on the door but i don't take her seriously and shout that she's just making me take even longer because my brother and i always do the same even when we're not that desperate.

Now, when I come out, i'm really pissed because i'm currently on my rag so it's extremely awkward to leave the shower halfway through. I get even more pissed when my mom just takes her sweet time heading to the bathroom.

Now, to note, the bathroom door is currently broken and is literally on its last hinge.

As im yelling at her to hurry up from outside, and she's yelling back, the whole thing just flies off the handle and i open the door. And see my mom has shit her pants, and she is sitting with her shit covered ass on the side of the bath splashing water on herself. All over the floor.

I'm horrified. I am already aware of how unhygienic my mom is - when she normally goes to the bathroom, she only brushes the tips of her fingers under the tap, and flushes the toilet AFTER. Her phone screen and laptop keys are ALWAYS oily. I always wash my dishes when I take them out of the cupboard because when she 'washes' them they are greasy and covered in bits of food. But seeing her like this just confirms all my fears of how filthy everything is. I'm freaking out, yelling at her to not fucking touch anything.

She yells at me to close the door, but when i don't, she takes her fingers, clearly covered in crap, and waves them near my face, and then grabs the door to close it. With those same fingers.

I flip out. I start screaming. I can't use the bathroom to clean myself, because it's covered in her shit. I've always sprayed everything down with disinfectant, I've always washed my hands for thirty seconds, at one point i even used to douse myself with disinfectant in the shower. I am fucking terrified.

I pull the door off its hinge, and start dragging it out of the front door. That shitty door cannot stay in the house. My mom, obviously, is outraged. she comes out of the bathroom in a towel with bits of brown shit on it, and we're both screaming at each other. I push the door out of the house and run to the living room, holding the door closed before she can touch me. As i stand in the middle of the room, realising this may be the very room she shat in, my mom opens the door and starts rummaging everywhere in her shit covered towel to get her stuff. I start bawling and she says she'll call the police, and starts crying too.

She left and is currently out with a friend. When I did see her I ran into my room, but i hate my room because i know she keeps going in there and moving all my stuff, calling it 'tidying', and now i know how dirty she is. She never cleans, just shifts stuff from one place to another. I haven't talked to her since then. I don't know how to talk to her anymore. Whenever I've tried bringing up how she can be cleaner before - only wearing slippers inside, buying actual cleaning products instead of expensive smelly herbal liquids, cleaning her devices every now and then - she gets extremely defensive, saying that i need to stop behaving like an autistic person. I'm not autistic, I just don't like the floors being dirty, etc. :(

what should I do so that this incident doesn't get in the way of our relationship? how can i approach her about her hygiene issues without it ending in an argument?",13Jun2020,0

I have anxiety attacks at night due to my economy, and the pressure from uni is wrecking me.

Anyway, I was shocked that I got the interview, but went anyway confident that it would be a no. The interviewer was very intense and harsh, and he pressured me with many personal questions which I answered honestly. Suddenly, he pulls out a contract, and says great, youre hired. Keep in mind I am desperate for a job. I sign, half dazed, and he hands me some books to read,then pretty much pushed me out. I was starstruck, but when I came home, I realized my mistake. The contract says I have to pay 10000 kroners(1000 dollars) for a course in the middle of my exams, and work a minimum of 850 hours, way too much for me and my studies.

The thing is, the office only provide one blazer, I wash it everyday and air dry it. So I can't deny the smell. 

The issue isn't really that I'm stinky, I'm mostly hurt because my coworkers just didn't tell me up straight.

If you ever witnessed people talking about someone who stinks. How are people treating this?

What I need help with is how to approach the situation now with my coworkers. Of the smell side, I wash with extra stuff and machine dry my work clothes.

But on the human side, should I tell them to let me know if I stink? Or not?

The thing that was giving me anxiety and the things I was worrying about aren't important. I'm just wondering what do you think, is it healthy to just sit down and be sad sometimes. A part of me is scared that that would just make the anxieties and so called ""problems"" that don't really exists bigger and just make them more important then they are, since I'm giving them attention, rather then keeping them as some deep insecurities I carry around.

Since quarantine started I managed to use my time as best as I could. Started working out, reading, taking more care of my health, learning about what I want and generally just improving my life. And I'm very happy doing that. I don't feel stressed or under to much pressure or anything like that. It's just that the topic that gave me anxiety kinda popped up again, just as a normal part of life, and now I am confused whether I should just stop working, hug a pillow and lay down and think, most of which would probably be negative thoughts unfortunately.

It all started in the first year of high school. Me and Mark were made to sit next to each other in geography  and I never took much note of him. He was very quiet and seemed uninterested in talking to me and when he did, he had this inherent need to dominate me to show he was above me. I for one did not take it to kindly and confronted him on his nasty attitude. He was shocked and upset but I felt bad for him ,since he had no friends, so I talked it out with him and we became friends.

After that day, he changed to a completely different person.

* He Was interested in me and was now wimpy and he would start blushing every time I was nice to him.
* he made an effort to talk to me.
* He got my number and consistently texted/called me everyday.
* He learnt my whole school schedule and waited for me in each class.
* He knew my friends , people I’d talk to, where I’d go at particular times e.g
* He’d ask me personal questions. 
* He’d Go to my friends and ask about me.
* I tried hiding from him and made sure he knew I didn’t want to see him.but he still wouldn’t leave me alone.
* He had girlfriends but dragged me into there relationship issues.
* He said he had a crush on me and was no longer interested. But then someone played a prank on him saying I wanted to date him and he was really happy about it.
* He was pissed I had a bf.
* I told him to leave me alone and stayed in the girls toilet for the whole of lunch to avoid him and he was waiting outside.
* He’d stalk me around school.
* I was going home one day and turned around to see he was following me!
* He was angry I wouldn’t let him follow me home. 
* He’d threaten to go to my house if I didn’t agree with him.
* He’d put me in situations in where we’d be alone together.
* He wouldn’t accept the fact I didn’t want him anywhere near me. 
* He made sure he was the last person I talked to.
* He even tried to lure me Into a forest behind an empty park with him and his dog in a pandemic!

This guy would not leave me alone. 
He was making my life hell. It’s been 3 years, and we’re soon to be in year 10. I tried hiding, I tried running but he always finds me. I told Mark he was a stalker and to leave me alone. He then said to me he wasn’t a stalker and proceeded( and failed) to follow me home!

he’s less agressive but still keeps trying to stalk me which I don’t let him do. After the forest incident I’ve blocked him on WhatsApp. Idk what to do with Mark since were only 14 turning 15 there’s no way the police will do anything. What should I do?",13Jun2020,3

517,"My parents have been grading with my grades from year seven “you were at the top of your year now your average”, I feel like I’m just another statistic, I can’t study because it goes in one ear and out the other because it’s is so boring to me, I read the information but gain no knowledge. I want to succeed but I find it impossible for me.

521,"I stutter. I did my entire life. Doesn’t bother me that much. Except for when I CANT SAY MY OWN NAME. I stutter on it bad. 

My issue is when I’m at a social event or meeting new people and have to say my name. For some reason if we start the conversation off without introducing ourselves, I might stutter here and there and by the time I get to my name they already notice I stutter and it’s all good. They get it. We had an entire conversation and they got to know me for a little bit. So it doesn’t bother either one of us. 

For some reason when we start off introducing ourselves and I say my name with my little stutter it turns weird. They think I’m nervous or something. Some people ask did I forget my name (dumb response lol) then I make it more awkward by saying “sorry I stutter” then they feel bad. Then the entire conversation turns weird. Almost like I’m a charity case lol. 

What can I say to make the situation not so awkward. I’m always going to stutter on my name and I’m fine with it but what can I say to make the person feel less uncomfortable? Or should they just grow up and realize people stutter lol ?",13Jun2020,6
522,So basically there’s this girl that is really nice to me and we get along great then I started to catch feelings for her but my friends caught on so I generally just said I didn’t because I wanted them to stop annoying me about her. But then my friend has started to give her attention so then she started to flirt with him while she was still continuing to talk to me. He said he only wants her for a one night stand and isn’t looking for anything serious with her. I don’t know if I should tell him to help me out to date her or just be the better person and let him enjoy himself. She is way out of my league but I feel like if I work hard enough I could get some sort of way with her. My friend can get other girls a lot more easily. So what do I do?,13Jun2020,0

524,"Hello, first of all i'd like to apologize if i will have some grammar mistakes, i'm from eastern european country (Learned english in school a bit and through games)  


So i have a problem.... quite a big problem.  
My parents are divorced and my Dad used to send a whole bunch of meat over to our apartment (like 5-10kg at times). My mom would put the meat in the Freezer on the therasse (We only kept the freezer there and nothing else, cus we barely was going on the balcony (There was a door which kept all the smell on the balcony inside the balcony, despite the window being open, it doesn't matter.  


We didn't even consume that meat.. to the point it is sitting there for roughly 8 years, yeah you heard me.. 8 years. We didn't touch that freezer for that much time. ..... UNTIL TODAY, we decided to get everything out of there.. We couldn't get the meat out because it was frozen, and impossible to pull it out, so my mother decided to turn off the cable from the electricity to stop the meat from freezing, so it can melt and so we can take it out easier, but we didn't think of 1 issue(the smell).   


The smell is so intense, i never smelled anything like that before in my life.. gosh.. if i had to compare poop with that i think that rotten meat smells at least 5 times worse.   


So as we were taking the meat out in the trash bags to the containers, we left some drops of water all over the apartment and from our mistake, as we were holding the trash bags with our hands, our hands got contimated as well, we forgot about it as we were tryign to get all of it out but we touched lots of stuff in the apartment  such as, desk, toilet door, doors to other rooms, etc.. So after everything is finally out, we cleaned it up with some stuff we had for cleaning and closed the door of the balcony and tried to ventilate the entire apartment. We all took a shower and threw the clothes in the washing machine but the smell was still there, all around the apartment..  It's still there even after ventilating for about 3-4hours + having air conditioner ON the entire time.   


The smell is very intense, i don't know what we should do...",13Jun2020,1
526,"We are both 18 and know each other cuz we are in the same class in high school. I met him 2 years ago. We are rly good friends like rly comfortable around each other and have the same laid back vibe. We are into the same things and have a lot in common. But we never ever hung out. Only to go to the gym together after school but thats it. Also he calls me everyday since the day we became friends. But apparently he does that to all his friends (he lives alone so feels alone a lot). At some point in our relationship I felt like he treats me as one of the guys. But recently since quarantine, he gives me mixed signals. Like sends me pick up line memes but when I ask if he is serious, he says ""hell naaaah"". Also when I asked him to explain his recent weird behavior, he says he is like that to all his girl friends (which I dont rly believe) and then he asked me out as a joke which hurt.

I really really like him but I dont show it much. Anyways we are both moving to different countries after the summer and Im very sad about that. I will really really miss him. I saw him yesterday cuz it was our graduation. He did call the morning to ask me if i wanted to go to a bar for a beer before our graduation thing. I said yes but it didnt happen cuz I was too fucked up (we all drank at my friend's house before the thing). Tho i did tell him the morning when he called that i was going to a bar later that night and then to a rave with some friends (that he doesnt know cuz they arent from school). He was super envious tho cuz he wants to rave too.

Anyways he called me yesterday after the graduation at 10.45pm. I was at the bar when he called. He asked me if i was going to the rave. I said yes but at 3AM and that he could come if he wants but he sais he doesnt think he'll be awake. But he did say that he wants to meet my friends one day (i feel like he just wants to see if they are fine so he can fuck with them but idk I think too much). He also suggested me and him go out to a bar on his birthday (in a week). I said that I was super down for that :).

Anyways im gonna see him on monday cuz we have to go to school to empty our lockers. Do I confess? Or do I not so that I dont ruin our friendship? Is it fucked up to confess before his birthday? Ugh im so lost but I love him so much.",13Jun2020,1
529,"Context: My wife's family has 3 rental properties in a trust (her, her father, and her brother... the trust is hers / her brother's, but her dad has lifetime rights). One of the properties is open... it's a renovated old-school farmhouse that sits on about an acre. We'd basically only have to pay taxes / insurance... so, our rent would drop from $1250/mo (what we pay now) for a 2bd townhouse to around $350-400/mo. 

I've just been weighing out the pros and cons, and want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Pros:

* Next year, my wife enters her third year of school, she'll have to leave her part-time job... this will help a \*lot\* with that loss of income.
* We'll be able to pay off most of our outstanding debts in about a year out there.
* Right now, we're still WFH anyways, and it sounds like even when we go back, it'll only be a hybrid WFH situation.
* It's a house, not a townhouse... so, no immediate neighbors.

Cons:

* The internet sucks out there, and I'm WFH as an IT analyst... Right now I have about 100mbps, there I'll be averaging about 20mbps. I question whether I'll be able to do certain tasks well.
* It's a 45 minute commute to work, but it's also about 20 to everything else.
* There could always end up being family dynamic issues over it.

So, Reddit, what would you do in this situation?",13Jun2020,1

I think he desperately needs help from a professional, and every time we try to help him he throws a tantrum (we have never mentioned autism/aspergers though). I am at a loss - I think having some sort of diagnosis would give him some relief (hopefully) in understanding his difficulty in connecting and maintaining friendships.

538,"So as the title says, I have a crush on my best friend. We’ve basically been attached at the hip for the past 4 years and we tell each other everything and we’re constantly hanging out. At first, my feelings toward her were just a little crush, but not I can’t stop thinking about the possibility of being with her. I’m a lesbian and she says that she’s confused with her sexuality which gives me hope. I have a feeling we both like each other but I don’t know if I’m reading into things.

539,"Ever since quarantine abruptly started, things became different to me, emotionally, mentally. My thoughts always revolved in school since I really don’t have a circle of friends to hang out with after school. So, that given, I distract myself with school, like literally. I’m a part of the student council and a straight A student. Prolly, the only reason I have people who “seems” like my friends and are nice to me is because I’m useful in terms of group of activities and quizzes. I don’t really mind though, as long as I, myself is doing good in school, I don’t mind helping them (lol, is that even considered helping?.. nah, that’s not point here..)

Anyways, I’m wary of my grades. When quarantine started all of a sudden, I had a lot to catch up to, since I was excused a lot from classes because of some contests the school signed me up for in which they didn’t asked my permission if I even wanted to join in the first place and they had put me in a place where I couldn’t say “no”. Due to that, I was so focused on preparing for the competitions, they permitted me to stay in the library most of the time, and excused myself from class because of sChoOl pRidE. After the competition, I missed a lot of classes, and teachers wouldn’t give me special classes in order to catch up saying they were busy and that they don’t want to give me “special treatment” because it would be “unfair” to other students. They adviced me to ask from other students who are top in class to help me out, so I did. It wasn’t really a problem asking help from them because if they were in my place, I’d be happy to lend them a hand. When I asked (let’s call her Mae) Mae to help me catch up with a some of the lessons, she helped me. To which I was really glad. She even let me borrow her notes!

When exam day came, it was like any other exam day because, I answered all the questions without having a hard time.

When we got the results, I had lower marks than I usually get. Like far from I usually get. Specifically the subject Mae assisted me with. Since I was the one distributing the exam papers, I saw that Mae aced the exam. I felt betrayed. I mean how could someone do that? Why would they even? I know she was after my spot since high school started but I didn’t know she would do just that! Because if I were her, I would never do that to her because we are both doing our bests and there’s no reason to bring each other down.

That exam would determine how we did in the third quarter of the school year. I was nervous of the results but I just said to myself that if I wouldn’t be able to maintain my top spot that quarter, I could always get it back on the fourth quarter which is also the last quarter of the school year. But then, quarantine came and I wasn’t able to do that. 

During quarantine, we were given projects and assignments do at home. I did all mine already and passed it to the teachers. But days almost prior to the deadline, Mae sent my cousin a DM, to secretly take a picture of my outputs saying, “She needed ideas.”, “She doesn’t know what the output should look like.”, or “I will only understand the question if I get to see an “example answer” (which was my answer.)”

The fact that my cousin even sent her my outputs made me so mad. Now, we’ve got outputs nearly identical to each other. My cousin knows what she did during the third quarter exam, but she did her a favor anyways? Bro, the audacity they’ve got! 

My mom’s going to get my card soon and I’m nervous. She’s not the type to flip out if my grades go down, though she assures me that it’s okay, I still know she worries.

Mae already knows her results though. And I’ve got to say they got higher than her previous results. For the record, I didn’t find it out myself. She sent me a DM about her results weeks ago since she talked our teacher in giving it to her since they’re kind of close. And yes, every grading she DMs me her results.

So what should I do with people like her? How should I deal with them? I don’t want to start holding grudges on people. Please help. How to make her stop? :((",13Jun2020,1

543,"I have seen many people include their pro-life stance regarding Black Lives Matter, saying ""If you were to kneel for 1 minute for each black life lost to abortion since Roe v Wade, you'd be kneeling for 38 years. ALL Black Lives Matter.""

After doing a lot of research, my personal opinion is: Whether you're a pro-life or pro-choice - you are entitled to your opinion. BUT why do you have to include it when it comes to the current BLM movement? The purpose of BLM movement is to be against police brutality and systemic racism. Systemic racism is one of the biggest reasons why POC and Black people have the highest abortion rates. So without figuring out a solution to removing systemic racism, we can't talk about banning abortions.

I have spent days calling out people who shared this image, and I have tried to explain why they are in the wrong for bringing their religious opinion to this matter. All of their responses are - if my black \[religious\] friends can say this, why can't I?

544,I live in an apartment building that houses all college students. Last night my neighbors who I have never met were throwing a rager at like 4:30 am which is odd because I’ve never heard anything from them before. It was really annoying because music was blaring and they were yelling at the top of their lungs for so long I suspected they maybe were on something stronger than just alcohol/weed whatever. This morning I got woken up by their iPhone alarm. It’s been 4 hours since the alarm started going off. I thought the phone would die at some point but I guess it’s plugged in? Anyway when is it appropriate to suspect someone’s unconscious or something worse enough to go check on them/let my building staff know?

545,"India is in lockdown, and just two days before the lockdown, a homeless lady came to our house with the excuse of taking a bath. We know that lady since years(10 years i guess). She usually wanders from house to house whom she knows and stays for a maximum of 3 days. She has two daughters living in Vasai, but she doesn't like staying with them because she has a great appetite for food and she doesnt like general everyday food.

when she  goes from house to house, she usually gets enough money with which she enjoys her life. And she is ultra health conscious to such an extent that she gets annoying. She will never ever eat Yesterday's food. she is ultra clean. That's OK. But she has a lot of prejudice too, especially against muslims. She says that muslims are bad, evil, cheaters, etc,etc. this really pisses the hell out of me(im not muslim)

She really pisses everyone in the house and i bump into her every second due to our house being sufficiently sized for that. She is shrewd and takes stuff behind my moms back and says that she always asks before taking(YES SHE ASKS ME AND MY SISTER WHO ARE DEFINITELY NOT ADULTS AND HAVE NO RIGHT TO GIVE HER ANYTHING, REGARDLESS, THE TAKES IT.)

She compares me and my sister to some evil,useless,brainless,dumb, character like you'd expect in movies! And when she tells her stories,it seems that she is the damn saviour of her story

When im studying, Gaming, she will come to disturb me with her stuff (Tell me to search some shit on the internet)

She is always against me in opinion and she thinks that she is superior(blah, blah)                                       

Above all,She is taking control of our house by Instructing us to keep it clean, she tells me to clean my junkyard of precious electronics which i have kept at a corner of the house

I don't know why she likes to tinker with others lives!

She is an absolute Snitch and she is manipulating my Mom to some extent. I'm tired of her doing that

Once my mom told her something and she started saying 'you all are not treating me like a family member' Well, thats because of her behaviour

Even my mom is scared of her to some extent, she comes and stares at my moms medicine and is curious about them.

She is trying to learn how to control the remote of the smart tv and Im afraid that she might learn it( seriously at the age of around 75-80)

She gives example of people that have not listened to her shitty advice and have ruined their lives. And then she is advising me what to do in my life. She starts grumbling and calling me and my sister 'disobedient children' , 'dirty children' , 'Good for nothing/ brainless/ useless children', etc...........She also  calls our home 'garbage house' just because she sees my stuff around. She has absolutely no manners and humility and is controlling us. She tells us what to cook, what to eat, bla, bla

she has been stuck in our house for almost 2 months coz of this lockdown

Things get deeper..................

In the first few days of lockdown she was saying 'i wish i could leave this house and go somewhere else'.........but now since the lockdown has eased she is quiet and not bringing up the topic at all (Even though she can very well leave the house)

Im afraid that she might become a permanent familly member. My Mom says that she is tolerating her just for the fear of GOD, As we should help the poor and needy. But she is Full of Arrogance, Attitude, Prejudice {INSERT BAD HUMAN QUALITIES HERE} And she treats our family members with disgust (As if we were a bunch of monkeys)

At the end,  she is trying to change our mindset by giving fake examples of ""extremely holy/ saint like/ obedient children "" that she has come across her life

551,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

When I was younger (the age is hard to remember now, but in the range of 6-10), my brother started asking me to do certain sexual things with him. We do not need to divulge on the details of this except that there was no penetration and was more of the sexual teasing nature. This happened on multiple occasions. The events stopped for some time, but, several years later, he approached me about it again. This time I knew better and said no. It is important to note that I gave consent throughout these events and there was nothing forceful nor coercion. 

My brother is a few years older than me. I do not want to share too much information because I know he is on reddit as well. 

I have recently gone to a psychiatrist and been diagnosed with depression. I see these events as a likely contributor if not the catalyst of many of the self-worth and other issues I’ve had over the years. When I was younger, I repressed all of these memories and only thought about it on rare occasions. Now, for whatever reason, it has come to the top of my mind and I cannot stop thinking about it. I always told myself he didn’t really know what he was doing either because we were both kids and that made me feel better. Now I have realized that is not the case because the last time he asked me about doing things like that, he was in 7th or 8th grade (well past the innocent stage in my mind). 

For a long time, I was angry at my brother. I now try to treat him with respect even though we still have a strained relationship. 

The main problem I see is that my brother lives close to my parents who I am currently living with and we are a close family so we have dinners together occasionally. I’m not really sure how I could stop seeing my brother or avoid him while this is the case. My family would certainly ask about it and I cannot tell them about it because I also don’t want to damage my brother’s reputation. My family would almost certainly see me as an asshole if I just suddenly cut ties with him and give no reasoning at all. However, I believe seeing him occasionally isn’t great for my mental health. I plan on working this out in my own mind and with my psychiatrist but that will take some time.

However since quarantine they have been in contact about the job and then said we should look into an apartment together. This caught me off guard as it wasn’t phrased as a question. 

I am nervous about starting the job as i don’t have any friends there and had planned to move into a house share to meet people. I’m afraid that I won’t get on with my potential roommates and should just move in with my friend.

My mom (F51) has never liked this bag saying I need something more feminine and I'm sure you can guess where this is going. She washed it so it would be ""fresh"" when I return to work this weekend...... not only did the the label came off, but it's all torn up. When I asked her about it she did actually turn it inside out to look for the label ""not realizing"" how ratted the bag looked. When she couldn't find the label, she laughed and said I could still use it.

I know it probably wasn't intentionally ruined, because she did admit later that she accidentally put it in the dryer. But she never apologized and still tells me I should just get a new one that more girly.

568,"Hi r/advice

This is my first time posting to this sub but it's been something I've been wanting an opinion on for a while now, so about 6 years ago, I was 16, just joined Tumblr and had a 'fandom' I was into, but not being used to being in such a huge community on the internet, I joined under an alias, a fake name *(last name and all.)* and I engaged myself into the welcoming community, when I got used to it, I started really becoming friends with people and being welcomed for who I was, cause I remained being true to myself and still being me but just under a fake name.

But during that time, I came across this one girl, ***Hellen***, for explaining sake. *Hellen* was actively engaged in the community I joined at the time; writing stories and such, she met a significant amount of people before me and me being me and inexperienced in online social gatherings, she still made me feel welcome and introduced me to many members of the community who were amazing; so if it weren't for her, I wouldn't be where I am today, so bear with me.

Not shortly after joining and coming across Hellen and her friends; something always brought me and her closer together, from sharing 'fandom' things at the time, then after, to even more personal, and intimate things we'd never share to our own family, and in over just a year in late-2015, we officially dated over online. (and I want to preface that I never met her in person, but I always was honest to her of what I looked like, and vice versa.)

This relationship lasted for nearly a year until she decided first that it was too hard to keep going on. And I agreed, as heartbroken I was at the time, since there were times I've been disengaged with myself so it was making it harder to communicate our feelings, we still continued on and agreed we'll be better as friends.

After a month or so after giving a short break, I messaged her, and she responded with enthusiasm, happy to hear from me, and I honestly was very happy to hear from her also. We have since kept being friends, we've even joked about our short relationship at the time since we've both gotten over long after and we both still hold the same interests that we share, either being the old fandom we used to be apart of, new things we're engaged in, our work, school and even still share personal, keep-to-the-heart things.

The advice I'm asking for is this.. I still hold up that I'm this fake alias though after 6 long years, let’s say she’s always known me as *‘****Evan Holland****’*, I've lied about my age that I'm only a year younger than her, when in reality I’m two years younger, it got a point where I made a fake Facebook, Insta and Snapchat account under the alias ‘*Evan Holland*’ to add her (and even all the other amazing friends I've met since.) but in my heart, even all these years past, I don't want to lie to her anymore.

And because of this long lasting lie of a name I think she believes I am, I've allowed myself to start being not comfortable anymore, so there are days, weeks, to months even, we don't talk and that's my fault cause I keep that at the top of my thoughts, but yet, when I message her, we pick up a conversation as if a day hadn't passed.

I'm about to turn 22, and I want to tell her the truth that I'm not '*Evan Holland*' as she's known me since 2014, but I don’t know how she’ll take it if I tell her, Part of me wants to believe she’ll understand and look past it, but another part of me feels like she’ll feel betrayed, hurt and never talk to me again.

So r/advice. What should I do?",13Jun2020,1

He's anxious about catching Covid, and I can tell that this is very different from any other type of concern he's ever had. My parents are worried and have advised him multiple times not to carry on like this. He's used his allowance to buy himself hand sanitizer and disinfectant (separate from the ones we use in the house).

579,"Vehophobia, I gotta call it like it is. My mother was in a serious auto accident when I was in elementary school, got a TBI and has never quite been the same. Then my parents didn't support me getting my license at the traditional age of 16, so I finally got it at 22 - but by that time the fear had brewed inside me to be much stronger. 

I avoid driving at almost all costs because of the fear that it creates for me, which manifests in physical symptoms like a pounding heart and sweaty hands in addition to mental stress. I always feel like I am going to lose control of the vehicle and it's terrifying. Today I finally realized that I need to get treatment for this, when I had a doctor's appointment scheduled and I cancelled it just so I could avoid driving. 

People around me seem to think I'm silly, and that I just need to say a prayer before getting on the road or basically ""suck it up"" - and I get it, driving is really a necessity in the world we live in. Yet this runs really deep for me, and I feel like I need more practical solutions than just attempting to stuff my fear down with a cork.

So I grew up in a veey strict muslim family and there where a lot of rules that were hammerd into me. As I grew older I realized that I didn't want to be Muslim so I became atheist.

I am able to drink and eat pork without feeling guilt and I have been able to remove or change most rules out of my system.

However the idea that someone else has already had sex kind of disgusts me. Mainly because I was always told by my parents to *imagine a dirty dick in her vagina* and that was their point.

Everytime I kind into that weird place in a relationship where sex becomes an option I tend to retreat because my mind flashes a disgusting dick in her vagina. I have a very vivid mind and seeing that shit makes worried about std's and how some girls lie about their hygine and I just get extremely turned off.

I try and try but it's like forcing two magnets that won't click together. I really want to have sex or at least have experimented with it enough to the point where I am able to be comfortable with my own sexuality. Also pleasing my future significant other one would be nice.

581,"So I struggle with mental health issues and have a healthy support system in regards to professional help. I have lost all my closest/good friends over the majority of my life and the biggest contributing factor was when my ex cheated on me and since guys stick with guys I lost all my friends to him since they chose him since I guess it was easier. Other friendships ended due to going to different schools or misunderstandings where the other party refused to acknowledge any fault and I either had to be the bad guy or we weren't friends. I acknowledge my faults too, I can overreact at times and struggle with my mental health at times.   


Its been over 2 years now, and moving on seems to be beyond me. I still dream about my old friends and my ex, I still get caught up on it at random and can't shake it. It still has enough of a hold on me to bring me to break down.   


I've also failed to build any new friendships as this happened in the last few months of high school and so socializing with people my age has become difficult. I am working on a new friendship at the moment but it's early days and don't feel comfortable getting super emotional with them, plus most people want to have fun with their friends not deal with their baggage.   


I did reconnect with some of these friends and got some apologies for how they acted and I was hopeful, those apologies soon became nothing but words as their behavior showed they had no care for me and seem to have embraced their worst qualities, they've become quite misogynistic sadly. 

I've done the obvious, blocking them, removing myself from their direct social circle (I don't even HAVE a social circle), worked with my psych, and am trying to make new friends.   


I just don't really know what to do anymore, how to move on. I've given it time, and done all the right things. I still love these people for some reason despite the pain, I just want to forget and move forward without my dreams constantly reminding me.

582,"(edit: TLDR at the end) 
There's this friend of mine (let's call him Josh) who I'm really close with. We're two people in a group of three and the three of us constantly hang out. For the past week or so, I had a feeling that he was annoyed at me since he was leaving me on read, acting really standoffish, etc, but tried to convince myself I was overthinking (I'm as dense as a rock, keep that in mind). 

I hung out with Josh and the other friend (let's call her Heather) today and he seemed really tense. He would barely talk to me and even when he did, it was to ask me on what days I was going to an event so that he could purposely avoid going on those days. I didn't know this at the time.

Anyways, Josh left first to head off somewhere else and it was just me and Heather. That's when she confirms my gut feeling that Josh was annoyed at me this whole time. I ask her why and she said she's not exactly sure, but she says that she knows for a fact that he's annoyed at me for multiple reasons, not just one thing I did. 

I think what really annoyed him is when the three of us were hanging out last week. Apparently he'd gotten bad news that day, but I misinterpreted him being sad as him being tired so I continued to joke around. Thinking back on it, I should've asked him if he was alright. I feel like a jerk and I know that this is my fault.This isn't the first time this has happened and people have told me I'm bad at reading the room. I've tried to improve and fix it, but it's quite difficult. Not only that, but I've also been a really selfish friend in general to him and I can't help but think that I'm such a horrible person.

I want to confront Josh and sort it out with him. I want to apologize, maybe ask him to tell me if I'm hurting his feelings in the future because a majority of the time I'm not aware that I'm doing so. (In my culture, we're expected to be able to read the room really well and adjust accordingly, but because I can't do that, I want to do the next best thing and try to improve and do that now.) But at the same time, Heather told me that Josh wants space from me. I'm not sure if I should confront him because I'm afraid he'll get even more annoyed with me. I want to respect his decision to keep away from me because I know that I hurt his feelings. I feel like if someone were to hurt my feelings and then confront me about it, I'd get more annoyed with them. But at the same time, I'm afraid that he'll never forgive me and we'll just drift apart. I'm a pretty quiet and boring person, so naturally all our mutual friends would go to him. But the thing I'm most afraid of is losing our friendship. even though I didn't deserve it, he was so sweet and compassionate and an overall great friend. I don't want to just let him go like that. Even if he were to talk to me again, I'm afraid that he's going to act like nothing happened and we'll move on from this. The unresolved conflict could rear its ugly head at us and make things worse if we were to argue.

tldr; My friend is annoyed at me for multiple things I did. I'm not sure if I should confront him and sort things out or respect the space he wants from me.",13Jun2020,2
583,"Hi, I have a question, I don't know if I am expecting too much but whenever my university gives us a long break, none of my friends ever make the first attempt to contact me (we live in different states) it is always me who texts them first, if I don't text them they don't make the attempt to talk to me. 
During this lockdown period, it's been over two and a half months since I have spoken to them, and I am sure it's going to continue until it's my birthday and they will have to contact me to wish me out of obligation. 
None of them are necessarily selfish people, but they never make the effort with me, but they do so with others because I keep seeing them tag each other in memes, and stories and make video calls to each other. 

It has come to a point that it's now only going to annoy me if they wish me on my birthday and pretend like them not contacting me for so long is completely normal. 

Is it the right thing to cut off these people from my life and stop investing in trying to grow the friendship?

I’ve always been outspoken and opinionated, and I like to be vocal about what I think/how I feel. Of course when it’s appropriate or within the privacy of my home, but I do tend to get amped up.

If anything I’m yelling towards him but I don’t notice if I am getting too loud. This is even when we are at home by ourselves, no one can hear us yet he still tells me to be quieter.

It hurts my feeling being constantly told to be quiet, and I tend to stop talking immediately. He has told me that I can keep talking but I just need to be quieter but I generally don’t because I am upset at being interrupted and then shut down in the middle of a conversation.

596,"In short, I have still been entertaining the company of someone who was absolute shit to me for the entire time I've known him. Here's the long story just to recount how terrible he is. Let's call him J- I met J when we were 14. He was my first relationship and we lost our virginity to each other. About 2 months in he broke up with me and I found out that he had been carrying on an entire other relationship the whole time we were dating (with his ex, let's call her M). Of course I was furious but I was young and dumb so I directed my anger at M instead. After that me and J were on and off for about 4 years. Each time we broke up it was because he was cheating on me with M. He really did some sadistic shit like texting her in front of me on valentines day and not stopping even when I was bawling my eyes out. Then we just hung out as friends for a couple years up until 2 years ago. Even when we were just friends he still managed to be an asshole. One time after we smoked weed he said he could hang out that night but ended up basically abandoning me while I was high as fuck because he forgot he had work, and the most recent time I gave him money to buy me some weed and he just never got back to me. He texted me like 6 months later out of the blue apologizing, then we arranged a time to meet up for him to give me my money. We agreed on 6:30. I left my friends house early so I could be on time, and when i texted him at 6:15 he said he didn't even go to the bank yet so I just told him to venmo me.

Despite all this, we both still value each others company very much. Whenever we got back together or wanted to start hanging out again, we would text each other at the same time one of us was thinking about the other. Whenever we miss each other we show up in each others dreams. I feel an insanely strong connection to him. Whenever I hang out with him after not seeing him for a while, it feels like the most comforting thing in the world. A couple months ago I texted him for the first time after not seeing him for a year and he said he was glad i texted him because he'll always have a soft spot for me.  He got a new phone so he didn't recognize my number at first but he knew it was me even when I just said hi. Not that I believe him because most of the time he is a liar but I still felt happy when he said those things. This is all pretty embarrassing because I would not tolerate this behavior from anyone else. I do not know what drives us to each other time and time again. Once again, I am feeling a very stronge urge to hang out with him even though I'm happy in life. We have known each other for 8 years now and i wonder when or if we'll ever grow out of it.

598,"(16M) My parents have been separate for about a year but now that they've both found someone else I feel like the deal's been sealed. I've been living for my great aunt since I was 11 because they were both drug addicts but I always wanted to eventually go back and live with them once they got better, they did end up getting off drugs but unfortunately their marriage didn't survive it. Now that they're separate I feel as though I have nothing to go back to and my dream's been crushed. I just wanted to go and be loved and parented by mom and dad bu that'll never happen now. My dream is literally dead. I never got that much attention from my parents because they were drug users and now it causes me to act out because I want someone to care about me and guide me through life and I want someone to be proud of me.

600,"First off, if there is a better sub for this, please let me know. The ones I could find were more about opinions on specific cars. I'm just looking for general advice here. 

So a couple years ago, I got a new car. But, I did it with my dad, he handled all the negotiating, and I was really just there to sign papers and drive off. I pay for it myself, he just wanted to go and handle negotiating since I'd never done it. And to be honest, watching him handle it, I thought he was a total asshole to the car salesmen. We had like 3 guys from management come out and tell him they couldn't go any lower. I don't have patience for all that, but I also obviously want to pay less for a car if I know the sticker price can be reduced. 

The car I got was purchased with the mentality that I'd be commuting over an hour a day to work, not really the car I wanted. Well I ended up getting a much better job, pays better, and it's 10 minutes from my house. The last year and a half, I've been saving, and want to now get the car I actually want.

601,"I have a rare disease which has caused a secondary lung disease for me - my friend getting married is very aware of this. Her wedding was supposed to be this summer and instead of pushing it back a year due to COVID she pushed it back to October of this year. Just got a text this morning from her MOH nailing down plans for bachelorette party in a month. I know the bride and at least the MOH have not been social distancing (they’re in FL now at bars and stuff). I feel so uncomfortable with this entire situation and I’m also upset that my friend getting married hasn’t once acknowledged my lung disease OR COVID at all to any of the bridal party.

603,"Throwaway account. I really need advice.

I was so bored during quarantine that I just started talking to guys online. I met a guy on Reddit and we basically hit it off and have been talking and calling for one month. For me, it's really just for fun and a way to pass time in quarantine. For personal reasons, I also have no intentions of meeting him in person or it growing into something more. But recently, he has started hinting that maybe we could meet up. He told me he looked at flights to my city and says oh ""if"" we ever meet etc. This is really freaking me out. He is incredible and we have also gotten so close. We've never really done or said anything romantic. I consider him an online friend but nothing more than that. Since we are spending so much time together and it seems like he is seeing this going somewhere, I would like to end it now. I don't really want to string him along and honestly, I should probably invest my time in other things. My question is how do I tell him? What do I say? I really think he's a great person so I just don't want to ghost him. But like do I say I'm seeing someone and it wouldn't be fair to them to keep talking to him ? ( I have actually gotten more romantic with someone I actually know from real life and I see that going somewhere even tho it's early). Or should I just say we are getting too close and I need my time for other things? Please tell me how I can be a decent person but also get out of this.

I feel like this is a lot of people in quarantine because it's so easy to meet and talk to ppl online and detach yourself with the fact that they have feelings/are people. I feel so bad. I wish I'd picked up baking or knitting instead :(",13Jun2020,1

I’m taking 5 online classes this summer, and for the past week I’ve been struggling to focus and keep up. I had to take an exam online and had a fever during it and barely passed with a low C. 

Should I contact my professors? I’m not looking for an excuse to get out of work, but I feel like the quality of work I’m doing is definitely not my best and my focus isn’t normal.  I’ve already taken a low exam grade, have 3 exams coming up, and a decent amount of assignments due this week. I’m mostly worried about exams, because focusing to study and retain information is very hard. 

I’m not sure what to say without it sounding like I’m just trying to get out of doing the work (again, I’m not!).  Idk if it would be worth it or if anything would come out of it.

Before lockdown, I would never get invited to things or get asked to visit them at university when others do. They seemed to have also formed little cliques and I'm the odd one out. I am also the last to know things. I remember at one point a few of my friends were talking about moving in together and everyone else knew so they started talking about it and I was literally the only one who had no idea. 

All of my friends are a lot smarter than me so I am left out when in 'intelligent' conversation, I genuinely have no input at all because I can't follow along. When I ask questions about the subject or what it means, they just give a quick brief answer or they just tell me that it's too hard to explain. Since being in lockdown, we've had to talk over our group chat and rather than even explaining or whatever, they just flat out ignore my messages and questions.

Even in general conversation that I can understand, all of my input gets ignored like I don't even exist. I have tried so hard for years to be like them and to be treated the same as they treat eachother. I have even studied things that they regularly talk about just so I can join in conversation but none of it works.

Its gotten to the point where I just look up information on how to talk to people because I am worried that it might be me that is the problem. I have always told them to be absolutely open and honest with me and to tell me if I am doing anything wrong but they just seem to act very differently when I am around.

619,"I live in the dormitory at my university. Each dorm consist of 6 apartments and each apartment consists of 2 rooms. One is a bigger one with a balcony and one is smaller and a bunk bed. For half a semester I have been living alone in this apartment having the whole place to myself. One day a guy comes in and told me the dorm management has placed me in this apartment. Yet, he told me he is assigned to the bigger room where I currently am and where I have been comfortable with all my things already. 

  At first, I refuse to leave and start asking for some proof. We both went to the office, but since it was the weekend, we had to just go to security. The security checked the system and apparently I was actually assigned to the storage room directly in front of my apartment. This is clearly the management's small mistake because no one can even stay in the storage room in the beginning. So given this, I have the right to stay where I currently am. However, the new guy insisted I move immediately to the next room and told me to move to the smaller room. I have written a petition to the dorm management asking if I can stay where I currently am but as it is still the weekend, the only authority that is present is the security. So it is this guy and the security, who is supposed to only enforce the rule and not decide who to stay where, against me, and yet I have no solid claim other than that I have been here.

This is my first post in this community ánd my first text-post on Reddit, so I don't really know if people are gonna see it, but here we go.

My name is Gijs Teuwsen and I'm a 22 year old singer and guitar player from The Netherlands. The band I'm the frontman of plays British-inspired rock music and we're about to start touring abroad. Now, in The Netherlands and Belgium, Gijs is a pretty common name, but anywhere else people have no fuckin' clue how to pronounce it. Sooo I wanted to ask you all to help me find a cool stagename!

My on-stage presence is very energetic and somewhat flashy and crazy. My voice (so I've heard) is very clear and direct with a rock-y edge to it. Our music has the energy and the guitars of britrock, but with the chorus of a super-catchy pop song.

I'm looking for something cool and something that'll stick in peoples heads. Doesn't have to be an existing name or anything. Just wondered what other people could come up with.

Thanks in advance!

621,"i like someone and it's been three months since we've known each other. he's my workmate. the connection between us became strong despite of us having different background ( cultural upbringing, hobbies and religious beliefs) we're basically open to each other just like how friends are and I'm comfortable with him and I assume that he feels the same way also.

the difficult part of this is our difference when it comes to our experience in dating. I've dated two guys before and both were bad experiences, but that never really hindered the way I see guys, or as I thought so? I might be wrong. As for him, he never dated anyone (and he told me that I was the first girl he approached like this and I genuinely believe him)but he had countless girls liking him, and even my other workmates has a small crush on him. but he never really cared, he was a bit anti-social about it and he told me that he didn't really like people who seems fake and self-absorbed. now, we had a slight disagreement about that because I don't really think someone is entirely bad. and even if they might be, there must be a reason behind it. we understood our own points and it never really became a big deal. we are bound to have our own differences.


he is so nice to me also. it made me feel like i'm in a whole different world. he gave me assurance when I didn't even ask for it. He has everything in a guy I could ever wish for. But the timing isn't exactly right. His kindness can be overbearing a lot of times, his compliments were very nice and I appreciate it a lot but it made me feel pressured, somehow. I kept telling him I'm not perfect nor nice, but he never really stopped. And I was a bit worried about that. It's not because I don't believe I'm good, but he was getting too attached to me and it seems like he's painted this whole different picture of me.



I keep reminding him, giving him hints that I'm not really up for a relationship. We never really took it far, but there were times where he held my hand for comfort, and I just let him be. It felt awkward but I didn't really let it bother me. I didn't want to reject him, and I wanted to accept his love but most of the time I had doubts. Doubts about myself, not him.He keeps asking me to tell him if he is doing something that bothers me, and I said nope. Though I never really showed much enthusiasm in his advances but there were a few exceptions. 


I told him in message last night about my worries. he was nice about it but I think he never really understood what I meant. He got dispatched to a different location for almost about a week now, and we are still in contact. he cried in the first day he got dispatched, and that made me feel so sad yet relieved at the same time.  I felt so bad. I like him but why do I feel that way?

Am I still not ready for a relationship? Maybe, that's the case. When i think about entering a relationship, I mostly think of excuses as to why I'm not able to do it rather than reasons to do it. I keep thinking that I'm still young and I still have a lot to do. Dreams to achieve. To take care of my parents. ( I'm 18 yrs old btw.)

And I’d drop stuff sometimes too. I’m like a scatterbrain, it sucks.

635,"Hopefully in the Fall, I'll be a first year Biology teacher at an inner city school (99% non-white). I already teach at an inner city preschool, currently teaching 6-13 year olds. So, I have some experience. However, it occurred to me today the QUESTION. 

""Why should I know this shit?""

I know the kids are going to ask me this on the first day of class. I'm best friends with the in-school suspension teacher of my new high school. She's my co-worker for the summer program for older kids at the preschool we work at. She told me what to expect, etc. Got me the job as a Biology teacher. 

But I'm a bit at a loss at this question. The kids I see currently every day, especially the older of the bunch (12 and 13 year olds) are much more interested in their phones. I tried showing a science program to them, and one of them loudly proclaimed, ""thank God that's over"" when it finished. 

So, I'm like, what does Biology have to do with their lives, especially what's in the textbook? I can take them to the zoo and the aquarium and our natural science museum if they behave, but you know. 

I feel like the question ""why should I know this shit?"" could define our classroom experience, so I'd like to know your answers. 

I'm nerdy as hell about science, so my answer probably wouldn't resonate. ""Because it's awesome and worth knowing.""

648,"Hi guys. Sorry if I write something wrong, English is not my first language.   
To put you in context, I'm going to tell you how my life has been. I'm a 20F and I'm living with my grandparents. For 18 years I lived with my parents in a small village. This means little friends, no contact with the city and helicopter parents.   
Since I'm a child my parents always forced me to study and get good grades. Even in summer. I spent months doing homework 2 years ahead of what I was supposed to do. I never hang out with other kids because they didn't care about going to the park with me. I've always been alone, but I ended up enjoying it. When I started going to highschool I had to take the bus, which took like 10 minutes to arrive to the next village where the highschool was (important later). In my 2nd year I began to be sad and depressed, and I even hurt myself. My parents paid little attention to that, and even when I told them the reasons (no privacy, overprotecrive, couldn't do anything besides studying...) they didn't try to change. That behavior kept going for the next 5 years of highschool. They shouted at me for no reason almost everyday, and I saddly stopped loving them. That can sound very bad, but it's the truth. I don't love my parents. I suffered from anxiety and depression because of them, I couldn't even go anywhere because they didn't let me go to next town to hang out with friends (yes, the same one where my highschool was). The first time I took a real bus was when I turned 16.  
After I finished my last year I moved to the city, where my grandparents live.  
No more anxiety, no more shouting, no more toxicity. I even met new people and I currently have a wonderful boyfriend.  
I recently turned 20. And my parents want me to go for a month to their village. I'm an artist and I need to earn money this summer so I was planning on working on commissions from June to September (when I start uni), and if I go there I won't be able to do it for a whole month. Besides the obvious. I don't want to go. I really don't. I want to be with my friends, I want to work, I want to see my bf. I don't want to suffer again. I didn't enjoy life for 18 years and now that I'm starting to see things differently... they are ruining that.  
My grandparents are going to the village that month, and if I wanted to stay at their apartment my parents won't allow it since they say that they don't want me to be on my own.   
What should I do? Please, I don't want to go. You may think that I'm overreacting but I really don't want to be with them...   
I tried to negotiate but they won't talk, so that's not an option.

652,"I lived a poor but happy life in the northern United States up until my 9th birthday. At that age, I didn't know what racism was, nor did I think it was unusual that there were people who had a skin color that was different from mine. I thought a different skin color was as normal as having different hair color. As far as I knew, there was no such thing as a minority. I thought that there was equal distribution among all ethnicities. I guess you could call it the innocence of being a child, but my parents also didn't raise me to judge people based on how they looked.

My family then moved down south to a border town that was 1% white and 99% Hispanic, so for the latter half of my childhood I was the only white person anywhere I went (excluding my family of course). That didn't really sink in until I started getting the impression from people that there was something wrong with my skin color. And mind you, the fact that I couldn't speak or understand the Spanish language only enabled those who had a problem with my skin color to openly discriminate against me.

I became very self conscious of my skin color. I felt like everyone was always staring at me and I could never be comfortable and relax. I never wanted anyone to see who my parents were because I thought that it would remind or inform whoever bothered to befriend me that I was in fact white; that's how messed up my logic was at that age because of how self conscious I had become.

I thought that there was something wrong with being white, I was ashamed of my skin color, which resulted in me having very low self esteem and almost no confidence. If someone didn't laugh at my joke, I didn't know if it was because I was white or because the joke just wasn't funny. If a girl turned me down, I didn't know if it was because I was white or they just weren't interested. I didn't know whether the problems in my life could be solved with self-improvement or be forever unresolved because the root cause was my whiteness which I couldn't change. I had a mental state of severe hopelessness and I never once talked about these issues with anyone growing up.

My self esteem, confidence, and shame for my parents isn't quite as bad as it was back in my childhood, but these negative thoughts are still very intrusive, and I have to constantly fight them. I love my parents with all my heart, they're my heroes for what they've sacrificed and how they've conducted themselves in the face of roads that would've been an easier path but also immoral.

As far as romantic relationships go, I don't know if my own issues with being white has made me start discriminating against white women or just the number of white women who could relate to what I went through is so astronomically low that finding someone I connect with who happens to be white is simply an impossibility. All of my romantic relationships have been with black women, hopefully it's because we can more easily relate to one another and not because I've become racist against white women; though it's just my luck that the women I'm most compatible with is also one of the most tested kinds of relationships in America (white male, black female).

This is the very first time I've tried expressing my thoughts on this experience in my life, so if it comes across as a little too stream of consciousness, my apologies. I would love to hear how any of you managed to cope with what I went through, because it's still something I struggle with to this day, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you for reading my rather lengthy post.",13Jun2020,2
653,"

Some   background: 

At age 15, I fell in love with a girl at first sight. Her name was let's say Julie. I first saw her sitting on a couch at our   high school orientation for an odd new type of school. I was hesitant to   go to this school, I saw her and I thought I want to be with her. She   was seeing someone else, we became best friends. 5 months later she   broke up with her boyfriend for me, we were inseparable for the next 3   years or so. Something she would always say to me that bother the shit   out of me was ""don't love me too much I am going to die before I turn   20."" I loved her more than I should have and she loved me, our families   got along great, she came on a trip to Paris with my family which was   one of her life goals. During my junior year/her senior year we were   great, she was talking about college. We both knew long distance would   be very difficult. She was graduating high school and I was starting my   senior year, she had plans to go to college.

She   broke up with me before my senior year started so that we didn't have   the pain of long distance. It broke me. I would lay on a daybed in the   office of the apt I was living in alone (longer story than I care to   share) It felt like I had a hole shot through my chest removing my   heart. Not being over dramatic, I felt paralyzed, sick, lost, hurt   beyond all words, mostly just dead inside.

My   senior year started whether I was ready or not, people gave me pity and   talked about her to me constantly, we had a group of mutual friends  and I  found out she was not going to college that year and it hurt all  over  again. She was partying and dating around. About 4 months later I  was  asked on a date by one of our mutual friends  named Kathy, who was  kind  of in competition with my ex, she was very attractive and I liked  her a  lot. We had one date and had sex. Kathy asked me to go to an  event with  her that I knew Julie would be at. I felt like I was being  shown off to  make Julie annoyed or jealous. So I did not continue the  relationship  with Kathy. I decided no more dating, I hung out with  friends and tried  to move on, halfway through my senior year Julie  began mentoring a  junior at our highschool and was around 2 days a  week. She would try to  talk to me or start conversations and I being  petty and hurt would  refuse or pretend to be too busy to talk. She knew  I slept with our  mutual friend Kathy I assume, she was slightly more  cold and closed off  than I remember her. My chest would hurt. I wasn't  ready for her to be  back in my life in any way let alone as an  acquaintance or friend.

Another   mutual friend of Julie and mine asked me if I wanted to get back   together with her and I said ""no, she could die for all I care."" I did   not mean this in any way I still loved her and would have waited for her   forever. 3 months later she died. She died at a college party of an  accidental drug overdose right before her 19th birthday.

Right   before I graduated highschool. While I was living alone, I was dead   inside all over again after starting to pick up the pieces of our break   up. I had nothing left. I do not remember feeling a single emotion, I   did not cry I didn't feel sad. I felt NOTHING. Not like down or   depressed. I felt nothing. Nothing. I would wake up drive myself to   school, take my classes. Go home and play videogames sometimes until it   was time to go to school again. I closed off from friends other than 1   or 2 who are still my best friends today. They would just sit a play   games with me. We didn't talk about anything related to Julie's death.   The funeral service was announced and my mother went with me. I saw   pictures of me and her together I saw her extended family who all knew   me. Then I saw her mother, and the wail of grief that came out of her   saying my name, shattered my nothingness. And I felt everything. Pain so   unbearable I broke down for hours, sputtering though the service   holding her mother, seeing her brother and her father all of our   friends, the pictures. My mother had to leave. She left me with one of   Julie and my mutual friends we'll call her Kayla. She drove me home. She   sat with me for the entire night I think, I cannot really remember.  She  held me and talked to me and was great. I decided I was going to  drop  out of highschool, I did not give a flying fuck about anything. My  good  friend said he would help me finish school, he would do every  assignment  for me he would pick me up and drop me off, all I had to do  was get in  the car. My friend saying that was all I needed. I  graduated, I did as  much as I could muster everyday, I drank, smoked  weed, took pills, and  used drugs to cope. Tried to feel as little as  possible.

This  past week: I heard  a song on YouTube the singer looked and sounded like  Julie, and sang like Julie, singing a  song about a missed love, and everything came rushing  back at me like  it was happening again, I am engaged, I have a great  business, I am depressed about the country right now, but I have been  very fortunate  to keep my work. What kind of specialist can help me, I  am afraid my  new counselor may not be enough, I had one session and  could not get  into what was bothering me yet, I am unsure about  everything. My  anxiety is through the roof, if I cannot get my  depression under  control I am going to miss important work deadlines.

All   I can think about is that, I believe the last words I said to Julie   were ""you don't have to talk to me every time you see me."" And I had   said ""she could die for all I cared"" those two sentences have haunted me   for almost 15 years. I know I cannot un-hear them or unsay them.

For   almost 15 years I have had sadness and depression about Julie, but  this  past week it has disabled me, what do I do. It is affecting my   engagement, my fiancee, and my work. Nobody knows that those are the   last memories I have with and about her. I have kept them to myself and   it is eating me alive now. I cannot bear to tell my family or friends  or  anyone. I cannot seem to stop watching the video because it makes me feel closer, and further from her. 

Any advice on ways to distract myself would be appreciated.

656,"I'm feeling so frustrated and I'm looking for different perspectives here.  

 I recently had one of my siblings come over and hang out ever since the whole pandemic happened. She also brought my 9 year old niece. 
Also, I live in a state with a very large covid number and we are only starting phase 2 now.  
I planned to socially distance and as well as stay outdoors on my porch which had plenty of seating for us. 


Now my niece can be a bit of a know-it-all, she's at that age where she's becoming more opinionated and confident in herself but the issue is that my sibling isn't correcting her behavior at all.  
My boyfriend works in the downtown epicenter of one of the outbreak cities, and I have had to start back at work with a very elderly (74) boss.  (We wear ppe and socially distance when I'm at work.) But I had to drill this into my sisters head that this is why we are socially distancing while they were visiting us last night. I've spoken to her about our situation during the quarantine and she knows we are taking responsible measures to stop the spread.  
At one point before I had to even tell her this, she jokingly coughed in my direction. I got so mad and told her to stop. 

So now, my niece thinks that this is all a joke.  And it's not that serious.  At one point I told her that we were staying on the porch for a few hours to hang out and she said under her breath, ""you guys are being ridiculous"" because we couldn't watch movies inside. This is coming from a 9 year old.   

One more thing I should mention, my sister lives in a house with 10 other people!! 

Is it crazy of me to be so adamant about socially distancing last night with my niece? When I told my niece why it's important to social distance right now, she told me ""It's okay we got tested"" and I had to tell her, ""that's fine, but you don't know who we have been in contact with"". 
My sister clearly isn't discussing the importance of what is going on with her kid, or as I suspect, my brother in law probably thinks it's a conspiracy and doesn't take it seriously. I don't know what to do from here.  
I already discussed with my boyfriend that I probably won't be seeing them again for a long time.  
 
I have an inability to respond to certain social situations incorrectly so that's why I'm asking for other perspectives.  I probably reacted wrong with my niece but I don't have kids and I'm unsure of how to convey to a 9 year old the importance of what's going on right now when her own parents aren't.

658,"I’ve [F,23] have been talking to a guy [M,26] for almost a month. He has a pretty busy schedule as do I. He’s going to be a doctor of physical therapy in August, he takes care of his father who has muscular dystrophy, he does dementia and Alzheimer’s research for the university he goes to, and writes his own music - I’ve been patient with his schedule. This time that we’ve talked has been great, we talk about music, hobbies, family, etc. In the beginning of our courtship we even set up a boundary that we don’t want to/shouldn’t talk about sex because we both didn’t want to focus this solely on physical attraction. He said to me that he’s had a past pattern of mistaking physical attraction for a genuine connection and he didn’t want to make the same mistake. We haven’t met in person but we message and FaceTime regularly. 

Fast forward, this week I hadn’t heard from him for 3 days so I knew something was up. He hadn’t even opened my Snapchat message (we message on snap because the hospital I work at doesn’t have great service). 

Last night I get a message from him at midnight saying, “Hey- sorry about the long gap in communication, schedule has been a little crazy lately. I've been doing some thinking lately about us and I'm not entirely sure if the connection on my end is entirely emotional as it is physical. You're basically the whole package but I think I might be falling into a familiar routine of confusing lust for a genuine connection, and I wouldn't want to lead you on further than I already may have. You definitely don't deserve to have your emotions played with. Hope you can understand that it might be better for us to cool things off at least for now until I can get my shit sorted out. And for the record, I hope your interview leads you to great things as I suspect it will, and I hope you're able to relax a little this weekend and spend some time on yourself because you deserve it. You work like crazy.”

I replied, “what does cooling off entail?”

He said, “Talking a little less/taking breaks from messaging, taking a step back from more of the more intimate kinds of conversations (I know most of that has been me, I'm not trying to gaslight you here or anything). If you don't dig that or are upset I totally get it though- you don't owe me any patience so I can understand if you just wanna move on instead.”

660,"So my ex and I loved each other. It was the kind of love I had read about in books. We had an amazing connection, we were each other's best friends and so on. But we would get into these nasty fights and sometimes after a huge fight he would break up with me on an impulse, and after a few days he would calm down and we would get back together. This went on for almost 2 years.

Our worst fight was when I texted my ex after a break up, a little history; my ex was really emotionally abusive, and 23 days after the break up I started the relationship with my boyfriend so I didn't really get closure. I was so full of hatred and regret and really wanted to hash things out. So after one of our break ups I texted this guy and I finally got some closure. But when I told my boyfriend he flipped out and said that I cheated on him (me and the ex only texted about our past mistakes and he reminded me of some good memories, and said that he loved me; and I said that I love my bf and we should stop texting even though we could have been good friends). He cursed and said some mean things and I apologized and we talked about things and he said he forgave me! Or so I thought! After every fight he would bring this up to paint me as the bad guy and in the wrong (even when he was the one clearly in the wrong, but this was a habbit of him; bringing up old fights).

Fast forward to our recent fight. After I started a twitter account and reconnected with some old friends (3 guys and 1 girl; we hang out as a group) he said I was an attention whore, and he didn't like me anymore. So we broke up! I was heartbroken! 10 days go by and he texts me and says he's sorry and begs for another chance and I give it to him. He says he's gonna make me fall in love again. But I was so hurt and couldnt connect with him so fast. After like 5 days of a somewhat cold relationship he says he has done everything he could (he bought me some flowers, took me out once and we shared some donuts, and he texted me cute things) and he doesn't know what else to do. I get mad that he thinks after 5 days he has done EVERYTHING he could and thinks I'm just trying to hurt him. He brings up my ex again, and I end things.

664,"So basically, my boyfriend went on a float trip without me because his friend was in town this week and I got upset. I cant go near bodies of water for a month because I just got LASIK. I'm less upset that I couldn't go, but more upset because I'd been begging my boyfriend for over a year to go on a float trip with me. He had either been refusing or ignoring it or saying he wants to canoe instead of kayak (I wanted to kayak). Then his friend comes along and suggests they kayak the river, and he immediately agrees to do it. I get that he just wanted to do something memorable with his friend (and his friends cousin apparently). But I cant help but feel resentful. Why did he suddenly agree? Why is it so easy for him to commit to doing things with his friend but I have to pull teeth to get him to do anything with me? 

I tried to tell him I was upset about it and we got into a huge fight, called me controlling and shit. But I never asked him to not go on the trip, or intended to guilt him for hanging with his friend. I tried to explain the bigger issue that I was upset about but he assumed the whole thing was about me jealous that I cant go.

668,"My mother has been prediabetic for around 2 or 3 years. She's 49. She is overweight and eats lots of sweet, fatty stuff and salty things. She is very sedentary and never exercised a day in her life.

I beg her to exercise with me but she's convinced that exercise shouldn't be tiresome and shouldnt make you sweat or pant. If I bring up the topic of her weight, she gets more stubborn and goes to eat some cheese crepe or cake. 

She has been getting suddenly fatigued, or dizzy, and her legs and arms have been feeling numb for around 5 months. My grandma recently passed too and that stressed her out considerably. 

We will have her do an a1c test tomorrow and visit a doctor, but I'm a medical student and I know it's most likely diabetes. 

I'm horribly worried because knowing my mother, I know she will not control her diet, I know she will never exercise, losing weight will be a horribly difficult mission, and keeping her on the medications will be a nightmare.

She is also the type of person who can very readily reject science and medicine in favor of conspiracy theories. She can dismiss things a doctor tells her or my pharmacist sister just because a Facebook post said otherwise. She also hates anyone to disagree with her or even suggest any alternatives to what she has made her mind up on. She's also sort of a hypochondriac, she imitates symptoms of people she's seen in ICU when she gets slightly sick.

I don't want to lose her early because of a preventable disease, I'd feel horribly guilty and I'm sure I'd forgive her for being so stubborn. I don't know how to get someone like her to listen and work on being healthier. Leading by example doesn't work, I've cut sugar out of my diet for a month now hoping she would follow but she doesn't care.",13Jun2020,1

672,"My roommate and I are both moving out of the apartment unit we live in. We must leave the unit by July 22nd and have the unit spotless by then. Since we are college students, we haven't seen each other or been in the apartment since March.

A week ago I texted my roommate, G, to ask when she would like to meet up to clean the apartment and told her the dates I would be around. She still has not responded to my text or given me any ideas as to when she will be around. This is especially frustrating when considering when I would help her with her homework she would spam my phone with texts or copy and paste the same texts if I didn't respond within 20-30 minutes.

On Thursday I came back to my apartment for the first time since March. I discovered that my lysol wipes (that I left to clean the apartment with and are hard to find), 10 k pods, and some of my Jack Daniels was missing. I don't understand why she would take my belongings considering she comes from a richer family.

I don't want to be rude but I am extremely frustrated. I have never taken or used any of her things without asking and we never had problems with it until recently. I also don't want to do all the cleaning myself or her to come for one day and leave without helping much. How should I approach the problem?",13Jun2020,1

I’ve been feeling off and anxious ever since. I can’t tell if the office is tiptoeing around me or if my anxiety is making me paranoid. I don’t know how to ask my friend if we’re okay or if she’s upset with me.

I went into the kitchen to get food and there were like hundred of gnats all over the dishes. So I washed them out but when I picked up the dishes, the gnats went flying everywhere. All over my face and my arms. It was gross. And my dad won’t let me tell my landlord about it because he doesn’t want anyone seeing how our apartment looks.

Things happened in life, we separated. Anyways, I called a lawn care company yesterday, and they came out. Dude.... he walked up to me and we both were shocked we were standing there. He kept staring at me like staring into my soul it felt like. His smile got brighter when I talked... and he was nervous/anxious. oh so nervous. We talked and shared things of our lives. Man we shared similarities... he would only talk when I asked questions or he just stood there staring and he kept saying ""I never thought I'd see you again"" like we grew up in the neighborhood I still live in and he was shocked I still live in the same house, like he was kicking himself he didn't know I was still here and he went off to college, but now he knows I'm here and he's back in the area. Has he been thinking of me if he didn't think he was gonna see me? 0.0

683,"I really find it boring chatting or talking to people sometimes. As it is personally very irritating when people be repetitive or sometimes just questions unnecessarily. 

Talking is fun when there is a particular interest that both sides can converse on or sometimes just acknowledge the right and wrong of both sides.

I really am infuriated with how there really isn’t much to talk or chat about with people. I really don’t have much to talk to and also I am lazy to converse with anyone. I rather would just spend some time alone focusing on myself and just doing things that make me happy.

However, having a relationship, parents and friends who wants to discuss with you about your life and ideas makes it really difficult for me to just not ignore them.

Hide any signs of mental instability even when they offer to vent because they don't really know how stressful it is and don't want you to vent.

Those are only some of my standarda but I also punish myself mentally and sometimes physically when i can't hold myself to these standards.

687,"I stayed up all night because I couldn't sleep, and by the time I got into bed (around 5 AM) all I could think about was self-deprecating things and suicide. That lasted for at least 40 minutes until my parents got up and came into my room. My mom almost immediately came in and told me something she was mad about (my friend posting LGBT+ stuff on his instagram, to be exact, and how she doesn't want me being friends with people who are supportive of me and other LGBT+ people) and it really stressed me out. For the next hour or so I couldn't sleep. My heart felt super light, my head hurt, and my stomach felt like something was stuck in it that I had to get out. I kept trying to like track my heart beat but it didn't feel stable. It would beat really hard one minute it felt like, but then the next I could barely feel it. I kept trying to do the thing where you like breathe in for 4-8 seconds, breathe out for 4-8 seconds to regulate my heartbeat but it just wouldn't work. 

It feels better now. But I still feel pretty light in my chest. There's also like this airy pain under my rib.

I was eventually able to fall asleep, but I would wake up with this feeling of overwhelming dread and discomfort when I woke up. Partially because all I wanted to do was cry, partially because my back hurt and everything was too hot or too cold. Putting my arms out of the covers would make me freeze, same with my feet, but I was overheating when they were under the covers.

For the past few days I've been experiencing headaches a lot and my eyes really hurt last night, too. Like, I couldn't close them sometimes without them burning. That may be because I'm on the computer often, but I'm not sure. 

I woke up again about 30 minutes ago and laid outside. I thought maybe fresh air would make me feel better. It didn't. I came inside and I forced myself to throw up. I finally felt better. I grabbed an apple and started eating it (previously I couldn't eat or I felt like throwing up. I couldn't really drink water either without feeling super weird, so I ate ice) and drank some water too. 

I'm not feeling good again, but it's not as bad. Specifically when I drink water I feel sick.

I'm not sure if my mental breakdown caused me to feel physically sick or not? I've had breakdowns that resulted in a mild headache or my entire body aching and discomfort, but I've never had it be where I had to force myself to throw up to feel some sort of relief. 

Should I be concerned? I'm not entirely sure if I should be or not. Is there anything in particular I should try to eat or drink that would be good to keep fluids in me while also being gentle enough not to hurt my stomach? Is there some sort of breathing exercise or calming thing I could do to try to calm myself and feel better? I still feel really on edge.",13Jun2020,1

695,"I am absolutely fuming right now. I just had an interview with a company based in the US hiring people for remote sales position.

The guy was an Indian living there. I'm searching for jobs lately but as we know, they have all dried up. So the salary he offered me was 20,000 a month i.e. less than $300 for him for working 9pm to 5am IST, 5 days a week for the whole fucking month!!

Now, I have my bachelor's in IT with two years experience and then I went to EU to get my master's. I came back and was interning with the company to go back. However that didn't work out due to Covid19 and I started looking for more positions now. 

Since I don't have much experience in positions that are not purely technical, (and I know I don't want to do programming as I did that for two years and didn't much like it, hence my master's) it's been extra difficult finding a job. I, 100% know that I'll be good at working in a position I'm applying for as I have the skills and the know how of the business world. 

He was casually mentioning how there's no jobs right now and what not! I firmly believe that you should hire a person and pay them based on their skills and not because there's not enough jobs out there, that you'll exploit them! I freaking earned more than that even before going for my master's. 

I'm 26 and have worked hard my entire life to be capable enough to not be treated like a beggar. However, after taking the interview, it made me feel so small and all my education accounting for nothing. All the hard-work I've done over the past years account for a mere 20k. That's what you can earn working in a restaurant in less than 3 days in his country. 

It just made me so sad and upset how little these companies think of individuals. I'm at crossroads whether I should accept this position and swallow my dignity or reject it and keep searching. My heart tells me to not take it but my mind tells me to take it since I have nothing else right now and to suck it up. I don't want to have a gap on my CV as I know it's considered a bad thing and if I take this job, atleast I won't have that. However, on the other hand if I take it and when I apply for new positions, the HR asks about your previous salary, which is stupid, and I'll have to show I was getting paid way less than what I was getting paid prior to my master's. 

This is just messing with my mind right now and I don't know what to do. Please help me with some advice, kind people.",13Jun2020,2

697,"Hello! First time posting here. I am a biology student in undergrad aiming to become a veternarian. I really wanted experience this summer, since next year is my ""senior year"" (it will be my third year, but I have the option and ability to graduate early) and I have little work with animals besides mice in research labs. 

I got a job at an animal shelter that I really love. I haven't started yet, but after doing a working interview I fell in love with the shelter and the staff seemed very funny and friendly. I told the manager I would accept the position because I hadn't heard back from any animal hospitals yet, but I did have an interview from one fairly close by the next day.

I interviewed virtually for the animal hospital a day after my working interview at the shelter, and I found out today I got the job. Its closer, it pays more, and it is an actual hospital with veternarians, and two exotic vets! I'll be a kennel attendant, so same as the shelter, but also allowed to shadow certain procedures.

Here is my issue. I feel bad about telling the manager at the shelter I'd take the position, but I havent filled out any payroll paperwork yet, just the interview paperwork. And I really enjoy the shelter. The shelter also has a medical bay, where there are veterinarians, but I have never seen it, and they work only on cats and dogs, not exotics. Moreover, I did hear some bad talk about shelter management not knowing what they are doing.

The hospital, however, will be filled with vets, I would be more immersed in my future field, and there are 2 exotic vets. They deal with birds, small animals, and reptiles, on top of cats and dogs. But I have never visited the hospital, and I am not sure if I will like the position since it wasn't a working interview, just a virtual one. I haven't met or talked to any staff yet. There is also a toll bridge that is 13~16 dollars 1 way, but I would make back the money working only 1 hour at the hospital (the hospital pays $5 more an hour). I asked if I could come in for a few hours to see what I would be doing, and they said yes.

Both jobs are part time, but my family and boyfriend think I should only be working 1 job over the summer.

My brain and half my heart are telling me to go for the animal hospital, while my heart and obligations are telling me to stick with the shelter. I was wondering:

1) Which job do I take?

2) I start next week monday tuesday wednesday at the shelter, while I would go to the animal hospital thursday to see if I like it. Should I ""take"" the shelter job for now, then see if I like the hospital later?

3) If I take the shelter position, how should I let my boss know that I am quitting if I end up liking the hospital better? Should I bother asking to only work 1 day a week instead of 3, or to just volenteer, as I do really really enjoy the shelter and seeing all the animals. 

4) Should I keep both jobs for a little bit, and quit whichever I don't like? I don't like this option, as I want to be a loyal employee, and I haven't even discussed what hours I would have at the hospital or what a schedule would look like yet.

706,"Hello, this is my first time posting on Reddit! I hope I'm doing it well. Also, sorry if there are any grammar/spelling mistakes. English is not my first language!

So this story starts with a friend of mine who we will call ""Sarah"", who met a guy who we will call ""Mark"" in 2015 via social media. They became friends and have been checking in with each other from time to time since then.

On **January** this year, Sarah told me about Mark for the first time. She said I reminded her of him: we both like art (he draws and I do photography), we like learning about history and also have really similar taste in other things. So Sarah thought it was a good idea to introduce me to him. That same day, Mark and I started talking via instagram DMs and my first impression was really good. He seemed like a really cool guy. However, at that time I was going to get rid of all my social media (I do that when I have exams), so I gave Mark my phone number so we could keep talking via Whatsapp.

We texted each other for 2 months from time to time. We had some hobbies in common and a similar sense of humor. Everything looked fine so far. In **February** I was getting really busy with uni stuff so I started spending less time on my phone and started answering him some days after he texted me. He would then ask me if he had done something wrong or if I was angry at him. I felt bad every time and told him no, that I was just busy and we were cool.

I reactivated my social media. **March** arrived and we wouldnt talk much. On the 30th, I got a text from him saying that ""He wanted to tell me something"". From my experience, when someone says that, it can mean two things: one, something really bad has happened or two, the person likes you. It was the latter. I told him I thought he was a nice guy but I was not looking for a relationship at the time. He asked if we could still be friends and I said sure.

He wouldn't text me again until **May**. He asked jokingly how I was and if I had already forgotten about him. I responded politely and joking a bit too. Just being friendly. Then all of a sudden he says he is ""still crazy about me"" and if ""I can please just be honest with him"". I try to play it cool even though I am starting to get pissed off. I had already said **no** to him a month ago, so I tell him again and add that ""it really isn't so hard to understand"". He starts to get intense to the point he tells me I am a cruel person and can't believe what I am doing. I tell him I am not comfortable anymore and I'd rather not talk with him again. He answers ""ok"" .

A few days later, my friend Sarah sends me some screenshots of Mark telling her that I am ""communicating with him indirectly"" with my tweets and with the lyrics of the songs I post. He also tells her that I am ""obsessed with him"", and that I ""have really low self steem"" and this is the reason I've rejected him. He says he is ""sure I like him back but I'm so insecure that I can't tell him in the face"". As I am reading the screenshot, I am more and more confused. I obviously tell Sarah my tweets and the songs I listen to aren't related to him (wtf) and I send the whole convo with Mark to her (I screenrecord it) so she can see I never led him to think I liked him in any way (she already knows, but still).

The next thing I do is block him everywhere. I also deactivate all of my social media because I have my finals and so he can't stalk me anymore. 

So, **June** arrives and Sarah tells me Mark has sent her a text saying ""Why?"" without any context. She answers ""Why what?"" and he answers ""What do you gain from ruining someone elses life"" and then blocks her. 

Today, June 13rd, Sarah has sent me screenshots again. Mark has unblocked her and is saying he is sorry, that he hates himself and he's ""mentally sick"" . He says before all of this happened, he was already disgusted by himself. And he understands and knows what ""we"" are doing to him (we don't know what he is referring to, neither Sarah or I are interacting with him or have interacted with him in the last month). He says he wants to let all his ""shit"" out but he can't say what he has inside (we don't know what he is referring to). Sarah has told him to reach out for help because he is clearly not ok. And the conversation has stopped here for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the thing is, I politely rejected this guy on March, had to do it again on May and now we are on June and he is still obsessed about it. He believes I am constantly thinking about him or plotting against him or whatever. Like everything revolves around him. It looks like he can't move on. 

We live in the same country but not in the same city or region. Even so, I am scared he finds out my adress or something like that. I am paranoid that with the pics I have posted online he can guess the city I live in or where my house is.

Only my friend Sarah and my friend ""Daniel"" know about this. Right now I have to study and I can't even focus because of this. It's not fair that I am stressing over something that's not my fault. 

Do you guys think this guy is dangerous? Should I tell/do something? I'm so sorry about the long post. If you've read this far, thank you so much.",13Jun2020,3
707,"Hey Reddit!

***Edit: Im 22F, others in this context are male 15 to 24. Im a bit weird/don't care too much about what others think. I don't know if thats relevant. Everyone in this story are European. Them being mostly Dutch and me being Norwegian.*** 

Reticently I've spent a lot of time on a game, and made some new friends. However its a group of 3-4 guys who always harasses me and try to put me down. Making fun of everything I do whenever they meet me. This has resulted in me blocking them and refusing to acknowledge their existence. Because I don't feel like its any point in arguing or even giving attention to the behavior. But then a guy who I didn't think much of at all. I thought he was ok, didn't have an opinion of him. Tells me that I am the issue, and how I am worse than the bullies. He tells me I've been rude to people and bully them more than they've ever hurt anyone. However he is the first person to say this that is not a part of the what I find to be a gang that bullies me (at least i dont think he is apart of it).

I ask him; What specifically did I do wrong? I would like to know what I did wrong so that I can improve myself, to make sure it does not happen again. Im sorry if I did something wrong, I was unaware of this. But i do not think im worse than what I'd consider horrible behavior towards me. (constantly bullying and trying to take me down in any way, making fun whenever they see me).

Him: Why would I need to give you specifics? You cannot see the what you've done is wrong? Without having evidence?

Me: I've been gaslighted so much in my past, I do not trust things without proof of specific situations where I hurt someone or you. Im not gonna think im worse than them simply because you say it without proof to back it off.

Him: goes on and on about how im a horrible person and the people like mentioned are ""angels"" compared to me.

Me: Thanks for the conversation, have a nice day. \*deletes him\*

Note: I have a tendency to ""tickle"" people, but i didnt think the small banter I was doing was rude? Nor was I aware of it.. Such as: Your pink outfit is blinding, thats why I could not see that you weren't afk. (stupid joke ik, but stuff like that). I don't hit after peoples personality as I find that quite wrong at least not that im aware of.

**Is he right in this situation or is he wrong?** I don't know if he is a toxic narcissist or not trying to gaslight me. Or if I am actually doing something wrong here.. Most people in the community im in dislike this group too, its not like im alone about this. Many have expressed their dislike towards them. **How do I improve myself if the person accusing me of something refuses to tell me what it specifically is that I've done wrong?**

Thanks for any replies, I know u dont know the whole story from their side. But i hope to further understand myself and them.",13Jun2020,2
708,"This is about a guy that I liked for three years in high school, but still come back to crush on every time we come back from college. 

In those three years in highschool, there have been many times that he reciprocated emotions, but when I took the hints and confess, he straight-up joked around and told me he never liked me. Yes, that is a dick move. After this happening twice, I cut him off completely to move on. Then, he got into a really toxic relationship that he just recently got out of. Now, we are in college (rising juniors), but the problem is every time we come back home for break,  I ask to hang out/work out/play sports together (only I initiate/reach out, he never does), esp now that we can't go anywhere cause corona and he lives close by. Every time I see him, I go through a cycle of falling for him again, fantasizing, then convince myself he is actively rejecting me because he doesn't express interest  (me breaking my own heart), and then getting over it (by the 4th time we hang out or so). But then, I don't see him again for a while, come back, and go through the whole cycle of heartbreak again.  (Even worse, he glowed up. as a person, not just physically. like full-on character development.).

It might seem simple to ""cut him out forever"", but what keeps me coming back is that I haven't found anyone I like as much as him. So many years later, I haven't had true feelings for anyone but him. He's literally...perfect if only if i could have him, but I can't. Also, we like to play beach volleyball, so I kind of need him so we have enough people to play. HOW DO I MOVE ON? Do I ask for straight-up rejection? Do I just completely block him out forever and ever?

But I don’t know how to do things in real life. If you tell me to go and do something I’ll stand there for minutes either zoning out or wondering how to do the thing even if it’s easy.

Sometimes time just passes without me noticing. I’ve been thinking about something for a second and the next time I blink, something has happened or I’ve done something that I don’t remember. I feel like what a person with dementia would feel like.

Also, I just look weird. Not outright ugly, just a bit off. My eyes always look like they’re cross eyed even though they’re not, my posture is absurd when I see myself in photos and videos, unlike that of everyone else and so is the way I talk.

I’m not traditionally feminine but not masculine either, just... weird. I don’t have romantic relationships ever, it just seems like an impossibility.

711,"My estranged stepmother, call her Karen, started antagonizing me again.

It started when I ordered, and had delivered, kinetic sand to my house for my half-sister. She had played with it at home and minimal sand was left over when we cleaned up.

The next day, Karen went, well, full Karen over me buying the toy. As though buying the sand was a mortal, unforgivable sin. MY HARD-EARNED MONEY BUYING A TOY WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO HER. Karen did mention, among other things:

1. that her golden child, the roommate, had to pick up the order on my behalf;

2. she raised my half-sister and bought everything for her using her money, and I'm being arrogant by just buying ONE thing for her,

3. of all the toys, I had to fulfill my sister's wishes and buy the ""SAND, of all toys""

4. having to clean the floor time and again because Sand-Filled throwaway111 is walking around the house

5. that I milked off her by eating her food,

6. had no respect for her

7. racist things that I cannot say here.

I read up about the [grey rock method](https://www.e-counseling.com/mental-health/what-is-the-grey-rock-method) and had discussed with my therapist about it, and she gave the A-OK. But these allegations are too much to just keep quiet, and at that point I felt the grey rock turning into a doormat.
 
I went full rebuttal.

1. there was no such arrangement and her golden child can choose to stay out of it but just had to stick his nose in my business. that was why i didn't entertain HER UPS deliveries despite being home; it's not my business and she's now taking the piss

2. time &gt; money. you had the child, that's your JOB. and guess who's the one bragging now?

3. well, you controlling parasite, if you had listened to your kid...

4. ironically you got the golden child to clean up after me. why are you so afraid to command me to clean up then? why did you do it yourself?

5. those were family dinners where Karen cooked for everyone. I had no choice at all. quarantine = cannot eat out

6. respect is earned and you don't deserve any of it

7. only goes to show what kind of person she is. the irony here is that she's a minority herself. Imagine a black woman in a white neighborhood, calling Asian slurs on Asians.

I did not actually respond from 5 to 7 because it's a waste of my time. If she wants to be racist, that's her problem. Anyway, having friends of other races is the ultimate pissing I can give her.

I felt that I broke my vow of being a gray rock, which has helped my mental health slightly during this quarantine. But these allegations are turning the gray rock as a doormat instead. By being agitated, I had broken my own vow and I allowed Karen to ""win"" my engaging in an argment. I don't see my therapist for now because of lockdown. Was I right to stand up there and then, or would being the gray rock-morphing-into-doormat be a much better solution?",13Jun2020,3

716,"Hi! So I have this one friend who we bond with on many levels since we are both in the art field (just different mediums) and various interest. Anyway, this friend asked me to do a favor on a personal project they were working on last March (2019). I obliged but because it was an ongoing thing that would take months to complete so  I asked that they pay me a fraction of my normal rate. They agreed and they didn't really seem to mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, more than a year later and this friend is still asking me for favors on this particular project. About six months ago, they asked for one favor relating to the project. And I happily agreed, going above and beyond for them. They later told me they changed their mind and decided not use what I made. I was slightly perturbed but at the end of the day I know this is the risk you run with creative types so didn't sweat it. However, just last week they asked me to do another favor for them relating to this same project! 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, I don't mind doing favors for people it just seems like if I keep saying yes, I'll have to continue working on this project that I really don't have time for and to be perfectly honest don't connect to creatively. If I tell my friend I don't have time to do something for them they then reprimand me for doing something for myself and make passive aggressive comments like, ""Oh, I thought you were too busy to do X for me so how can you do Y for yourself?"". Which is completely fucking nuts and entitled AF.  I felt like before began granting these favors  and entering a work relationship our relationship was great but now I am wondering if I should slowly start distancing myself until they get the hint.

However, I always see them go out together without me, or without even letting me know, on their Snapchat stories. Then we I speak to them next, they act like nothing has even happened. What should I do from here? It makes me feel angry and upset as it happens often.

The issue I have is, if I decide to tell them how I feel and ask them to invite me, it makes me seem needy and then I think they’re even less likely to want to ask me. If I act like it doesn’t bother me and as if I barely even noticed, then I fear nothing will change.

721,"I know this is probably a stupid question but I’ve been struggling on not being lazy since middle school. I feel like most of you will say,” Just do the work and stop being lazy,” but the thing is trying to stop being lazy is like trying to stop a smoke addiction in under 1 day. I find it so hard not being lazy. I try to force myself to do the work but unfortunately that lazy feeling really doesn’t go away no matter how many times I force myself to do the work even if I don’t feel like it. My laziness is affecting my life. It has affected my school grades, it’s affected my own physical health, and it’s affecting my relationship with my parents. I don’t know how else to stop feeling lazy. This is just entirely frustrating me, I want to do the work but my sluggishness is hindering me. My parents didn’t raise me to be independent so they pretty much did the work for me. They would clean my room, do my laundry, and all the stuff I’m supposed to be doing on my own by now. Because of the way they raised me, I don’t help them clean or anything else because of the sluggishness I’m feeling. I want to stop feeling lazy but I don’t know how. My parents sometimes yell at me and get really mad that I’m not helping them. Sometimes I just blame myself and call myself a lazy bum who does nothing but stay in the house and play on my mobile device all day. I take zeroes as a test grade a lot. If I find something too hard to do, I will just slack off and do nothing because to me I find it pointless to do something you find too hard. Even though I know the consequences of being lazy, I still don’t do the work. Right now, I’ve managed to try to be a little independent by rewarding myself for doing the work. However, I can’t use that method on everything so is there an alternative way to stop feeling lazy?? If I sound pathetic or ridiculous you can just say it because that won’t hurt me. I’m just angry at myself. I hate being lazy and I’m struggling a whole lot. Because of my sluggishness, I believe that I will probably end up being a failure in the future.

727,"Alright so this is my first real post on Reddit, and in general i am not great at relaying information without jumping from thing to thing, so please excuse if my story is difficult to follow. 

I recently moved to Minnesota from a state where bartenders make the standard $2.13 an hour plus tips. I was under the impression that things were the same here, and it wasn't until after I landed a job working for a small yacht club that I found out that typically employers pay servers $10.50 an hour plus tips. While I was being interviewed for the bar tending position (this was early March right before the covid lock down) I was told that I would be making $17 an hour plus some tips, but they did let me know that the tips would not be as high as working at a typical restaurant (which is why I would be making such a high hourly). That sounded reasonable to me. Unfortunately after accepting the job offer everything but ""essential"" businesses were temporarily shut down (covid). I had just moved across the country and was hurting a bit for money and was upfront with them about this, they didn't want me to leave them for another job so they offered me a temporary position handling take out orders, all seemed well with that for a few weeks. The governor announced in mid May I believe that we could open the golf course with some restrictions, so my position moved from delivering food to people in their cars to delivering food to people on the golf course (keep in mind that everything except target and some food places are the only things open from the time i ""started"" to when the golf course opened). All is well for a few days, until one of the women's groups complains about my pants being too tight. My manager approaches me after my shift to tell me about the complaint, and asks me to get different pants. I apologized and was extremely embarrassed to have to explain to him that i had gained weight since the quarantine began and no longer knew my size, and that I wasn't able to try anything on in the store since quarantine, but that I would just go to target and guess, which is what I did before my next shift. I walked in the next day looking like a 12 year old that had raided my moms closet for career day at school, but my pants were no longer too tight. I was greeted by the chef who laughed (we are friends so it didn't bother me) and informed me that he was ""in on that meeting"" and he didn't understand why they made such a big deal about it. After questioning him a bit further i found out that they HAD A GOLF HOUSE WIDE MEETING TO DISCUSS MY WORK PANTS (after they had already spoken to me about them). A few of the people in attendance were: The GM, a golf pro, my direct manager, his manager, the chef, and another manager. Queue wanting to sink into the ground and never go back to the golf house ever again...

Alright I'm not going to spend as much time talking about the rest of the stuff that has happened since, because I don't want to bore you, and i feel like they don't need to be set up as much as the first incident.

In the following weeks once we were able to open up for outdoor dining I was able to get back to bar tending and a lot more concerning things have happened.

The other bartender called out from work, I am the only other bartender so they begged me to pick up his shift (meaning i would work 6 days that week) I agreed, because they said I would get overtime. one I agreed they proceeded to change my in time to 30 minutes later THE MORNING OF every single day until i got only one hour of overtime.

I found out that technically it is a ""no tip club"" not just that the tips are bad, but if we do get tipped to just take it and put it in the tip pool.

I received no training days and was just put behind the bar alone from the start. I do have 3 years prior experience so I do know how to make drinks, but i didn't know their process or their signature cocktails right away, or the ""proper"" way to speak to members.

I was told once our inside bar opened (there is one outside that I started in) that the servers for the outside poolside area would make their own drinks, which proved to be untrue. I would be just starting to set up the inside upstairs bar and have them bring me drink requests that required special ingredients that i would have to make from scratch (the drink menus for the bars are different). This would set me behind in a major way for our dinner rush. I did bring this to their attention and offered to come in an hour early if I'm going to be expected to make drinks while setting up, they refused and just said that I'm going to have to deal with it until they can hire another bartender.

All of these things have just been inconveniences up until two nights ago. I was supposed to get off at 9. The dining room manager came up to me and explained that my direct manager had told the men's golf group that they could come in for drinks after they had eaten at the golf house, and that because technically that wasn't allowed that her and i would be able to go home if they ended up wanting to come in for drinks, and that my direct manager, and his boss would take over the bar for them. I was fine with this. 9pm rolls around and neither of the two managers that are supposed to take over are anywhere to be found, despite the golf group being there ordering lost of drinks and maxing out our capacity. Around 10pm they show up, they dont let me leave, and my direct manager is kind enough to pour a couple beers while his boss is just standing around chatting with the members not helping at all. 11pm people are starting to filter out and direct managers boss pulls us aside and says ""The new member Mr. Smith(fake name)  wanted to make sure that the people closing got this money and didn't want it to go in the tip pool"" and proceeds to split $300 3 ways. I didn't say anything at the time, because I couldn't fully process what had just happened, I have never in my life heard of a manager taking tips, and would much rather that money have gone in the tip pool, than to go to them. The whole situation feels very wrong and I am not sure what to do at this point, so any and all advice is welcomed. If you have managed to hang in this long despite grammatical errors and jumping from topic to topic, thank you!",13Jun2020,1
728,"*SUPER LONG AND NAGGY POST SORRY*

I came from a very strict household and academics were everything to my parents. I managed to get into university last year, but I failed 3/5 of my subjects. Yes I know, it's really bad. I was never academically inclined so to me getting into uni was like a miracle. I was so depressed after receiving my results. It was the end of the world to me. I didn't go home and tried committing suicide. Seeing the dissapointment on my parent's face is what scares me the most. 

After failing last year, I studied really hard. I did practice papers almost every-day and just keep redoing it over and over. I guess because I never really could understand accounting, this was the only way I could think of. By redoing the paper to the point where I memorized the format, and the way to solve each question even though I never really understood why. 

I just had my exams just now. It was a 24 hour open book exam. I spent more than 10 hours figuring out the questions when it's only a 2 hour paper if it's written. 

The first part was coming up with income statements, financial position statement and changes in equity. I was stressed out of my mind because I was afraid of failing again. So I began doing the paper and managed to finish and even balance it at the end. I rechecked the paper and flipped through my notes to make sure every line, every calculation is correct. And so I submitted my paper.  

Then my classmate came to me after the exam has ended and told me how easy it was, so I asked her if I could see her answers to compare to my own, so at least I could sleep that night (I have anxiety and it gets even worse during exam period) she happily told me that the answers were in the notes all along. Exactly the same question, word for word. I went to look and at first I was happy because I got it all right. Then it hit me. My answers and the answers in the notes were identical. Even down to each and every step, the formatting and all. No wonder it was so familiar when I was doing it. I had done this question more than 50 times repeatedly throughout the year and it's obvious that because I do not understand, I just ""vomit"" all out the model answer and in the end, what a ""coincidence"" even the numbers are the same. (Although I did it so many times, I memorised steps and format. Not numbers so when I did the exam, I didn't notice at all)  

Will the school think I cheated even though I didnt?? I emphasised on this part of the paper because it holds the most marks. It's 30 marks and if I can Ace that, I'll only need another 20 marks to pass. I'm so scared after recieving the text and checking my answers, I had a panic attack and fainted. I'm really scared that they'll think I cheated and fail me, even worse kick me out because this is very hard to defend that I didn't cheat. 

I attended every lecture even though attendance wasnt compulsory, I was early every time, sat at the front of the class and even attended the same lecture 2-3 times just to understand (my lecturer teach the same lecture 4 times a week at different time slots) I put in so much effort, gave up my social life, my health, my everything and this is what happens... My degree is 3 years and because I failed the first year, I had to retake the whole year and now I'll be graduating a year after everyone else. If they accuse me of cheating and really think I did, then I might have to take 5 years to finish a 3 year degree. My life is seriously over and I've thought of just ending it. Some people might think this is extreme but academics is literally my entire life and my whole family thinks the same.",13Jun2020,1

 We were all chatting on the couch and the topic of age appropriate dating was brought up. He argued that 19 year olds are legal and that everyone matured differently, and also that “how are they gonna learn how to be an adult if they don’t date someone older?” so it’s fine that he dates them. I tried to argue that a 19 year old and a 31 year old most of the time don’t have anything in common with each other, that they’re at completely different stages of life, and that I see it as taking advantage of them. 

The conversation was getting a little heated, so we changed the topic, and I thought that was the end of it until my (also 19 year old) friend pulled me aside and told me that he messaged her on facebook asking if she thought he was attractive. She didn’t want me to bring it up to him because she didn’t want to make it awkward between all of us.

He’s shown this type of predatory behavior even with my older sisters friends when she was younger, often saying that “your friend is gonna be so hot when she’s legal”, and other sceevy things (bragging about younger partners etc.) 

His entire demeanor on this topic makes me extremely uncomfortable and grossed out especially when he’s pushing that on my own friends, but I don’t know how to bring it up to him without him still trying to debate me about it or just getting sulky and guilt trip-y. 

Is there a way I can get him to see how gross he’s being? I feel like he’s too old and stubborn so I don’t think I’d be able to change his behavior, but I also don’t think I’ll be able to deal with it if he’s bringing people my age home and constantly trying to hit on my friends.",13Jun2020,2

Before I start this I just want to say I am not here to bash on anybody who believes in the Qanon stuff, but I do not.  I have a lifelong best friend who is adamantly trying to convince me that ""Q"" is right, and that trump is trying to save us. I apologize for this being political, but regardless it is the situation. What should I say? Every time I tell them that I do not believe this and I would rather not talk about it, they tell me I am not open minded enough. It's getting to the point that I just avoid seeing them.

He begged me not to tell his dad, hes usually here for 4 days a month thanks to his bitch of a mother and he doesn't want to hurt his dad with this information.

743,"I’ve got a four year old niece (let’s call her Sally). I don’t have any kids myself but I think she’s pretty awesome and I’d like to consider myself a pretty good auntie. However, I’ve got myself and Sally into this weird dynamic and I need some advice. 

Basically, as Sally was my sibling’s first kid, I was super excited to be an auntie and I used to buy Sally a little gift here and there (nothing extravagant. Think a small teddy or a cool t-shirt). 

This has escalated to the point that whenever I see Sally (normally once or twice a week) she expects me to bring a gift for her. This is totally my fault for buying so much stuff and getting her used to receiving gifts on the regular. 

But I also know this is just not sustainable. It’s costing me a small fortune; I seem to spend all my time looking for things to get her; I’m worried I’m inadvertently making her spoiled; and I’m worried she just sees me as Auntie CoolGifts. 

So my question, Reddit, is this: how do I change this dynamic? I’m afraid if I just stop buying gifts then Sally’s going to think she’s done something wrong or is being punished. (And I’m very aware she’s going through some upheaval at the moment anyway due to COVID-19 - school’s out, mom and dad are working from home, etc). 

So should I just stop buying gifts? Is there a way I can frame things that would make sense to a four year old? Am I overthinking this whole thing? Any advice would be appreciated.",13Jun2020,1
744,"Ive had my kitten for a week now. She was a rescue and when i got her she was sick with vomitting diarrhea a cat cold and bloating. I took her to the vet the first day i got her spent hundreds on her survival. I even called the rescue i got her from and they accused me of lying about her being sick and that i dont know how to care for a kitten so I should return her for a refund. shes so much better in only week and ive grown very attactched to her. now a week later my dad says hes deathly allergic to cats so she cant stay in the house. 

I thought of moving out close to my university now, or returning her to the shelter or possibly finding someone to take care of her for about 6 months when i move back to school. He says his allergies are severe so i cant even restrict her to certain parts of the home. 
What is best for her in this scenario? Perhaps finding her a good permanent home and adopting another cat in a year or two? Moving out and spending hundreds on rent to live alone from all my friends? 

Im not sure if i could give her the best life with me in a bad home situation and i think im being selfish trying to keep her. But every time think of taking her back i start to feel extremely depressed and anxious. I also feel so stupid for adopting her when im living with my parents during the pandemic. I celebrated having her with all my friends i have so many pictures and videos of us together and its been a magical week but i feel so stuck on what i should do and if perhaps im not thinking realistically. Im prettysure in this climate theres a huge demand for kittens so shell find a great home most likely. But again idk how to feel

747,"My parents are planning to send me to Africa with my grandfather for what is essentially, conversion therapy once the pandemic slows and international travel becomes safer. They haven't told me how long I will stay there, and my fear is that they will force me to attend college there, since they know my plans to leave immediately for college once I turn 18. I also don't know what they will do to me there. My mother plans to accompany me for the flight. I don't have a phone, a car, or a job. My main options are to comply and hope things work out or run away. A friend has offered to house me if push comes to shove, but her parents aren't the most progressive either. I can't request emancipation yet until I am 16 next month, and even then, the process is not clear cut and may require a lawyer.

748,"Hi. As the title says, I feel like I have trouble caring about people's problems. 

I can get agitated when people come to me about there problems, such as my friends, or even my Girlfriend, which disgusts me. 

I have tried to combat this by helping people in this very sub but it hasn't worked. I enjoy helping people but I can annoyed when I can't solve people's problems fast enough or with ease. 

I can find myself getting equally stressed when someone persists about it or I'm powerless to change it. It can even get to the point where I feel like I just stop caring altogether.

750,"Using a throwaway because I’m scared this could blow up in my face...I teach at a hot yoga studio in California and just got the email that they will reopen in the coming weeks. They have given me some time to give my answer about whether or not I will return and I have no idea what I’m going to say. Clients/teachers only have to wear a mask while moving about the studio. Once on your mat, masks can come off. Class wouldn’t be possible with a mask at 105+ degrees but I’m not sure if this is a good idea right now... Classes have been reduced from a cap of 40 to now 20. But 20 unmasked people breathing “in through your nose, out through your mouth” and sweating profusely doesn’t sit right with me. 

Am I being paranoid? Is Covid over and I missed the memo or something? I don’t even know what I’m agreeing to here or what new protocols are in place so I’m just at a loss really. I also work at the front desk there and thought about perhaps only returning to do that. At least I could keep my mask on at all times and wear gloves. But again, I do not know what new responsibilities I will have and it feels wrong to just blindly agree. 

If I say I don’t feel comfortable going back I believe this is looked at as “quitting” which means I lose my unemployment and I also do not get my sick hours paid out. So, on that note I also am torn. I’ve never used any of my sick hours in the 3+ years I’ve been with the company (was never explained how to use them) and have 3 days to use by the end of this year. If anyone has knowledge on this aspect I’d really like to hear it.

My Dad (58M) retired last year. He used to work as a Head Master in a high school. He hasn't been socializing enough after his retirement. He is getting a lot of free time and he's been spending that time on watching a lot of shitty YT videos and using what's app. His mindset has totally changed.

Basically, he thinks a wife's only duty is to serve his husband.

Every night at dinner he argues with my mum about not cooking well and threatens to kill our cats. They verbally abuse wach other every night. He argues that keeping cats is not healthy. He also thinks that we love our cats more than him and we care more about them than him
(which is obviously not true).

Also, he is not giving any money to buy other stuf like clothes and other miscellaneous stuff. We used to be somewhat rich, but ever since my dad retired he is worried about his financial state. He doesn't let us buy anything.

He is also very religious and watches a lot of religious bs videos and tells us why he is morally superior to us. He is also chanting a stupid mantra everyday thinking that it will increase his wealth. 

He also threatens to leave the house and go somewhere else.

I have exams in a few weeks and I can't fucking focus.

I suggested seeing a therapist, but my dad was like: ""do you think I'm crazy? Are you gonna send me to an asylum? ""

760,"I went to camp in the summer of 2019. I brought my best friend along with me and we traveled around Main Coast hiking and making amazing memories with 2 other girls, 4 guys (8 kids in total, ages 11-13) with 3 college age counselors (1 m, 2 f). After it was over, I didn't do a very good job keeping up with people. The groupchat didn't work very well because not everyone who we added could type (I'm not exactly sure what happened).
Months after the trip ended, I went to that best friend's house and she's snapping him (on Snapchat). He asks if I have a Snapchat and so I decide to finally make one. I do, and I add him, my friend, and others. (I want to preface before I get into this that I know my friend and him were not in a relationship since my friend is gay and already has a SO). The only interactions I have with this guy is over streaks and on groupchats. I have it for around a month and I notice that a new account under his name and same Bitmoji is being recommended. I added him since, why not? I haven't gotten an add back and I've noticed that the old account is now saying ""pending"" meaning that he un-added me? I did not do anything and if anything, I wanted to rekindle our friendship since we hadn't been able to talk in many months. I thought he wanted me to get Snapchat? I never insulted him (I have no insults to give) and never made any moves or anything that would make him uncomfortable. I don't understand what has happened and my friend is still snapping him so I know that he didn't un-add everyone to start using his new account. Any advice on what to do?

This year, I am struggling with the decision to hang my Fourth of July banners on the eave of my front porch. They consist of 4-5 large cloth flag bunting that hang between brick pillars.

This may seem like a silly thing, but I live on a street with neighbors who have extreme political views. And while I have no problem standing up for the people who need support the most, I am stuck trying to decide whether my display of pride for my country during its celebration of independence will give the wrong message.

So my friend is one of these people who seek validation through the internet. She spends hours selecting photos of holidays and then putting them in folders so she can post them over a few weeks to maximise likes, every meal she cooks she spends a ridiculous amount of time recording for snapchat taking pictures and videos for Facebook etc. When she does nice things for people its not actually just to do a nice thing, it's so she can go overboard and get validation from people, she will spend hours and hours setting things up for pictures for example getting literally 10 different brands of drinks and arranging them perfectly on a table so she can take a picture then removing all the drinks from the table and replacing it with 20 different sweets and foods(bare in mind this is for her and her bf).

766,"I want to start off by saying I am very ugly. I've been on many dates but on dated two guys before my current boyfriend.

Last year I met my current boyfriend during the summer, and we started as friends with benefits. However, I moved out of state for a one-year master's program. During the summer, we had lots of sex, but he was never able to cum and it started to affect me. He would take 2 to 3 hours (mostly with a hard erection) but still wouldn't be able to cum. Usually, we would stop because I am sore by that time. He only cums when he masturbates himself or I do it for him. Anyway, we were only friends with benefits so I didn't mind that much. In January, we started talking again on social media and realized we actually like each other. We decided to do long distance dating.Due to COVID-19, I relocated my home state. We would were current four hours apart. I went to stay with a friend in his town for a month and we had sex, but he still couldn't cum. We would cuddle, talk, and kiss but he still couldn't cum. It was affecting me so much. My self-esteem went down and felt that he wasn't into me [physically.](https://physically.my/) My friends said maybe it is because he just came, but that is not true. No matter what, he can't cum in me.

I recently talked to my friend who used to hook up with him years ago, and my friend said my bf was able to cum. It destroyed my self-esteem. I have been very sad these days and feel that I am not good enough. I wish I wasn't here in this world anymore because the man I love can't cum around me but he could when it was someone else. I confronted him and he said he has delayed ejaculation and has never cummed inside anyone he has hooked up with. I know he was lying to make me feel good because my friend did say he cummed.

As he suffers from depression and social anxiety I have realized after years of friendship that I can not help him to fight out of his emotional deeps any more. It takes me too much strength to get him back on his feet and support him the way I should. Currently I feel emotional blunted to him as I do not want to let those emotion come close to me. And now I’m thinking currently about moving out and give our friendship a temporary distance. But as I think about this step I can’t imagine how devastated he will be after I tell him my decision.

In sports i’ve always been the worst player (usually benched in hockey, basketball, etc.) as the skinny short person that i am i don’t have much to show for sports. With no sporting talent my last resort on these teams were to make friends with other players. Didn’t go so well as i made 0 friends with all my attempts. Not even the coaches wanted anything to do with me.

School wise i’m quite a “below average” student. My grades have always been around 40-50% ever since elementary. i’ve tried to get better by asking parents and teachers, nothings really changed. I’m concerned for myself about graduating if i’m gonna be able to get into a college or university.

With no other direction, i tried my way with music. My family was excited to hear i wanted to try it out; they were very musical. Unfortunately, I couldn’t learn anything for the life of me, jumping from piano, trumpet, and others i can’t seem to get the hang of anything. I was so un teachable my private music teacher for piano quit while trying to teach me.

In the end, no talents or much to give, i wake and play playstation, my days have almost no meaning and i go dawn to dark while days go by while i witness everyone i know have some talent or chance in life. Daily routines involve games and sleep, with barley interaction with anybody.

I have no motivation in anything anymore, i don’t know what to do or where to go for any help, a therapist would likely help i am unemployed, with no where close to enough money to book one.

hopefully this is the right place, i feel somewhat comfortable venting out to some strangers on the internet. Can anyone give me something to motivate myself to keep walking in this tunnel of loneliness. Maybe some light at the end?

He never parks in his spot and takes all the open spots.  From sun up to sun down he makes his car alarm go off and on, for what reason, IDK.  One of his vehicle is a loud MF too. He starts it every night around 11pm and revs the engine then goes back inside and the same shit at 5 in the morning. I get that it's apartment living and that's what you gotta deal with.  What should I do? I contacted my apartment office numerous times and they laugh about it and say there's nothing they can do.  Also he has his Instagram handle on his car.

785,"I was badly bullied throughout school, to the point where my High School let me do independent study summer of the end of sophomore year and I graduated at 16. I still find myself thinking people are trying to manipulate me or assume the worst an everyone. Anyone else been through this too?",13Jun2020,1
786,"So basically what the title says, it’s a recent issue. Ever since I graduated high school (a year ago) I’ve been too scared to be seen in public by people I attended school with. All my relationships with people ended after high school because we either stopped talking, lost touch or got into arguments which could never be fixed. A lot of these people spread horrible things about me and it’s just gotten to the point where if I try and reconnect with anyone again, it doesn’t work. They already have a horrible view on me 

I still see on social media that everyone else still hangs out with each other and mostly all the others in the graduating class are still super tight. 

I lived on campus my first year and only really came back during some weekends to visit my family and then went back. It wasn’t really an issue, but now that I’m back home and won’t be moving out for a while because of COVID, I am so scared.

I don’t know if I’m being irrational but the thought of me having to leave my house fills me with so much anxiety. Like my body starts feeling tense, I feel my chest tighten and I get so so paranoid. I haven’t left my house at all for almost 4 months now and this isn’t doing good for my mental health either. 

In the community I live in, all my favourite places is where everyone else hangs out. And soon I need to go to the library to study since classes are online and we only have one library everyone goes to. 

I tell myself all the time to stop caring, that people don’t actually give a shit. That the world does not revolve around me, I’m just being so dumb but it doesn’t work. 

Right now, I’ve made leaving my house seem like a nightmare even if it’s not a big deal and I don’t know what to do about it",13Jun2020,1

Recently I’ve felt like my my mums been super harsh
I mean my moms never been the nicest person or anything but recently it’s like she criticises everything more than ever

We argue a lot every time  she criticises me and although I know she’s wrong eventually it makes me feel insecure about whatever she said and 
I Hate it 
It’s like She’s being awful to me about what I look like and fashion choices my hobbies music pretty much everything and then she says she just wants me to be the best version of myself and then I start to think it’s okay for her to say all those things because  other people have family life way worse plus it’s normal for mothers to be harsh right?

789,"This turned out really long, sorry. Have included TL/DR at the end.

So I'm (32f) trying to lose weight atm. Not much, 10kg total, but it will bring me right to the bottom of the healthy range in terms of BMI. It's the weight I always was until I moved to the USA during college for a few months during my early 20s, which is when I put on maybe 3 or 4kg, and since then work stress has put the rest on over about 8 years. 

I'm getting a little concerned about my own thinking. I am a bit obsessed by food at the moment. I've lost 2.5kg within a month by restricting my calories to 1200 (TDEE 1600ish, BMR 1400). I've been really good and consistent at weighing EVERY THING and making sure anything that goes past my mouth goes into my food diary on MFP. Except last night. Last night I had a pizza. Over 1200 calories in it alone. I would point out that I'm actually lactose intolerant but took lactase pills before eating it. It was awful - fatty and so salty. But I gobbled it down all the same. Afterwards I felt very guilty. I felt kinda sick with myself and spent maybe 30 minutes thinking about vomiting it back up. Ultimately didn't have to because I reacted badly to it and was in the loo for ages (TMI, sorry) but was so relieved that it I suppose couldn't have all been absorbed calorie wise (I hope). 

I know I must remain strong on the calorie front to lose weight (CICO and all) but I want to get to my goal weight and be able to enjoy food again. Today I only ate 760 kcal from meals but decided to add 210 of chocolate. Even now I'm sitting here wishing I hadn't had the chocolate. It doesn't help that the weight loss is so slow. I tried not weighing myself every day but ended up very upset at not knowing so I weighed myself anyway. 

How do I get my slightly obsessive tendancies back in check? Thinking of making myself throw up and then being relieved at being unwell has me a bit spooked at myself. 

TL/DR: I'm on a diet and very committed but I think verging towards overly committed. How to lose weight without developing an eating disorder?",13Jun2020,1

794,"Sorry this is so long there’s a TLDR at the end
So I just started a new job a few weeks to a month ago. I’ve been doing really well (at least I think) and the boss has been giving me a lot of hours these past 2 weeks. Last week, when i first got a lot of hours, the girl who trained me seemed to act rather cold to me. I heard her complaining to someone else about her hours and when I checked saw she had a lot less than me, and less than she’d had the week before. I was really nice to her because I understand that shes probably anxious about her job, but for the most part she barely spoke to me while still being very warm and friendly to everyone else. Today however, when we got our schedules for this week (2nd week of me having more hours than her), she made my workday hell. It’s foodservice, and I was making food. I only know how to do 2 things so far: make food and prep 1 ingredient that we need halfway thru the day. Well this morning she decided to basically run over to my spot everytime i left (to go to the bathroom, to refill an ingredient, to wipe something down,) and do my job. It got to a point where I was basically just standing around while she did my job as fast as she could, seemingly just so I could have no part in it. She would say things like “Oh don’t worry I’ve got this” or “you can just go over there and i’ll finish these” as if she was doing me a favor. But it really didn’t feel that way; it felt like she was purposely trying to do my job to prove herself or something. It was beyond frustrating and I felt like I was gonna go crazy saying nothing, because there was literally nothing else for me to do. She had other prep work and complex orders she could do that I couldn’t. Idk what to do about it because everyone else sees her as an incredibly sweet girl, but it feels like she’s targeting me in the most subtle way she can. I just wanted to scream go do ur job and let me do mine!!!!

TLDR; i got more hours than the girl who trained me and she now runs over to do my job in between her tasks just so I can do nothing.",13Jun2020,1

So long story short, I procastinated a lot on my class and I was taking 2 classes that my professor is teaching online. One class I got an A and turned in things late and the other class I didn't do the work as much as I should. But today was the deadline and she was accepting work until today which I did. I must have ticked her off the wrong way and she popped off at me and re-graded all my work and applied the late penalty to all my grades. We had an exchange before this and I simply stated my situation and told her it was okay if she didn't get me the grade I wanted but she replied later saying ""  Plus, I didn't buy the sob story about having to have a B grade in the class or they would drop you. Please!!! LOL"" I found this very distasteful and would've gladly accepted the C grade in my class. 

She didn't mark anyone else's grade work late and simply just graded mine late, what should I do? Is there enough basis for me to report her to the dean? 

I'm not trying to change my grade, my grade is what I deserve I understand but for her to undermine me and sort of go ""power hungry"" is what I am bothered about. What can I do?",13Jun2020,1

I have been a very sensitive person since growing up. Part of it could be the fact that I cared about people way too much and when they hurt me, I would fret about it as long as I can. 

But anyhow, lately I have been getting triggered from the slightest of things. It could be some cashier I met who was rude to me. A person who criticized my work even though majority liked it. A sly comment from someone which can be easily ignored. Like I just don’t want to be triggered and think about it all day. 

Like I get it some things you do need to worry about that’s life, but like why am I having petty things on my mind all day. It’s so annoying but I can’t help but dwell on it.

800,"Okay so one of my best friends has this boyfriend who I'll name G and best friend shall be A, so I had a huge crush on G for ages though didn't realise for a little while. When I realised (A and G weren't dating at the time though I knew A had a bit of a crush on him but mainly leaned towards another boy) during our maths lesson I told A that I had a crush on G. (He had or still has a crush on me which I knew about) A was probably my closest friend I thought I could tell at the time. But that turned out wrong. I told her not to tell ANYONE about it. And since it was close to the end of the school she was all hyper and everything because I finally expressed that I had feelings for someone.

As we walked out of the school we saw some of my friends and we were talking for ages. One of them (I'll name S) realised A was acting weird and more hyper than usual. So A whispered it to her as we were walking. S wanted to do something and I instantly hated her for it. She proceeded to scream about how I had a crush on G.

I was horrified at how rude and irresponsible my friends were being but also incredibly upset and embarrassed so I quickened my usual sluggish pace of walking to a full on sprint. Where I was basically on the verge of tears. Luckily I'm no longer friends with S but I'm still friends with A and G.

G noticed that I had ran of and went after me with one of my other friends at the time. Nothing really changed at the time between me and G we just remained friends even though we both knew we had feelings for one another.

More recently A and G got together but G doesn't seem like he wants to be in the relationship he seems like he wants to distance himself from A. He always seems a little uncomfortable around her but when he's only around me he seems a lot more comfortable and talkative. My sister and many other people think he still has a crush on me and I slightly think he might.

As a way to kind of let A get her chance with him I forced myself out of a crush which somehow worked. I wanted A to be happy she had a crush on him since S1 and I only developed the crush during S2 (this was the school year I was in when everything started up)

A few weeks ago I had a dream with G in it. He held me in his arms and I could feel the sense of love in the dream. Though gained control and ask him about his relationship with A. He said they were still dating in it and I pushed him away.

Today I finally accepted the fact the I now have a crush on G the boyfriend of A who is my best friend. And I don't know what the hell to do and I'm scared that I'm gonna ruin a friendship or something.

813,"So a bit of input: We have some cats who like to frequently go outside but we've also had a ""problem"" with raccoons coming to our door eating the leftover food of our cats. So, logically, I'd think it's best to stop keeping the food outside like that and try to drive them away, so that they stop coming here every night. Problem is, we've already lost a few cats before. They could have simply gotten lost, surprise adopted by some overly nice strangers or - as my family and I think - snack'd by our local raccoon gang. They tend to come here every night. Hearing cats and other animals screaming every few nights is nothing unusual, so they're clearly fighting eachother.

Now, I'm not the one who's in charge of things here and my parents wholeheartedly believe that by continuing to ""feed"" the raccoons, they should be satisfied and thus should not attack our cats. But if we do try to take matters in our hands and stop feeding them all in all, they might be hungry and much more likely to attack our cats for food. According to Google, raccoons can indeed decide to eat cats. So, I'm honestly not sure myself anymore. And even if we manage to completely drive them away, it's likely that some more could just return later, putting our cats in danger again.

So, shall we just let them be, hoping that they will just return for food and leave our cats alone or shall we attempt to fight them, which means that they will be more hungry than usual and more likely to decide to eat our cats? Is the risk worth it?",13Jun2020,1

816,"**TL;DR:**

How do I cancel my Medi-Cal? Who do I contact and what information do I need to do it?

**Background**

Tried to keep it short but whatever.

Was forced to apply for Medi-Cal back in 2018 at a trade school. My application got stuck in a ""still processing"" limbo where I was technically in the system but couldn't use the health insurance. I DID try everything to make them finish processing my account but they told me it was out of their hands (?), so already I hate Medi-Cal for this. It never worked the whole time I originally had it.

Then I got a job with some *good* health insurance. I’m told by my trade school friends, who got the same job as me at the same time, that Medi-Cal dies off if you don’t renew it. So we all let it die off and they hadn’t had this upcoming issue yet.

I get a call like a month ago asking for an address update from Medi-Cal. I told the operator I didn’t want Medi-Cal anymore. She said I could have two health insurances at once. I said I don’t want it.

I hate to admit I don’t know a lot about anything with ""real world"" things and just assumed everything she said was fine. She said I *can* have multiple health insurances, like “If your current provider can’t cover one thing then we can cover it.” She's literally a Medi-Cal employee, so I'm thinking this is reputable information.

My mom overheard the call and jumped in, telling me I can’t have two health insurances at once, I can get in trouble at work over it and that Medi-Cal is… honestly shit compared to what I have now that literally covers *everything* (hate to admit she went Karen and chewed the operator out).

The rest of the phone call goes like this:

* Look, I’m not *renewing* her health insurance myself. We just want an address update so we can send the form out next week. *That form* is what she will use to tell us whether or not she wants to stay with us or if she's even eligible for it now that she has a job. You can decide by then whether or not you want Medi-Cal still.
* So it’s only an address update?
* Yes.

My mom helped me look into it and we found out that yeah, my work doesn't allow multiple health insurances for sure.

**Why I am now mad**

I never got whatever this ""form"" was supposed to be. I automatically got renewed for Medi-Cal anyways. The information doesn't even fit anymore so I've got this Medi-Cal insurance with completely false information. I don't want to lose my not-shit health insurance or get in trouble over this.

**Where I'm running into trouble**

Why do they make it so hard?

The letter I got says I can get a ""State Hearing"" to challenge the action of renewing my Medi-Cal. I'm thinking that's a bitch much but not sure what to do so I contact *those* guys.

They confirm that yeah, their office *is* too much for what I am asking for so they give me the LA county number to get rid of the Medi-Cal.

I can't get into *that* one because I never got issued a PIN. I don't even know what that is. I look it up and there's an office to call to get the stupid PIN.

I call *that* office. They want like a ""Beneficiary ID"" or something, which *surprise*, I don't have (or if I do, I have no idea what it even is). I can't figure out what this means so I don't know who to contact at this point.

Basically I don't know what I need or who to call at this point. I'm literally crying from the frustration right now.",13Jun2020,1

820,"In desperate need of advice for this one. 

Me(18) and my boyfriend(19) live together with our 2 dogs. We have 4 other roommates, 2 of them were having a problem with. nik(28) and Jay(30) 

Some back ground, they smoke a ton of weed, they have all of there stuff in the living room and leave it on this table that my dogs can reach on to it. I have a 1.5 years old and a 10 weeks old. The hippies are all about politics, and like to control everything in the house and make problems out of thin air pretty much. 

These main problems that I'm explaining are going to help understand why me and my bf are so irritated with the recent one. 

1. Nik wants us to recycle, which me and my bf dont mind doing it. She likes to say we have to bc the landlord said so, but we talked to landlord, she said she doesn't care. If we dont Recycle she throws a fit like a 3 year old would and say ""youre stupid for putting the garbage in the wrong bins, we made signs for a reason so look at them"". 

2. The hippies like to leave all of their stuff around, including their weed. Both of my dogs are big, they reach the coffee table where they leave their weed and my older one likes to eat any kind of paper. Theres been times where I go upstairs to make food and they left their stuff with no one watching it, and I've had to chase my dog to get the dab out of his mouth. They were mad, I told them to pick up their stuff so it doesn't happen and they started saying they did and that it's not their responsibility to make sure my dogs dont eat their stuff. 

 My dog ate a pair of dollar tree headphones that were left on the floor and she threw such a fit about it that I went a bought new ones just to get her to shut up

3. She made a chore chart that she makes us sign with the date and our name and if we dont she gets mad throws a fit and in her words, yells ""no one listens when I say things need to be cleaned"". She put on there that we have to pick up the dog poop at least 3 or 4 days out of a week. Which I do it 2 times a week and it's fine. 

4. Anytime theres dishes in the sink they think its mine and my bf and tell us to clean them up. (They also say their dirty dishes are ours) 

5. We live in the basement underneath the livingroom and kitchen. Anytime she gets upset, especially with me or my bf she jumps and stomps her feet on the ground right above us and yells

6. I got a job as a cna and its grave shifts, nik has been telling our roommates and making a big deal out of it because she thinks I got the job to cause problems in the morning when their not quiet

7. Nik complains that I make my bf do all the choirs and that I'm lazy because I have him do dishes, take out the trash, and vacuum when it needs to be done.... she doesn't do anything and likes to say she's constantly cleaning the house. She doesnt even have a job

8. I dug a little circle out side to put a kitty pull in (it was about 6 inches deep at most) for the dogs and replanted some little trees that were coming up from under the fence. The next day Nik ripped out my little plants and threw them away and the days after that up until 2 days ago when I empty the swimming pool, she was throwing dirt into it and grass chunks with dirt still attached to it. 

9. if you don't agree with them on anything they find a way to tell you, you are wrong and dumb for thinking the way you do. I cant have a conversation with my bf about anything bc they butt in and make it political or put their opinion in.

Now the recent problem has to do with my dogs. Ever since we moved in, my older one pooped in the same 2 places and still does. Now that we got a puppy she likes to poop where my older one does. Well just recently they decided to make a little garden right where my dogs poop. They keep causing problems with it and telling us to make our dogs poop somewhere else. Usually I wouldnt mind training them to not do it by their garden that they recently put in, but they've been causing so much problems and wanting everything their way and that I dont want to do anything for them.

Me and my bf are looking for new places, but in the meantime I'm not sure if I should just let everything go and then vent to my bf about their bs or stand up and say something.",13Jun2020,1
821,"I have been at my first job for 9 years. While I have moved up in the ranks it's not very fulfilling. Long hours, nobody likes each other and very little appreciation. Not to mention the past isn't that great.

My boss has put me down multiple times through the years and I finally feel like I don't deserve it... I've grown a lot as an adult lately.

I just don't know where to go from here. I don't have any special skills so wherever I go won't be high paying, I just feel like it's time to leave but I don't know what's next.

I had a situation where I fell out with a cousin a year ago after I hurt her and she completely stabbed me in the back. I was living with her at the time and she said she wanted for me to be honest with her about my job and I was, but she was upset because she didn’t like the legal job that I had was degrading. I owned up to and apologized to her for hurting her and I completely understand that she would be mad and have things to say. But she used her anger to bring up every private and personal thing that I’ve ever told her and tell me about how I was using the emotional abuse that I’ve went through as a child as an excuse to be lazy. At the time of the fallout, I was working a full time and the job that we fell out about would’ve been a second job . I also have clinical depression and anxiety that was diagnosed by a psychologist. 
I felt triggered because there have been times in the past where people have told me to be completely honest with them and I was and I’ve been stabbed in the back in the exact same ways. She also lied to me while I was living at her house about her husband intentionally not paying on his car so it could get repossessed because they couldn’t afford the payments. They used my car for free (they did occasionally give gas money) while he had a suspended license and I never found out until the cops came to the house regarding the issue. But I never got an apology for that. It’s also triggering because I come from A narcissistic family and have always been made to feel guilty in almost every bad situation that I’ve had with my older family members (that whole “Your mother/grandmother Will always be right and deserving of respect because they’re older than you ,even if they disrespected you”). It’s also hard because I couldn’t speak up for myself while I was living at her house and I don’t wanna go off on my cousin because she seems like the type of person who would bring up every private thing that I’ve ever told her to family members.
At the time that all this was going on, I was living with her for 5 months in a city 12 hours away from my narcissistic mother, both of my grandfathers passed within a week of each other a week before this, and I found out that my father had stage III cancer. I’m waiting until things open up to see a therapist ,but for now I’m trying to meditate and eat right and do everything positive to keep my mind off of the situation. Everyday I think about what happened to me and I’m just tired of it and I want to let go. I know and understand why the situation was extremely triggering to me and I’m trying to work on those things ,but I still cannot get over it. Even if I’m with my friends or out doing something and have a good day it still comes across my mind. My cousin already ran her mouth to my family pretty much saying that she “doesn’t know why I never contact her anymore” and lied saying that I ignored her calls and text even though she hasn’t reached out to me.
 I just want to let go and get over the trauma.",13Jun2020,1

824,"Its 1:30 am so bear with my possible incoherency

I started using this platform a month ago and this is my fourth account because I can't fucking get off of here . I spend 10-11 hours a day staring at this screen on Reddit, and my already dry eyes are just getting blurry and strained, and I have 25+ hours of online class to catch up on. Every time I start up on scheduled class I end up using split screen and just browsing this shitty website or I watch porn . I look like a sleepdeprived panda and I'm getting even fatter than I already am. I'm alone at home except for my dad and he's busy and we don't really talk too much anyway. 

Its not like I even do anything worthwhile; I spent pretty much all my time on only three subs and  I just keep obsessively refreshing my existing comments to see if people downvote/upvote me for some kind of pathetic validation of my opinion like some loser. And if someone is gonna read this and stalk my comment history, much of it is on acircle jerk sub, I'm not actually crazy, don;t misunderstand

I've deleted my account 4 times but I just always end up remaking another account. I feel lonely to some extent. Like, its not that bad, but i feel empty. I do have oligations and I need to study but ffs I can't bring myself to start. Some level of FOMO too.

I start everyday thinking oH heyy maybe someone commented or something, and I always say I'll only spend ten seconds to check up but I end up spending 10 hrs and the worst thing is I never even realise that much time passes.

828,"I live in Florida, and have spent 3 months in quarantine/lockdown with my parents. I'm 23 years old, male, and trying to get my life together after some years spent goofing off.

Lockdown has ravaged my mental health, and it is only made worse by the larger predicament I'm in.

The long and short of it is that my parents broke the news that they wanted to be retired and moved by July of this year. They told me this in December of last year. I spent most of this Spring semester trying to balance a part time job and school, and I barely made it through with my brain intact from the stress of it all.

They initially bought this retirement home of theirs in 2018, but the time they wanted to be moved by has been constantly changing ever since. 5 years, ""when we both retire"", 2 years, 3 years, ""when we both retire and grandma passes away"", and finally they gave me a 7 month deadline in December. It's further complicated because the home is in a 55+ retirement community, which means that I cannot move with them, or even live with them. The house is 6 hours north from where we are now.

I got furloughed by my job in March, and I haven't gotten another one since. Im too afraid to. Both of my parents are 65+ and I can't risk putting their health at risk, especially so close to their dream retirement.

They've moved the date by when they want to be retired by a few months, saying that ""By January, we want to be out of here for good."" 

Both are working right now, as they've been blessed enough to remain employed in the recession, but I still don't think they understand the magnitude of the crisis our economy is facing. My dad works at an airport shipping center and my mom works as a paralegal. They've felt no economic ripple. Nothing has changed for them. L

I can't find any jobs in my industry, because the ones Im qualified for are in the hospitality and tourism industry (which has been ravaged by COVID), and Im too afraid to get a basic job with uber or Target or anything really because they all require me to be around people all day. Lets not even talk about how none of these jobs are full-time, meaning that I won't have insurance or any useful benefits when they move out.

In fact, my current job is reopening again starting this week, and I continually try to stall because I don't *want* to work right now. Its full of people and since social distancing has been thrown out the window at places like Universal and Disney (I work at a zoo where lots of visitors pass through every day), it's just begging for things to go horribly wrong.

I can't stop my state from reopening because our stupid Governor continually acts as though nothing is wrong, despite the massive spikes in confirmed cases we've seen in the last 2 days alone. (He says ""I think we're doing really good. Let's start reopening"" on the same day we had the largest spike in deaths at that point). 

Not to mention that people aren't taking any of it seriously anymore, claiming that it's ""just the media trying to scare us into a recession"" (despite the spike of 2000+ new cases in a 24 hour period). My parents are even part of this problem, because my dad (who works at an import/export facility at the international airport) keeps visiting my 92 year old grandma each week, no matter how much I beg and plead with him not to.

Im stuck in a position where Im too afraid to get a job due to the possibility of infecting my parents (especially since everyone in my area has just thrown precaution out the window), where I don't *want* to go back to work for the same reason, but where Im faced with such an upfront, loose deadline that I may have no choice *but* to do these things.

I *want* to work and move my career forward.

I *need* to socialize, because isolation has sent me into a deep, terrible depression and bolstered my anxiety into full blown paranoia. I can't even talk with my friends on Teamspeak/Skype/Discord because my mom has been working from home and she answers phone calls all the time. The office is right across from my room, so even with the door closed, my voice carries. So here I am just silently in my room, whittling the day away.

But I can't socialize *or* move my career because my parents are precisely at the high risk age, and my chosen industry is in ruins.

Im so scared for the future. Im so depressed. Im so paranoid. I'm so distressed about what's going to happen to me (because with the way my parents talk, they make it sound as though they plan on moving up whether Im prepared/financially stable/independent or not).

My motivation for anything is just... Gone. Its gotten to a point where just getting out of bed is a struggle for me. Even to use the bathroom. I can hardly even play video games anymore because I lack to the drive to simply open up Steam.

Obviously, there's the whole ""just wash your hands, wear a mask"" schtick, but when working with large crowds, it's not as simple. And then there's the whole ""You can move"" bit, but if I move, then my grandma will be left all by herself, with the nearest relative being 6 hours+ away. (She has aides who stay with her, but these people only work during the day, and do not come during the night). I cant do that to her. I don't have it in me.

I have no credit.
Little savings.
I live in a city where rent is generally 1200-1700 a month (and they demand proof that you make at least twice as much each month)
I rely on my dad's insurance for therapy and medical care.
The career/field I've chosen to study and work in is basically useless at this point because the virus destroyed the industry demand.
I can't afford rent here, even with a job
I'm depressed
Paranoid
Scared
And stagnant.

I can't move forward 
I can't go back
Im too scared to move in another direction for fear of my parent's safety.",13Jun2020,3

831,"I am looking for advice to help my (20F) little sister (18F), I love her a lot but she doesn't seem to do anything all day most days. She has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past, which runs in the family and we have all suffered from. The problem with my sister is I feel like she doesn't realise her life has already started and it's as if she is waiting for something.

I am going into my last year at uni and she dropped out of a 1 year art course last year but has done nothing since. She did have a job but it was part time and due to lockdown she doesn't at the moment. My whole family try to encourage her to do things but she doesn't even engage in her old hobbies like painting and sewing since she dropped out of the art course. I have a small creative business and she agreed to take pictures with me for it but she doesn't seem enthusiastic at all and goes on her phone most of the day. 

She does have a boyfriend who she stayed with most of the lockdown and friends whose main hobby is drinking, I think she is brighter and has a lot of potential about her and could be doing something a lot more fulfilling. I know she is still young but I worry about her and what she will end up doing with her life due to this mindset, we are both at my parents house for summer (she lives here anyway) and I want to try to show her that there's more to life than waiting for it to fall in your lap.

833,"To give background to my relationship. I (15 F) met my boyfriend (18 M) five years ago, 2015 where we were basically our first love and first boyfriend/girlfriend. However, our relationship soon ended. He was the one who broke up. He actually really broke me and made me think I was not enough leading him to leave me. He used to ignore me for 3-5 days at times. He would just not respond to my texts or get back to me and when he would return and respond to me he would give me an excuse and I would just accept him. I was also 15 at that time and honestly I didn’t know better or know my self worth. Then he broke up with me, with an excuse. Both our families are very conservative and we have muslim parents so we aren’t allowed to date he used that excuse despite not being religious. He said his parents found out and took his phone away forcing him to break up. However, I knew that was not the case. I just had a gut feeling that he lied and I was correct. I was really heartbroken because I really did like him. Then years went by. As I was getting better it seemed like that’s when he started to regret his decision. I did not want to see him or find him anywhere in social media so I had him blocked on many social media applications. But, he reached out to me 3-4 times using fake or different accounts and asked me to see him to explain himself or at least talk for forgiveness. His friends reached out to me saying he still has feelings for me. However during those times I was with someone else. So I ignored him and everything he said. Then fast forward to 2019 I was single, where he reached out to one of my closest friend asking if he can talk to me through her. She obviously asked me what I would want to do. At first I was hesitant I didn’t want to speak to him at all. Then, I felt bad and I felt like I had some feelings for him left deep down. So, I did give him a chance to speak and tell me what he wants to say. He began telling me how he regrets breaking up with me. And after hours of talking about how he misses me and how he has only ever had real feelings for me despite talking to other girls. However, when I asked why he broke up with me in the first place he once again used an excuse, he said because of our age differences. He is 3 years older than me. He said he was already 18 and in college and it didn’t feel right to him that time. Even though I knew that wasn’t the real reason back then I still listened. After talking for couple days I started to fell for him again. Then, a week later we met up in person and decided to forget the past and start fresh, a new relationship. But it still bothered me that he lied to me 5 years ago and he’s still not truthful. So I confronted him and told him I know he lied to me about his parents finding out and he did come clean and said he did lie at that time. Then, he just apologized many times and I decided to leave the past behind because I wanted to give him another chance because I have feelings for him. Our relationship as of now is good, we do fight but mostly for small silly reasons. We are best friends and honestly it feels good being with him. But, I don’t always feel good. I keep wanting to change and mold myself into what he truly wants. He follows a lot of instagram models, small and big influencers. It doesn’t bother me honestly as long as he’s not texting them or talking to them which I know he doesn’t. But, one thing he does is he occasionally sends me posts of the instagram girls’ pictures saying how I should dress like them or how I would like good. Like I said I am muslim, I do not wear a hijab nor do I practice Islam but my mom is very strict and doesn’t let me wear revealing clothes. So I obviously have a very different sense of style which is very different than instagram models. Here and there he sends me their pictures and says I should dress like them. Which makes me feel very insecure because I am not like them. I do not have the body of an instagram model. I am fairly skinny and wouldn’t consider myself “thick” lol. I do not want to mention this to him either. I don’t want to tell him it bothers me. But I feel like I changing myself for him. I bought clothes to look like the girls he follows. I do like the styles but there are times where I have to change the clothes in the car or hide it from my family. Because I want to please both, my family and my boyfriend. I think if I did tell him he would understand and tell me I should wear what I want but I do not want him to ever know how I feel about this. I’m just confused. I think I’m just scared he will leave me again if I am not what he wants. I do feel really happy with him. And I am deeply in love him. He also makes me feel very loved and always lets me know how important I am to him. The reason I am writing here is because I need advice. I don’t know what to think or feel. I just feel very insecure in this relationship. I don’t want to let him know I feel this way because he will feel sad. Please comfort me. I want to feel completely happy. Please share your thoughts about my relationship and what you would do or what I should do.",13Jun2020,1

836,"Hello people of Reddit I'm asking for your honest advice on something that's been going on ever since I moved to a new area, I'd say about a month ago.

For backstory I'm a female, 20, and I live alone. So I usually have to walk to a corner store or gas station nearby to get stuff like milk if a friend can't drive me anywhere to get what I need. As I said I just moved and the only store that's safe to walk to is this little corner store. The next option is a gas station but I have to cross a busy road that spits off from the highway to get to it and people drive like maniacs there. It was all fine for the first 2 to 3 trips going to the corner store to get necessities. The first guy was this nice older man who would just say hello, ring my stuff up and I'd be on my way. No problems there.

Then from the 4th trip after this new guy who looked like he was in his 30's started working the counter. He started off just seeming nice and he'd say small compliments like ""You look beautiful."" And stuff like that. I don't mind compliments like that from anyone as long as they're polite. Then as I went there more he started asking me stuff like if I was married, do I live alone, what's my job. And then he'd ask if I had a boyfriend after I'd just say no to the married thing and then I'd say ""I don't and I'm not looking for one"". He'd say comments like ""Oh yeah the guys around here are bad bit I'm not"". At first I just brushed it off as the guy casually flirting at first, and just smiled and kept things casual. I don't really like deeming anyone as a ""bad"" person unless they actually do something bad.

The somewhat creepy part comes in when he'd just keep trying to get information from me almost every time I went to the store. It was getting a little annoying and unnerving when it seemed like he didn't get the hint and still try to ask questions. He'd ask about my family, my friends. And the thing is I don't think he's a bad guy, maybe just bad at picking up women. But I'd like to know what I should do to just stop him from prying without hurting his feelings or making him look like a bad person. Or if I should just stop going to that store all together and maybe take a longer walk to get to the gas station safely and avoid the highway off ramp road thing (I have no clue what those roads are called getting off the highway and near the highway) 

I'd really appreciate some advice and thank you if you read my little post.",13Jun2020,1

842,"Let me first preface this by saying that I live in Pakistan, and I moved here with my family less than a year ago. I currently don’t have the means to move elsewhere, especially with the world being the way it is right now.

So, let’s start from the beginning: About 4-5 years before I moved here, me and my father got word from our extended family that a weirdo was stalking my cousins. This fella, let’s call him RR, was a slightly older gent who was following and befriending my two male cousins, both of whom were around 9-10 y/o at the time. He would buy them presents, invite them over to his house (where they went), followed them around, and took pics of them (nothing inappropriate, as far as we know). So far, a little concerning. Then we were directed to his FB page. Hoo boy; there were pictures of roses, hearts, etc. with my cousin’s names photoshopped in, pics of bloody slit wrists, pics of other young children (both boys and girls), and lovey-dovey poetry directed towards my cousins. Nothing illegal, as far as I know, but certainly worrying. Eventually, during one of our trips to Pakistan, my dad confronted him publicly (and loudly) to get him to back off. He also explained the whole concept of stranger danger to my cousins; one of them (henceforth referred to as U) understood, and has since snubbed RR, much to his chagrin. The other, however, let’s call him H, is too naïve, or something. I’m not sure why, but he still interacts with RR, not going to his house, but accepting his presents, talking to him, etc. As a result, he’s become RR’s main target.

Fast-forward to the present, and a recent interaction between RR and H caught our attention. My dad and U’s brother again confronted RR in front of me, H, and H’s dad. Based on what I’ve found out since then, H and U’s dads don’t confront or report RR as they are afraid of retribution, especially since they both have a daughter each. RR had moved out of our neighbourhood, but still comes to pray at the local mosque so he can meet and interact with H and U. Nobody else, including my parents, want to do anything as they don’t want to get involved (such a strong family /s). Since this is in Pakistan and I’m fairly new here, I don’t really know what legal options, if any even exist. Looking at his FB page now, there are a lot of disturbing things there; pics of a bloody heart with H and U’s names, poetry expressing yearning and love for them, and anger at H’s dad, pics of religious buildings with H and U’s names over them, and many, many pics of various kids. He went on a religious pilgrimage sometime back, and even that period, he spent taking covert pics of kids.

Rumour has it that he was once married with a kid, but his wife left him, and took the kid with her. I can’t imagine why /s. I also wonder if he isn’t enacting some kind of revenge on H and U’s parents, given how he is targeting them so much. Almost everybody has advised us to stay away from him and not get involved. However, I have an infant daughter. I’d rather not imagine him targeting her someday, nor what I’d do if he did. I am turning to Reddit in the hopes that maybe someone here can give us some decent advice. Thank you in advance.

844,"I am currently dating this guy from uni, we were briefly friends until our relationship morphed into a romantic one. I really like him (and the feelings are mutual) but I am finding it really hard to not overthink when I am with him due to the prospect of potentially messing something up.

I have severe anxiety (GAD and SAD) and find that when it comes to the idea of kissing or even holding hands I cannot stop my mind from racing. I am worried that I am doing it wrong (for handholding) or that I won’t know how to do it (for kissing). Those aren’t skills I can learn alone, so I know I’ll have to rely on someone else to learn, but really anxious to put myself out there and be vulnerable.

I am completely clueless when it comes to relationships (no experience with guys whatsoever) so this is foreign to me. On the other hand, my guy is completely experienced in all aspects of relationships. I have asked him to take it slow as a result (he is aware of my inexperience) and has been nothing but respectful thus far. But I cannot shake the anxiety despite my desire to open up to him.

Any advice or tips?",13Jun2020,1

846,"I (m) have been close friends with my best friend (f) for the past few years. We were so very close and would confide in each other things that we never told a single soul. Well eventually I developed feelings for her, but I kept it a secret from her because she was in a happy relationship.

A few weeks ago she found out (I think from a mutual friend but I dont know who) about my feelings. She confronted me and told me that it would not change anything about our friendship and she seemed to take it very well at the time. Or so I thought.

That past few weeks she has been acting alot different around me and our friendship has deteriorated alot. A few days ago I asked her about it and she said that she cant handle knowing that I have feelings for her and still be as close. She says that she wont be as comfortable around me and that she is feeling awkward. She also says that she doesnt trust me anymore because I didnt tell her about my feelings.

The point is she said that we should stop talking as she can't handle knowing her bestfriend has feelings for her while she is in a happy committed relationship.

So basically I lost my best friend. Someone I talked to almost daily for over a year, someone who knows my deepest secrets and I hers. Even if we somehow start talking again I know it wont be the same friendship. The last few days I have been thinking about everything she said and I dont know what to do. I feel so lost without her in my life anymore, she always gave me the best advice. 

How do u deal with losing a bestfriend?

847,"I (18/F/Asia) have been suffering from mental health issues for a long time. I was diagnosed with OCD a few years back, thankfully it has come very much under control. I feel depressed most of the time. Due to some family issues about a year earlier, my mental health went under the drain. I've been trying to solve it myself, but it has become painfully apparent I can't do it, and I *need* to visit an actual therapist. My thoughts are getting messier and messier.

I have been a pretty good student all my life, but with the issues, my studying habits have become practically nonexistent. I don't want to keep being like this, but no matter how much I try I can't focus on studying now that I've gone a long time without doing it. I badly need advice on making good study habits that will actually work. I have a tutor at home, but he's not coming due to the pandemic. I feel really ashamed to admit the turn my studying has taken. (Even though I'm not taking any steps to overcome it - I know I'm a hypocrite. I need to change it!)

Now, as I said, my family situation is pretty wonky. I can't ask my parents or sibling to visit a psychologist. I have to ask them because I can't go there alone, plus I also need money as I don't work. My country is a lot different than the US.  My family treated me as 'abnormal' when I was knee-deep in OCD, and that term has struck me hard. I don't know who to ask to accompany me to the therapist because they will certainly blow it up and talk about it to the whole extended family.

Anyhow, as a result of this, I feel like people will view me as mentally retarded if I tell them what I'm going through, and this is why I'm also afraid to seek professional help. I have one or two friends I talk about the things I'm going through, but they are in the same situation as me.

I really want someone who will sit and patiently listen to each and every worry of mine, offer a neutral viewpoint instead of my brain blowing it up, and just guide me a bit.

I just feel very scared the therapist will judge me, or secretly think I'm abnormal.

If you have visited a mental health worker, can you share how you dealt with your therapist? Like what sort of questions did you ask them in your first session? What should I expect?",13Jun2020,4
848,"Hello fellow redditers,  


My name is Patrick (26) and I have a very confusing friendship with one of my friends on which I need some extra opinion. So here is the story.  


I have been friends with the particular person for some years now (28F) I am not going to hide that we were a couple at one point but decided to break up. We took our time off to move on from the break up and decided to be just friends. None of us has an intention of starting a relationship between the 2 of us so we are only friends. (I will also note here that we both live in different coutnries and haven't met in person before.)  


The problem is that for example today we were playing Minecraft. She showed me a couple things that I didn't know which was cool. I then asked her if she had any ""Sugar Cane"" so she went to get some and plant it in front of her house. And then planted another 2 infront of my house which I didn't see. After some while she said in chat ""Ok then. You are welcome xD"" and I swear I did not see the message at all. So after I noticed it I decided to thank her on FB Messenger as she logged off from the game. Her reply was ""After 20 years"" and that's where things go downhill. She started saying things like ""It was a big mistake to play with you another game.""   
I just don't understand why is she getting worked up over a stupid game. What's worse is that she always disliked me getting mad over a game we used to play together. Which is true I did sometimes go off but apologized right after which might not have been enough. But now her doing the same thing getting mad and raging at me doesn't that make her look bad ?   
Her personality is generally like that if she doesn't like what I do or act like she starts complaining/getting mad. But when she does the thing I do that bothers her it's all fine in her books....  


I've been in a rough spot ever since we broke up I was depressed and even went as far as to suicidal but fortunately I overcame all this. I even started working on myself as a human being to become a better person than what I used to be.   
But it just doesn't make any sense to me the one day she is all fun to talk to, the other she turns into someone else. I've been trying so hard for us to actually stay as good friends but seeing how things go I am not quite sure it's worth the effort. Is there something I can do to change that ? Am I doing something wrong ? Is this some kind of revange she is trying to get ?  


Thank you for reading this and I am sorry if my grammar is not good. I would really appreciate some feedback on this situation.",13Jun2020,2

851,"Hi! I suffer from bipolar II disorder (which entails depression), anxiety, and ADHD. These have all been diagnosed by a professional when I was a teenager. But being the rebellious teen I was I stopped going to the doctor, and stopped taking my meds around the age of 17. (What a dummy I was). 

Around the age of 25 I started desperately wanting to see a psychologist, and psychiatrist again but I couldn't afford it because I was at that terrible income bracket where I didn't qualify for cheap insurance but I also made to little to even be able to afford even crappy insurance, let alone be able to afford to pay out-of-pocket.

Well my financial situation has very recently changed. And after a major mental breakdown last Tuesday I decided enough was enough, I'm tired of living like this and with the help of a friend I made a longterm and short term plan to take back control of my life. One of those things In my plan was, mental health help. So I picked up some pretty damn good insurance, and scheduled my first appointment in years to see a psychologist next month. 

However, this is where I need advice. How do I approach my new psychiatrist without looking like a drug seeker. I'll be honest I kinda look like a junkie (thanks terrible self hygiene from depression) even though I don't do drugs outside of occasionally drinking every other weekend, and smoking cigarettes daily. 

I worry because about 4-5 years ago I had an unexpected panic attack that got so bad I started thinking I was having a stroke, (I psyched myself out into showing physical symptoms) and went to thre hospital. After I was admitted and explained to the nurse I thought I was having a stroke the doctor who came into see me, looked at me and before even introducing himself or asking ne any questions, he told me straight out, that he's not giving me any drugs. He says he has junkies on the daily coming in to him looking for drugs. I was in shock. It was so unexpected, I was there because I thought I was having a fucking stroke, not drugs... It turns out it was just a panic attack inducing physical symptoms. 

Now the thing is.. I worry this could happen with my psychiatrist. Like I said I have been diagnosed with these things before and have been treated in the past. So I know what I need, I need a mood stabilizer, coinciding with an anti-depressant as not to induce a manic episode because of my bipolar disorder, ADHD medication such as an amphetamine, and anti-anxiety medication such as a sedative. 

Now.. I know doctors don't like it when patients tell them these things, I also know that doctors don't like patients that are knowledgeable on things like this either, because it can arouse suspicion that they are looking for something in particular to feed their drug habit. 

But I can't help it that I know these things. Ive researched these things heavily over the years because without being able to afford treatment I needed to learn and find ways to manage my disorders myself. Not to mention it just interest me, if I could I'd go to school for neurology, and psychology. These two topics have always interested me. 

But ofcourse the doctors don't know that, and I'm scared I could be profiled, and judged and classified prematurely as a drug seeker. 

So the other option is to play stupid, but I can't do that either because.. truthfully both my ego, AND morals won't allow that. 

Plus there's the problem that playing stupid will delay treatment because than the doctor will have to re-diagnose me which will take time, prolonging the time it will take me to get treatment for something which I already know I have. 

There's also the problem that I don't think I will be able to provide him with my previous medical records regarding my BPD because the neurologist who originally diagnosed me when I was 15 abruptly moved to another state many years ago to help with disaster relief from a natural disaster, and he never came back. And I don't know how to contact him. He will have access to my hospital records and the records from my pediatrician from when I was a kid to support my diagnosis. 

I honestly don't know if I'm just being paranoid about this whole thing. 

All I know is I desperately NEED treatment and this is the only psychiatrist in-network in my area for my insurance and I don't want to f*** this up.",13Jun2020,3
852,"I’m sorry for the long post. I tried keeping it short, but I really needed to vent.

I've been depressed since my late teens and throughout my entire adulthood. I'm now in my early 30s and on medication.

I’ve tried different meds, but, honestly, none of them helped me much. Sure, there's some improvement. It’s never substantial enough though. I live with this constant feeling of profound contempt for myself.

There’s just so much self-hate boiling under my skin - and I don’t know why. I can’t see why anyone would be interested in me. Although I have great friends, I don’t get how they can’t possibly like me.

Often, I can’t sleep properly for weeks. It’s a daily torture to even get out of bed, let alone leave my flat. Yet, I put on a fake smile and go out anyways. I used to party and drink a lot, but I can’t have alcohol anymore because of medication.

I’m profoundly miserable. I feel worthless even though I have quantifiably achieved so much in my life.

Although I enjoy being with my friends, I can only fee peaceful when I’m alone. The safety I experience when I’m in my bed alone cannot be explained with words.

Recently, my friends have been pushing me to make a move on a girl from our group. To make things short: we both know we could work as a couple, but we’d also be a toxic one. We enable each other in very unhealthy behaviors (mostly doing too many party drugs). So we decided to remain friends.

Our friends don’t know this and I don’t think it’s any of their business. They know that I’m depressed and have been supportive, but I can’t tell them how shitty I feel. It’s not fair to them, as they are not professionals and would be burdened for no good reason.

The problem is that my friends keep “shipping” us, which is making me extremely uncomfortable to the point I’m dreading to meet them. I don’t want to explain to them why this relationship would not be good for me. I shouldn’t have to, especially since I made my discomfort with their jokes pretty clear.

The truth is I don’t wanna be with anyone. I’m not comfortable in a romantic relationship. My last semi-serious relationship was beyond stressful. I’d have panic attacks before meeting this girl or just by her making plans for our next date. My heartbeat would be so high before seeing her that I could have a heart attack. When she canceled plans, I’d feel extreme relief. However, when we did go out I’d have a blast. I’d enjoy her company. I’d enjoy the sex. I just hated everything else.

During my most recent semi-serious relationship, I was also self-harming a lot. She was uncomfortable with the cuts on my thighs. And I felt self-conscious and stupid.

I don’t want a new relationship. I frankly hate the idea of having those panic attacks again. Even just putting the effort to overcome those feelings is just so damn exhausting.

I’m fine being alone and meeting my sexual needs via one night stands. I don’t long for a partner to share my life with. I’m content with being alone. Besides, why should I drag someone else into my depressing world? After all, this is a condition I can’t cure and it comes with some fucked up moments.

I’m writing this post because I need to know if my desire to be alone is perfectly normal, if I’m lazy to not wanna make an effort to overcome my issues, if I'm just a stupid man complaining about nothing, or if my condition has made me lose touch with reality.",13Jun2020,3
853,"Heya! I (19F) have been quite afraid of thunderstorms my entire life. This progressively got worse when my childhood home got hit by lightning during a severe storm when I was seven. Good thing was, no one was hurt, the majority of stuff was not broken and no property damage either. Still, it stuck with me. Luckily, I’ve received some treatment for it a while back using EMDR, but I still can’t help but feel uneasy when it comes to big lightning storms.

My current room (in another house which luckily isn’t sticking out as much as the previous one) is right under the roof. 

I figured out that eating while the storm’s bad helps me a bunch because it signals to your body that it’s safe and works against my fear. During midnight however is when the most storms occur here and the thought of me munching all night isn’t a great one, to be very honest ;). Talking to others helps too, but keeping others up at night isn’t always the best way I think. 

So do other people (with astraphobia or without) have some small useful things you can do during bad storms?

855,"Hi everyone! So I (20F) moved into a house right when COVID since on-campus housing was shut down. I moved in with two random girls who the landlord has said were both students.

857,"First of all, I'd like to say that Lasik surgery is a procedure which can give you good or not as good results. I don't want to encourage or discourage anyone who is thinking about having Lasik surgery. I'm quite happy with the results and the side effects I have are minimal.

Second, I apologize if you struggle to understand my text. I don't speak English as a first language though I've been studying it for a long time. Hope you understand me.

I underwent Lasik surgery 2 years ago (July 2018) and from the moment I left the clinique I saw 100% perfect. It was in july 2019 ( 1 year after the operation) that I started to notice I couldn't see 100% clear from far away. I thought it was my myopia kicking in again (I was about to turn 24 when I had the surgery, very young I know, but my myopia was more or less stable).

The thing is, now I feel it's gotten even worse. I try to look and guess license plates from my balcony and ask my cousin or somewhere with no vision problems. I still see Ok, I don't need to wear glasses or contact lenses BUT the thing that annoys me is:

**-I realize if I keep looking at a license plate or sign and open my eyes and suddenly start blinking, I suddenly see way better!!** 

**-Though I don't feel my eyes are itchy or hurt, I do feel they are sticky and wake up with sleepers and have to thoroughly wash my eyes every morning.**

**-Some days I feel my eyes are less sticky and I see clearer than other days.**

**-My vision is better in the mornings.**

All these things I mentioned above make me think I may not have myopia but dry eyes or something that makes me see blurry a lot of the time (far away objects).

The thing is, I don't feel my eyes are dry, I only feel they are itchy in the mornings (but I'm allergic so IDK if that's the cause)-If I had myopia my vision wouldn't be clearer or blurrier depending on the day, no??

Has anyone been in the same situation? Is it possible to feel you have myopia when in fact you have dry or “dirty” eyes?

863,"So this past summer, I [F25] broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years and not too long after, started feeling attracted to a friend of a friend. Basically, he ended up asking me out on a date and we slept together, but then immediately after that, he went cold, took a week to respond to a text and then finally told me he just wasn't ready for anything.

Long story short, I still find myself obsessing over this rebound who pumped and dumped me months ago and I now feel repulsed by anyone who seems the slightest bit attracted to me. I have no idea what is causing this exactly, but I just want to be happy on my own and stop feeling things for this guy. I can't just cut him off or avoid him entirely, because we have overlapping friend circles.

we fight pretty often and honestly, he has pretty much dominated and ""won"" every arguement if you want to call it that. we are each others best friends, and we really are all we have. i feel too needy and clingy and i can tell it drains him. he has said that i haven't really made him happier than he was before, but i still make him happy. that made me feel pretty sad because he makes me so happy. he makes me feel like a horrible person when we both make mistakes, and he said that ""past me"" was a whore and when i got angry he turned it into me hurting him. he says he has forgiven me for what i did but it still comes up so much. 

one more thing that hurts me is how he gets upset when he remembers memories of his ex and one time that stood out to me was when we drove down a street that he used to take to get to his house. we were having fun then he remembered his ex and got quiet and that same day we saw his ex's sister and he looked broken. its been a year since they've been together. he said he never loved her. they were together for 2 years. he tried to kill himself because of the lies she spread abt him. he says hes over her and i believe it but that stuff just hurts, but i feel like i shouldn't be. whenever i bring up something i have a problem with in our relationship he makes me feel bad about myseld and that im hurting him.

Every single day for the past week my parents have let themselves into my house without asking. I have a weird work schedule so everytime this happens I’m asleep and they end up waking me up. I asked them not to do this and there excuse was “I didn’t answer my phone” which of course I didn’t answer my phone... I was sleeping and I told them this multiple times.

Today they did it again and after a week of being woken up mid sleep I finally got angry and told them to give me my key back. My dad refused to give me the key and called me “antisocial” and he said “this is not right”.

So for the past 2 years I've been apart of my schools Teaching Career Path Course and I've been pretty set on being a high school Physics teacher. I have already been planning on going to a community college for 2 years starting in the fall then transferring to a state university to get my bachelor's. 

Now i just graduated from high school and have since been less exposed to Physics which was my favorite subject and over the past few months I've been working more at my job and making a lot of money and have decked out my gaming setup with new peripherals, chair, desk and a computer that i put together with the help of my brothers.

Ever since that project i have been addicted to computer parts and have realized my love for computers especially since i just got a new raspberry pi and have been fiddling with it.

So now im not sure whether or not i want to do something in computers or teaching. I dont want to be a computer teacher at least not as much as i want to be a physics teacher so thats not really a way i can mix them.

876,"I'm 22 and male. So i was with my babies mom for 3 years and we split up because it was a very toxic relationship shes was abusive. After we split I was in a hard place and I went back and well we ended up getting pregnant and we knew that it was getting back to how it was but we decided that the baby would be kept due to her having a very low possibility of having children. But we spoke to each other a lot and we decided that we were not going to sleep with other people during the pregnancy mixture of I just didn't feel like it was appropriate and well to keep the baby safe. As she's had a really hard time due to her bodies problems. Like we nearly lost the baby at 12 weeks that was a very hard weekend.

So the baby is here now and we have been Co-Parenting and its been good and she wanted to be honest with me and told me that well she had slept with someone and she was about 30 weeks. And this is during the pandemic and lockdown. But she also told me that they didn't use protection!

877,"Throwaway for the usual reasons. 

So this morning I had a mental health emergency. I live with my sister and she helped calm me down. I work at a large retail chain and I knew there was no way I could go into work today but I also couldn't really talk on the phone so she offered to pretend to be me and call in for me, and I accepted. I thought she was just going to say that I was feeling sick or something, but she decides to tell them that I had tested POSITIVE for COVID-19. Don't ask me what was going through her head because I honestly have no fucking idea. What she didn't realize was that they have a whole process for what happens when one of their employees tests positive, which includes talking to someone in HR about everyone in the store I may have come into contact with, and informing all of the other employees. So it's (understandably) a pretty big deal, however I don't have fucking coronavirus.

I definitely can't call and tell them my sister lied because I would absolutely be fired. So what should I do? Should I tell them I took a follow up test and it came back negative and pretend like it might have been a false positive? Should I just go with it and deal with taking the two weeks off and pretend like I have it? Is that legal? Will they ask me for any sort of verification? I am so anxious about this and could just really use some advice on what people think is the right thing to do in this situation.

878,"A little background:

My boyfriend and I (F) are in our early-mid 20s. We've been dating a little under a year. I am his first sexual partner and first serious relationship. I myself have had several M and F sexual partners (though I won't claim those relationships were pictures of good sexual health and intimacy). My boyfriend has a pretty high libido, and as do I when I'm comfortable and feel intimate and safe with a person. Starting out in our relationship, we would have sex every day, usually multiple times a day. As our relationship progressed, sex became less frequent, but not to the point of being unhealthy. Currently, I would say we have sex 3-4 times per week on average. From my experience and knowledge, this is still on the higher end of sex frequency.

Relevant NSFW details:

My boyfriend really enjoys head. I suppose it's a sexual act that really makes him feel like I care, and it's pretty important to him when it comes to sex. As such, I usually give him head every time we have sex as part of the foreplay. This can range from 10min-1hr, and I'd say on average I do it for 25min.

The problem: 

Last night, he asked for head and I told him I probably couldn't do it for a day or two because my mouth has been hurting pretty bad the last few days (partially due to giving head, partially due to sores and aches from stress/teeth grinding). He took it pretty negatively and withdrew from me. I tried to talk to him but he was pretty upset. His reaction hurt me pretty badly, because it made me feel like he cared more about head than me. It also made me feel like I couldn't say no to him without him getting angry/upset. There haven't been many times I've said no to giving head, but the few times I have it's always ended in conflict. 

We talked a bit today, and I tried to tell him how it made me feel like he didn't care about my needs, and how it made me feel like I'm obligated/expected to do this act regardless of how I feel or what I want. I told him that it hurts our intimacy and sexual relationship when he has an averse reaction to me saying no, because it forces me to choose between agreeing to something I'm not comfortable with/something that may be painful, or saying no knowing it will result in anger/hurt/conflict. 

His response was that I should have put it differently, and that it hurts him that I took away that option by saying I can't do it for a few days. He said that he was upset because it didn't seem like I cared in the way I said it, or offer an alternative. He said that I don't understand what it means to him or how much it hurt him, and that sex is different for men. I told him he should talk to his guy friends about this because he's right, maybe there is something I don't understand, but he refused. 

Now our relationship is on the rocks, and I don't know what to do. I want to address his needs, but I feel like it's going to make our intimacy deteriorate if I feel like I can't say no without upsetting him, and if I feel like this sexual act is more important to him than me. 

TLDR; my boyfriend got upset when I said I couldn't give him head for a day or two because my mouth hurt. Now I feel like he cares more about head than me/doesn't consider my needs. 

Can anyone shed some light for me on his side of the situation and where his feelings are coming from, or possibly give me advice on how to approach this? Please, try not to demonize anyone, I don't want us to be pitted against eachother and I don't think either of our feelings should be invalidated.",13Jun2020,2

882,"Huge anxiety attack! What do I do???

Hey this is my first post here!

I’m a 20 something female who lives with her parents while college is closed. I work 60+ hours a week at 2 labor intensive jobs with high demands and I am enrolled in 2 summer classes. 

About 2 weeks ago I was on a cookie binge to relive stress and I was eating a box of nilla wafers a night for 4 nights when I’d come home from work late. My parents are somewhat judgmental and so I hide things from them to avoid confrontation.( I don’t want my mom saying I’m gonna get fat and I don’t want my dad questioning why I’m eating cookies every night.) My parents also don’t like it when anyone except them eats upstairs because they pay the bills. 

I did break the rules and eat upstairs however I put the boxes in a trash back,tied, and stored it in my closet. I forgot about it until recently today when my parents went through my room and found the empty boxes. 

I come home from working 9 hours today and my dad asks me if I’ve been eating upstairs. I lied and said no at first and then I said yes. He proceeds to tell me he has flipped my bedroom inside out and that I have to wash everything and clean everything despite cleaning the other day. I come upstairs and my room is literally on the floor, my toothbrush is in the trash can uncovered and my dirty clothes bin had clean clothes from my dresser inside it. My remote for my light was broken and i couldn’t fix it and my door is no longer allowed to be closed at all at any time.

So naturally I just sat on my bedroom floor, remote in hand, and cried while trying to piece it together. Then my parents came in my room and just started asking me why I was crying and stared there was no sympathy for me in the situation because I was dead wrong. Then they just watched me have a panic attack, I popped two visceral and now I’m cleaning. 


I get that I shouldn’t have eaten upstairs but i feel like this was excessive. I had been up on my feet all day since 6am and I have a 4 page paper to type and a test but my parents told me they didn’t care about any of that which frustrates me because they made me sign up for these classes and I have to get A’s. Not only that my job stresses me out and when I tell my parents I want to quit the more dangerous one (Amazon) they tell me they don’t care and I’m just being lazy but i barely have time for myself or school or even therapy (which I very much need) unless it’s the middle of the night which is bad because I have to work early for my other job. I have work tomorrow morning early as hell and now my dad is asking me if I think what he did was fair and honestly no I don’t but I wanted to ask y’all because I really feel invalidated and like I can’t even be honest with my parents without a vindictive response. 

I even tried using the bathroom when I came home and my parents thought I was trying to escape cleaning my room but honestly where is there to escape to????! 

I guess my main point it 

1. How do I have a healthy conversation with my parents about my anxiety and stress without them belittling me

2. Was my parents punishment excessive 

3. Am I crazy?

4. What do I need to do to improve myself in these situations

889,"We’ve been together 6 years and have lived together for 4. He’s a great guy and Everything was good. But then, One day, I found him FaceTiming a girl. He told me that she called him from a number he didn’t recognize so he answered, and she was a girl he knew from before he met me and hadn’t spoken to her in years. He said she was just checking in because she was bored because of corona. So I had to believe him. But ever since, I’ve had a moments of insecurity and doubt where I don’t trust him and I get angry.

Things got better, and I trusted him again. But then he went back to work a couple weeks ago. He does construction which is very tiring. I have been working from home, taking care of his kids half of the week, doing all the cooking and cleaning. He has been super moody and grumpy which has made me insecure about him ignoring me because of the incident I mentioned before. This morning I was crying about it, and he said he know he’s moody and he just wants space to do things like fix his car and work out, and get things done. He procrastinates doing all of these things because he’s tired from work and that makes him even more moody and distant and he knows that’s not fair to me.

Now he says he wants a break from the relationship. He doesn’t want to see other people, he wants to keep living together, and he wants to sleep in the same bed and still hang out as friends. I told him that if we do that I can’t have sex with him and I can’t do his laundry and cook for him and take care of him like I do when we’re in a relationship.

He says he loves me and that I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him. He says I’m the best cook he’s ever been with, and I give the best blow jobs he’s ever had, which I do several times a week whenever he wants. I gave up having children Because he didn’t want more, now I’m too old to have them but I love his kids like they’re mine. 

I’ve tried everything to make him happy, I cook, I clean, I do all his laundry, I work out six times a week, I put on make up and do my hair every day, I don’t ask him to take me out or buy me expensive things.

904,"Hello, first time poster so I appreciate any advice that can be given but I have a difficult cat custody issue I am trying to work out and would love some opinions from people detached from the situation, which generates strong emotions. About three years ago I started dating my ex who we will refer to as J. When we started dating J had a cat named KP that she had for about 2 years previously. We moved in together pretty quickly and the cat and I grew very close. After living together for about two years J decided that she wanted change in her life and that we should break up. While she looked for a new home she went to stay with family and asked that the cat stay with me for roughly a month until she could get situated. I accepted of course because I love that cat, but one month dragged out without my ex getting her own place. After about six months told her that I was getting more and more bonded to KP and it may be difficult to take him and she assured me she would never do anything to upset or harm the cat. I took this to imply that the cat could stay with me and any question of re-homing was off the table. Not to mention my ex had ignored requests from me for cat food and had barely visited at all leaving me the cat's sole care giver and beneficiary. Now it has been almost a year and a half since my ex moved out and she is finally getting her own place and now she wants to take the cat back. I love this cat immensely and offered to compensate her but she is insistent that she wants to take him. He is older, around 12 years old, and I fear moving at this point would be traumatic and upsetting and he barely remembers my ex due to her absence the past year. I have spoken with an attorney and in my state animals are property, but I did genuinely believe my ex gifted him to me when she remarked on not ever wanting to take him back if it would harm him. Is there a right answer here? I have no doubt my ex would love and care for the cat, but he is my best friend and I love him like a child, the thought of letting him go breaks my heart. Any advice is appreciated, sorry if this is a bit rambling if anyone would like any clarifying details please let me know. There is very little if any paper trail to this besides my asking my ex in text messages for help with cat food which she ignored. There was no written agreement to watch the cat or transfer ownership. My ex did lie to Chewie.com once and tell them the cat died in order to get out of paying for an auto-subscription she meant to cancel, that likely won't play any bearing in this though but I do have documented proof of that.

Her mom is a piece of shit who abandoned her and her sister and this is the first time she’s taken care of her. She has a creep abusive stepfather and then that’s it. On a effectively deserted quarantined island. Its the weirdest most helpless situation i’ve ever been in. So basically the advice i’m asking for is how in the holy fuck do i get her back to Texas. She has absolutely no one to help her down there. And i have no idea what to do up here. How does she convince her mom or what authorities could help. Is there any fucking thing that can be done.,13Jun2020,2
913,"i have many, many friends, but only a few close. one of them has been posting on social media badly about me for a while; she doesn’t directly say my name but i know it’s about me.

she’s been sayinh i have body odour and should ‘mask’ it with foods (it’s always been something I’ve been self conscious about). it’s just all so infantile for a woman my age to be doing this. i’m very bad at confrontation... how can i talk to her about this? should i even bother? 

thank",13Jun2020,1
914,So the thing is that I have not been living with my parents since when I was 3 years ago I live with my grandma and grandpa so the thing is thatit was like my mom she used to live in the other country so when she came back by that time I was or I am 17 years ago now but I don't understand why she keeps yelling at me like when am watching TV it's a problem or doing anything else for myself all she says is that am not a good chlid to her and more pinful words to me and the bad part is that even my grandma she started talking very bad at me like when I do something bad even if it was a mistake she still thinks that I did it intonationlly some times I try to say sorry to her but she doesn't mind like in the morning when I wake up after her she says that am always lazy and don't want to do anything. And now I feel hatered in my heart i no longer be happy sometimes I wish my old times would come back nobody understands me in the house thy just want that I should do what thy want and wat thy will I should to thy forgot that I too have my life. So can you give me some advice of when I should do bcz I feel like getting to other palace and never come back..,13Jun2020,1
915,"During covid my job went fully remote like many office jobs did. I’m an only child and at the time I temporarily moved back home to my parents because of all the uncertainty so we could look after each other. Plus I had been used to visiting a couple times a month living only about an hour and a half away and didn’t know how long things would be shut down. 

 I’ve been fortunate enough to keep my job and I’ve kept my apartment as I just signed a new lease. Now things are gradually coming back and my job is starting back one day a week and the gradually moving to two office days per week. I had told my parents that and that I was excited that my gym was reopening and friends moving back as well. My mom, however, sees it differently. She said that if I were to go anywhere but work she doesn’t want me coming home because of this risk (I get that). But furthered her point by saying she was hurt and felt very unimportant to me if I would choose that. And she made it clear that I was choosing my friends/life over her. It was somewhat like this when I moved out 2 years ago. 

As an only child I’ve always been close to my parents and they have always been a bit overbearing, but these comments took it to a new level. I realize the current situation has been hard for everyone, but I’m 24, have an apartment I’m paying for and not using, and friends that I haven’t seen in 3+ months. I know that because my parents don’t want to leave the house I’ve become their only source of social interaction. I’m suddenly very distressed by what she has said because it feels to me she is making me choose my happiness or hers. Any wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",13Jun2020,2
916,"Honestly my issue is such a first world problem, but I’m genuinely having a hard time making a decision. Anyway, I bought concert tickets not too long ago, however the concert got postponed (due to the pandemic) and the new date has still yet to be announced. Just for context the tickets are around $300CAD. 

I’m saving up money for an iPad + Apple Pencil (which I plan on using for University and for personal art things). 

Now here is where I am trying to think about what to do. Right now I’m considering returning the ticket I bought for several reasons:
1. I could use the $300 to be closer to my end goal to obtaining my iPad and Apple Pencil
2. Since the new date isn’t announced yet, I can’t risk having it interfere in my last year of high school (because of my grades and uni applications)
3. If it’s rescheduled for July/ August the risk of getting Corona virus isn’t really worth it either. 
4. I feel like I’m only going for the sake of going? I’ve been listening to this band for a while now, and at one point I was a die hard fan. Although in recent years I just haven’t been really heavily invested in their activity? It just so happened to be convenient that they were coming here and my parents had agreed, which is why I ended up buying the tickets (thinking back it was impulse buying).

You might be wondering why I’m not returning them yet and it’s because: 
1. I don’t want to make my other friends feel bad about returning my ticket, which is making me hesitant returning it.
2. I also know that concerts are a one in a lifetime sort of experience? So what if I regret not going? 

Gahhhhhh honestly I don’t even know what to do anymore and I’m honestly over thinking it, but regardless of me being self aware overthinking this, I still can’t come to a conclusion.",13Jun2020,1

919,"My husband and I live with his parents and 10y/o brother. We have 3 dogs and I love them with my life, me and my husband are the owners of one of them.
My brother in law says he is the owner of the other two but he never does anything to take care of them... He doesn't see them as living beings.

I know he is a 10y/o and all, but my husband and I are planning to move out once the Quarantaine is over, and we are not sure if we want to let those two dogs in my brother in law's hands, since his parents work all day, so the one who has to be in charge is him... So we are thinking about taking all the 3 dogs with us.

He fought to have his own dog, but he doesn't want to take care of them, he just wanted them to say he owns them at school and to pet them, but that's all. He wont feed them or walk them, nothing.

Plus, sometime he complains about his dogs not being ""cute enough"", and saying that he wants a dog like the neigbor's because is cuter and/or more obedient (when he doesn't even bother to train them).

What if i wont get attracted to him anymore?

922,"Ever since I was a child I've had bad experiences with dentists. Stuff like pulling teeth without any numbing, massive amounts of pain, nearly choking on my spit etc.

It didn't get much better as I got older, and even though I've taken care of my teeth as well as I could, I have a massive cavity now in one tooth that needs to be looked at. It looks bad so I'm guessing the tooth will have to go. 

But I'm really afraid. I know how bad the pain can be, and I'm currently trying to find a dentist that will take me seriously. The problem is, I have ADD, and for some reason possibly related to potassium levels (research could be improved there), lidocaine doesn't really work on me. Sometimes it works a little bit, but mostly not at all. 

Most dentists around here use lidocaine as a local anaesthetic though and have no other alternatives available. The first few I've spoken to wouldn't even agree there's a problem with ADD and anaesthetics. So far no one has taken me seriously on this. I am rather shocked at the ignorance and didn't think alternatives to lidocaine were so rare. 

My question is, how are your experiences with lidocaine alternatives? Is there anything you can recommend? How can I overcome being afraid of the pain?",13Jun2020,1

931,"Hello, I've been suffering from depression and I've been miserable for the past few years of my life. Today, I finally decided to seek advice from others (both men and women please) on the forum and I hope you can provide me with some serious advice. I sat myself down for one hour and listed the ugly, the bad and the good of my life and I'm wondering if you can help me with the ugly and the bad. Below is an honest self assessment of my current status in life and I'm holding nothing back. Please provide productive comments and suggestions. Well... Here goes: 

**The Ugly:**

1) I have 0 friends, outside of work, and almost no social life. The state I moved to is completely new to me and I’ve been here for about half a year. My family is also far away from me. My social life consists of me trying to meet with women who I match with on Tinder/Bumble. I have had low success on these dating apps and haven’t been able to find a nice skinny blonde girl to date, which is troubling to me because I am not attracted to overweight women or single mothers. Being overweight/obese is a major deal breaker for me. My dad has also been bullying me on the subject and telling me that I am “gay” if I don’t find a nice girl to settle down with. 

2) I’m still a virgin. I had opportunities before, but I just found the women to be too fat or had depression issues that I don’t know how to deal with and didn’t want to be involved in. I grew up in a Buddhist household and was constantly told that if I have sex before marriage, I will be punished in hell and in the next life. My mom actually beat this thought into my brain and I subconsciously worry about about those consequences if I sleep around. It’s been hard for me to discipline myself, but I’ve prevailed thus far. However, this conflict is constantly in my mind between what I want to do and what I know is right. I’ve also noticed that being a virgin is a turn off to most women, but I think being a non-virgin is a turn off (although not as much as being overweight). This probably significantly shrinks my dating pool. My mom is also trying to convert me to be religious with her, but I'm not a religious person and struggle to commit. My relationship with her is ok, but could be better. I just don't know which side to be one sometimes. 

3) I hate my banking job and it makes me miserable every day. However, I cannot deny the fact that it pays well, especially for the hours I work (\~ 50 hours per week, but fluctuates depending on dealflow). I’ve thought about going to law school, but I just don’t think I can make it to a T14 school due to my low undergrad GPA (\~3.4ish) and even if I did, I don’t think I can make it to big law, which is where the money is at. I’m not sure if I am suited for the corporate life. I like to invent my own things and be independent. 

4) I’m a stubborn dude and I refuse to give up on my dream of being a competitive gamer. I really enjoy playing a first person shooting game and I am just not good enough to get to that pro/competitive level. The goal was to be able to play part-time on a competitive esports team and work my banking job. I am still working hard on this goal, but I am struggling. I can play at an OK level, but there is still a skill gap between me and the professional players I see on YouTube.  I am trying to play 5 hours per day to bridge that gap. 

**The Bad:**

1) I’m relatively short at 5’8 (below average US male height of 5’9), skinny fat at \~139.4 lbs and not athletic (I can’t bench over 125 lbs and arms crack when I do pushups). I have bad cardio too (mile time sucks at \~9 minutes). I get tired and sweat easily. It’s also very hard for me to build muscle. I just naturally have a very skinny build. I'm also a homebody. Its hard for me to change that. Are there ways to change that?

2) I’m a racial minority (harder to date and advance fast in the workplace I’ve noticed).

3) My overall ability to study and do well in highly analytical tasks sucks. I am not a book smart person naturally and struggled through college. However, I am an extremely hard worker and was able to overcome my mental slowness due to sheer determination. Also, Adderall/Ritalin doesn’t work for me, I’ve tried. I tried to pick up computer coding, but failed miserably. I just cannot reason though the logic and get to the proper code. 

4) Live in a tier 2/3 city (Think Charlotte, Richmond, Columbus, Detroit).

5) I don’t have a car – I am working on buying a used Luxury Japanese car that I can work on myself (Think Lexus, Acura, Infiniti), but progress on finding one has been slow. It’s inconvenient for me to live in my current city without a car. Not having a car is probably a turn off in this city. 

**The Good:**

1) I have an undergraduate degree from a top 10 business school and employed as a banker and make \~$100K+ (Salary + Bonus). Not to brag, but I think my position within the bank (slightly below middle management) is slightly above my peers who are in the profession. I cannot confirm if what I’m making is higher though. It’s probably lower than what the folks are making at bulge bracket banks like Goldman Sachs.

2) Have \~$110K in cash savings (net worth probably around $180K total if including stock/ETF investments and 401K). Currently have low fixed costs and saving \~65% of salary and 100% of bonus due to low rent costs.

3) Have $0 college debt, no car note, no mortgage

4) Eat out almost every meal every day and keep food costs to around $400-$500 per month. I love eating out because I’m a huge foody, it’s tasty, convenient and just a better experience vs. cooking. 

5) I have traveled a modest amount, for my age, and been to big cities in the US and abroad. I’m also bilingual.

6) I dress well and have a good wardrobe. My clothes fit and colors match. Brands I wear are Polo, Patagonia, Cole Haan, MK, etc. I also have worked out the proper hairstyle that fits my face shape. I don’t wear glasses and have contacts. 

7) 25 years of age, so relatively young, and I think time is still on my side until I hit 30

8) Skilled at working on cars (worked as a mechanic before) and computers (I take a lot of pride in these skills idk why). I am very good at working with my hands vs. Microsoft Excel/PPT/Word. 

9) I grew up in an immigrant family, where money was tight and had to stretch every dollar. I’ve gotten used to this lifestyle and have good spending habits/save compulsively.

Please give honest and thoughtful advice/comments on the ugly and the bad. Thank you very much and I greatly appreciate it.",13Jun2020,1
932,"WARNING: GRAPHIC 


So, when I was a child my mom moved her boyfriend into our low income housing. He is a felon - felons are not allowed to live in low income housing. For the last 12 years he has lived in my mom’s housing illegally. 

When I was a child he became grooming me and eventually sexually assaulting me when I turned 13. He became key logging my computer and sending me explicit messages on Facebook referencing the porn I watch. He got me a cat and told me to leave my door open for her to get in and out of my bedroom at night. He used this as a means to come into my room while I slept, stand over my bed, whisper sick shit and jerk off. I woke up multiple times and was terrified, so I pretended to be asleep. As I got older he became bold and would literally just come into my room and pull his dick out in the middle of the day, jerking off and just staring at me until he felt like leaving. I was petrified. Never did anything about it.

When my mom found out all hell broke loose. I was sent to my grandmothers for a few days while he moved out. I came home and everything was okay. At least, for a few weeks. Then my mom asked me if I would let him move back in to help us with bills. I said no. She said I was being selfish and manipulated me into saying okay. They have been broken up since this incident.

Let me tell you about my mom. Single mother of six. Negligent. Battered by our father. Didn’t graduate high school. Physically and mentally abusive to my siblings and I. Has never learned to drive. Has no career or even a simple job. Never has. Completely depended on others to take care of her.

Well, he kept being a sick POS, just not as obviously. My sophomore year of high school I attempted to kill myself. My mom made it about her and how this made her look like a bad parent.

When I was 15, I got a boyfriend and basically moved out - was staying at his the majority of the time. Sick POS threatened to kill us both, called me a whore, told my mom I’m his “pussy” and ever since then I had a lock on my door - if I was home my door was locked. 

Moved out at 18 to go to university, met my current boyfriend. I live with his family now. 

I’m 22 and I’ve finally had time to process what happened. Recently, Ive been having severe suicidal thoughts and mood swings because I can’t stop thinking about this. I feel like I can’t sit idly by and let him get away with traumatizing me.

I’ve decided to at least file a police report, because, yah know he’s a pedophile and deserves to be treated as such. I gave my mother a courtesy call to let her know and it ended with her threatening to kill herself if people find out she’s a bad mom and if housing finds out she let a felon live with her for 12 years (he currently lives there) she could go to prison. She would rather die. She told me she wouldn’t testify or make a statement. She said I shouldn’t care because he didn’t rape me and men do freaky shit like this. “It’s just how men are.” she says. 

I told her to go fuck herself, not to call me and not to expect a call from me anytime soon. 

I am so traumatized by my mother and her shitty Ex I feel entirely vindicated. My cousin says I’m being selfish and should care more about my mother becoming homeless or being put in prison. 

I’m not sure if I will file the report now, because I’m not sure if police will alert her housing management about what happened there. I would feel like an asshole if she ends up in prison or jail.

What should I do?",13Jun2020,5

935,"See I've been having this shit in my chest and today is when I start practicing talking about it because I'm bad at confronting emotions with other people.

2 years ago I started having really bad acne, not any cysts but it wasnt pretty and I started to take a lot of medicine and now I'm free from all acne, and I barely have any scars because no cysts. 

But the thing is that the scars sit tighter on the inside of me, during this time I've built such a huge insecurity over my face and since it's not perfect, still a little red on the cheeks, it makes me self conscious and I panic whenever I get exhausted, work out or go to anywhere hot because I can feel my face getting warm and I get embarrassed because I think my face is getting red but it isn't, until I panic and then I get red and then it just keeps on going. 

I've only kind of talked to one person about it but it was vague, and hardly in depth, I'm scared that people will laugh or get uncomfortable when I tell them I'm not fine and it doesn't help because my parents just shrug it off as if it isn't a problem. This made me start analysing (possibly overanalyzing) their behaviour and it has led me to think that they do not care about my mental health and about the fact that I'm insecure every single second in my life. It hasn't been a single day since 2 years ago where I'm not constantly scared I might get a little red. 

I can go on forever but I really need help so please help and give me advice on how to counter this fucking shit.",13Jun2020,1

938,"So my younger sister is 16 (I’m 25), and she’s been in a relationship for about a year and half with someone. I feel like he is a good kid, and I have nothing against him personally. The problem comes in that their problems feed into each other. They’ve become very codependent, not being able to function well without the other. They’re young (he’s 17), and obviously aren’t as mature as they will be in the future, but it is concerning to see that they need each other’s constant approval and presence to not be anxious. 
He has also become controlling, and she’s passive and indecisive, so not a good combo there. He gets upset when she wants to spend time with her friends or do things he doesn’t agree with. For instance, our city had another BLM protest that was just standing along a main road with signs. Nothing major. She was going with her friends, and he got quite upset about it and was angry at her for it. This is a pretty typical reaction whenever she is out doing something he doesn’t approve of. 
She is someone without a lot of self-esteem (that we’re really trying to work on), so he decides that she shouldn’t go into the career she wants because of this and that, but she needs to fully support him in his. She then tries to come up with new careers that would please him. She wants to go to college about 8 hours away to study something that doesn’t have many opportunities where we live. She keeps getting discouraged because he plans to go to the local tech school and start his career here. They don’t want to compromise or work it out. Obviously. They’re kids. 
Most concerningly, though, is he was over the other night, and they start making out. She was going with it, and then she said she wanted to stop. It took her 4 times of saying she wanted to stop before he did. This makes me really worry about how much consent is really being given and accepted when no one else is around to see. Consent to me is a basic respect issue. And if he isn’t respecting consent, that’s a problem for me. 
Obviously this is biased, as I know I see more faults in the relationship from him. I’m fully aware that it’s two-sided and I’m sure she has just as many problems in it. 
Basically, all this long rant to say, am I being an overprotective sister? Is this relationship actually concerning, or should I just move on and assume they will mature more and the relationship can improve. I try to talk to her about consent and about communicating in relationships, but she’s not the best communicator, and he’s not the best listener. It worries me since they’re both young and immature, but again, they could easily mature. 

Should I keep trying to get her to see that this is not the example of a healthy relationship, or should I let them grow it themselves?

939,"So not asking for advice for me, but my dad has been working on a diy project for a couple weeks and has spent a lot of money on this. He's made a table out of bottle caps then wanted to finish it off with the epoxy (I hope the spelling is right) to give it a glass looking finish. Turns out we had a thunderstorm and whilst the resin was setting it got pelted with rain. We came back from going out to see that the table was ruined, I want to help the best I can but i don't know anything about diy, currently he's just using whatever polishes he can to try get some of the minor scratches out, but there are some really deep cuts. 
Any DIY experts wanna give me advice on how to save the table or at the very least salvage some of the hundreds of bottle caps on the inside?",13Jun2020,1
940,My ex has a girlfriend but continues to follow me on Instagram. I’ve taken him off twice but a few days ago he followed me again. I still love the man dearly so sometimes it’s hard for me to still see him and know we aren’t together- so having him still involved with me even if he just wanted to be friends just makes my healing process hurt more. Should I tell him to not follow me because it’s inappropriate ( and if so how should I tell him) OR should I just try my hardest to ignore him and just let him lurk?,13Jun2020,1
941,"Currently 16, I’ve been coding, writing, drawing and writing music for my video games since I was 12/13. My dream is to make video games that people would appreciate and think of them as a great form of entertainment. However, no matter how much I try, my writing is never good, my drawings are terrible with no improvements whatsoever and my music sounds disgusting. The only thing I am truly good at is coding. If that’s the case, should I give up on doing creative things? I feel like even if I want to, I will never achieve anything. I’ll end up in mediocrity. I only have 2 years left before I have to choose my professional carrier. What should I do? Should I continue my creative path or do things that normal people do?",13Jun2020,1
942,"At 4am on June 3rd my (18F) friend (17M) said he's gonna disappear off the face of earth and then he proceeded to block me everywhere while I tried calling him, almost dying. (details in the old post) 

next morning he emails me saying ""wtf happened last night"" he claims to not remember anything.

I ask him to fuck off, he does, after 10 days he texted me on reddit w a new account saying he got whacked and got a concussion and that caused him to lose his memory 20 minutes before he was slapped. so he wasn't lying or anything.

when he texted me again he kept fooling around. he never bothered to let me know for 10 days that he apparently ""lost his memory""

I then made him promise me he'd never attempt again and asked him to take care and that was it.

I really don't know if I'm being a cunt. I miss my friend alot. Idk how to react. 

I really need some advice, thankyou :)",13Jun2020,1
943,"Since spending 3 months in lockdown, my mum and stepdad have been facing some troubles which I think is threatening their recently new marriage. I'm a 24yr old guy and live with my mum, stepdad and step sister (15). Recently my mum and stepdad are both just getting blind drunk and arguing, last night's was really bad and I think it's going to end the marriage.

Basically they were playing poker and were obviously drunk at 4pm(ish). My mum, sensibly, suggested they have a coffee or tea to sober up as it's only 4:00 and we need to pace ourselves. My stepdad angrily declined and told her he's not drunk. This turned into a petty squabble which honestly I'm quite embarrassed by. My stepdad then drove his car drunk to the shop, which we were pretty pissed off by. Not only was it illegal but couldve ended his life frankly. My mum gave him an earful when he came back, at this point I was sick of all the arguing and played some rocket league to try and escape. At some point my stepdad said he was leaving my mum in the morning, which we all laughed at because it was so utterly ridiculous.

Fast forward to the next day, I had imagined my stepdad would've apologised to my mum for his stupid irrational childish behaviour, possibly my mum aswell for maybe being quite confrontational. Then again you can't really blame her. Can you? 

ANYWAY, here I am end of day 2 and there's been no apology from my step dad, he's very certain my mum's in the wrong by always being on his case and telling him to do stuff? Both of them have been blind drunk again and not spoke, I came downstairs at 5:00ish and my mum is singing kareoke by herself, completely shitfaced wearing my dressing gown. Maybe the most heart destroying image of my life. I sat and hugged the shit out her. 

Things got quite argumentative between me and my stepsister so I took my drunk mum for a drive. She told me alot, including she would be happy on her own. All it boils down to is my stepdad is a stubborn man with not alot of open mindedness. No matter how wrong he is, he's right.
E.g I am passionate about blm and told him about it. He told me whatever I do doesn't matter because it's happening in america, not the UK. Why should we care? Honestly this shook me to the bone, I couldn't believe it. But no matter how much I argued with him and presented solid facts, I couldn't convince him a single percent. 

Everyone's alseep now, and I'm genuinely scared for my mum's happiness. My dad is a recovering alcoholic and that destroyed her first marriage, now it's destroying this one. Does anyone have any advice of what the fuck I can do, if anything? Hopefully people have had similar situations. 

Hope people are ok in this shitty situation, and being kind to one other &lt;3 

Please be kind.",13Jun2020,1
944,I’m scared out of my mind by wasps. They are cunts. Is there anyway I can stop being a little bitch and get over my fears? It’s to the point where I won’t go to places of there are wasps there.,13Jun2020,0
945,"I don’t even know where to start. I didn’t want to go to college to begin with but I felt as if I had to because I “owed” my mom or that it would be the only way I can be successful and make something of my life. So I took out a large amount in loans for school only to gain 10 credits out of both semesters while failing every other course. 

I withdraw from the university and applied to community college to major in something just for the money and how quickly I can finish but I don’t even want to attend school at this point. I thought about joining the navy and well I don’t think I have what it takes let alone would enjoy the kind of work I would have to do. 

I’m just confused and lost. I have so much pressure to be something I’m not and I don’t even know who I am yet. I don’t know what I like. What I want. Or what I need. I told my mom about how I feel and she says she supports me with whatever I do as long as I finish school but...I don’t even know what I want to do or how to do it. Any advice?",13Jun2020,1
946,"My son is almost thirteen. He was diagnosed with Asperger’s at a young age and has really overcame any challenge presented to him. He’s always been in regular school curriculum, with some specialized classes such as speech. He’s been an A student up until this spring when COVID-19 made distance learning the norm. He’s very routine driven, so that was taken from him. I noticed a sort of aggressive behavior that lasted a few weeks where he wanted to go hit a metal barrel with a hammer or use an axe to cut wood anytime we asked him to do schoolwork. Then my husband and I started finding knife marks in door panels and along our porch rail. This stopped for a short period. Today I walked into his room and found a knife in his bed, with his bed sheet shredded and holes where he stabbed the bed repeatedly. When I confronted him about it in a very calm manner, he said, “I don’t know why I did it. I just don’t know.” Knives are no longer accessible to him, nor are scissors. My first response is to call his primary care doctor and go from there. Any other advice is appreciated. Thank you.",13Jun2020,1
947,"Hi everyone,

I'm not a professional model nor would like to be. I recently had several occasions to have both portraits and not-exactly-safe-for-work pics taken of me, by the photographers' request, and it was a great achievement because I had severe issues with my body and food over the years. I am simply very happy with the fact that I had the strength to do it and I'd like to try to help empowering other people to love themselves.

The people who took them have been tremendously respectful of my privacy, but I would like to take it a next step further and try to post some, of course with the consensus of the photographers who took them.

Please do not judge: I'm not here to hear nasty comments.

No nipples, nor genitals, nothing vulgar. We're talking about artist's work.

I would like to do it in a way that protects my privacy, and avoid by all means any site that's porn related, or where the concept of art is used to post pornography.

Is there such a platform where I can share these work in a condition of security for my identity and find an artistic milieu? 

Instagram is not an option, since I already have an account there that I use for professional reasons (totally unrelated field), unless there's a way to create and unlink a second account to my Google and Facebook accounts (spent hours on Google trying to see if that's possible, didn't find anything, maybe someone has an idea, I'm all ears!).

Such an attention to privacy is due simply to the fact that, even being the pics shareable with family and friends, I'd like to take small steps out of my comfort zone. Also, I live in a very judgemental and creatively insensitive environment, and I would like to avoid useless and totally out of place comments.

Plz help ☺️",13Jun2020,1
948,"I like to think that I do my best to be kind to the people around me, but I feel I often come across as a pushover.  Quite often it is honestly that I just don't have much of a strong opinion so will let others take a lead on decisions.  But I still have found times where I have failed to be assertive in the way I would have liked, and don't know how to do so without coming off as a dick.  What is the secret to being kind while not being bulldozed??",13Jun2020,2

950,"oh. my. god. i’m sat on my stairs crying (might be overreacting a little bit)

these past few days have been a nightmare. i’m incredibly scared of spiders, and they’re everywhere. only in my room. 

i don’t know where they’re coming from. but every hour or so another group of 6 or more show up on my windowsill. my dad comes and vacuums them up, and they’re gone. one comes up. i squash it with a tissue (they’re very small so one is fine for me). then two come. i panic and squash them. then i leave my room for a bit and they’re swinging from my window and scurrying everywhere. little. tiny. spiders. everywhere. 

it’s 12:51am right now. i can’t wake up my dad or mum. i can’t hoover myself because it’s loud and i’m scared of them. i have a windowsill full of spiders and i’m on the stairs scared as fuck

HOW do i get rid of them permanently?? has a mother spider layed 100’s of eggs somewhere and that’s why i keep seeing so many spiders? they’re about the size of a flat pea. does that mean their mother is absolutely massive? where the fuck are they coming from? i’m being really serious, please help me",13Jun2020,1
951,"Hi advice reddit, my current situation is I recently put a deposit on a used car that costs $5000 to secure the deal. The conundrum is the telling my parents that I’m buying a car. I’m very certain on this car since it’s what I want and not taking a big hit on my own personal bank account. I work my ass off throughout the year to make money but my parents are stingy about money on whatever it is.

 I’m basically set on buying this car, but not sure on how to bring it up because I’m expecting to get yelled either way I do it a day or two before picking the vehicle up or just showing up to the house with a new car.

Thanks",13Jun2020,0
952,I am okay. I really am but just a little hurt by the fact that someone that I didn’t even date hurt me. I liked the idea of being with them and the attention they gave me. They knew they were leading me on but continued and left so easily. You get used to something and it becomes a habit. This person was like that. You know how people say maybe they are looking at you when you are not looking. I knew they were looking. They would see me from very far and still look and same goes for me I would look at them too. Its just I am hurt but I still keep on checking if they viewed my story and still listen to sad songs and remember the good times we had. Yes at the end of the day I am ok but I am hurt. I need advice on how to go back to the unhurt me or how to forget this person. They played with me and they know it and now we are strangers.,13Jun2020,1
