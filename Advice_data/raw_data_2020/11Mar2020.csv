I have unwanted sexual thoughts about screwed up things and I want to get rid of them

So I have sexual thoughts about really weird and taboo things. I’m currently on nofap too and I’m on day 127 so that could be attributing to this. 

Basically about 1-2 months ago I saw a meme about a taboo sexual subject and that caused me to think about it. Since then these things pop up in my mind all day everyday. I literally can’t stop thinking about it. I have these thoughts about things that are even in my house and have urge type things to act upon those thoughts but I refuse to.

 I’ll have these thoughts or visualize those things and I’ll move my legs around or move positions and most of the time these are overexaggerated like I’m trying to get off. Other times I’ll feel like I’m trying to push something out of my penis. Sometimes I’ll even stop walking and grab my neck or something like that because I think that I’m walking in a weird way to fap. Hell, I’ll even stop breathing because I think I’m breathing too deep to try and get off. 

I’m surround by things that cause these sexual thoughts and I see them a lot. I don’t know what to do and a therapist isn’t an option. I’ve even become depressed due to these thoughts. I think of myself as a loser.

Please help me. What do I do?",11Mar2020,1
1,"Hey everyone I need some sound advice. Yesterday my wife took my 2015 truck off the road, over a boulder and into a large bush. Girl is fine, but the truck has some problems. Side airbags went off, smashed side panel and a flat tire. Dealership says I'm looking at $6300 plus just to get it back on the road not to mention the cosmetic stuff. Here's the problem, she unknown to me changed the insurance policy to liability only. As we still owe $17k on it this was never supposed to happen. I don't have the money to fix it so I'm thinking about calling the bank and telling them where their truck is. I wouldn't miss the payments, but I'm pretty sure the bank isn't just going to look the other way. What do you guys think? Thanks for the help.",11Mar2020,1
2,"Honestly, I don't believe this current outbreak will balloon to the point of becoming the ""Pandemic of the Century."" In fact, I think it will further subside in a month or two, and things will be all right again come year's end. However, my mind has repeatedly feared the worst and made me think that all aspects of life and leisure will be shut down worldwide because of the panic surrounding the virus. Because of my fears about the virus evolving to Spanish flu/Black Death levels and shutting down society and activity in my native Southern California (which has yet to experience the worst of the virus yet), I had a pretty bad panic attack today to the point where I had to leave work an hour early because my mind wasn't mentally in it to work.

All that said, what do you feel are the best tips for me to consider in order to ensure I don't panic too much about the coronavirus, keep worrying about things that haven't happened yet, and assume the worst will happen? Given how much I scoff at the excessive fear-mongering and panic surrounding the virus, I don't want to give in to the panic myself and feel like the worst is going to happen 1-2 months down the road. Especially because I truly don't feel the ongoing outbreak will get *that* bad like many panic-inducers are projecting.",11Mar2020,1

5,"Hello dear people, so I found myself in little existential crissis. I'm soon to enroll collage and...

I have no clear vision, no passion for anything. I have no idea what collage will I choose. Nothing really interests me and to make it even better my grades aren't the best so my choice will be limited anyways.(bla bla bla)

Now I find myself lying on the bed thinking how I don't want to do anything really, beacuse I will be mediocre at evrything I ever do, I won't invent anything new or bring anything new to this world. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I find myself worthless or anything like that, but I honestly never found satifaction in ""little"" things. I want to shoot big academicly, but I'm afraid that's overenthusiastic. Best I can hope for is some average job position &amp; school. I find it very unsettling that there are so many people smarter than me out there. I don't even know about what am I asking advice for.

All of this has lead to me doing nothing but being lazy all day and finding excuses why not to do things. I'm sure there was something else I wanted to mention but I forgot what was it...",11Mar2020,1
6,"I guess that sounds bad, but fuck it. Maybe I am being entitled or something. 

We live in an RV. So basic things like the shower and toilet need constant upkeep. I work full time and my SO doesn't have a job so that he can take care of all the upkeep and hopefully in the future build us a more permanent place to live. 

I've always been in the habit of thanking him for things he does. But now I'm in a situation where I feel like I need to thank him for refilling the water so I can take a shower and emptying the tank so I can pee. It's starting to get to me that I need to thank someone else for being able to do these very basic things. 

I know they do require effort though. I don't want to take the effort he puts into it for granted. I'm just not sure what to do.",11Mar2020,1
7,"Hey guys! I am a 16 yo from Albania. This school year hasn’t been easy on my country due to devastating earthquakes and now the coronavirus lockdown. School has already become pretty deficent due to a lack of organization. Studying is pretty hard right now and i feel out of place. 

When i was young i used to live in Greece. At the age of 12 i came back home and pursued an international school, finishing with my igcses. Then i decided to flee the country and follow an international education abroad. 

I went to Germany and got enrolled in a british school there. However i got deported back 3 months later. I had started studying a levels there. When i came back i unfortunately had to chase ib as it was the only international school which i could go to right now. 

Then all the misfortunes mentioned in the first paragraph occurred. It found my country to be unprepared. I wasn’t able to study. Things got eventually stabilized but the problem is that being in albania, my school is disoriented just like the country. 

Life here is becoming more troublesome every day. I wish to retry again abroad. Should I redo year 12 as I feel like i lost a lot?",11Mar2020,1
8,"For context i’m an undergraduate at uni
Over the past week or two a few (about 3) friends have asked, on separate, unrelated occasions to ‘talk about stuff’ (their words) and have a cigarette or a pint with me one on one- they’ve told me about their problems and how they’re struggling and how they almost jumped off a bridge or overdosed and how they feel absolutely lonely and I want to help them out and make them feel like they’re loved or appreciated by me and other people around them but I don’t know how to go about it in a beneficial way. It’s fucking killing me to see how much pain they’re in and I want to take it away from them and see them get better and become content with themselves- how do I do this? What can I say or do for them to help them? I have this reputation as being this rock of fortitude in a stormy sea (if you’ll pardon the imagery), and I am scared if I let it slip something bad might happen to them and I’ll be damned if it happens on my watch. Help me out please.

I’m sorry if it’s a strange question but it’s come relatively all at once and I’m a little unsure as to what the next step is. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this, from the bottom of my heart I am grateful to you.",11Mar2020,1

10,"I am starting to finding myself having the same problems I've had at the start of therapy. I actually got an organization specialist because they thought that the problem was that I could not organize my time correctly. Still, it was actually finding the will power to do it at all. I didn't see the point, why do all this bullshit when I don't even want to live anymore. I am starting to think similarly to how I did them. Amaya keeps on telling me that regardless of how I'm feeling, I am still moving forward, yet its hard to believe when I am having the same dumb problems. My relationship with my mum has been rapidly decreasing, I feel like every time I talk to her she is just telling me how I'm not up to standards, or she is telling me what I'm doing wrong. Like, do you think I don't know that already?

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I think about running away and killing myself, but it seems like too much work. But if I had a gun on me id probably pull the trigger. Everything is looming over me, and I'm just waiting for the crash. Maybe it would be better if I was in a mental institution, but at the same time, it makes me realize how grave my situation is, and it makes me want to vomit. People would ask questions, I would become behind in school, people would think I'm insane. Hell, I would think I'm crazy. I don't know what to do anymore though, I can't go on one more fucking day of this bullshit. Each time I go tho therapy, I go rant about my problems, feel better for like a day, then go back to the same cycle. What do I have to do? I'm trying to show my desperation through these words, yet I don't think anything can show how breathless and tired I am. I want to crawl into my bed to die or sleep.

16,"The way my personality manifests is that I am very open with just about everyone, perhaps happy to see someone's listening. On the other hand, with people who are genuinely willing to listen (= not just passively listening but pushing interest = asking questions) might rub me the wrong way and I'll stay reserved. Growing up with a parent with narc' traits might be a part of it.

Anyway. My lack of boundaries is clear as the day. I open up too soon to people and then I might find out within a few days I shouldn't have because I find legitimate reasons to not trust them. Or I might enter an environment (group, twitch streaming) and will have trouble diffirenciating what is private (about myself) or isn't. I tend to go from one extreme to another: super open to super paranoid, perhaps entirely based of my mood or the vibes I am getting from others.

17,"16f - I've always been a fairly private person and I'm fine with that but it's come to the point where I feel guilty over it and also the feeling of desperation because I want to talk to people about my feelings I just feel unable

Sure I'm not the most private person in the world but for a teenage girl I share very little with my friends. I have a boyfriend who I can tell everything to but both of these are sources of guilt. For my friends I haven't even told them (all except one who I've known for 10+ years and even then I could barely say it just hinted till she directly asked me and then spat out some word vomit) that I have a boyfriend (not the longest relationship especially for adults reading this but 2 and a bit months) these are the same friends who tell me extreme details about their personal life and come to me for advice and I can't even tell them I have a boyfriend. 

The other issue is my boyfriend, not that he himself is an issue, but the burden I feel like I put on him. We are very close (best friends before we started dating I already told him way more than I told anyone else) and I can trust him. However he tells me deeply personal stuff and some of his issues cause issues for me yet I feel ridiculous and incredibly selfish telling him because it will only make him feel guilty (sorry that is so vague even now on an anonymous account I feel awkward going into detail). So there is the issue of finding someone to help me with that is really what I need advice on or how to open up easier to my existing friends. I tried to explain the situation to an internet stranger one time a month ago in hope for advice and felt incredibly awkward, couldn't explain anything and half way through just apologised and told them it was fine the situation was resolved. On a surge of feeling open another night I made two more direct advice posts and got no responses. 

I don't even know if this rambled post makes any sense since the details I give are so vague and idk how closely they relate or if this is the right sub or anything. If you have any questions ask in the comments essentially I just want advice on how to open up easier to people or trust people more I guess?

19,"I am wondering if this is a misunderstanding on my part, as I may very well be in the wrong in this situation. I am going through a few things in life, as we all do, and I felt the need to talk to the school counselor because i felt it was getting a bit out of hand. Upon my request at the begining of class, i explained to the teacher that i had to see the country for an important personal issue. She answered no. I asked again after fi wishing the required work for the class. She said no, once again, after me explaining that it is important. She proceeds to call the principle and gives him a basic rundown of what I am saying. Not only was there a complete lack of respect for me while she was speaking with the principle, she made me sound like a young needy child with a silly and pointless reason to see the counselor. 

The advice I am seeking is simply, is the teacher allowed to deny you to speak with a school counselor about a personal issue that is important to the students personal mental wellbeing? So far from asking other students I have been told this is not allowed. 

If anyone is kind enough to answer, I'd love a link to any website explaining the policy on this. Thank you to all reading!",11Mar2020,1

However, today before I left work I got pulled into my boss’s office and I’m now on 30 day probation (I think it’s mainly because I made a mistake when helping the company’s president’s computer).

30,"I’m at a weird time in my life. Haven’t gotten a lot of feedback in my job hunt after graduating college. I’ve started going through a recruiter, but haven’t heard from them in about a week.   
  
Meanwhile I have 3 part time jobs. It sound weirder than it is. I already had the first two in college, the third is to get some office experience on my resume.   
  
One job I have kept year round for the last 5 years. The other was seasonal, but is now part time year round. That one hasn’t had many hours since it started getting cold, and I haven’t worked there in like 2-3 weeks.   
  
The other two just don’t have full time options, but they’re easy, low commitment, and amazingly still good money.   
   
So that leaves me working every Tuesday and every other weekend, plus the occasional odd shift or interview.   
  
Money’s no issue, I live with my parents for now and have a bit of savings built up.   
  
My problem is I never know when I’ll work more than that, have an interview, or **finally** find a job.

*Little bit of a read but will try and condense everything.*

Got a new job at a golfing venue; social hub if you wanna put it that way. Met this one girl (we’ll her A) and A worked there. We talked for a bit and throughout the week after training and shit, she came up to me and got my number. No biggie.

NOW, we text lightly before one day I find out we have a movie night at the venue; she shoots me a text askin me if I’m coming, yadda yadda, she bringing blankets and we can share. __Hm.__ I say dope, and I go.

RED FLAG I IGNORED: She cuddles up to me and shit, and ain’t gonna lie y’all; I was feeling her so we got cozy and shit. Did that for a short time, then I walk her to her car and she offers to drive me home but wants to go joyriding.
RED FLAG 2 I IGNORED: Touchy in the car, even bringing me to her old park. Park ranger was there, otherwise we would’ve “had some fun” in her words.

We kiss a for a little when I get home, she even grabs my shirt when I walk away to kiss me again. I thought this chick was up w/ it.
Then she hits me with the “I got something to tell you” the next day. Tells me she’s talking to someone, he’s moving things forward and she still wants to “get to know me better.”
I say fasho, and of course.
Saw her on our work shuttle, and apparently my boy said she smiled until she saw me. Ain’t say a single word to her while she was in the front.

Realized just hot much that shit hurt me though; we talked a little and got close quickly. Got trust issues as well so shit like this is a blow for real. Still removed her from my gram, and deleted her number but there’s a chance I’ll see her at work pretty often... how do I go about this? Be civil but cold? Still upbeat?
I got a feeling she’ll come back around though, but I don’t plan to date this chick no more, fuck that.

__TL, DR; Met a girl @ new job, vibe was cool but moved pretty fast. Ended up cuddling and kissing later only to find out she was “talking to someone and it was moving forward”, basically kicking me to the curb. Fine chick though so might pipe if opportunity presents itself.__",11Mar2020,1

39,"So I've been needing a new vehicle for a while now and I am stuck between buying a used vehicle and a new one..

I'd like to buy a used vehicle because I'm planning on buying a house within thext 12 months and I dont want to be locked into vehicle payments because I'm trying to save as much money as I can for a down payment.

On the other hand it would be nice to have a new vehicle and not have to worry about fixing it because I'll have warranty and all that.

My goal in life right now is to purchase my first home and I just want to try and make the best decisions for my future and I feel like if I buy a new vehicle the monthly payments are going to make it really hard for me to save money so any recommendations will be appreciated.",11Mar2020,1
40,"So recently I had an interview for a job in the medical field in a big city (won’t say which one but I’m in the North East, USA). 

At the end of the Interview, the manager told me to email her if I was interested in the position &amp; she would send my resume over to HR to “get things started.” (I’m assuming the hiring process?) 

I emailed her Thursday saying I was interested but never received a reply. Should I inquire? If so, when would be a good time?

41,Im in college and im trying to find a job. I am almost going to graduate and i am so excited. I dont have much experience working but i am looking forward to it. Sometimes i get nervous and say the wrong thing and mess up. I have tried practicing but forget what i practice and blank out. Thats why i feel like not practicing instead. I know i will have to get through many interviews to get to the right one for me. Its just i would be so excited to have a job. I genuinely love bringing smiles to people and i am a nice person. I dont understand how there are alot of workers who have a job and are all mad and are sometimes rude. I get that sometiems peoples are not having a good day or are going through stuff but it does not justify their actions. The overall thing is that i would do anything to get a job. It has been so hard for me these past few months. I went to this company that helps people get jobs. Any advice? I just want to feel better and not hopeless.,11Mar2020,1
42,"As the title suggest we have been separated for 5 years. We have a child together and get on really well as friends for his benefit. 

I've never stopped missing her, and lately it is starting to become too much to handle. She's in my mind day and night, and has even been in dreams lately. It's causing me some serious depression.

We had good and bad times together, and both experience depression and anxiety. My family do not approve of her after she had cheated on me in the past, however I had forgiven her for that a long time ago and taken steps to improve myself also.

Do I tell her how I feel? I don't know if she will care or not, but I wonder if it would do me good to at least get the weight off my chest.

43,"There is more to this post than just the title- a lot of it relating to my father as well. My relationship with my dad is very complicated so i will try to sum it up as best as I can-

My mother got pregnant with me when she was 15. When they were about 20 and i was about 5, they broke up for about a week, and within that week my father managed to get another woman pregnant. Woman ended up being slightly crazy, basically took control of my dad and was very toxic and allowed no contact with me or my mother. Flash forward to when im about 16, we try to have a relationship, but again his wife gets in the way of it all. every time we would try to meet up, she would get involved, he wouldnt speak up for himself, he wouldnt talk to me for 3- 6 months. this went on for a little bit and I was getting fed up with it and emotionally i just couldnt deal with it. I basically told him that I want a relationship with him but I cannot stand him ghosting me for months at a time. He finally maintains a steady relationship, but then he suddenly up and moves to a different state with his wife and kids without telling me about it and does not contact me again. I am 23 now, and i have not spoken to him in about 4 years. 

Last night I was on instagram and i notice that his son, my half brother followed me. I have never had any animosity toward them, however I was very bitter when i was younger. The son tried reaching out to me when i was about 14, but i completely shut him out since my father had no contact with me at that point. He has a sister as well, and all my relatives on my dad's side have always told me how my half brother and sister have always wanted to meet me and that they were so excited to have a big sister. But i never allowed a meeting to happen because I was so bitter at my dad, even when i did maintain a relationship with him. I regret not meeting them honestly, they now live in another state and i feel like the option of ever meeting them is out of the question. I would like to send him a message, but I have absolutely no idea what to say. I do not hate him, or his sister, I was just young and jealous that my father was in their lives, but never really put his foot down to be in mine.

On top of it i have learned that my father is paying for his college tuition flat out- and I dont know why this hurts me so much. I have been struggling financially with community college and have to work part time in order to pay for college. i dont really have a relationship with my mother so i am basically on my own. My dad's side of the family judged me so much for not having a full time job, for not going to school after college, and now for not being in school full time. I do not have the money for this and I wish i was able to flat out afford to go to a state university- but i cant right now. I am living with my grandparents at the moment and they are wonderful to me- but they dont have the money to pay for college. But it is more than just the money. I just wish that my dad had any kind of relationship with me, I really just feel like I am the throw away child and he went and found a new life. I have absolutely no way to contact him, but i dont know what I would say to him even if I did.

Should I contact my half brother? Should i ever try to have a relationship with my father if he ever contacts me again? I guess most of this was to vent, but i don't know what to do with the situation at hand lol.

I debated on making a throwaway, but oh well.",11Mar2020,1

I was on the catholic ministries website reading about the classes we would have to take if we were to get married in her church. While reading I noticed that it had a clause about non religious and non Catholic faiths and included I would have to sign documents stating that I would raise my kids in the catholic church and would have to disregard my personal beliefs. Is this true? Can someone give me some idea what to expect?

I'm not religious as of right now, but I've been doing research into my gf's religion because I genuinely care for her and want to see if its something I can be there with her. So far its done the opposite. After reading the previously mentioned stuff I don't like it, I don't want to get married in a catholic church, but she is so concerned with what her family thinks I doubt I could get what I want and I'm worried that my faith/lack of faith is going to make it so she can't marry me in her church. I'm not going to lie about what I believe, because I feel like I'd be setting myself up to continue that lie and I don't want that. I'd also like to teach my kids more than just religion. More of a teaching them how to think, but not what to think.

50,"So me and this guy have been going out on dates for about two months now. I enjoy being with him and he has such a great personality. He’s funny and seems super interested in me, though he doesn’t open up about himself. I knew before going out with him that he had done things that were typically against my standards, but he seems like such a genuine guy so I felt like he had changed.

Today I heard by a close friend that has known him throughout high school, that he’s still the same guy he’s always been, and he hasn’t changed at all. But why is he hiding that side of him from me? Maybe he knows I have standards so he hides the side of him he knows I won’t like. But why does he hide that side while seemingly proceeds to show interest in me and continues to hangout and go out with me?

Hearing about his history with girls, that he’s truly just a f*** boy and has really bad standards, has made me rethink about going out with him, though I thought he wasn’t like that anymore. He seems like a great guy to me, but from what others say, he hasn’t changed at all.

53,"hi so I am a 17 yo girl in high school, and I think I might have some form of mild social anxiety. I only say think because I don’t think I have severe enough qualities to truly judge myself and i haven’t see a medical professional so I don’t wanna self diagnose and I also constantly doubt my own emotions.

I am sorry this is a big wall of text I never talk about this stuff so idrk how to talk about it

I feel like my “anxiety” (which i’m honestly not sure is even real anxiety even tho I feel like it might be but I don’t wanna say it is when rlly what i’m experiencing might just be normal and I just don’t kno how to cope with it) but I feel like my “anxiety” isn’t that serious because I don’t get panic attacks or anything but I do spend a lot of my free time overthinking small social interactions that could’ve take years months or days ago and it’s to the point where if my mind is clear for a split second smth rlly random like for ex a shoe will suddenly remind me of smth embarrassing I did a couple weeks ago and from that memory i’ll feel like people now have a negative perception of me based on the memory and then from that i’ll invalidate all of my friendships and feel lonely and then i’ll feel sad. BUT i also feel like this probably just a normal thing teenagers go through and i’m just being over dramatic and just buying into small emotions and letting them consume me.... 

but it’s not just when i’m alone either I constantly feel on edge with ppl and I feel like that’s just me being really shy and not socially anxious but I literally will sit there and I don’t know how to respond to anything bc my mind goes blank and I just say really awkward things which then trigger me overthinking later that day and it’s a really annoying cycle which I feel like SHOHLDNT EVEN BE A CYCLE bc it’s just me getting too consumed by minor emotions and letting them take over me

but also idk bc it’s to the point where i’m constantly talking down to myself bc I have no confidence from me being weird and nervous all the time (but then i’m weird and nervous all the time bc I have no confidence) and I also can’t pay attention anymore in school or for anything honestly it’s hard bc i used to be really studious but now it’s hard to sit down and focus bc then I start overthinking bc it’s just me and a blank ws and my brain just starts to wander...

and it sucks bc a lot of my friends tell me they’re genuinly there for me to talk to but I feel like there’s a constant wall between me and the world bc i’m too scared to open up bc I think i’m just over dramatic and I feel like it’s just one sided and they don’t actually care about me —&gt; so basically I feel like I have no one to go to bc I mentally distance myself from everyone and close off my deep emotions bc I constantly invalidate myself lol

so yeah I literally don’t know what to do or whether this is actually a serious problem bc I still function a decent life and it’s not like i’m suicidal from it or get panic attacks or randomly break down in public but I still just feel exhausted constantly from being rlly nervous all the time and overthinking and it makes me sad bc I feel like i’ve missed out a lot in life bc of my “anxiety”

55,"For the last two years, I had some very strange, painful, and frightening experiences that have led me to believe that someone has developed a way of remotely monitoring and altering brain activity in secret, and is using it on me as a form of torture. They are able to control my voice, shouting out of my mouth for hours at a time, every day, barely leaving me any room to breathe sometimes. The things the voices say seem too detailed to come out of my head alone. The involuntary shouting has caused me to lose my job, get evicted from my apartment, and to be repeatedly hospitalized against my will after neighbors called the police on me. It feels functionally like what I imagine demonic possession would be like if it were real. The voices seem to be able to hear my thoughts,  see what I am seeing, and hear what I'm hearing with a degree of accuracy that most people would assume would be impossible with current technology. There seem to be limits to what they can do, but they have access things like mental audio, primed words, and sometimes thoughts that are more intangible or less clearly formed (as far as I can tell from what they say). While there's not always someone talking to (through) me, there always seems to be someone ""inside"" my head looking at me, which seems difficult to believe for me given the manpower this would take, but there you go. The voices have different sounds and different names attached, with the names and voices changing over time, presumably as different people get assigned to run whatever they call the neural torture device.  

The things the voices say to me are chosen to give me as little information as possible about who they are, and what they are doing to me, but I think I've been able to glean some details about how it works. I would guess they are using some military-made millimeter-wave radar or scanner, in combination with certain chemicals that are visible on the scanner somehow, that can be vibrated or moved pretty precisely in my brain. They seem to inhibit brain activity, I can feel myself regain some brain function when my torturers occasionally move them out. (This feels like a sort of a swishing sensation in your head.)They leave these chemicals constantly vibrating on my left side, especially around my frontal lobe, causing me a chronic, difficult-to-describe pain, and making it hard to think clearly. They also have hair-thin fibers that they can vibrate and move through my head. I think one of the bigger fibers is what they're using to control my speech. They've used the fibers to repeatedly stab certain regions of my brain, and block blood vessels leading to certain parts of the brain, (I think). 

They can use this system to do a lot of different things to me that can be very unpleasant. They can control whether I am asleep or awake, and have used this to keep me awake for 3-4 days at times. They can force me to vomit, and will do so with little warning. They can make specific spots on my body itch, and they will sometimes go for half an hour making me scratch one place after another. More importantly, having hair-thin fibers running through your brain tissue and chemicals remotely vibrated take their toll on a nervous system. Who ever is doing this to me seems to be going for brain damage as a means of mind control/ personality change, targeting specific areas like my nucleus accumbens and my hippocampus. I am a transgender woman, and the voices use my male name and seem to want me to be male-- I think this is, in part, a hate crime. Since I first started noticing it two years ago, my ability to concentrate, read, remember things, and other cognitive abilities suffered, and I'm afraid of how much brain damage I'm going to accumulate before they stop, if ever.

Who do I think is doing this? My best guess would be a group within the US deep state/ intelligence community. The voices have mentioned Israeli military and intelligence, suggesting the technology was initially researched there, but is now in the hands of the United States.  I believe the technology in question was experimented with during the Jade Helm military exercise in 2015.( See A Letter to the Texas Governor: The Jade Helm Report  by  William Starrett). It or something like it may have also been tested in the 2016 attacks on the Cuban Embassy. The agents who talk to me told me they were operating out of Maryland, which is where the offices of the NSA and other intelligence agencies are located. This is all just guesswork, though. 

I have to admit, the story I tell sounds highly implausible, and Carl Sagan tells us that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I don't have any, unfortunately, and the story I tell sounds very similiar to a person who was psychotic or delusional.  My doctor tells me I have schizoaffective disorder, and the only other explanation seemed so absurd that for awhile I believed I was delusional. Ultimately though, what I experience, what my senses tell me directly made it impossible to believe that nothing but my own mind was responsible. My psychiatrist asked his colleagues if any of them had every had a patient who had voices take control physically and speak out of their mouth. None of them had, and most schizophrenics don't experience sudden bouts of nausea or irregular insomnia lasting for days on end. I've taken antipsychotic medication and it doesn't make any difference at all.  While the technology that would have to exist to do this to me seems futuristic, consider the incentives the discoverer of such a technology would have for keeping it secret.

As for why I in particular would be targeted, I used to have a bad habit of talking to myself out loud as a way of organizing my thoughts. I half-suspected that the NSA or some part of the deep state had much better surveillance capabilities than they were saying, so I just started talking to whoever was listening, presumably over my webcam and microphone. I lived alone, smoked pot, made some weird and naive assumptions about the spooks that would be listening to me, and said some far out stuff. I was not approving of their surveillance state, and so I think they chose me as a punching bag to use whatever mind reading/ mind control technologies that had on me. 

What would you do in my situation? Please could someone consider believing me? No one I know does, and it's tremendously isolating. I feel like where I'm slowly being tortured and brain damaged to death, while the people around me deny it and do nothing. I can barely get out of bed most days, and I've become an alcoholic to deal with the constant pain. Once someone starts monitoring your mind in this way, you feel like you never again have a thought alone, a freedom you thought no one could take away, and it's deeply dehumanizing. 

If you have any questions, let me know. Help me prove to you that this is real.",11Mar2020,1
56,"Title probably says it all. I'm a freshman in high school. This year has gone by way too quick. I'm now only about three years from going to college, and it's kind of slapping me in the face right now. I'll try to break it up a bit because this is a bit of a vent.

**Academics**

The idea that I was finally in high school never hit me, and I always had it feeling it would eventually. But it still hasn't, and now I'm faced with the idea of being an adult in about four years. I get that these four years are probably going to be eventful, but I'm getting a little nervous.

I go to a really competitive high school (ranked top 300ish in nation, US) and for the most part I'm getting all A's (I know it doesn't matter as much as I think) and usually I'll scrape a B in my math class because I'm not too great at math. 

As I grew up I knew that I would probably study something like computer science, and I'm still pretty sure that I will, but I really don't know what to do regarding my future. I get that reddit is by no means an accurate source of information, but by browsing r/all sometimes, I'll find these tweets/stories about people in their 20's complaining about what a hellhole life can be. Am I worried for no reason, or can it actually be that bad? I guess what I'm really asking about/worried for is do I have to decide to pick myself the fuck up right now and study study study to really make it into this world?

(If it matters, I'm asian)

**Social Life**

Contrary to people's usual experiences, I dislike high school much more than I do middle school. For one, there was less people to, well, not know. I sort of knew everyone in middle school and because I was generally funny and relaxed I got along with everybody. Now in high school, I'm kind of lost. Never had the motive to try out for a sport, and now I'm regretting it. Was in the top band in middle school but fell to the lowest one in high school. Kind of smart, but nothing remarkable. (Probably) Average looking. 

I know most people reading this post would tell me to not give a shit and keep going, and I'm doing my best, but it gets hard sometimes. Do you guys have any words of advice when it comes to dealing with people that make you want to be different in high school? Maybe a quote or something?

61,"First off, I have not (yet) been attacked in any way by this individual, who I will be referring to as Kevin, but he has repeatedly harassed a few people in my Astronomy class. Second, I apologize for any grammatical errors.

tl;dr: A kid bullies another kid with her mother who passed in a mass shooting, and I don't know if I should report it.

This kid is, for a while has been the textbook bully, personal attacks, insults, repeatedly poking people after they've said: ""Don't touch me."" I recall this one instance where he said the school needs more bullies because that's what builds thicker skin. He's posted some racist things against Muslims on his Snapchat story a few times, as well as pressured my friend into sending nudes, and when she didn't he called her a ""fat whore"".

Some quick background before I go on, in this class, there is a group of Liberals who sit in the back and often discuss politics, never in an attacking way towards anyone. Kevin is Alt-Right and very open about it.

Today, he went too far. One of the girls in the Liberal Group, we will call her ""Jill"" had a mother who died in a mass shooting and is fairly open about it. Kevin and Jill's boyfriend were having an argument about the weight of a car hood, and Kevin, of course, had to brag about how muscular he is. After the argument finished, Kevin said ""I have a question for you guys,"" And he pulled up a list, with pictures, of the victims of the shooting. He then went on to ask, ""Do any of these people look familiar."" Jill, for reasons I shouldn't have to say, gets visibly upset and asks what his point is, and why he's bringing up her mother. Kevin replies with ""Oh this is your mom,"" zooming in on it, ""What a shame,"" in a very condescending and heartless manner. If this wasn't bad enough he turns around and LAUGHS. Jill then screams ""F\*CK YOU"" and the class goes silent, while the teacher says ""Hey, hey"" because of the yelled cussing, Jill yells back saying he brought up her mother, and they go back and forth while Kevin calls her ""Retarded"" ""B\*tch"" ""Dumbass"" all sorts of lovely things. After it all dies down, he continues his not doing school work, instead watching Fortnite, like nothing happened. The teacher didn't do anything, instead just declaring the conflict over. I saw no evidence of a dean's slip, no email (his computer was closed) and just went on teaching like everything was peached, rainbows, and sunshine. I believe this attack was politically motivated, because of how aggressive Kevin tends to be about his views on social media, and in real life. He always seems to stare or eavesdrop on the Liberal's conversation, I assume this based on how he moves his head to point his ears, and the way he looks at them.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like enough was done on the teacher's part, maybe I'm assuming too much, but I really want to say something to someone. But I don't know if bringing it up to a person of authority in the school will only cause more issues if Kevin retaliates against Jill, or if he'll retaliate against me if I say I reported it. I also wonder if I shouldn't say something because I wasn't directly involved, meaning it's not my business. I don't want Kevin to get off scot-free for what he did. Furthermore, I don't know who I should report it too. I feel awful knowing that it even happened, and at this point, I really don't know what to do. Furthermore, I'm a bid worried he could be a school shooter because of his apparent lack of empathy and embracing of guns of his Instagram.",11Mar2020,1

65,"I'm mostly looking for advice, or a reality check. However, this may be long as I need to get  a lot of things off my chest. Most of these things I've talked to my therapists, but I still don't know if what I'm feeling is real or it's just me being dramatic. I haven't gotten a diagnosis so it makes me think that maybe it's not that serious. So I will try to give as much background as possible. Here I go.

I was raised by an old lady who worked in my house looking after my sister and I. She was our primary caretaker for the first 8-10 years of my life and pretty much all of my memories involve her. My parents both worked and that is the reason they hired this woman to take care of us during the day, since she was the mother of one of my mother's employees. To the external eye, she was the best person to look after us. She would take care of us, love us like one of her own kids, cooked, baked, played with us, etc. I remember being so attached to her that I'd beg for her to stay over and I would share my bed with her, which she would often do.

However things weren't as great as they thought and after many many years I realized that both my sister and I suffered from different forms of abuse. This woman had schizophrenia and was extremely narcissistic and manipulative. To a point where no one realized what really happened when she was alone with us for almost a decade.  I don't really have many of ""my own"" memories of my childhood, most of them are just things that my other siblings have told me (I have 6 other siblings from my dad's side), but I do recall so many memories of her being just.... Horrible.

For the first thing she was always comparing us to her real granddaughter who was like 7 years older than we were. She would tell us how bright, pretty, incredible, over achiever she was looking for us to become jealous or to just feel diminished. Then she would proceed to tell me things such as ""It is okay if you never achieve anything in life, it is really okay, because no one could ever expect anything from you. Actually, if you have to be held back at school, don't feel bad, that's just who you are and probably what you can expect for the rest of your life"". This was said to me often and in the most loving tone, almost like she was comforting me. I accepted it because I was really small and didn't really understand what she meant. She would often attack my sister with another approach, constantly mocking her for her weight, her glasses and the fact that her skin was darker.

She loved to tell us scary stories about sex, and how horrible, dirty and disgusting it was. She would explain very graphic details to us and often would tell us that my father raped my mother and exactly how he did it. I remember one day my sister and I were in my mother's bed watching TV and I put my leg on top of hers. She saw me doing this and started yelling, saying that that's something prostitutes did to initiate sex and that I was coming on to my sister and that I was a whore. I remember just staying silent and crying.

I have other memories of her telling us lies about our father after my parents separated. She once told my mom my father kidnapped me. She would whisper to me what to say whenever he called. She wanted us to hate him, otherwise it was betrayal to our mom.

I never said anything about this to my parents because I was too afraid she would leave us. The thing about this woman, and probably due to her mental health condition is that she wasn't always this way. Some days she was just the best mother figure in the world. She loved me, hugged me and made me feel like I was the most important thing in the world. I was just... In love with her! It was extreme, I hated her, but also I never wanted to be separated from her. Then, on the next day, she was just vicious and horrible. My sister would often tell me she was going to tell our mother about the things that she had done but I remember begging her not to. I was so afraid of her loving me, because she made me feel like no one else could love me like that.

Sometimes she used that against me. She knew how much she impacted me and often threatened to leave when I didn't do what she wanted or agree with her. I remember one time I stole some money from my mother's purse and escaped to buy her a present (I think I bought a bag of cookies or something) and I presented them to her. She barely looked at me and wouldn't take my apology, she just kept watching the tv. I started crying and begging for forgiveness, literally begging on my knees that she wouldn't leave me.

One time I stayed at my dad's while my mom was traveling and when she came back she told us that they had fired her. Apparently she started a fight with my grandfather and he got sick of her so he fired her. My mother was very worried about our reaction. My sister was so happy, and I felt absolutely nothing. From that moment, I decided that all of those memories belonged to someone else and that none of that happened to me.

Of course, I did have to face the consequences of that upbringing. I was constantly labeled at school as the overly emotional girl, often made up stories that weren't real, tried to imitate tv characters and generally, pretending to have a life I didn't actually have. During 7-8 grade I had outbursts of crying over the most random things like if they changed my table partner, etc. In this time, my sister was going through a serious depression over low self-esteem and my mother's business had gone south, she was in serious debt. She would come home so sad, and because my sister was also sad, I didn't allow myself to express any other emotion other than enthusiasm around them. My mother smiled a lot whenever I made jokes or said funny things and she was thankful of my constant good mood. But at school I was a disaster.

When my mother declared herself in bankruptcy we moved to another city and it was a new start. We had some family troubles though, we moved to my grandparents and everything that comes along with adjusting to that. I imagined this was really hard for my mother because she started working for them. My uncle was a jerk at the time and often became violent when enraged. He hit my mother once so every time he came along I was scared and pretend I was asleep. I often overhead him saying things like we are lazy, we don't help around the house, etc.

I had my first boyfriend and discovering sexuality was especially hard. I remember feeling disgusted everytime a kiss got very intense. One time I literally ran out of my bf's house because I couldn't deal with what I was feeling. My friends laughed at me because of how dramatic and squirmish I became whenever anyone mentioned the word penis or even referred to sex. I couldn't understand why this was so hard for me or where this was coming from. I cried one time I found out my boyfriend had condoms. I just felt so so so dirty. When he broke up with me I had a nervous breakdown and started having muscular spasms to the point I had to stop attending school for like two weeks. My doctor suggested therapy and I remember going for like two weeks and her saying that I needed to deal with my guilt feelings. I remember feeling like a total faker, because there was no medical explanation for my spasms. Just therapy. Does that mean I was faking it?

When I turned 18 my second boyfriend broke up with me. I don't remember specifically what triggered it but I was with a couple of friends crying and I just felt like a lock open in my head and just remembering all of the things in my childhood. I cried a lot that day, my friends were really supportive. I couldn't believe that all of that happened to me and I was really really angry, I hated God, and I thought about killing myself for the first time. That thought was really scary to me, so I immediately discarded it.

I took the SATs and I was so surprised about my scores. I never thought I could achieve such scores, and through all of high school I actually waited for the time I was going to be held back, though I had good grades. I didn't have a plan for college because I never really expected I would be able to go. Due to economic issues I attended a non-traditional college on a full scholarship. I dealt with feelings of loneliness, and feeling different. Mostly I think it was because most of my classmates were very wealthy and I couldn't relate.

In reality, I had a very good relationship with everyone, I had people who really cared about me. But I couldn't help but feeling lonely and constantly questioned whether I had true friends or not. This often happened and I tackled the anxiety by making a list of my friends. It was only when I saw a bunch of names on a piece of paper that the anxiety subsided and I would stop crying.

I also dealt a lot with frustration. I couldn't cope and got really sad when I wasn't getting good enough grades. I failed a couple of classes and I felt that that defined me more than anything. I felt that I failed my parents, especially my father. It was impossible for me to see and appreciate all of the other things I had achieved (full scholarship to study abroad, TA for multiple classes).

I tried to drop out of school several times because I felt inadequate and not good enough. A teacher who was very dear to me one time spent 2 hours convincing me to stay at school. Other teachers I worked for really encouraged me, and I will be forever thankful for that. I felt that I needed to live a good life and be successful as a way to repay them.

I started a master's degree during my senior year on a scholarship and during the first year I met a teacher, had a conversation with him and I think he saw potential in me and told me that he wanted to mentor me. To do that, I'd have to move to the capital of my country, where he found a job for me. I moved, I was excited to enter the field of Data Science which was so interesting for me.

However my mental demons soon enough appeared again. I procrastinated a lot because I was so afraid of working in my thesis and fail. The first year went by and I felt I had achieved nothing and though I wrote a scientific paper and it got published, I have never been able to accept that success as my own. I feel that I didn't do enough good work and all of it was done by someone else, my advisor. I wasn't good enough at coding to have done that by myself and if it weren't for him I would have never been able to do that.

I felt like such an impostor, so undeserving of the opportunity I was given, and depressed. Because I was depressed, I didn't work and because I didn't work I felt I was failing everyone which in turn gave me anxiety and more depression. I felt I was not gonna be able to deal or get out of that vicious cycle and I started contemplating suicide. I called a suicide hotline and started therapy again. The doctor suggested antipsychotics and antidepressants. I started getting better and I stopped attending my sessions and stopped taking my pills.

The research I was working in ended so I had to find a job. I didn't feel like I was good enough at anything to get a job, and I was so anxious about being by myself in another city and not being able to afford rent. My advisor's ex-boss suddenly contacted me because he started working as a manager at a big bank and they needed people, so he called me and got me an interview for a Data Scientist position. I was so scared, I didn't feel I knew enough, and I assume that because he recommended me I got the job. So I had to pretend, and this further made me feel like I was an impostor and that soon enough someone would realize that I knew nothing. I tried really hard to study and become proficient.

I feel that I learned a lot during 2019. However, still I was not able to finish my masters thesis. This broke my heart, the feelings of failing everyone who believed in me, failure, self-doubt and mostly guilt became more intense. I also realized how much I am not interested in banking, but I feel so ungrateful for not wanting to stay at my job, which may be the only one I'll ever get. I had a nervous crisis on August and had a medical leave for about a month. I told my parents everything that happened during my childhood, which was by far one of the hardest conversations I've ever had. I attended therapy 2-3 times a week because I was determined to get better and getting rid of all of those feelings for good. I resumed going to work and was okay for about a couple of months. I remain in therapy and medication but haven't been diagnosed with anything, which makes me feel like I'm making all of this up in my head.

Flash forward to now. I'm still at my job, but I am unmotivated and constantly feeling guilty for it. My bosses realize how this affects my performance which puts my position at risk. There are a lot of problems in my team and the general sentiment is low. One of my colleagues recently got fired and several are applying to other jobs or are thinking about leaving. I'm afraid to leave my job without having another offer. I've been applying to other jobs but haven't gotten a call back, which only feeds my thoughts of actually not being really good at my job, not knowing enough. I mean... I still can't finish my thesis.

I started thinking so hard about how much I didn't want to be at my job, but I won't be able to have another one. Maybe I'll get fired, I won't be able to pay my bills. Maybe I didn't choose my career path well because obviously I'm not good at it. And I know I'm the problem, and even if I got another job this will keep happening to me because my brain is broken and will get fired. I will never be able to appreciate anything I have or anything I achieve and will never stop feeling this way and this will keep impacting all of the areas of my life. I will remain depressed, and unmotivated and never actually do anything right and will have to keep living with this guilt and failing everyone around me. I am ungrateful of all of the opportunities I've had and I feel guilty because I feel that if other people had the opportunities that I've had they would have made great things out of it. Instead all of those opportunities were wasted on me. The voices in my head constantly tell me to put myself out of my misery and that I won't be able to rewire a brain that doesn't work properly. But I can't bring myself up to do it because if I kill myself my parents won't be able to collect my life insurance.

I re-read this and I sound like a spoiled, ungrateful bitch. I'm so sorry. I just really need guidance, or a slap in the face.",11Mar2020,1
66,"I hate this. No matter how much I try I always suck at math even though so many people in my family are proficient in math.

It's like the only way to become wealthy nowadays is to do math and no matter how much I try, I can't do it! I study everything, practice for hours and hours and hours but when it comes time to do a test, I don't know that the hell I'm doing.

But at this point, I feel like we only keep each other company for convenience. We don’t know who else to go to, so we stay with each other because there’s no one else. I’ve tried so hard to bring my group of friends back together but it seems that we’ve grown in our own directions. Talking to them in real life is awkward now because there’s nothing to talk about. They don’t really respond to the group chat we have. At this point I’m ready to accept moving on, but there is an issue at hand. Recently I figured out that one of my friends had attempted suicide last month, my other friend whose family is struggling financially, and my other who is struggling with an eating disorder. I feel like as if our broken lives is what brought us together in the first place. I don’t want to burden them by leaving, but I honestly want to escape this cycle of constant sadness.

70,"For reasons I won't go into, about 15 years ago I went to prison for 6 months. At the time it was a huge deal for my family who are generally law abiding middle class people, and I'm pretty sure I offended most of them by breaking the law. Obviously it was a huge deal for me as well that affected me socially and mentally, not to mention professionally for a long time.

There were a lot of things that went on inside that I never talked about with my family, and after I got out I wrote a book with a mildly-sanitised version of life inside. I never did anything with it, although I planned to self-publish it for my family. Time passed and I never quite worked up the courage to do so. Almost none of my friends, and none of my co-workers today know what happened.

Over the last few months or so I've had a number of conversations with my family about things that happened in that time period - finishing college, weddings etc and there seems to be this amnesia I suppose about the fact I went to prison. On the one hand I am kind of glad, as in it's not something I want brought up every day, but hey... this happened.

I'm not sure whether it is worth reopening old wounds, whether it matters enough to me to create drama. This whole forgetting thing just bothers me for reasons I can't quite put my finger on.

81,"this is probably too long, but please read it if you can. your opinion would mean a lot to me.

basically, i started working at a spa reception desk at a hotel a month ago. everything was fine, they were more than satisfied with my work and abilities and i was told that i got the job and when the month is up i'll be signing a three month contract. cool.

there were three girls working there, myself, another receptionist and our manager. we are all similar in ages, and even though they were very close (receptionist has been working there for half a year already) and our dynamic was a bit weird, i thought we are there to work and everything is fine. i was friendly, they were kinda friendly back and that was that. i'm a completely different type of person than them, but i thought that was okay, as long as the work is getting done and nobody is having arguments with anybody. well, i should've known better, apparently. 

this sunday my manager calls me outside, says we need to talk. alright, i thought, probably something about the upcoming contract and stuff, no problem. we sit down and she lets me know that she wants me to transfer to the main reception desk at the hotel so my spot at the spa can be available for a friend of hers that's in need of a job. i'm a bit stunned by this, since i wasn't expecting it, and i tell her that i'm not really interested in transferring and i'd like to stay where i am. main reception is a shitshow, and much more stressful than the job i already have in the spa, and it's just not worth it to me to transfer. she says it would really be great if i transfer since i have a friend that works at main reception desk already and that she already told her friend she can come, starting monday. bare in mind, we're talking about this sunday afternoon, i have less than a few hours to decide. wtf.

i think it over a bit, agree with myself again that i don't want to transfer and tell her so. she keeps on pushing me, i keep on saying no thanks, i like my job here, i'd like to stay. she says okay, i'll talk to the hotel owner to see if we can be 4 receptionists instead of three. she also mentions that her friend will be leaving in two months or so to go work abroad. wtf 2.

two days pass, nothing is happening, and today i'm at work again. i ask if she talked to the owner she says yes, but we'll talk later, i don't feel well. fine, whatever. the whole day passes, we don't talk about it at all. i get ready to leave and tell her to call me, she says she will. she calls after midnight. this isn't new, in the month i was working here calling at crazy hours wasn't uncommon. once i got a text at 2am from the other receptionist letting me know i'll be working a noon shift, the other time manager called at 2am asking me to not take a day off, but come work second shift so she can go to a birthday party and the other receptionist can go out with friends. wtf 3. i ended up giving in and coming at 8pm on my day off to finish the shift so they both can go. i am an idiot, i know,

anyway, she calls and basically says that there isn't space for four people, and that i need to go to main reception. she also mentions that the owner also said i should go to main reception. i highly, HIGHLY doubt he said anything of the sort, but i swallow. i tell her i'm not interested and that i'll be leaving if i can't stay on my original post, and ask wtf the problem is, three days ago everything was fine and i was about to sign a contract and now suddenly i have to go. i ask what issue there was with me or my work, she can't answer. she says something about me not 'vibing well' with the other receptionist, to which i ask wtf she's talking about, i thought we're there to work and not be bestest of friends. she doesn't really have any real answers to my questions and just tells me a bunch of complete shit while trying to cut the talk short. basically tells me okay, you can leave thursday, we will give you your money for this month. 

i am honestly very upset by this. it's completely unfair to be pushed aside so someone's friend can get in your place. if there isn't space for four, there isn't space for her friend, not me. i have a job already, her friend is the new one. she also told me that her friend was going to come back to the post eventually anyway, but it was just faster than expected. nobody told me this was a temporary job when i applied, they even begged me to come in immediately, even though i was sick, as they were in great need of another person. 

i am, of course, going to leave this post, since i am obviously not valued there, and really there isn't any other choice. my question is, should i go and talk to the owner? the way this specific hotel is set up, the owners are extremely involved in everything and are very nice, approachable people. i doubt they really know much of this story, and even though there is nothing they can do for me right now as i am already leaving, i'd like to let them know of this whole fucked up thing. it's a very traditional place, and they are very proper in the way they present themselves and handle affairs, so i feel a bit optimistic that my talk won't fall on deaf ears. do you think i should do this? i have an anxiety disorder and it's skyrocketing right now since i hate conflict, but my friends and family all tell me i should go and talk to the guy and just let him know what happened with me. what do you guys think?  


TL;DR; manager tried to transfer me to different post to give her friend my job, i declined the offer. she was extremely unprofessional about it, literally took a job she already gave me away from me to give to someone else. i'd like to go and talk to the owner of the place to let him know of these awful practices. should i do it?",11Mar2020,1

83,"Ever since high school I have found a lot of joy in running.  Probably a lot of that has to do with endorphins and ""runners high"", but lately I've started to see it become detrimental to my health.  Sore knees, sore hips, fatigued throughout the day, can't seem to keep up on calories without having a ""gut"".....



On top of that I just don't have the passion anymore.  It was fun when I had a team and a group to meet with to go run, but now I'm a dad and husband and work full time... I get that same community and gratification from other places.  Now running just hurts.  But don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to let myself go and get out of shape, I'm just considering doing more of a high intensity workout regemine and lifting.  One big factor in that is that my son is not mobile, so I need to be able to lift and carry him for probably a very long time.  Plus I'd like to be healthy enough to take him to do things he might not get to experience, and that I still want to do as well but want to be able to enjoy with my son, like travelling or exploring the cool state that we live in.



However, I still feel like I ""can't"" stop running. My brother is one of my closest family members and we both ran in high school, and he has been able to keep training through college and now runs marathons.  I like the idea of giving him competition again as well as competing myself, but I just don't think I have it in me anymore.  I had these big plans to race to raise awareness for rare diseases and epilepsy, but I feel like if I'm not training for a race, I won't be able to do that.



So I guess I have a few questions.  Should I quit running for my own health or am I just out of shape and need to work harder?  Am I pushing myself too hard and focusing on something that is going to deter me from the things I still want to do with my son?  Could I still ""compete"" or do something else to raise awareness and fundraise for rare diseases?  Am I overthinking this????",11Mar2020,1

The thing is she lives in Florida and I live in Texas. She always tells me how’s she’s lonely and wants a relationship but doesn’t go straight forward if it’s a question. On face time she told me that someone just texted her asking her out but she rejected them. She says that I’m really cute and her type but hasn’t really asked anything. I really enjoy talking to her and I love everything about her but I don’t know if I could do a long distance relationship especially for my first ever relationship.

87,"Recently I received my ASVAB scores back (93 raw score) and not long after I was being hunted down by the recruiters at my school. Albeit having a felony they want to push to get me on nuke, which is where I stay on a nuclear submarine for 6 months out of the year. They offered me a 40k sign in bonus and a full ride to MIT. I’m scared to Pursue this as it means leaving all of my friends and loved ones. I’m 16 with a girlfriend of a little over a year now. I really need help and reasoning as to what paths I should take.

88,"So a thief stole my dog of 9 years back in August. We know it's him because his vehicle is on video and the witness in the initial report agree it's the same truck and person. The only witness is my neighbor across the street, but he doesn't want to talk to the police anymore to move the case forward. Also, another bad part is that police can't help anymore because since the license plate isn't on video(my dog was taken at night) they can't get my dog back because the thief can just deny claims against him.

The thief isn't from here and only comes one or twice each month on Friday or Saturday to visit his girlfriend. Another neighbor took a video of the guy during the day and he matches the person from the day of the incident video. So I don't know where the thief lives, but he should be in an adjacent city.

I want to confront the dog thief but my family says it's a bad idea to directly confront him and accuse him. I'm stuck in a loop that I want to confront him but I feel hes dangerous, but I really want my dog back. Any advice? Thank you for reading.",11Mar2020,1
89,"My (16M) dad's girlfriend moved in with us 5 months ago and I've never liked her. I made up excuse after excuse of why she shouldn't be here, I made up lies and accused her of stuff. He didn't believe me  because they were lies.

My little brother is 13. My dad and I were supposed to be home at around 4:30pm, I was bored and wanted to go home and my dad said since we were close, I could run home if I stayed on the phone with him. I got home and heard the shower in my dad's room so went in the bathroom to ask her if she was going to make something or if I should order food because I was hungry. I heard talking in the shower, I heard my brother's voice, they were both in the shower. 

That was super weird for me as we stopped being allowed to be naked around my dad once we could bathe ourselves. She asked me not to tell my dad because she knows how it seems but my brother was tired and needed help in the shower. I couldn't look at her try and defend what she did. My brother said she told him to shower in dad's room because he had the better shower and then she just got in, she grabbed him down there a few times and he touched her. He said at first he thought to get out of the shower but she calmed him down and assured him it was okay. He told me not to tell dad because then he couldn't do stuff like that anymore, he said they've touched each other before. 

My brother thinks this is okay. It's not. I told my dad and he doesn't believe me, his girlfriend says I'm lying, my brother said to leave him out of my hatred for her.

I don't know what exactly to do, should I just call the police? I mean it's already happened will they believe me? Will they do anything if they *do* believe me? How will they believe me with my dad, his girlfriend and brother saying otherwise? I'll just look like a son who doesn't like Dad's girlfriend. Should I not call the police? We don't have a mom and really any other family I can contact for help. I don't want this to keep happening",11Mar2020,1

92,"Years ago I had a depression with panic attacks and I refuse to talk about it. What is important are the details after it. Before it I had very clear what I wanted to do and dedicate my time to, but that thing that caused depression stole so much time it was unthinkable as I couldn't do anything that wasn't work related literally at absolutely any moment. 

There have passed years and it's not there anymore and depression isn't either, but the anhedonia remains. After it, I note my emotions are notoriously less intense than before, good and bad. Periods of attention are as well, and the joy of several activities rarely lasts a full hour while before depression I could spend almost a whole day just fine. Nothing except love of some people feels so good as it used to and I am afraid this situation lasts forever. My passions were numbed and still I can't recover them without experiencing strong anhedonia in several activities. 

I am in my 20s, I have been in several therapists and talked with friends about it with bad results and no real useful help specially from therapists, so I come here to see how to reanimate me and bring me back to the old myself that I actively pursue.

94,"So I bumped into this girl I’ve known for awhile, at least 3 years, we use to work at McDonald’s together when we were 17-18, we use to like each other back then and went on a little date that didn’t really work cause I was young and nervous, and after that when I left McDonald’s we didn’t really talk as much anymore, we still constantly always matched with each other on tinder, but I never made a move cause I’m a bitch! But I ran into her at the mall a couple times, and ran into her today again and we always talk for a bit, and I have always liked her and had a thing for her just once I left McDonalds we didn’t really talk anymore, so every time I run into her, I want to ask her out to dinner or something but as soon as I said bye this time and left I realized it would have been the perfect time to ask her out to dinner, but as I was walking away I kept telling myself that I don’t want a relationship right now, I have to work on myself, and I work out of town, I would never get to see her, I work 21 days on and a mere 2 days off, lots of women don’t like that, so I told myself it’s not right and left the mall, got in my car and started to drive away, and had a second thought like why not? Why not just go for a date and see how it is you know, so I reparked, went back inside, she was getting her phone fixed so I was hoping she’d still be there, but she wasn’t, walked around the mall a bit see if I could find her, and I did but she was with a bunch of people, and I knew I lost my opportunity, and now I’m kicking myself over it, cause I don’t know if I’ll see her again, I just sometimes randomly run into her, I deleted all my socials media’s about a year ago, so I can’t message her on there, not like I would want to though, cause I still have an Instagram I made just to be able to talk to some family/friends that can’t get ahold of me otherwise, and I have her on that, but I can’t ask her to dinner or whatever over Instagram, that’s a terrible idea, but I’m literally not going to see her again for who knows how long? So I don’t know if I have a move from here, I think that’s checkmate unless I run into her again but that’s highly unlikely, I go away for work at the end of March, and won’t really be back in town till early December!

95,"I live in Ontario, Canada. 

So, this is a bit complex. My father immigrated legally to Canada in the 90s. Sometime in the early 2000s he changed his name legally as well. My father has been involved in criminal activity in the past, but had a clean record up until recently. 

So fast forward to 2013ish...he met a woman in his home country in Europe. In 2018, she moved to Canada and lived in his apartment for about 6 months (and they were also married at this point). Things didn’t work out so 6 months after moving to Canada she moved back to Europe and they only officially divorced a few months ago. I have her on Facebook and I’ve kept in touch. She’s still living in Europe, is in a new relationship, just living her best life basically. 

Now. Back in 2016 he was arrested on drug charges and released on bail. In this past December he was sentenced to 6 years in prison. His previous friends/roommates now occupy his apartment while he is serving time. There’s some fishy stuff happening lately. Two weeks ago, immigration showed up at my dad’s apartment and were looking for him as well as his ex wife who left Canada long ago. The strange thing is, they referred to him as his OLD name (which he only goes by with family and friends; he only uses his legal name in professional settings like at work and such). 

Then it got stranger. Today they appeared at my brother’s mom’s house (my dad was married to her prior to his recent ex wife) with a photo of his ex’s passport photo and asked if she knew where she was. They said they believed that she’s illegally living in the country. They also had her Facebook, which is even weirder because she is very public and active about her life on there and you can quite easily see she is still living in Europe. They also had a picture of one of his female roommates who has been in Europe (same country) since last summer and wanted to know where she was as well. She isn’t an illegal immigrant. My brothers mom said she doesn’t know anything and also saw their batches and got their cards. 

My father has no idea what’s going on and is equally as confused as everyone else. What I don’t get is how they could not look up his ex wife in the system and see that she obviously left the country years ago and has not since returned? And how they are unaware that my father is in prison and why they referred to him with his old name. 

Everything is fishy to me. If anybody has any knowledge on this type of stuff I’d be happy to hear you out. Thanks!",11Mar2020,1
96,"I’m 21, and for the last 4 years I’ve been wanting to get a car of my own since my parents aren’t financially well off to buy it myself. I spent 3 years in depression and making terrible decisions and self-sabotaging my life. Along with depression and anxiety and basically dealing with suicide. Come up these years and I’m in school part time, slowly realizing what I’ve wanted to do with myself through out the years and having a ft job (I would job hop and quit after 1wk to 3 months) and right now I’ve been managing to keep one and saving up for a car. Last month I’ve been looking for cars and I think today I found one, and it’s not a for sure but either way I’m closer than I have ever been. I know it’s a materialistic thing but “having a car” has been something that’s been awaited for from my family, friends and especially me. I’ve never been closer, and I think bc of my circumstances I was never this close to finally owing one. I just can’t help but cry because for one I’m just so relieved but at the same time stressed and feel like I don’t deserve it. I think of how irresponsible I’ve been for those couple of years and how childish I was behaving and why had it been so hard for me when I know that if I was more mature and responsible this could’ve happened a while ago.

Hey reddit, I need advice. About two months ago my ex and I broke up. We still keep in contact but it hasn’t been the healthiest. He owns an art and fashion brand. Months ago he got an offer to display his clothing at release party for a  pretty big magazine, this was before we broke up, and he told me he wanted me to model for it. Becoming a runway model for high fashion brands is my dream job, so I got very excited as this would be a chance to be scouted. Fast forward to around a week ago, he tells me he still wants me to walk in the show for him. I tell him I would love to do it and we talk a little bit more about it. Yesterday, I asked him what the plan was because I hadn’t heard anything else about it and knew it was this weekend. He was super short and told me he didn’t know anything for the whole day. He then tells me that he no longer wants me to do it because it could cause “unnecessary drama”. I was super upset, not just because he pulled a complete 180 on me for something I was really excited about, but also because he replaced my spot with a mutual friend of ours. This isn’t a new behavior either, throughout our relationship he would gaslight me all the time. This event plus our already unhealthy relationship made me very angry and resentful. When I expressed my hurt feelings he made me believe I was the bad guy and that I shouldn’t he feeling the way I did. Today he texted me again and told me that he changed his mind and still wants me to be in the show. I’m thinking he only asked me because two of his other models just found out they wouldn’t be available for the show. This is a really good opportunity for me but I don’t want to give my ex the idea that what he does is ok. What do I do? 

TLDR: My ex is gaslighting me for being upset when he constantly switches up on me.",11Mar2020,1
99,"Tw; sexual assault????

Actually explaining this feels so weird. I’ve only just come to this realization a week ago. This is kind of embarrassing but I really want to hear what other people think. I’m just too afraid to ever mention this to anyone.  I’m sorry if this is very long :/ 

I am F18 and I’m a very pretty girl. (not to come across as vain but I feel like it’s pertinent for some reason.) But I am still a virgin. People I tell this to either assumed it’s because I’m waiting to fall in love or that I’m waiting for marriage. But it’s not. I have no emotional attachment to my virginity. I am very pro- sexually liberated women. I strongly believe in casual sex too. My abstinence has really been because of mental blocks. Not even just strictly with just sexual exchanges but also relationships. Anyone I’ve ever tried to pursue any normal teenage relationship with it ultimately fails. Not because of normal relationship failures but because I’m broken. 

I ran across an article a few years ago called “the ick in relationships” and it basically explains how you end up really liking someone and eventually you grow to hate/resent them for no reason. I had never seen something that perfectly explained how I felt until that article! Every. Single. Time. this happen!!!!! Any form of romantic relationship I am in I ruin because of this. 

Now the reason I think this might be my dads fault is because my dad is a sexual abuser. I don’t know if he ever abused me but there have been times where I question he had. While I was 4/5 years old I used to imitate sexual acts on my teddy bears. It only just dawned on me how some of the things I did made no sense for me to know how to do. There were things that wouldn’t be shown on tv or anything I had access to pick up on- yet I knew them. 

There was also one time when I was 12 I had fallen asleep. My dad had been out late and didn’t come home until the next morning. I don’t remember much but it’s the first time I remember blacking out. When I woke up I was standing up pressed against the wall screaming to “stop!” And I watched my dad run out the room. I don’t know what happened, I initially thought I had slept walked or something. I tried to mention it to him later that day in a joking manner and he pretended like he had no idea what I was talking about and dismissed the conversation. 

Other than those incidents my dad has always made weird comments around me. He made comments about my body. He would try to force me to dress the way he preferred his girlfriends to dress. I should also mention he used to grab/rub my butt until I was about 13. The crazy part is I thought it was normal!!!! Until one day he did it (when I was 13) and I was like “don’t grab my butt!” Because I had realized how weird it was. He started yelling at me and took my phone. My step mom came in and told me “you getting your phone taken is your fault, that’s what you get for talking back to your dad.” 


Now that I’m older I just wonder what else I have blacked out from or what else could’ve happened to me I thought was normal, thought nothing of it and never thought of it again. There has always been this feeling of alert whenever I was around my dad. It never felt normal. I can’t even walk around my house now (I live with my mom now) without baggy clothes and a blanket wrapped around me because I feel uncomfortable in my own body. Not because of body image issues but because I feel weird about being exposed. Same thing with being naked while I’m alone. I wore all the time including when I slept in bras until I was 16 because I felt too exposed without one. 

These are just the incidents he made me feel uncomfortable. There’s so many other stories of what he’s also done to other people. 

I don’t trust men and I definitely don’t feel comfortable around them just as is let alone sexually. I feel so broken. 

please let me know what you think about any part of this. maybe I’m being dramatic or something. Has anyone experienced this? Do you have any advice? Do you think this is something I just have to meet the right person to help get past this? 

PS 
(Also, Idk if this is important but recently I found out he was telling his wife to dress, do her makeup, and present herself more like me???? I found this really weird but idk if it is.)",11Mar2020,1

She began to explain to me that she wasn't conducting a job interview, but wanted to ask me some questions about my history.

After everything was all said and done, i was asked to come back the very next day with some documents, and that she would be moving forward with the hiring process.

I let my roommate know that I may potentially have a new job, and he started grilling me about asking about whether or not I asked about my pay, or if I was going to get paid weekly or bi-weekly. I told him that I hadn't even had a job interview, and that she just decided to move forward with the hiring process.

He ended up telling me that I was stupid and that I should have asked those questions, and I proceeded to tell him that I don't think I should ask questions about pay until I actually have my foot in the door, rather than one that hasn't completely opened yet.

A few weeks ago, around 9:30 at night I was driving to the gym. On the way there was a stop light. Before the stop light was a pedestrian walkway. I slowed down at the walk way, looked both ways, didn’t see anyone and slowly started inching my way up toward the light. Next thing I see is a bicycler zooming past my car. I slam on the breaks and I hear him scream “woah”. I roll down my window and immediately started to say that I’m sorry and asked if he was ok. I was generally concerned even though I didn’t make contact with the guy. He screamed “what the fuck” “what’s your problem” etc. I stayed calm and kept saying that I was sorry. He looked at me for a little bit and said “dude get the fuck outta here”. That’s was all I needed to here. Next thing you know as I try to pull off he puts his bike in front of my car, starts cussing at me and starts walking towards me. He told me to park my car. At this point I felt threatened for my safety. So I swerved past him. I drove off. I was thinking everything was good until earlier today when I received a letter for the police department about the situations. The guy stated that I hit him and damaged his bike. I didn’t do any of that. So now I have to go to court in a few weeks to get everything settled. I’m worried because I’m a 6ft black man and sometimes we can be guilty until proven innocent. I’m not a violent person and I have anxiety problems. My mom passed away in July too so I’m working full time to pay bills and potentially make a return to college.

context:

I’m 18 years old, a girl, and in university, depressed to hell and sick of not being able to do anything in my life for me, and constantly being emotionally/verbally abused by my mother. Money isn’t an issue.

My father is a truck driver, and barely home, however he recognizes that my mom is “sick” but doesn’t do anything about it. He’s miserable too. My mother has a terribly strained relationship with him, but won’t get a divorce. 

I’m sick of living a fake life and living with a parent who’s love is 100% conditional. I want to leave. The problem is I recognize that it’s not my mother’s fault she’s sick... she’s been through a lot. I know she’d feel EXTREMELY betrayed by me moving out—she’s 1000% against it. The very mention of me moving out gets her incredibly riled up. My father is also against it, but I don’t really care about his opinion, and I know he’ll get over it. 

And then theres the matter of my siblings... they also suffer abuse from my mother, and are very young. My brother is 13, and my baby sister, she’s only four... I know if I left I’d be abandoning them. My sister is already petrified of the idea of me moving out (my mom constantly threatens to kick me out and tells my sister that she won’t have a big sister anymore). I don’t want to leave my siblings with my mother, and I know the stress of me leaving will worsen my mother’s abuse to them. And like I said earlier, the idea of leaving my mother heartbroken and alone seems so cruel. She never leaves the house unless she needs to drop us off somewhere or buy food. She’s very isolated and alone, and as hot and cold her relationships are with her, my siblings and I are all she has... Is there anything I can do that’s right? I can’t abandon my siblings. Even if I could somehow take them with me, I couldn’t just leave my mother completely alone like that... I want to die, thinking about this situation fucks me up... I wish I could just go on with my life and accept it, but I want to do something... I need to be heroic for once in my life, don’t I?

118,"Ok so this whole thing is a shit show and I feel rotten.  

Basically,  I started working in a new restaurant last summer.  There's one girl (S) who I actually worked with before and is a manager in this new place. We didn't know each other well, but have progressively gotten friendlier with each other over these past few months.  She's really lovely. We both have kids who are close in age so we've had a few play dates.  She's the only collegue I've went out my way to hang out with outside of work.

Here's the issue. Not long after I started I heard a rumour that she had slept with one of the guys we work with (P). Here's the thing. Not only is P a total piece of shit, but S is married and her husband is also an employee at the same place.  I brushed the rumour off at the time because, honestly, I didn't think it was any of my business. From what I gather, P himself started the rumour and basically everyone besides S and her husband have heard it. It's something that is frequently joked about among the staff, especially the guys but I'm not sure if people actually believe it or not because I tend to not involve myself in these conversations. I just kept my mouth shut and got on with my work.

So tonight we worked the closing shift together and we decided to go to the supermarket afterwards. As we were walking she told me that in the past P would message her being really creepy. She eventually told him he was making her uncomfortable and blocked him.  Everything clicked into place in my head. This was clearly a case of retaliation or something. I felt really bad for her at this point and decided it was about time she learned the truth, so I told her about the rumour. I told her exactly what had been said and that basically everyone new.  I also apologized for waiting so long to bring it up and that if she wanted to take it further I would back her up all the way.

Guys, she freaked out.  She legit had no idea these things were being said about her. She kind of panicked about her husband and how he'd react.  She said she felt sick to her stomach.   To make matters worse, she deleted the messages after blocking P because as far as she was concerned it was over and done with.  

I'm so angry at myself for waiting this long, and I'm now so incredibly angry at the people we work with.  Everyone thinks it's so damn funny but S clearly doesn't think so and is taking the whole thing really badly.  I feel so sad for her. She really deserves better than this.

TL;DR Told my married manager about a rumour stating she slept with one of the guys we work with after hearing he had been a creep to her in the past. She reacted very badly and now I feel like shit",11Mar2020,1
119,"I feel like I find myself in this situation once or twice a year where I hear very loud, rather aggressive arguments between a man and a woman, presumably in a relationship.  Tonight, as I was walking my dog, there was a couple in a car and I heard her scream ""don't talk to me that way!"" and then she got out of the car and then he said something along the lines of fucking get in or get the fuck out and then I couldn't make out what they were saying.   But it was all very loud and very aggressive.  

I know relationships have their ups and downs but how do you know when something is actually wrong?  Is there a point where I should intervene?  Of course, intervening could make things worse for everyone so that doesn't seem like the wisest course of action.  Any advice on this topic would be highly appreciated, I couldn't live with myself if I let something slide that ended up hurting someone when I could've helped.",11Mar2020,1

123,"TL;DR, grew up socially isolated, and am trying to find out how to have friends. (BTW this is a throwaway)

My parents were ultra religious so many things were banned from home, such as radios, TVs (by correlation video games), computers, and many other forms of technology. My parents would not let us have privacy (me and my brother) and we were disciplined a lot of the time (got the end of the belt) for very minor infractions. I was home-schooled and was apart of home-schooled groups during high-school grades, but was left out of groups a whole lot of the time. My parents would only let me participate in THEIR Sunday School class, and no others, since kids my age were 'not mature enough'. The only people I hanged out with was mainly vets ranging from WWII to Vietnam and, as most of them were, only talked about career stuff with me, and nothing social/""adult"". They didn't know that they were my only social interactions. My parents also made me work practically full time (38 hours average) since I was 14, (the managers didn't really give a damn about laws and I was ignorant in that field). 

So fast forward a few years. I am a member of my State's Guard, am enrolled full time in college (which the Guard helps pay for), and work a full time job (with all my coworkers being over the age of 30 (I'm 21 btw)). This is all I have ever really known. My issue is that I don't know how to socially interact with people my age, nor how to have friend groups. How do interact with people my age? How do I use social media (I don't want to come off as a narcissist on the platform).  How do I go out and find a group of people to hang out with? Do I just ask, and if so, how so?

126,"Hello, well, this little ""talk"" will have place in a few hours.

You see, my dad apparently has been ""cheating"" on my mom for quite a few months and she obviously didn't take so well, the first weeks she was calm, then she became insane.

My mom started talking to everyone about her issue with my dad, when she comes from work 4PM-6AM, she only talks about it with me and my sister and is annoying (i am studying for university), my sister is totally on her side about kicking him, no words at all, from the house but i am still thinking they could talk about with no screaming involved.

Long story short, she slapped me 2 times and even called me an idiot about 15 minutes ago and kicked me out of the kitchen telling me i will tell him that if she wants to go with her girlfriend or stay on the house, that it doesn't matter if i like it or not, my sister kinda hates me so she started talking shi- fish about me in front of her which made my mom hate me as well.

I have to talk with him in 3 hours to tell him what my mom is making me say about kicking him out of the house or drop his girlfiend.

I also wanted to add gears and moving things to the front because I'm not very good at art but I can manage mechanical stuff well enough. I just don't know what to put on it.

132,"Ok so back in November my rommate and I moved out of the place we were in and into her parents house. (Our lease was up, and she wanted to try and save up for a bit. She invited me to go with her to her parents, saying it would only be for a few months.) Well it's been 3 and a half months now she doesn't want to leave until after April as she has a Cuba trip coming up. We became pretty close friends when living in the place before this, and I really enjoy her friendship. 

But heres the issue, it seems like within the last month or so our relationship has been going down hill, we dont hang out, she is never home, and when we talk it seems tense or angry? I feel like she is snapping at me now literally any time she speaks to me and even our normal conversations seem to turn into some sort of argument? 

For example when we first moved in she decided to take the basement bedroom (it was hers when she lived here, and is bigger so she can fit some of her furniture in there.) I got stuck with the upstairs bedroom. (Which is dead center in between her parents room and her 17 year old sister's room.) Can say I wasnt very pleased with the decision, but oh well what can you do it's her house right? 

 I have (half) jokingly brought it up in conversations (she says something about it sucking to live at her parents to a mutual friend, and I laugh and say ""yeah well at least you got the basement!"" And she has always just kinda laughed ot off or said, yeah but I needed MY room, which is whatever because it wasnt like I was actually trying to change it?? Just mutual complaining..  well last night she brings it up to her mom (I dont remember exactly how the convos started) saying ""haha yeah (my name) keeps saying she would have taken the basement"" and I responded ""I 100% still would take it haha"" and then she responds (sounding like angry/challenging) ""yeah well if YOU want to try and fit all of my furniture in that tiny room,"") and I cut her off with a ""ok I dont want to argue about it.."" to which she gives the good ole ""I'm not arguing!"" I grumbled ""whatever I cant"" and walked away, I was in a funk for the rest of the night, and felt kinda bad about it today. So while we are doing the dishes I apologize, and get a ""it is what it is.""  This has happened a few times now she is bitchy (or at least that how I'm perceiving it.) and its whatever, but I have a bad day and it gets held against me for the next week and a half. I'm getting really tired of always feeling like she is mad at me, and being the only one to apologize for my actions, but I also dont want to lose her friendship what should I do to try and keep from winding up disliking each other and becoming ex friends?

137,"Tw : rape, sexual assault topic.
.
.
.
A couple years ago a friend of mine, we drifted apart. There were some mild reasons behind why I didn’t chase her or salvage the friendship (eg. Seeing my exes behind my back). 
but nothing was really adressed. Wanted to keep the peace and just let it be. 
Moving on,
As some people in my city love drama, I received news from multiple people that this old friend of mine was telling people that I am a rapist and that I raped her... 
probably for shock factor as there isn’t any sauce with saying someone’s a bitch anymore.
My supporters were quite outraged by this “rumour” and a couple of them confronted her on their own accord.
Which was met with more backlash slandered about me saying I’m harassing and sprouted more rumours. 
However in this time as it blew up, she was throwing more accusations as me at the same time trying to back pedal, changing her story saying “I didn’t say rape I said sexual assault”
Which, it just hurt as, when we were friends we were very close, She was more initiative then I was. We used to run around naked at sleepovers. I just felt betrayal like, never were we close together without consent. I feel like if anything, 5 years later she changed her mind of consent , or it was purely defamatory.

It was just over a year ago that this blew up,
And the other night I was at a metal gig and she come upto me and apologised.. she said “hey I’m really sorry about everything that happened”
I was just happy for that so I gave her a hug and then parted off continued our night.

I just don’t really know how to feel about it. I am just curious on how anyone else would feel/do if their accuser apologised for falsely accusing you of something so horrid on a public platform.

Should I talk to her to atleast hear what is it it from her? As a lot of the blow up was heaps of people talking inbetween? Get a clear story and sort it out or?
Should I be mad?

For context, his mom would never provide him with the basic necessites. She won't buy him clothes nor medicine and this is combined with the fact he has a lot of physical issues and has to bring the same clothes whenever he sees her

She never cares for him as she would often snap at him for even asking basic questions. One time he asked her if she could drive her to school early and instead of responding normally she yelled  and scoffed at him

It doesn't help that his brother is often hounded and screamed at them and his little brother often makes racist comments in public and whenever he tells his mom she gives off the ""just being kids"" excuse. His mom also makes snarky and rude remarks towards him and is somewhat racist, homophobic and transphobic (Boyfriend is FTM). He told me she has said comments such as ""they're in America so they should speak English"".

141,"I have been diagnosed with major depression for over two years, and I have been in therapy since then. The reason why I got depression is because two years ago, I was pining for a girl that I met in high school five years before that (7 years from today). He told me that that girl got a boyfriend, and qualified my devotion to her as ""cringy."" That made me fall into a depression that has put me into debt and in my parent's place for the last two years. I have been blaming that event for putting me in this situation, and I have wondered why did he had to do that. In that time I had a reason to do the things a I did, whereas today I am empty. Then to add to the matter, he questioned me about my politics six months ago in a sort of judgmental way. So I have wondered, why did he say that the girl I longed for had a boyfriend? What did he hoped to gain? I have wanted to confront him, but I am afraid that that will worsen our relationship. However, my therapist presented the option to have him join our session in order to discuss this issue on our next therapy session. The question is, should I confront him in the first place? How should I approach the matter? How do I invite him to join our therapy session?

My friend, I'll call her Cube, has been having suicidal thoughts and likely has deep, deep depression. Cube's kept on a tight leash by her parents, with her mother and father being divorced or no longer together, and they're trying to make that leash even tighter. She was sexually abused when she was very young, I don't have many details, and she's allowed to keep those secrets.

She does, according to her, most of the work in her house, keeps silent around her mother and father due to how they yell at her for whatever reason. She doesn't feel loved and feels like everything nice she's ever given is to make up for her own personal trauma, and she feels like she's being abused. I assume she's glossing over being physically abused, considering her brother- who just turned three- is being hit daily for whatever reason. From being too loud to just because her mother feels like it.

My main concern is that they wont allow her any form of privacy. Yes, she's 15, however I feel a mother shouldn't be censoring her child, and shouldn't hit Cube and her siblings because they complained about her to their friends even a little bit. She's suicidal and might consider running away from home, but she's only alluded to the last part.

New York State, for the reference. The insurance is Blue Cross Blue Shield Anthem. So my family was pretty poor when we joined BCBS, and we basically had free healthcare. I needed braces and got them fully covered by insurance. 2 months ago, that subscription expired and I was forced to renew my plan. When I submitted my income, they said that I am unable to get free coverage anymore and was put on a premium. They gave me a plan that they claimed was ""absolutely the same so nothing would change at all"". I still have a year of braces to go. Today I got a call from my medical office saying that my insurance does not cover my braces anymore and I am required to pay 1.5K for the treatment out of pocket. FYI, I had no previous notices from my insurance or doctor that this would happen so I had no idea at all. Now I found a letter in my mailbox saying that my situation is not covered by this ""new plan"". It was previously covered and now I have to pay that enormous amount of money.

I literally don't know what to do now. I can barely pay my rent, so 1.5K for braces so unexpectedly is more than I could handle. I am honestly about to break down rn.

149,"Hi, all. I'm hoping someone here can give me some insight on my situation. 

I [F24] am bisexual. I have been all my life, but didn't come to terms with it / come out until maybe two years ago. Because of that, I've mainly dated guys my whole life and have very, very little experience with women. About a month ago, I met this girl, ""L"", on Tinder and we've gone on two dates. 

Before and after we went on our first date, L and I texted pretty much every day. L is super busy all the time, but she still found time to text me at least once a day. She started convos as often as I did, and we even flirted a bit here and there. The date itself was great, too. We talked a *lot*, found out we have quite a few similar interests, and ended the night saying we both had a really good time. She had the biggest smile on her face, too, so that made me feel really good about how things went!

Two weeks of more (sporadic but consistent) texting preceded our second date. This time, we hung out at her place and played video games until almost midnight. We laughed a lot and talked smack while playing. Toward the end of the night, she seemed a little deflated, like she was tired (I'm hoping because it was late). She texted me later that night saying she had a really good time with me. I said I had a good time as well.

Ever since then, messages from her have been few and far in between. It's only been a week since we had our second date, but it feels like I'm always the one initiating conversation. She texted me first the other day, but when I responded, she didn't reply. I try to keep telling myself she's busy, but my anxiety-riddled brain keeps telling me a different story. I can't help but wonder if I maybe said or did something that turned her off.

I want to keep talking to her because she's really cool and funny, but I feel like our second date didn't go too well and now she isn't interested. My friends keep telling me I'm overthinking it, that everything is fine, but I'm not sure.

Dating a woman is so different to me. When I went on dates with guys, I was still nervous, but it was much easier to tell whether or not a guy was into me. 

With women, though, I feel like I'm struggling to ""read the room"", if that makes sense. It's hard to tell if she's into me anymore or if she's just busy. I also struggle with wondering whether or not I'm saying the right things or being interesting enough to keep her around. For some reason, I get more nervous when it comes to dating women. Maybe because I don't have much experience, or because it's harder for me personally to tell what my lady-date is thinking?

I was the last one to send a message. Should I keep texting her and making an effort until she tells me to stop or ghosts me? Or should I kind of leave it up to her and let it be?? 

How do I stop obsessing over whether she likes me too, or over whether I'm coming on too strong or not showing enough interest??

I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub. I'm just so confused and it's hard to talk about this with people in my life. I'd appreciate any advice you all have to give.",11Mar2020,1

I’m 19. 

I started going to therapy last month because I thought I was bipolar. I see my therapist once a week. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder and social anxiety and seasonal depression. Not on any medication. There is a DBT group therapy of 6 girls (19-22 years old) that started at the end of February. The first meet was the 26th and then last Wednesday. With another therapist who I’ve never met. I didn’t show up at the last two (they didn’t put me on the list though so it didn’t matter but this week they did).

I currently don’t have a job or any friends (haven’t had friends or a job in months, can’t keep either). And i sit in my house most of the time or take my dogs for walks sometimes (but that causes anxiety if it’s crowded on the walking trail).

I am supposed to see my therapist Thursday and group is tomorrow and I got a group text message as confirmation that group is tomorrow and there’s other girls replying. I never said anything. Someone is bringing their cat and snacks for the group.

I’m scared there might be people I went to school with there at group (I was bullied a lot and virtually had no friends all 4 years and sat alone at lunch a lot, I have RBF so I guess that doesn’t help and a strong fight or flight response and tend to come off rude when I feel uncomfortable and I shut down). There is someone in the group named Rachel and I knew 3 Rachel’s that went to that school that absolutely hated my guts for no reason and made my life hell.  Idk if it’s her because I don’t know the last name. 

I’m also scared they are going to judge me (you know the looks on peoples faces to know they are judging you, that certain look and then the way they look at others after looking at you or if they start whispering) and won’t like me for whatever reason.

I’m having massive anxiety thinking about it, my therapist thinks it would be good for me to try it out so we can use some of what they teach me there in our 1 on 1 sessions and so I can potential try to make friends. She also told me about meet me.com meet ups and I’m too scared to do that, I don’t trust people and I hate driving. Driving gives me massive anxiety.

Basically, my ex has a shoplifting problem. I never thought what she was doing was right but I didn't do anything because I loved her. Now, after keeping this a secret for months, it's starting to eat at me and I want to do something about it. 

I know any illegal activity is against our school code of conduct and the code of conduct at the university she's going to next year, but I don't want to mess up her life. I could also go to the police but I don't know what they would do. 

I do have screenshots of her admitting she's stolen stuff and a list she made of the stuff she stole. There's also definitely pictures on her private instagram of stuff she stole where she admits to stealing it in the caption. 

The reason I haven't said anything is because I fear for my own safety and my status at school. I'm not popular but nobody other than my ex friends are mean to me. I fear if it got out that I reported her actions that other people would bully me as well and I honestly couldn't handle that. I also fear that my ex would react with violence towards me, as she's very aggressive. 

I don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",11Mar2020,1

158,"*disclaimer: it’s a bit wordy, but damn it felt good to write it all out*
so i have these two friends. one of them went to my high school, and was my absolute best friend. let’s call her kelly. the other one, was my first semester roommate who i had just met at the beginning of the school year. let’s call her lexi. we were all attending the same college, so i introduced them, and we became close friends, along with kelly’s roommate allison. the four of us hung out every day, and it was a great semester. i was generally closer with kelly and lexi than anyone else was, being that i knew kelly for years and i was living with lexi, and they trusted me a lot with everything. after the first semester however, i ended up transferring schools, thinking the new one would be a better fit academically. it totally was, however, i have made absolutely no friends. after transferring i still kept in close contact with my friend group, and it almost felt like i never left. i didn’t mind that i wasn’t meeting anyone at my new school, because i still had my close friends to talk to. but as the new semester has continued, kelly and lexi have started to become far closer. i know it’s to be expected, and i shouldn’t feel jealous, but i can’t help it. they do everything together now, and i can’t help but feel replaced. lexi rarely talks to me anymore, and kelli constantly flaunts their friendship infront of me. i still regularly text in our group chat, but they respond less and less frequently. they come up to visit, but it seems like they do it only when it’s convenient for their wants (ex: the old school we went to didn’t have a big party scene, now my new one does, so they only come visit when they want to party). i hate feeling like this, because i know i brought it upon myself by transferring, but now i’m miserable and it feels as though my two best friends have replaced me with eachother. any advice on how to cope would be much appreciated!

tl;dr: had a friend group and was much closer with two of them than they were with anyone else. transferred colleges this semester, and now it feels like they’ve replaced me with each other and they barely talk with me like they used to, and only seem to want to visit me when it’s convenient (for example, when they want to party for the weekend). i’m having a hard enough time making friends, but they seem to just flaunt their friendship in front of me all the time now. i know it was inevitable and i brought it upon myself by transferring, but i need advice on how to cope.",11Mar2020,1

She had brought it to my house, and I had told her that I didn’t want it there. She hid it when going to sleep, and forgot it at my house. My mom found it, asked me who’s it was, and cracked under pressure. She got her phone taken and it grounded for a very long time, and she’s pissed at me. The following texting exchange was through her new fliphone that she was given:

Her: It happened. I’m grounded for good. Thanks for being there for me.

Me: Blank, I get that you're probably mad at me, but I'm not going to cover for you by any means when it comes to stuff like this.

Then, I told her that I thought I liked girls as well.

Her gay friend said she had kissed a girl and knew. My friend's boyfriend is bisexual so we called him and told him we thought we might be bisexual too and asked him if we could kiss. He said yes and then we kissed and cuddled on her living room floor for a while. 

That morning we woke up and acted like everything was normal then I asked her if we kissed because we were blackout drunk. Anyway, my friend said she couldn't really remember much and I said that too.

167,"Currently recovering from a bout of pretty severe anxiety due to drug and alcohol abuse and sexual assault that left me unable to leave the house for almost three years. My Dad got me a job as a barmaid through his work as a way to ease my transition back into real life as my work history is pretty patchy.

The operator of the pub and my manager know I still suffer with mental illness to a degree, as they talked to myself and my Dad about it before they hired me. We also agreed that if I fuck my shit up, I shouldn't get any special treatment regarding my performance and should be treated like anyone else, which I completely agree with.

I was doing okay with my shift pattern, quiet afternoon-evening shifts on weekdays, better than anyone thought I would considering what I've been through. I have been drinking again, and that could become a problem but for now it's just a minor issue. Then I was moved to Saturdays, as a pregnant colleague was given my shifts.  

I was supposed to be working 2 pm to 6 pm and had prepared accordingly. But I got a text on Friday night asking if I could work late. I can't say no to anyone. So took 7 pm to 2 am. I had to miss my medication and missing it makes me pretty loopy as in angry and tearful. I make sure I'm home to take it at the correct time or can at least have a little food and time out after I take it if I'm out of the house, because it strips my stomach and gives me some mean side effects. But again, can't say no, can't ask anyone for anything, can't stand up for myself anymore. 

I was told my manager would be driving me home at 2 am. I freaked the fuck out, and I'm not assertive enough to say no. He's gay (I think) but that's not the point. I refuse to be, and avoid being around men alone. I'm all or nothing when it comes to men, I either trust them or I don't. I didn't think it was really appropriate to tell anyone that. 

I got mad at closing time after we shut the door. It was minor, but did tell another girl to fuck off and proceeded to walk outside and get some air. The doorman asked me if I wanted a hug. I don't say no to men. Which sent me even further off the rails. 

When I walked back in to carry on cleaning and collecting glasses, it was like nothing happened, the situation had been diffused and resolved. My manager called me into his office and I just burst into tears apologising for what I had said. I told him I had booked a taxi and called my mother to come and pick me up when my shift ended. I got my shit together, did my job, and went home. 

The operator (manager's boss) called me in on Monday to 'talk'. I thought I was going to be fired and was actually excited. I'd made a fucking idiot of myself and just wanted to get a job at a supermarket or something until college starts now I know I can hold down a job again. 

Operator said what my manager said but a little bit more nicely. She also said it wasn't acceptable for me to 'scream and cry', which isn't the best description of a few private tears, but she only got a second hand account of that, and a third hand account of the incident so things get lost in translation. She was very firm but reasonable. 

She said that she'd heard I'd said I didn't feel comfortable in the car with my manager. I had actually said to a colleague that I didn't want to get in the car with him because of how my behaviour looked and the problems it caused. I would never tell anyone the original reason I didn't want to get a ride with him, but that was irrelevant once I had made myself look stupid enough to be too ashamed of myself to even look him in the eye.

I need a new job. I'm not scared of hard work or seven hours straight without sitting down, I'm not bad with people or heavy lifting, I thrive on noise and chatter and people having fun but I don't have the transport to be getting home at 2 am. Getting in the car with a male that isn't my brother, cousin or grandfather is a red fucking line. Not being able to take my medication sucks so hard. 

I can keep my cool and work whatever hours of the day you throw at me. But if I can't take my meds or have to be in the car with someone I don't know, it's not the job for me. This makes me a liability to her and she SHOULD have fired me for her sake, because I am not capable of doing the job to the best of my abilities right now. 

How do I condense this and tell her in a rational way that it's not effective for her to employ me anymore if it's only going to be late nights I can't get home from, and that it would be best if I left? I don't want to wait until the next shitshow. Should I even be telling her? I just want to leave on good terms as quick as possible. I wouldn't ask Reddit this shit, but I don't really have anyone normal to ask.",11Mar2020,1

171,"I think she's in love with me. I've known her since high school. We are 27 now. We've been really close lately. There was a point that I saw her everyday for months. We would go to the beach, go get food, or just hang out together and talk about anything. I like her as a friend but nothing more. See I'm gay, and she knows that I'm gay and I've told her that me and her will never be a thing. Yet she always ""jokes"" around and asks how we would be such a good couple if only I was straight. I feel like I'm keeping her away from finding a man at this point. So I am trying to distance myself from her, she recently told me that her family and friends told her to not hang out with me as much anymore because I am keeping her away from finding a potential husband. I'm very masculine, so every time we go out together people assume we are a couple. I don't want to be with her romantically, I never had feelings for her like that. I just enjoy her company. But now I'm starting to think that she is in love with me and she'll do anything to have me with her than to not have me in her life at all. I'm now trying to distance myself from her. I don't see her everyday anymore. But she messages me everyday and is always trying to find out what I'm doing, if I can hang out, go to her house and watch tv, etc... I tell her that I'm busy but she just keeps finding ways to message me. After I turned her down a couple of times, she asks me if I can do a favor for her and help her with heavy groceries tomorrow since she is unable to lift heavy items temporarily. I don't know what to do. She told me that she wanted some space after what her family and friends told her and that's when it hit me that I need to stop hanging out with this girl. But the following day, she messaged me apologizing for trying to distance herself and has been trying to see me everyday since then. It's been a week almost and she's asked me to see her everyday. I don't know what to do but the more I dont see her, the more I realize that she is really attached to me. I think her family and friends are correct, she is way too invested in me that she isn't putting time to put herself out there to find a potential lover. How do I let her down easy. Even when I tell her that I can't see her and that she should focus on herself,  she keeps on messaging me trying to find anyway to see me. Thanks in advance",11Mar2020,1

173,"19 M for reference. I would deeply appreciate any advice here, as I am in a tricky situation right now.

My mum broke down recently while we were talking and told me about everything that her boyfriend has been doing to her over the past six months or so. She told me that he has constantly been cheating on her with multitudes of women off online hookup sites, and meeting them at bars while he said he was ""meeting friends."" She found out by seeing his phones recent searches one day because she was (rightfully) suspicious, and all the results were things like ""hookupxxxsex.com"" as well as tinder, match etc. When she confronted him, he exploded and said it was her fault because she wasn't 'giving him attention.' She recorded the conversation, which essentially boiled down to my mum crying, asking how he could do this, and him screaming his face off at her. 

On top of this, everytime she mentions the fact that she is leaving once the lease is up, he storms off and texts her that he is going to kill himself, and that she is 'evil.' He also said that he was going to 'make it harder than this has to be.'

She also said that he constantly insulted my brothers and I, for being 'lazy, freeloading pieces of shit who will make shitty adults one day.' I do not know where he gets this notion from, as I currently work 25+ hours a week while attending school full time, while my brothers are literally still in elementary and high school.

There's many other examples, but the point I'm getting at is I want to seriously confront him about all this and tell him what a piece of shit he is. It makes my blood boil the way he treats everyone, and I want him to leave. I know this is kind of a rant, but any advice on how to tell him what an asshole he is would be greatly appreciated.",11Mar2020,1

So my friends parents are getting a divorce, which is already pretty rough. Apparently they complain about each other in front of her, ignore each other, the whole nine yards. But as if that wasn't enough, her dad's company recently declared bankruptcy and they're moving to another continent. I know that it seems like I'm not taking this seriously, but I really, really care about her and seeing her making ""edgy"" jokes that disguise her feelings and watching her get more reckless and moody has been horrible. I'm trying to create a space for her to not think about all that but I don't know if it's the right thing. She won't fully open up to me, and even if she does I'm pretty awkward with feelings and I feel like I'd just hurt her more. How do I help her? Can I even do anything?",11Mar2020,1
191,"

So I made a dumb mistake but I had unprotected sex with a girl I met recently and after we were done she went on about how many partners she had recently and now I'm pretty worried about if I caught something. 

The big fears are HIV, herpes, and anything blood related. She was on her period and I intended to use a condom but again, life happens and I made a really dumb mistake. It won't happen again because now I'm really worked up. She told me she's tested regularly and she's clean of any stds but right now a day after I don't any symptoms but I DO plan on going in. When should I go check? 

I'd much rather go now but I understand I'd need to wait, if I caught something wouldn't it show up pretty soon? I don't want to wait for symptoms as I have a pretty intense anxiety disorder and the not knowing and letting hypochondria take over isn't my idea of a good time...

Any advice would be great! And as a bonus question can anyone tell me if I'm just overreacting? It was a one time thing and for anyone asking it was just penetrative, she did give me oral for a brief moment at one point however. But no oral on my end.",11Mar2020,1

195,"So for background, I’m currently 22 [m] and my SO is 24 [f] - we began dating in January ‘18.  This was my first real relationship and it’s a long story so apologies. TL;DR at bottom. 

We met each other in a very cute, stereotypical way at work (grocery store) and we didn’t hit it off but I was persistent in showing her my interest. Pretty soon, we fell in love and we had a lot of passion for each other. 

In October ‘18 she decided to take a break from the relationship. Her reasoning was rational as she felt very scared of the idea that our commitment was for a lifetime + she just started her career. For context,  she graduated in May ‘18 from uni. I never mentioned getting married and surprisingly - she was the one who was always talking about kids/our future. However, she felt as though I didn’t understand how to give her space during this transition in her life.

I gave her time and in November ‘18, she came back to me saying she made a mistake and realized how much she loves me. Things got really good, we couldn’t get enough of one another. 

Now it was time for my last semesters of uni, although she began her career and had a salary, I was still at the grocery store due to my part time work schedule and full time student schedule. 

It was stressful, unlike her, I was a first-generation college student so didn’t have any guidance about post-uni life or how to finish strong. On top of that, I moved back in with my parents in August ‘19 to save money and focus on graduating. Regardless, I graduated this past December ‘19. 

During the last year of our relationship, we mostly had ups but when there was a down, it was a nosedive. Both of us are very emotional and in-tune with what we feel. I was stressed during my last semester with the semester-long projects and living at home (relationship with parents was rocky). She was stressed from transitioning into a new school. We both tried to be understanding.

In December ‘19, it was a hard month for me particularly. A couple of days before my graduation, my father exploded on me and confessed a lot of negative emotions about me. My graduation was also on a monday at 10am so my SO couldn’t make it nor any friends. My graduation didn’t feel like a celebration with only my parents there. The following week, I lost my job at the grocery store, which was my own fault for telling a coworker to ‘fuck off’. Money got tight for obvious reasons. I couldn’t take my SO on too many dates or buy her much in general. 

January 11th ‘20, she broke up with me because she said she wasn’t as in love with me as I am with her anymore. She said it felt wrong. I told her with time and space, maybe it’ll change. We took our time and space and at the end of Jan., we began seeing each other once a week for date nights.

I also got hired at my first full-time, salary position on Jan. 16th, exactly a month after my graduation and 2-3 weeks after getting fired from the grocery store so these dates were back to normal, money-wise. 

After seeing each other 3 weeks in row, we spent Valentine’s together. I sent her the usual list of things I’ve sent the past 2 Valentine’s: her fav flowers, cookies for her classes, strawberries, and a funny card. I also took her out to a nice steakhouse that night where she told me we were officially a junior together. I was very happy.

Before making it ‘official’, we decided to work on small things like better daily communication and having dates that weren’t so templated. After our Valentine’s dinner, I noticed that we weren’t really changing them or at least she wasn’t up for it. I asked her, without accusing her, if anything is wrong and to call me so we can talk about it on Feb 20th.

She said okay but never called so I texted her the next day again to ask if she could maybe find time to call me that day. She got upset and said I was pushing the issue. She then goes on to say that us going on dates and seeing each other doesn’t mean we’re dating or in a relationship. 

I said, “okay, that tells me what I need to know. I love you and I’ll be thinking of you.” she then calls me and asks if I’m breaking up with her. I tell her she just told me that we’re not attached by anything so what would I be breaking up? I then give her an ultimatum: take space and leave me alone or realize that we can fix the situation and make it better if we both just try a little more. She agreed and said she’ll talk to me when she decides. 

Time passes by and on March 7th, my friend tells me she’s dating somebody new - learned because she was tweeting about it. We didn’t have each other on anything anymore so I was unaware. I called her to ask and she was reluctant to tell me the truth. Once she did, she followed it up with, “I didn’t think I had to tell you.” I told her how much it hurt me because I was waiting and telling friends/family that we were just taking space and it’ll workout. I wish I would’ve known so that I could move on and have closure. 

We talked a few times over the weekend and there were times, out of pure rage, that I told her I wouldn’t want to be friends. I also said I couldn’t believe she already found ‘new dick’ within 2 weeks. She took it very personally as well when I said I’ll be deleting the pictures of us off my phone. She also didn’t like that I looked up the guy she was talking to on LinkedIn (which notified him). She blocked me on everything including our phone numbers. Despite speaking to her several times, I wanted her to admit or acknowledge that she had done me wrong. So I emailed her asking if we could be friends one day after some time because even with all this, I really love her and wouldn’t want to be kept from knowing how her life turns out. I’d also like to keep her updated with mine. She told me not to speak to her until June or she’ll get a restraining order. Her reasoning is because I’ve ‘subtweeted’ her and have thrown her name in the mud. The tweets in reference were mostly about being in shock that people can go from one relationship to another and how it’s unhealthy. 

so, tell me how I should feel.. is this gaslighting? Am I psycho? 


tl;dr: 
Gf and I dated two years. She had broken up with me 9 months in but came back saying it was her fault/mistake. Broke up with me again this past January but came back at the end of the month saying she wants to work it out. Told me we were dating again but changed her mind within a week. I gave her time to decide and she began dating another guy. I said I didn’t want anything to do with her so she blocked me on everything including phone number. I realized I spoke out of rage and not honesty so I backtracked through an email - she said not to speak to her until June.",11Mar2020,1

198,So this has been kind of on my brain for a long time. I’m an only child but I have a lot of cousins and they’re all younger to me and I’m not for sure but I think they kind of look up to me. The second oldest is not even in her twenties yet and has been going through some rough times. She’s just been having... personality changes and being... more distant and doing messed up stuff. I know that goes kind of with the territory of being a teen and she’s also incredibly secretive with me. I think she trusts me but part of me thinks she’s afraid of me looking at her different. I try to take her out as much as possible and take her to do things out of state and try to be around to be a good influence to counteract the bad influences she might be getting from people closer to her own age . I know it doesn’t seem that bad but she’s the closest thing I’ve ever had to a little sister and love her dearly and just want to do what I can to help steer her in the right direction.

199,"I (26F) moved into a neighborhood about a year ago.  Most people keep to themselves which is quite different from the neighborhood that I grew up in where everyone was pretty friendly. It would be normal to hang out occasionally with the neighbors like for dinner or game nights. That doesn't seem to be the culture in my new neighborhood. I've only talked to a few neighbors (mostly couples). 

One neighbor (30s M) I've enjoyed talking to  and he's also noticed that people keep to themselves in the neighborhood. We get along well but occasionally he seems like he might be too friendly. I don't want to give him the wrong impression. I have a boyfriend that I love and have been with for about 3 years.  Currently my boyfriend is only over a couple times per week so most evenings I'm on my own. He will be moving in later this summer. My neighbor knows about my boyfriend but I get the impression that he's flirting with me at times.

I'm trying to navigate how to be friends with this neighbor without giving the wrong impression. Would I be giving the wrong impression if I invited him over sometime? Should I just wait until my boyfriend moves in to try to establish a friendship?",11Mar2020,1
200,"Hello! To hopefully keep it brief, our landlords are choosing to not renew our lease, leaving us to search for a new apartment. We found an apartment we like at the low end of our budget ($300 less per month than we pay now), but with a move-in date about a month earlier than we were aiming. 

We've asked to possibly cut out the last month of our lease, and they aren't able/willing to do that. The question now is, do we jump at this lower rent rate and ""waste"" a month's rent? Or wait it out to see what comes up? Our current lease ends in 2.5 months, and we live in a competitive spot housing-wise.

204,"Hi there, hope this sub is a good place for this

I'm a 3rd year university student, and I've always had a knack for math. I'm living on my own for the first time ever this summer and I'm hoping to make some extra income on the side to help pay for rent, food, and next year's tuition. 

I already have a job as a tutor registered with a local company, but the hours are really minimal, I may be able to get 20-25 hours a week there over the summer and that's if I'm able to get the students in each slot, and it ends in June unfortunately. I have another job, but it also has very spotty hours all over so I figure I'll have some extra time to make some money, but not enough to work another job with hours that will collide with my other 2 jobs.

So I'm basically asking what's the best way I can use my high school and below math fluency to make some money for a few months. Do I tutor online or is that a conflict of interest, and if not, where? Do I create some help media of some kind and hope it gets traffic? Do I just go on something like Fiverr and offer to help people with their homework?

206,Hey guys this is gonna be long time and I appreciate any advice given to me. Alright so there’s this girl I’ve known since junior year of high school and i liked her but I didn’t really start talking to her until senior year and we got along great but before college started I guess I was being obvious that I liked her and she told me nope and we stopped talking. About like 8 months later I randomly thought about it and figured I was over her so I’m like welp we can try being friends again and to my surprise she was down to be friends. Until the summer happened when I was like I still have feelings for this girl but I didn’t want to ruin the friendship I kept it hidden and she was starting to develop feelings for another guy at her work and I was like this hurts but I can’t try to be supportive but that didn’t happen and she knew about my feelings and so she rejected me in a kinda of a weird way like she still wanted to be friends so we just took time off from talking to each other. Some time passes by and now September of 2019 my dumbass was like yeah I don’t think I can be friends with her anymore because of my lingering feelings but again she said we could just take time off but at the same time she got a boyfriend and decided it was best to delete my number and off social media. Now end of November we were in the same class and had been paired up in the same group for a project and naturally we start talking again and like a week later she breaks up with her boyfriend. Our friendships starts to return back to normal. Then back in mid January she got drunk and drunk texted me and asked if I wanted to know anything so my ass being curious and knew it was a bad question had asked if she ever really considered dating me at any point and she said she would have dated me but feels like she’s too fucked up for me and we move past that until 3 days later where we went to a party and the topic was brought up again and that’s when she seriously started crying and like hugging me. Since then i think we’ve gotten closer but idk lately she’s gotten a little confusing bc my mom likes to tease me that she’s my girlfriend and i tell her about it and she’s goes with it saying that’s her mother in law. One last thing is that Friday she came over to my house and helped me set up new curtains and afterwards we laid on my bed jamming out to music and she was leaning her head on my shoulder and our faces had gotten close a few times.

208,"A little context. I (25m) work at a home automation company (home theaters, whole house audio, lighting control, automated shades, security, etc) I've been an installer for almost three years and I've specialized primarily in the automated shades department. Out of about 30 employees this darpement is three people; a salesman, and two installers. It does about 700k-1mil in sales a year. Our salesman recently left and the main sales department has started including shades in their sales pitch. It hasn't gone super well and today I was the offered the sales position with an increase in salary plus commission. 

The catch... My brother (30m) was a salesman at this company when I started. He got me the interview but beyond that, I made my own way. About 6 months after I started my brother came into a fortunate position to get financial backing and buy the company, with another salesman. He is the CEO and head of sales, while I have worked for the other owner under Operations. Until now my brother and I rarely see each other/speak at work and really have nothing to do with eachother. Weve agreed that he doesn't make decisions about my position or pay either and given his hardass personality, I really believe that. Outside of work we have a good relationship. We are decently close and confide in eachother quite a bit. Usually work isnt discussed much. After my brother bought the company I noticed a shift and it took about a year before I was just one the guys and not ""the owners brother"" I expect that shift again as I move into sales. 

I've worked my ass off to get to where I am. I know people (sales and my fellow installers) will think I got the job because of my brother, that's not the reality and it doesn't bother me. However, for the sake productivity, how can I push through the preconceptions? There are alot of processes at this company and if people wanted to make my life difficult, they could. I know it wont all be bad. I'd really like to streamline the amount of time it takes to solidify my position, especially working directly under my brother.

We began getting close those first two weeks, and he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said no, I don't want to be committed. I meant that I wasn't ready, and soon would be, but it came out wrong, and I was just really insecure and scared at the time. We were still dating, sort of. He warned me that his ex asked him to lunch, but he didn't feel anything at all, and he promised he wouldn't go back to her. I said it's fine, I trust him, and he should go..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the jealous type, but maybe I should have been. Anyway, he comes back that day, and tells me he's getting back with her. It ripped my heart out, I said ""cool"" and started crying. How shitty huh? He tried to hold my hand and said sorry, but I pushed away and left. After, they were together. Around September 20th or so. I would often talk about him to his friends, and how I still felt things, and they told me he didn't see a future with me, and he told me that he just didn't want to regret saying no to her later on. Whatever. One day at a party he starts crying, and the gf (at the time, you'll know more in a bit), let us call her Cake, she tells me it's my fault and that he feels guilty over me, and that she's scared over his feelings for me, and people have been telling him about my feelings. I didn't want that, I just wanted the inside scoop. Cake actually talked to me when we first met about how she didn't want this to happen, and she was sorry. Excuse me? Do I know you? Get away. She told me it was her that told him to not talk to me as much, and that was why he was so distant.

Anyway, fast forward to Jan 20th 2020. They have broken up. I didn't know until February (which sucks), and well, I still liked him, sadly. Apparently they were arguing all the time, etc etc. So I invited him to my birthday dinner. He said no, politely. Guess why? HE'S WITH SOMEONE NEW. This new girl slid in, mind you, when he was still with Cake. This new girl, let's call her Merda. They broke up, probably cause of the arguing, and THIS GIRL. UGH. I really wanted to try again, but what can I do with this girl in the middle of it all. Me and him are on good terms and all, btw, but I DO NOT know what he feels for me at all. At least he's more friendly with me than when he was with Cake. Merda... She's alright. When I first met her, she also introduced herself to me, and she said she'd heard of me. WHY THOUGH? WHY AM I BEING MENTIONED? O\_O I see them together sometimes. She's not really touchy, unlike Cake, who would LITERALLY sit on his lap and make out with him in front of me. HELLO? NO! NO!

Okay, so. What do I DO? I like him, and want to get close again, but I am not a homewrecker, and I don't want to ruin a relationship by meddling. I am not like this girl.

Premise. An apartment complex was bought by BO; PM was put in place to run it. Mom was hired as a leasing agent about 1.5 years ago at Company. Mom is a realtor so the whole residency contract thing was a great fit. PM seemed like a nice lady at first but started to show her true colors. PM and MM politically fought for power, aiming at employees.

Illegal:

1. Watched a family play in the grass area from her office, sneered *""Dirty Mexicans""* and gave them an eviction notice the next month for some bullcrap reason
2. She gives eviction notices to anyone who raises their voice at her (usually for issues she caused).
3. Gave the keys to a resident's home to his family who he hated while he was in the hospital for a mild stroke. The sisters had NO right to be in his home or have his keys. Yes they did steal things.
4. Fires any person who dislikes her. Literally any employee. No matter how necessary.
5. Always hanging on the male employees and residents. Hugging and touching them.
6. Letting people move into apartments before signing leases.
7. Leaves contractors and residents in the main office alone with records and resident files.
8. ignoring the health department's demand for them to WP a building's crawlspace because it is flooded and molded. hasnt fixed it, doesnt plan on fixing it.
9. not paying contractors. outside contractors, just ignoring invoices. inside contractors, ignoring their paychecks for 7 weeks cuz y not.

Unethical:

1. constantly arriving late, leaving early, getting her nails done on the clock
2. depression pills or something that make her arrive a mess, act like an unprofessional witch, goes home. even without pills, she had a mood cycle of 48 hours swinging between one extreme to the other
3. got in a drunk's face, while hugging him and leading him on in the months before. she took him to court and evicted him.
4. cheating on her husband with a contractor (who had helped her and her husband move out of their house after they started dating. which is sick btw) they constantly text, have private talks in her office a lot, and even use the office for cheating
5. cutting the cleaner's hours in half for the reason of ""easing company spending"", then hiring a full time cleaner secretly at $3/hr more than original cleaner. fired original cleaner a month later (Original cleaner needed the job to get rent credit because having a job meant SS wouldnt pay for her medicine. now she has to move to anywhere that will take her)
6. PM would have closed door meetings with MM for no discernible reason and then all of a sudden an employee would have a target on their back. Each the same rumors going around about laziness, drugs, and drinking on the job. spreading rumors about employees till she eventually felt she had a case to fire them. (7 total)
7. went through a resident's apartment while they were being carted away in an ambulance
8. tagged cars to be towed for expired tags when her's was expired by 6 months
9. scolds residents for drinking or other habits
10. constant closed door meetings with the MM, no reason for this
11. handles her personal renting business on company time
12. fires any employee that doesnt dote over her
13. so shallow that she will pretend to listen while the resident is talking with her, then as soon as they leave, PM starts saying any nasty thing she can think of
14. allowing MM to fire all employees and replace them with family members (no there isnt company policy against hiring family. we checked).

There's a list of so much more but Mama is on date night with Dad so Im not going to bother her to get me the list right now. I can edit this later with many more items for the list if it helps.

I told my mom to write a list of all the unethical/illegal things that both PM and MM were doing. To log them, record them, take pictures. All of it. From day one. Im a firm believer in protecting yourself and standing up for others who cant defend themselves. However mom is a sweet marshmallow and still hasn't learned that ""Benefit of the Doubt"" does NOT equal ""Maybe they won't do it for the 100th time"". She hates confrontation so she tried to just skate through it till it blew over. It didnt. Of course not. I sat and made a list with her, trying to convince her to take it to the BO to show him what was going on on his property. She kept saying ""soon"", till PM heard a rumor that Mom was trying to take her job (which Mom wasnt). PM fired her the same day. Mom called the BO crying, trying to ask for help. BO basically pushed her off saying 1) youre nothing but a disgruntled employee and anything you say is a lie and 2) i chose that manager so my name is on the line, PM cannot be a bad egg because that would mean i was wrong.

Mama and I are angry. Very angry. Evil people shouldn't win. Evil people don't get to just hurt people without consequence. I want to watch a witch burn. Mama was the only one standing in between PM and the residents. She cared for them, protected them, helped them. PM doesnt care about destroying any of their lives at a whim and BO keeps protecting her blindly. We're an At-Will state, and Ive been told its nearly impossible to protect your employment rights without a Union. However, they got Al Capone on tax fraud, there HAS to be a way to get this horrible witch on something, anything, to pay for her selfish cruelty.",11Mar2020,1
222,"I’m in my first year of a Master of Research in Ancient History, recent graduate from a Bachelor of Ancient History. In about 9 months I will start writing my 20K word thesis. This means that in the next few months I need to decide on a supervisor. I have been propositioned by two potential supervisors: John and David. 

Throughout my undergrad, John has taken me under his wing. He’s always been great for advice and has been an excellent market of my papers. He is who I originally planned to have as my supervisor, and he has been in agreement on this for about 2-3 years. John has spoken a lot about finding me paid work and connections etc. however this has never actually come to fruition (which is quite normal for my field, where paid work is very hard to come by). 

David came onto the scene about 8 months ago. i had performed well in a seminar that he was guest-hosting and he contacted me afterwards to see if I wanted to work as his Research Assistant on a casual basis for about 3 months (which I did). David’s work isn’t exactly related to my interests or original career plan, but I still find it very intriguing and could see myself working on it. He also has an *extremely* large amount of funding by my country’s research council and has also propositioned me about being my supervisor. The primary difference is that he has offered me an ongoing paid internship on his funded project, as well as travel and scholarship opportunities, as long as my thesis is related to his project. David is also the Associate Dean of Research for the Faculty of Arts at my university, which is home to the top ranked and largest Classics and Ancient History department in my country. He is, therefore, very well connected and respected. 

Work in history, as we all know, is very very limited, and I know I should take this employment and supervisorial proposition very seriously. I would love to take it, because it would lead to so many new and exciting international opportunities in the field. However, it isn’t exactly the topic I have a passion for, and I would feel terrible abandoning John, who has invested a lot in me. 

Any advice or help would be very appreciated!",11Mar2020,1
223,"So, just tonight, I was about to take a granola bar out of its cardboard box (completely packaged granolas), but I noticed something moving and I brought it to my mother. She dug all of the granolas out of the box individually to find a singular cockroach. I've looked around my room but I don't see anymore cockroaches. I've not seen feces or eggs. I had friends over just today, but if they have cockroaches im not aware of it. When I tried looking up about I kept seeing ""if theres one, theres a hundred/thousand"". I'd also like to make it clear I keep a cat and everything he needs (food, water, liter box) in my room. I wouldn't be shocked if they could live of my cat's feces, but I've never seen one in there either. I don't have much experience with cockroaches. I find this to be extremely alarming as I find any insect to be beyond terrifying, and I don't even want to sleep in my own room. What should I do about it? What's the likelyness of it just being a stray cockroach, or an actual infestation? I heard they aren't very shy, so wouldn't I have noticed them? I heard they tend to come out at night, unless there's always a light on. I keep a sort of lamp on during the night and it lights up the room (not super bright, but I can see everything clearly). The lamp is on the opposing side of the room from the cockroach. Given all this information, what do you think I should believe / and do?",11Mar2020,1
224,"When we made a netflix account all of our family agreed to split the cost between us, my sister payed the first few months and then never again, we've had it for 2 years now.

She's my dad's favorite so he never pushed her too much, and also, she's a very pushy, obnoxious person so even if he tried to she cut him off.

This week he asked again, this time in front of me and her answer was ""I have bills to pay, I can't pay netflix"" (it's 3 dollars per month mind you) I said ""if you can't afford it then don't have it"", she threw a fit and told me ""I live on my own, I pay rent, power..."".

I think even my dad is tired because he gave me permission to change the password, I did it and I kicked her out.

Now that I did it I feel very guilty, like I did something wrong.

I didn't gave anyone the password (I did log them in btw but nobody knows the password), so if she wants it she'll have to come to me.

I don't know how I was able to quit the nail biting habit so fast it was incredible and i was very proud, I probably quit within days. I remember that the nail art all these youtubers did were really cool to me and just like that, I was able to stop all because i was inspired to try nail art. This was all 3 years ago btw

Then the problem came back. I guess I can say i'm anxious and nervous very often, so the fidgeting from the stress came back in another form. I started picking the skin around my nail. Most of the time I don't realize i'm doing this until I finish picking, or when it starts hurting/or in uncommon cases it bleeds. When I was able to stop picking my cuticles for like maybe a week, I started picking my acne on my face and now I got some acne scars which is another problem I have to deal with :((

235,"(originally posted in r/teenagers)

Since Freshman year of high school, I thought I knew everything. I was going to go to College for biology, go to Med School, and after years of hard work, become an oncologist. But I've been realizing these last couple of months, I think my real dream and passion is to become a professional actor on Broadway. This may sound stupid af but ever since I started acting in these community and school shows I've been enthralled, I've daydreamed constantly about possibly being an actor, a singer, etc.

But I can't tell my family this, I've already been accepted into colleges for biology, I've told them I want to become a doctor. They've told me before that they were afraid I would want to be an actor but I always told them I knew I could never.

But as I have gotten older, and my days being able to do small time youth theatre have grown numbered, I think acting and singing is what makes me happiest. And I can't give it up.

While I'm not bad at singing or acting I just don't think I have what it takes to do it professionally, but I'm also afraid that a lack of passion will cripple my work ethic going into college and medschool and will leave me with a ton of debt and nothing to show for it. I do have a big interest in medicine, and being a doctor and treating and helping people. But I can't help but think I would be happier acting and singing. I don't exactly live in a good place to be an actor (Dallas) and my family would laugh in my face if I proposed moving to a place like LA or NYC.

I had two months to take the decision and until a couple of days ago, I was sure that taking a year off (to then decide if I should drop out for good) was the best possible idea. I wanted this year to explore my interests, work on my Instagram second-hand clothing shop to save money, get some filmmaking classes as it interests me a little bit, get better at digital illustration, etc. I do like many things but I have no idea what it is that I want to dedicate my life to.

244,"So, here is the context.

I am in my senior year of college in mechanical engineering and picked some extra classes to learn more yet I did not have to in order to graduate.

I was in a class that I was initially interested in and until the first week I liked the idea of it. 1 month and a half go by everyone I know including myself in the class absolutely hate it. My friend joined the class because I was in it and I told him about it. I did not tell him to do it, it was his choice like everyone else in the class. I dropped it the other day and it does not affect me at all academically, while it could for him if he does not pass. I already told him I am probably going to drop it and he said: ""please don't"".

I am the type of person that is very nice and feels bad for the slightest things such as dropping the class. I am starting to learn that I really should not because I did force anyone to join the class.

I am actually really pissed off because this same person is in another class of mine where we have to do lab work and I am the one who does most of the lab, usually all of the data analysis, and most of the write-up. He is only available usually one day on the weekend and it is usually at noon where I am working on it all weekend from 9 am in the morning to 5 pm. I was actually really pissed off this past weekend because we had to make a presentation and I did nearly everything and it took him 2 hours to do 2 slides out of 17. That had no plots or data analysis in it.

 This has been for 3 labs so far. We are senior engineers I do not know why some people act like this still.

Back to this other class I dropped, the homework requires a lot of time to do and usually myself and a few others always meet up to do it. I invite my friend but he never comes. Then he expects me to help him later on.

Today, when I was working on my senior design he asked if we could work on work in the class, I said I already dropped it. He then replied with ""Fuck You"" and walked away to talk to someone else that is in the class.

I am frustrated and feel like I am being stepped on by people like him and am going to lose my shit possibly the next time I see him.

This same friend has made me laugh a lot and I have known all throughout college. I have matured a lot through the years with being in the engineering work world and it has shown me that you won't make it if you mooch off others and you have to work hard. I am starting to think I should disassociate with people who act like this and mooch. But to whoever reads this I could seem like the asshole so I dunno.",11Mar2020,1

250,"I am twenty and my parents are sixty. My parents noticed a loss of life in me a few years ago. The full context of that is boring and pointless to cover here, but the main point to acknowledge is they feel they've done a poor job with me because I don't seem outwardly happy. I can't deny that I'm not an expressive person, but I do truly appreciate my parents and what they have done and continue to do for me. On both of their sides, we have histories of bad health and diseases, so I believe they're concerned about dying with regret regarding how they cared for me. I don't want that, so was curious how to tell them they've done well in a way that is meaningful and appears genuine. Spontaneously giving hugs and gifts would be incredibly disingenuous to them since I'm not expressive in that manner. I could also tell them, but that might not convince them either. I do help cook, clean, and help them both with their work when I've completed my own so they can have more free time, but I don't believe this is special and only mention it so nobody suggests them and assumes I'm leeching off of them. I contribute to maintaining the household as I should, however I'm asking for unexpected forms of appreciation. 

I realize that I could start trying manage my vulnerability and trust issues, but I'm not seeking that kind of advice. If you are someone that just isn't very emotionally expressive, I'd appreciate suggestions on how you show people they're appreciated.",11Mar2020,1

252,"Gonna try to keep this super short and straight to the point. I’m overweight and trying to get stronger, skinnier, and have more stamina. I workout 3 times a week. Mom, wed, fri. I try to do little exercises like yoga on off days but anyways. 

I started just walking at 3.0-3.5 mph no incline for 30 min and in the span of 2.5 months I upped it to a little workout that includes leg lifts, crunches, similar stuff. (I’ll go more detail if needed) and that usually takes 5-10 min and I break a small sweat. I go downstairs to the other part of the gym and use 2 weight lifting machines, 12 lbs and do 30-40 lifts (sets of 10) on each machine working my arms. Then I go to the tread mill and do incline 3.0 and 10 min of 3.0mph, 10 min of 3.5 mph, 5 min of 4.0 mph then go to incline 0 and each minute for 5 minutes lower the speed by 1.5. I then get to my car and go home, drink chocolate milk (usually abt 12 oz) and shower.

My question is; why when I’m on the treadmill do I get a headache, sometimes my front tooth hurts (?), and once my randomly I couldn’t hear out of my ear. And should I change my workout to fix this or work through the pain? 

I sweat a lot as I walk, and the headaches are always gone by the time I’m home, the ear thing and the tooth thing sometimes take a little longer. Also this has only happened 3-4 times.

My boyfriend, who won’t acknowledge me to family and friends, is Mormon. He goes to church, pays his tithes and is extremely enmeshed with his family and his ex wife’s family. I knew nothing about the religion when we began seeing each other. He refuses to talk to me about it. I know nothing about it. The things I learn (such as the founder being a known fraud) lead me to believe it’s a cult more than a religion. He “can’t” be with me until his children are grown, but his children are extremely sheltered and incapable of supporting themselves.

Regardless, I booked a trip to Japan with my girlfriend and her family scheduled for April 6, 2020.  I realize this was selfish and irresponsible, but it seemed like a rare opportunity. I spoke with my father (who is also my employer) and he agreed to let me go. 

Fast forward six months and we are facing the COVID-19 outbreak.  My father has been following the events very closely and he has decided to not let me go to Japan. Ultimately, its my choice, but I'm worried I'll lose my job and damage my relationship with him if I go through with this trip.  

All that aside, I'd feel very feel very guilty travelling at the moment. I'm not so much worried about my own health, but that of my friends' and their families. I've asked my party consider rescheduling for next year, but they are pretty set on leaving in April.

259,"Bit of a weird request but here goes.

Basically my life has been shit between my abusive family, multiple suicide attempts, and hardly caring about anything. Its been this way for the last 5-6 years. However, things seem to be taking a turn for the better. I got into all three colleges i’ve applies to, and I think I know what I want to to as a career. The next chapter of my life seems to have revealed itself. I thought It would be ending in a couple months at best, but their may be hope yet.

Anyway, my plan is to try to get as fat away from this hell I’ve been living, and I want a new start. I can’t do that living as who I have been. I want to be able to care about people. I want to be able to laugh without suddenly stopping. I want to not have to hesitate every time I come home, wondering if I should just start walking and not look back. I need to become someone else entirely. And I think that starts with a name

I think someone’s name is one of the most important things about them, and I want to have one that makes me happy when I hear people say it. The trouble is I’m a picky bitch and can’t decide, so I’ve come here looking for suggestions. I like the vibe of more fantasy-esc names, something that stands out, something that’s me.

269,"Ok, first off, I'm not some weirdo white person who cries reverse racism, I'm also not trying to virtue signal or any of that shit. I need a damn house to rent and I'm starting to suspect I will be stuck with thousands of dollars of tax refund in this cockroach slum house, but no place to go because I'm the only white person in my family, and people (white and black or whatever) seem to really give a shit about this in 2020, still.

I found a house, that takes cats, that we had proof of income requirements, and could easily afford. Messaged the realty company representing the property.

Was up front. Yes, I have a criminal record, it's non-violent and years old at this point. Is that ok? Yes.

I have cats, that's cool, right? Yes!

My credit score is meh, but I have a cosigner, is that cool? Yes! 

When can I see the property and fill out the application? Today? Sure!

I get there, and it was perfect. Not too nice, but my stepson (10) would have his own room, and we would have a nice little home for our kitties, kid, and us. It's got that ""private landlord"" feel, there's nothing but families on the block, they don't sell crack on the porch, and it's not next to a methadone clinic (sorry love u guys but there's...issues) like where we are now.

Dude gives me the application link and we spend $100 for us, and then like 15 bucks for the cosigner stuff. 

I don't hear ANYTHING. It's been two days, so I am contacting them later today (Wednesday).

Just cause I look shit up, I look up the property again 2 hours ago and lo and behold, it's still available.... but...

It states it was ""updated"" 1 day ago.

They lowered the rent by $100. Weird, right, when we totally agreed the price was the price, and were interested... why would they take a lower price when we would pay more?

Now it's no pets. That would've been nice to know, from the gate, because I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN HIT YOU UP dumbass!

And, magically, now they have apparently installed on-site laundry within 2 days, because it's listed as having it, but it was NOT there when I had the showing.

So now I'm heartbroken, trying to find a reason, when the thought occurs to me that the landlord saw my pasty-ass license picture, and then my partner's sexy chocolate ID, and was like oh hell no. 

Am I nuts? I'm in Philadelphia, which like most modern American cities, has gentrification on deck. There's a few black people I've known who basically get concerned when white people move in, they get pushed out, and I'm not convinced they are wrong in feeling that way. This property is in a neighborhood we lived in over a year ago (landlord sold that property and we had to move to this shithole which she also owns), and is predominantly black, except for me and one other white girl who was the only other white person I ever saw living there.

How do I ask this realty company if that's what happened, without sounding like an elitist twat Karen? I can sometimes be pretty biting with my IRL commentary, but at this point I just wanna know, for future reference, and knowing what to say and how to say it beforehand will help me not be such a sarcastic bitch. 

Am I missing something? I doubt this was some application scam, because I saw the property, and it's listed on multiple zillows and hot pads and whatnots.

272,"It was a Saturday morning, my husband daughter and I had just woken up. I was making breakfast, also his cousin was over , my husbands phone at the moment was not working so his phone was off, his cousins phone was off as well (battery) . When my husbands phone finally turned on (it takes a while to turn on) he had like a billion (literally) missed class from his mom and brother . He returned the calls, and they were mad at him ( he was supposed to go help his dad put concrete down and he never went). The first phone call he made was to his brother, his brother tells him why didn’t he wake up early to go help his dad that they’ve been waiting.. and he tells him his phone is not working and blah blah.. next he calls his phone and she says why didn’t you come your dad is always helping you out and you never want to come and help him.. He makes another phone call to his brother and his brother tells him he called his cousin earlier to wake up my husband so they can both go and help but cousin never came to knock at the door.. we were supposed to go to a surprise party for my husbands uncle, and before the incident happened my husband told me he didn’t want to go because they were going to be talking S$/) to him and his cousin (understandable). So later in the afternoon he got a message from his dad stating “pinche mierda” which translates to “piece of shitt” . He didn’t reply. So after a few hours my husband decided to call his dad, and they were arguing. My husband, cousin and I were in the living room and my husband had him on speaker. So mind you we can hear him.. his dad starts yelling at him saying that he’s going to come pick up my husbands truck and he basically was just mad.. and out of nowhere he mentions me but in a rudely way, he says “your stupid ass wife” but I’m Spanish I got so mad and talked back to him. My husband just hangs up. And then we were all just so shocked. My husband is mad at that moment and calls his brother because he thinks his brother had something to do with it too, and starts yelling at him, and then later my husbands tells him I’m not going to be around for a while and I’m not taking my daughter so y’all can see her... then hangs up. I’m guessing now he told his mom, and the mom calls my husband and asks what happen and he tells her. And she’s like well I wasn’t there I didn’t hear anything (and I’m like you don’t have to be there to know that’s wrong for your husband to say) . So we definitely end up not going to the surprise party. About two days later , my husband is now not talking to his brother or dad. Just to his mom and she keeps telling him to talk to his brother that he never got in a fight with his brother before.. and my husband has her on speaker so I can hear everything she says. she then mentions , “don’t ever fight with your family because of a woman” . That got me so pissed. A few days later he decides to talk to his brother once again, and he tells him that they need to start respecting me and to his mom as well. (There’s history behind) for the few days he started talking to his brother his brother and girlfriend start telling my husband that he needs to talk to his dad again, and start telling him what if something happens to dad or to you and y’all never talk again... my husband calls his mom and they talk for a few minutes and he then tells her again that they need to respect me, because I am his wife and that his dad needs to apologize to me for what he said and she replies your dad is not going to apologize you now that so don’t even tell him and he hangs up.

273,"Hi Reddit, 

I’m 20 years old &amp; I’m easily in the obese category. Obviously it’s not something I’m proud of/like to advertise and I’ve tried for years to lose weight and most of the time I’d do well, only to gain it back, if not more. I’m currently at the highest I’ve ever been and I can easily attribute that to a simple lack of self control/over eating. I don’t even eat junk food. It’s just eating too much. But my eating habits contribute to how I managed to get so big. 

Now, my mum always brings up how she asks me to exercise with her but “I never do” and she’s even tried to blame that on the reason she drinks. Mind you, she’s an alcoholic so that’s on her and not dealing with her own issues. We used to go on walks every weekend but now she works on saturdays and on Sunday, she’s already drunk before I’m awake so we can’t exactly “go out and exercise together”. Basically she makes me feel bad for not exercising with her but it’s not like she’s a fitness person at all. She never exercises by herself. 

Today, my dad prepositioned how maybe we should both walk to pick up my sister from school cause that’s exercise and it’s good for us. Like, I know he means well but it’s just my mindset of feeling like they’re looking down on me for not being smaller. Like I struggle with my weight personally and when I do try to be healthier, they never support me. Like I wanted to convert a spare room to an exercise room but they never agreed despite me offering to buy the necessities for it. So it feels like it’s “on our terms you can be fit/healthy or else nothing” but currently I’ve just been low and not mentally ready/motivated to do anything in regards to controlling my weight. 

Any advice on how I can bring this up to them without somehow offending them? I know being healthier will do me good, I know the benefits etc, but it’s just tiring sometimes and I will try to go on those walks with my dad on my off days from studying, but how can I try to get more actual support from them cause exercising is one thing but it’s all about diet/a healthy environment and if nothing changes in regard to that, it feels hopeless, if that makes sense?

High school was better but I still got treated like crap and was always blamed for stuff I didn't do. Literally even people with leprosy got treated better than I have all my life.  I even had a personal stalker at my high school who even admitted to stalking me. When senior year came I was so excited for college. I occasionally run to people from my past and realized just how fake they are. Like even the so called ""nice ones"" talked to me weird, gave me weird looks, and when I am genuinely nice or try and be friendly and reconnect their expressions seems like ""with you? lmfaooo no. You're not even worth my presence"". People removed me from social, avoid me (even one girl I used to get along with became so fake later on). Even a guy friend I used to be close with no longer has anything to do with me ever since he started dating some chick/his now wife.

I have gone out of my way to make sure people are fine, I have listened to their problems, and etc...I am always friends to people but nobody is ever a friend to me.. I don't say this to brag but rather to prove a point. I have gotten much happier through out the years but I still feel like it's a trend.

280,"i broke up with my best friend. that’s a weird way of saying this, but it’s true. let’s go back to the beginning. 

the person i called my “best friend” was also my roommate for two years. let’s call her Polly. Polly grew up in a christian-ish household, felt called to ministry as a worship pastor, and lived life as she saw fit. she had her fair share of hurts and falls, but in my eyes she was a human who understood me better than any other person at this point. she had always been stand-off-ish on the fact that i called her my best friend or even considered her like a sister. now, fast forward three years of knowing each other and going through a lot. 

last September Polly and I went to a Jonas Brothers concert. i paid for the tickets because her boyfriend of two years had just broken up with her/cheated on her/got another girl and she was heartbroken. after graduating college Polly moved about 5 hours away from where i was living so it wasn’t easy to see her. we ended up facet timing or video chatting literally everyday. but i’m not sure what happened to us after the concert. she was hurting and i tried to be there for her as any friend would, tried to console her, get her to see her worth, etc. we went to the concert and everything seemed okay.

long story short, after the concert Polly stopped talking to me. it slowed down at first, and i knew she was having a hard time with her ex getting with another girl (she really cared deeply for him) and i tried to be understanding. but over time, she stopped opening my texts/snaps/etc. she’d be on social media like nothing ever happened but would refuse to respond to me. all i wanted was to help her get out of the dark place she was in. is that wrong??

so since november, Polly has completely dropped me like a hot potato and my heart hurts. i’ve tried giving her space but i keep clinging onto this dead relationship like it’s going to revive. (short background story: my bio mom was a drug dealer/abandoned me to do illegal things &amp; my dad died when i was 13, my best friend died when i was 14, another close friend died when i was 17, my uncle died when i was 19, another close friend died when i was 20, and my uncle just recently passed away). when i love someone i love them with everything that i have. that i don’t want them to hurt. to go without. to fee alone. i know i have issues with relationships since i feel like i’ve lost so many people close to me. if you have read this far (surprisingly) and didn’t notice, i do have severe depression and severe anxiety. and my dishes haven’t been washed since november. i let this situation rule me and my life. to the point where i would wake up late for my 2p-10p shift at work. staying in bed on a sunday rather than going to church because my depression/anxiety has me glued to my bed. so to better help my severe depression/anxiety, i decided to say goodbye to a relationship that i was allowing to hurt me (i’ve never done this before).

i sent Polly a letter. i told her how much i love her, how proud i am of her and how i can’t keep dragging along this friendship anymore—i need to do this for me. i cried for hours. i even had a trusted friend from church read it and say if it was selfish or not. it was approved and so i mailed it. and her father posted on her wall (about a week after i mailed the letter—so she had to of gotten it at this point) that she doesn’t need “insecure control freaks” and “jealous girl ‘friends’” taking up her time. 

please, did i do the wrong thing? did i focus too much on myself and not enough on Polly? was i being ignorant of her feelings? i am constantly thinking of these things. that i care too much about Polly’s response to my letter (which, i don’t think she’ll even acknowledge).... someone please give me advice. 

i feel like not a lot of people i know understand my heartache about this. i loved Polly on a familial level—as close as one of my real sisters. she knows things most of my family doesn’t know, she was there for me when i needed someone. am i just too clingy to people? no matter their gender/relationship woth me, am i too clingy to all of the people in my life? whether it be my youth pastor, sister, brothers girlfriend, cousin, old high school classmate who messaged me, etc. is this so bad?? i don’t know. if anybody bothers to read this, i’d be grateful for some advice about how to get through this. 

thanks.

282,"I am a recent college graduate (May 2019) and I still currently work at a grocery store. I have applied for full time jobs at better companies but still no luck. I really do not like my job, and have wanted to quit for a while. I also am in a relationship with a higher up employee and it’s starting to cause issues that I never intended to cause (I planned on having a better job a long time ago). Today things sort of blew up with my direct manager and I told her I would leave my two weeks on her desk for her in the morning. Me and my direct manager have a pretty good relationship, but people have been coming to her with suspicions about me and my boyfriend (although we have not been open about anything). I am still applying for jobs but do not currently have even an interview anywhere yet. I now am second guessing my decision and don’t know whether I should actually put in my two weeks, if I should transfer to a different location(which would lead to me working a somewhat lower level position), or if I should stick it out in my current position and hope I can find a better job fast. I am so lost at what to do at the moment. I want to quit but rationale tells me not to. Would I be completely screwing myself over to quit and potentially be unemployed before finding a new job?

Any help is highly appreciated.",11Mar2020,1
284,"I’m gonna offer some context to help this make sense:

I started a job in a major city a year ago. It’s at a mid-size hotel, and it required all of us to be flexible with shifts (i.e. I was hired for front desk but was required to know and hold multiple positions within the hotel). It’s been a lot and, because hospitality runs on seniority, I’ve been getting the crappy shifts for the better part of the year. (Which I knew coming into it, so I don’t mind mainly doing PMs.)

We currently have 4 people on leaves of absence right now for health-related issues and injuries. Because of this, we’ve all had to adjust our schedules a bit and help out where needed. During this time, we also hired 4 new people, 3 of whom now have lower seniority than me.

The most recent person to go on a LOA was injured and will be out for several months, and she was our main overnight person. The girl who’s been doing overnights 2 times a week (for when our main O/N woman was off) has been doing them 5 nights a week now to cover for Main O/N Woman. This seemed fair because this girl has lower seniority than me and has the most experience with O/N shifts.

Now when I was hired, I told them that the one thing I couldn’t do was overnights. I live over an hour away and use public transportation, and since I live in the suburbs, the commuter train’s schedule is ALL messed up. It makes doing overnight shifts very difficult and requires me to sit downtown for 2 hours prior to a shift and 1 hour after a shift doing nothing; this changes to 3 hours and 2 hours, respectively, on weekends. But because of this sudden injury and change to our schedule, I agreed to do overnights 2 times per week, every other week, until the other 2 new people are trained and can take over.

Well, the guy splitting over nights every other week with me can no longer do them. So now I was told I have to do 2 nights a week, every week, for the foreseeable future (probably until June). And work currently has no plans to train the other 2 new people on overnights.

I’m always willing to take whatever is thrown at me and be a team player, so I KNOW that’s why they aren’t concerned about training the new people asap because they assume I won’t complain. They’re giving me a week’s schedule where I work AM, PM, mid-shift, AND overnight all in the same week. It’s very hard NOT to complain about that.

I have a slew of mental health issues (including anxiety, depression, and a panic disorder) that are triggered by a lack of sleep, and my depression and panic attacks have been so awful since doing overnights that I’ve been legitimately suicidal. I feel like an asshole going to HR and pulling a “mental health” card (I HATE using my mental health as an excuse for anything), but I genuinely don’t know how I can handle another 2-3 months of overnights every week given how it fucks up my sleep schedule (due to the weird commute). 

Does anyone have any advice on how to appropriately bring this up with my managers without seeming like I’m not a team player?",11Mar2020,1
285,"Before I get into it I just want to say we are on good terms. We still send each other stuff on Instagram and share pictures of our pets. And talk about everyday life now and then. 

But i don’t think we’re best friends anymore. She and I used to be inseparable. To the point where I lived with her and her family for almost two years. It was closer to my job so I rented a room from them. Flash forward to last year. I got a boyfriend. The friend group I met through my best friend decided they didn’t like him so they basically all stopped talking to me. My best friend and I made up but it’s clear that the relationship isn’t what it used to be. Since then we’ve stopped talking once more for a few days but again made up. Keep in mind both times we made up because I reached out to her. Which leads to my point. She never asks to hang out. It’s always me asking if she wants to get breakfast or dinner or something along those lines. I don’t mind asking but after a while it kind of makes me feel like she doesn’t really care about hanging out. I know she still likes me but something is missing. Every year the friend group would go on a trip to celebrate my best friend’s anniversary with her now fiancé. The anniversary thing was just a convenient excuse to go on a trip. This year I didn’t get an invite. Didn’t even know anything about it except for them posting on social media. It hurt a bit because I’m always trying to include her in everything I plan. 

I know we’re drifting apart and I’m trying to make peace with it but it’s so hard. I don’t want to accept it. I even got us tickets to go to two concerts later this year in hopes that it would rekindle our friendship but nothing has come of it yet. I just don’t see how we can go from her saying she wants me to be her maid of honor and how we’ll be best friends until we’re old to her barely initiating contact. 

I’m terrified to start this whole friend thing over. How do I come to terms? How do I let go?",11Mar2020,1
286,"
 I hate that I have to be alone, it has taken pretty much all of my motivation away. It’s so hard to see the point in trying to excel or do really anything when I know that I’ll have nobody to share that experience with. Who cares if I finish my degree? I’ll still have an apartment with nobody to come home to, dinner alone, sleeping alone, holidays alone, nobody to care about me. I’m just tired of trying to convince myself that there’s some sort of pay off for trying hard when it’s become very obvious that there’s not. I try talking to women all the time, I don’t say creepy things and I really try to get to know them. They seem to enjoy it until I mention something non platonic like watching a movie or hanging out, after that I can tell it makes them so uncomfortable so I just stop. I feel so bad after these encounters, I hate being such a burden on people.

I can’t deal with it sober anymore. I have drank every night this week and before that I smoked every night for the 3 weeks before it. Even right now I’m not sober, I’m drinking more after I finish this post. I just want to matter to someone, I couldn’t give a fuck less about sex. I’d be so cool with dating someone who was ace or anything g like that. But it looks to me like any woman with any respect for themselves would aspire to find someone better than me and I can’t blame them. I am so ugly that I can’t feel surprised or bitter when they reject me, it’s to be expected. 


Smoking and drinking are the only things that keep me alive at this point. I don’t even plan long term anymore, I know that after I graduate and maybe a year or so goes by I’ll end it. My friends and their girlfriends are all making plans to move across the country and start their lives, I’ll just be here alone. I can’t do that, I’d rather not go through 40-50 years of more empty disappointments. 

What can I do to give myself a chance? I just want to make myself worth someone’s time and commitment. I seriously would do anything. I’ve already tried losing weight, 80 pounds down and no results. I’ve bought new clothes, I have a car, I have a job, I have good social skills, I am in college, what more can I do to offset being so repugnant?",11Mar2020,1
287,"So my (now former) friend is a massively egocentric ""fuck it all"" kinda dude. He has 2 cats and a fish in his house (not spayed or neutered, no shots, never changed litter box, fed scraps that fall on floor) his amazingly sweet girlfriend who is wayyyyy too good for him, who accepts his bullshit.

To set the scene on why we arent friends
I had a drug problem and someone who i let move in threatened to report me to the police for possession.
I asked if i could stay at their house for a couple days as i have done the same for them. He said yeah and i got all packed up (no drugs as i had been trying to quit) to go to his house. I was all packed and waiting for my uber 15 minutes away and he said
 ""nvm i wanna be alone""
So i said ""alright ig""
Not 45 minutes later one of his friends he ""doesnt talk to"" was at his house, doing drugs.




The abuse--
They smoke weed and blow it at the cats eyes and ears
They never change the litter box
They rarely feed the cats 
The cats arent neutered and one of them hasnt ever been in heat (idk if that matters)

2) happen after a success. so if im productive for a couple hours at work, ill start patting myself on the back and then start fucking around, even if i have other work to complete. ill post something on social media that i regret in a couple hours (like, why the fuck did i post an IG story of my trip to starbucks like people care???).

I wanted to walk with my friend and we’re literally neighbors.

303,"Okay, long story short, I joined a random intramural team so I would be doing something active but also something I enjoyed.

The two of them definitely get along better, but I’m also super awkward and could just be reading too far into things. Basically, I think they’re cool and would totally like to hangout with them more outside of this intramural team.

304," Hey guys, I´m 18, I live in a big metropolis with more than 6M people, I have a financial life way better than most of world people (even being from an Emergent Country), and even with all this, I feel a lot of the time lonely.

 And the problem is that different from most of people that say ''I feel lonely, even with people around'', I really don´t have basically anyone besides my family and one friend (who has his friends too, so it´s not always that I can go out with him).

 Just to put some context, I will make a quick explanation on how I came to here.

My childhood : Real normal, was a popular kid, always had a lot of friends  and was a happy kid.

From 15 to 16 years : I wasn´t that happy anymore, especially cuz I was suffering with depression, but at the same time, that my life in house was terrible and boring, I was LOVING to go out with friends. And then I met some people, I began to drink and some months after smoking weed. In this time I had like more than 5 real friends, and a lot of other colleagues.

17 to 18 : What changed? Idk for sure, but in a moment, I decided to quit smoking, and I stopped gradually to talk to most of that friends. And from this time to here, I am a totally different person, it´s like, i few myself unhappy but I few like I am more ''awake''/being who I really am. 

For example, when I go to parties with this friend, always a go asks about me, If I am single, and most of the time, I picked up a lot of girls. But this changed. Not the girls, but me, I justo don´t see the point of picking up a girl just to ''be cool'' or simply to kiss. I decided that I only like to pick up girls that I found attractive AND i like the personality. The same with friends (without the attractive part).

 The problem is, that at the same time I just want to be a friend of person who I and he/she really like me, I feel lonely especially because of that.

 I am not the guy that just can´t pickup girls and this stuff. I always was the ''handsome one from the group'', I am welcomed and people like me everywhere I go, I am smart, I like myself. But the problem is that I don´t like most of people (don´t get me wrong, I treat everyone well, and this type of stuff), but most of time I just have to pretend that I am interested in their story, that I understand some ''typical teen problem'' and this type of things.

 I like my family and this one great friend. So I feel lonely a good part of time.

We’ve hung out multiple times at my brothers house and we get along really well; even to the point where I picked up that she may like me. Tonight my brother called me and told me that Jane secretly does like me, and he wants me to date her because of the qualities I mentioned before. He even went as far as to say he was gonna “make it happen”. Now, this is where things get complicated. Jane’s ex is also a mutual friend of ours who goes way back (John). I don’t know what compelled my brother to want me to date her given that John is still very much so in our friend group. The situation I’m faced with now is WHAT action to take, and HOW to step across this minefield without hurting Jane, my brother, or John. I’m afraid if I don’t pursue her my brother will be angry with me for hurting her feelings, and it would ruin our friend dynamic. On the flip side, honor is absolutely crucial to me regardless of how attracted I am to this girl. I’d feel so wrong dating a girl that one of my close friends was with, especially behind his back.

I love where I grew up and have a lot of family and friends there. I have always known I wanted to move back at some point and recently decided now's the time.  I have moved around alot since graduating from University and currently live in Paris France. It has been a wonderful place to live but my initial feelings about where I grew up and it's long term plans in my life have never changed.  

I decided it's time to move back about a year ago and am planning to move when my lease ends this June and am really excited about it.  I look forward to being closer to family and lifelong friends and working toward some longer term goals.  

There is also an old and really close friend that I started hooking up with regularly when I  go home and have developed feelings for.  We have been friends for about a decade and share a friend group which makes me a little nervous but I'm excited to see where this might go but also recognize I'm in the middle of a big transition and maybe I should hold off on any romantic relationship for the time being.  

The combination of this big life move and the relationship with my close friend has made me really forward focused right now on next steps in my life. I feel like this excitement is making me rush and feel alot of anxiety.  I worry that I'm going to ruin my friendship and manage this overall life transition badly.  How can I manage this process so I don't mess up my life",11Mar2020,1
317,"I recently transferred to a small-sized private Catholic (Diocesan) school in the Philippines due to my Dad’s job. It has about a population of 3000 students, and is your typical rural private High School, except that it is near a church.

Now, not bragging or anything but I have been a constant honor student and I almost always top my classes, not because I’m smart, but I work really hard.

Here’s the shitty part:

I always noticed that the school principal always seem to glare at me whenever I pass by him. I just thought he was grumpy or had a bad day etc. He was always rude to me and my friends, when he does his daily “rounds” of walking around the campus. 

I have an absolutely nice teacher, let’s call him Mr. H, who is always kind to me. One day, Mr. H told me that the school principal has talked to him about giving me consistent high grades. Apparently, I was on my way on being the batch valedictorian, but the principal doesn’t want it to happen because I’m a transferee. Apparently, it would ruin the school’s reputation if a newly transferred student defeated the “old” top student (Let’s call her O)

I also have noticed that my grades in essays and written reports were also significantly lower, and my other teachers seem to be a bit guilty when handing me my graded works. I also noticed that “O”, receives special reviewers and incentives for being hardworking and kind. Whenever she gets the highest score, she is immediately exempted in the next examination. When I get the highest score, I get nothing.

I don’t want the Valedictory title. I just want to get what I deserve for working hard.

 I know that I’m not that intelligent, but I know that I sometimes score significantly higher than “O”. Mr. H has already told me that the principal is guilt tripping him for not caring about the school’s reputation.

TL;DR: The school principal is pulling some strings to prevent me from getting high grades.",11Mar2020,1
318,"So. I’m a 30 y/o male, I live with my parents due to lingering health reasons. Long story short, I’ve had two brain surgeries. I want to move out and be more independent and have my own space. My parents are vehemently against that idea, so much so that they are threatening to take my property away, my truck, phone, and dog, if I do so. The phone is on there plan, but I paid for it. The truck is in my name, and financed through me. The dog is also registered in my name.

319,"I got a new cat for emotional support.  I've had dogs all my life but I can't have one where we live. 

My gf has two cats already. They're both 4. My new cat is 3 and he was adopted by me last week. 

Now I work third shift and both my gf and roommate are asleep at normal times. When I'm at work, my cat Jax is free to roam the apartment. I sleep during the day between Saturday and Tuesday, so I make sure to pet him and play with him when I can. 

So here's the frustrating part: Jax is a bit of an attention seeker, so when I'm not home he goes to my gf and roommate and cuddles with them. Doesn't seem unnatural to me since he's a bit of a chonk and likes to cuddle. My gfs cats have done the exact same thing. He'll meow at them for attention and food, just like he does to me. He brushes up against them, just like he does to me. He cuddles with them. You get the picture. 

I'm upset because I feel like Jax really likes me and comes to me whenever he needs something. It only feels natural for him to go to them when I'm not home. I'm also not directly in the vicinity of my gf and roommate when I'm giving jax attention or playing with him. He sometimes goes to them when I'm home too, but I never neglect him. He always gets some cuddles and a kiss, and if it's time, food and treats.

The very thought that, despite pushing back on these negative vibes, they will always be there is enough to off myself, but I’m afraid. 

Everyone says time is the best for the situation I’m in... But the only thing I’m becoming more comfortable with is the thought of dying a peaceful, clean death.

322,"So I’m 18 and in my first year of college so I’m financially dependent on my parents. The issue is that my parents are pretty much separated but won’t get a divorce even though they are both well off financially. I don’t really have a relationship with my father since he doesn’t see value in forming an emotional connection with his kids and is the one I blame for my family falling apart do to his constant verbal abuse to my mother and his disgusting session of watching porn in the living room without a care in the world of who is around. So I have always sided with my mom since she broke down once and told be of all the cheating my father did before I was born. Now, last week my mom left her phone unlocked and I saw her texting sexually explicit stuff to another man. Things I could never imagine a “mom” saying. So she was now cheating. So i have slowly began distancing myself the same way I have distanced myself from my father since I was 12 by talking to her less and just being away from her.

tldr: Both of my parents are behaving like they are divorced, but remain together even though they are financially stable by themselves. Both my parents have/are cheating on each other.

So I need advice on what I should do in my situation. I know it’s their problem but it’s beginning to mess with me mentally because every time I see them laugh with my siblings or hang out with my friends all I see are cheaters and not my parents. All I want to do now is graduate from college and get a job, become financially independent and move far away as I can from them. I’m just so confused, disgusted and uncomfortable since I have taken pride in being able to have a good grip on my emotions, but for the first time since I was 7 I’m feeling so many things and don’t know how to release it.

323,"To start, I am a D2 collegiate athlete. I ran cross country in the fall, against my will really. To compete a team needs 5 people, and a lot of people left the year prior and in the summer, so they slotted me in the last spot. Indoor track went terrible, my times haven’t gotten better since junior year of high school (freshman in college now.) I am faking an injury right now, but because I just simply don’t want to run. I lost motivation that I will get any better in my respective events, so I kind of am giving up. The college is giving me a pretty decent amount of scholarship, so it’s a reason I want to keep running. I know I have potential on the track, I ran a really good time my Junior year, but haven’t gotten any better since even with plenty of work. I have lost contact with most of my friends from high school, except one that I occasionally play Xbox with. I don’t really ever want to go to class, even though I know I am smart, I have always gotten good grades even in the first semester. I don’t have much money, either, which doesn’t help when I’m hungry. The only thing I have going for me is my lovely girlfriend. I just feel hopeless and don’t know what to do.

324,"Quick background to set context about why I’m so upset: ever since I can remember, my father has been a heavy marijuana user (basically every night he will smoke a joint or use a bong). He once promised me he would cut back and try and quit. He never has. I hate this part of him and feel that it was affected our relationship my whole life. 
A few years ago, I found out that my mom had secretly been smoking cigarettes. I discovered her hiding out at a family party smoking and was seething. At the time I thought it was just a one time thing (she used to smoke before I was born), but she told me later it has been going on for awhile. I was literally furious, telling her how could she do this when she knows how much I hate smoking and that father does it. We had a big fight but made up our relationship in time. 

My parents generally don’t have a great relationship. The tension is always high in the house and I spend most of the time I’m not at work either in my room or just out of the house at the gym or wherever else. 
I’m not proud of this, but earlier today I snooped in my mom’s phone at texts between the two of them...there was nothing really there, so I looked at messages from her friend. Again, I’m not particularly proud, but please don’t judge me. In these texts, I found a message from my mom telling her friend she had “run out of smokes” but didn’t want to go and buy a pack cause she thought she might smoke them all. I am so upset. I know I brought this upon myself. But I would like some opinions on how (if at all, though I would really prefer to so I can hopefully help her quit) I can talk to her about this without admitting I snooped. Last time she was smoking I found a lighter in her purse which I thought was odd at the time but didn’t think much of it (it later made sense). I’m not sure if maybe I look in there again and see if there’s a lighter, and then can mention it casually when I go to get something from her purse (which I sometimes do). 
Any advice would really be appreciated, judgement, not so much - I know what I did was wrong. Thanks :)",11Mar2020,1

326," 

I've had a friend(both 17m) for two years in high school we'd hang out with each other every day during lunch and chat and play games with each other online after school, he even paid me money to win him stuff in for honor. Recently I've finished all my credits and I haven't been at school in two months so I haven't seen him in person then but we'd usually continue chatting throughout until recently. Maybe every one or two days we'd chat about things but we've only said one thing last week. I tried messaging him today but he's not responding to my message.

Before all this happened he said he's been playing GTA with a friend. I think he probably just replaced me with whoever that is. I sent him a message some hours back and he still hasn't replied he's not even doing anything he just jumps back on with the friend and ignores. If this is true then it looks like I literally have no friends he was my only and my best but it looks like I'm alone now.

327,"Is it wrong of me to feel a bit insecure and somewhat upset after seeing my boyfriend’s comment calling another girl cute? I make it very clear whenever I’m with him (or even over text) that I think my boyfriend is the most handsome, seiest, most beautiful &amp; attractive person I’ve ever laid eyes on/met— inside and out. I’d think it would be a bit insensitive to compliment the pretty appearance of other girls (whether we’re in each other’s presence or not). Just that fact that I saw it written down is what’s throwing me off I guess. It kind of hurt. I don’t think I’m overreacting... I hope, anyway. Makes me wonder if he’s starting to lose interest in me physically. 😞 I’ve been going through a lot mentally and as such, have put on a little weight around the stomach due to immersing myself completely in work and school. Whenever we’re togther he acts perfectly fine, but... to see this kind of blindsided me a little. 

DISCLAIMER: I wasn’t actively seeking out his comments on Reddit in a stalker type fashion. I just happened to see in my newsfeed that he’d recently commented on a post in a subreddit that I also follow, so i decided to take a look. I hadnt seen this post yet either, after all. Wanted to see what the fuss was about. When I open it up, it’s a selfie of a girl, clearly seeking attention with overdone makeup and goth-style/emo clothing. None of which, I wear. This is on the “Roast Me” subreddit, by the way. So... if he comments “Even though this is supposed to be a roast... she’s cute, ngl”, what would be your first thought? Maybe it’s me being a little jealous. But it still also hurt my esteem a bit seeing that. I would hope that if he had some concerns or was unhappy with something about my appearance, that he would say so and I would make an effort to change that. *sigh*",11Mar2020,1
328,"Hi everyone, I have a friend that moved from the UK (where I live) to Amsterdam two years ago, and she's been asking me to visit ever since. Due to a breakup, and moving house, I've had a pretty rough time over the past couple of years and only recently been in a position to take her up on her offer and finally give myself a break away.

I booked the flights and hotel late last year, and I'm due to fly this weekend, but now with the Coronavirus spreading, is this really a good idea? 

The Netherlands is similar to the UK in number of cases, so I'm not traveling to a level 1 or 2 area, but people are worried about the contact with so many travelers at the airport. I have family members (that I'm living with) with weak immune systems, and coworkers that I worry I'd be putting at risk when I get back. My family have said not to worry, and just go and have fun, but people I work with I can tell wouldn't want me returning to work (potentially ill/carrying COVID-19).  

I can't afford two weeks off work to self isolate when I return, but I could possibly do one week, and watch out for symptoms?

Half the people I speak to say to just go as the government/WHO don't have any restrictions on the Netherlands, but the other half say that they would cancel the trip if they were me. That would be £500+ lost for nothing, as my insurance doesn't cover this.

333,"I am 19 years old and I have an issue with letting go. I tend to dwell on things in a negative light to the point where it interferes with my day to day thinking. My mind tends to grab onto things and not let go. 

My negativity issues have gotten a LOT better and as a result- I’m a lot happier. I’m coming to terms that people’s reactions to things might not be exactly how I want it to be, which is okay and normal. Trying to look at the cup half full instead of empty, and things like that. 

However, I have an issue with knowing someone thinks something false about me. Here is the situation I am dealing with:

I just got back from a vacation with 6 friends and my boyfriend. One of his guy friends said I was flirting with him, which is not true. This guy who we will call “C” and I never really talked a lot prior to this trip, but during it we were laughing, joking and picking on each other. It was all in good fun. C was drunk/high most of the time, where I was sober. I know I didn’t flirt, and my boyfriend knows I didn’t flirt. C got kinda flirty with me in which I recoiled from, but honestly didn’t think anything of it.

Ever since I heard he told our friend group that, I’ve been so sad and annoyed. I’m not a confrontational person and I don’t think it’s worth a confrontation, but I’m hurt and I hate knowing my reputation is being questioned.

I know it’s so small, but I can’t stop thinking about it! This happens with many different situations, and I always get into a hole thinking about it.

We got really close, especially the past two months we lived together.

We spent a lot of time together and it’s always been fun. Basically every moment we’re in the apartment at the same time we spend hanging out. 

However, during spring break this week, we haven’t talked and now he’s ghosting next. I lent him some money this week since he was short on cash and that’s basically the only time he contacted me.

So, i fold the clothes when i see them on the bed, i wash the dishes when im told its my turn, and i vacuum when im told to. Apparently its not good enough to just do what im told or what i see in front of me. My mom tells me, if you see the bathroom is dirty, clean it! If you have time, sweep the floor! How am I, a teen who is forgetful, supposed to remember to do these and check for these? How do i know if the bathroom is dirty or when it was cleaned last? It looks clean, but she says its dirty? 

Is it so wrong that i need her to tell me to do things or i wont do them? Its not like ill say no when she tells me to. Is it bad that i forget if the clothes are in the dryer? Dont many other teens forget these things? 

I've never forced these responsibilities on my mom, if she tells me to do it i will. I have a social life, and homework to attend to, and things to stress about. Am i supposed to be the one who remembers every little chore that should be done and do it? 

I get it that my mom has a lot on her plate as well, but she yells at me out of nowhere and it both hurts my head and annoys me. I know how stressful life is firsthand, so i wouldn't yell at her for not doing a little thing i didn't even tell her to do.

I'm so lost and alone and I have nobody in my life to turn to. I don't know how I let everything get so terrible. My car breaks down several times a day and none of the mechanics know what's wrong with it.

The universe is testing me but I'm failing all her tests. Help? I'm terrified.",11Mar2020,1
344,"I hate saying the word. I hate it. I grew up happy and had a great childhood. I know that it could have been worse, but lately it is coming back to me. I was about 8 or 9 and I was growing up along side my older brother. I grew up more developed, and I had boobs at a very young age. 

It started small. He ( my brother) would try to touch me. He would make it a game, and I would say stop. And he did. Then later it would be more. Once we were sitting and I was forced to touch him and he kept saying it was okay. 

I told my mom about it and the situation was confronted, and she chalked it up to being expiremental and it stopped. Now I’m 19 and I think about it a lot. I have a great relationship with my brother and I don’t know if he even remembers it. I don’t want to ask him about it because I worry that my family dynamic would be changed.

But she also said she needs more time because she didnt fell in love with me because she wanted it to happen. „Maybe its still coming and i dont want stop seeing you“ is what she said and kisses me holds my hand etc.

On the other hand, she said she doesnt want to be exclusive and only hadnt sex with others because not to hurt me.

351,"Sorry if this is too long! One of my best friends (Rose) in a group of 4 of us has been a bit unresponsive to all of us for a few months now &amp; I’ve found out a lot things have been going on and today was particularly tough for her. I want to do something (either just myself or all of our group) for her to make her feel better or even just loved and supported.

A month or so ago, Rose told me that her boyfriend’s hours had been drastically dropped at work and she had to pick up a second job (on top of full time study) to make rent. At the time I anonymously sent her a Lush gift box to give her an excuse to take some time for herself &amp; relax on one of her very few days off. She really appreciated it but I’m not sure it’s right for this situation.

Yesterday Rose got badly injured at a social sports event &amp; has had to take a week off work (casual employee so no sick leave) and uni or risk damaging the issue permanently. As well as that, today she had to put one of her cats down after a few weeks of knowing he had end stage cancer. These cats were strays hanging around her apartment building until she moved in and took them in, they both mean so much to her.

I live interstate and I can’t get the time off work to visit at the moment but I wish there was something I could do. I’ve told her I’m here for her and we have a call scheduled tomorrow for her to vent or cry or distract herself. I’ve also told Rose how much better she made this cat’s life and how the last year of his life was his best because of all the love and care she gave him.

I’ve messaged our friendship group (friends since high school) and we’re trying to come up with something special to show her we love her and care for her. I would also like to hear any special ways anyone has memorialised a pet before? Maybe I can do something like that for her?

TLDR; Over the last three months, best friend was forced to pick up a second job, badly injured, and made to put down her beloved cat. How do I make her feel loved?",11Mar2020,1

I obviously told her I’m here to support her and listen if she needs to talk. But how can I help without making things weird?

For some reason I’m super worried she will be offended if I try to gift her any money while she’s going through this tough time. I wanted to give her a Christmas bonus a few months ago but there were some extenuating circumstances that made it difficult then.

354,"I need advice/ tinder story

Ok so wow I never thought I’d be here signing up for reddit so that I could get some advice about a tinder hookup gone horribly wrong... but here I am. 

I’m newly 18 and (Fred) is turning 20 this year

So backstory, I had just ended things with my first ever boyfriend of 2-3 weeks. Wow right a nice solid relationship. Anyways I was quite upset at the fact that none of my relationships ever work out and so I turned to tinder. 

The day of the break up (Monday) I downloaded tinder to get my mind off of everything. And saw a guy that I found decently attractive, I’m gonna admit i was only looking at physical features as for me I was looking for a hookup. Not a rebound. 

I’m gonna name him Fred. (Not his name) We talked on the phone for a couple hours for two days, and I wanted to hookup so I was pretty desperate for us to meet up. We met up (Thursday) and right off the bat he’s super awkward and not what he looked like in his photos. 

He’s speaking really fast and walking even faster. We were in no rush to get up to his dorm room, this made me super anxious and I tried to push that to the side. I’ve never done a hookup before, but I was more than willing to give It a try. 

We got up to his dorm and it smelled like gross boy fumes. A lil febreeze would have been nice but hey it was the least of my worries, it just added to the discomfort I was already feeling. 

We talked to some of his friends and one of them let me use his vape in his dorm... which was super nice! And then he wanted to watch a movie. A longg movie and I was just ready to go honestly. So I made my moves and he made horrible ones. I could tell he had little to no experience but he insisted he had done this before. It was horrible. we didn’t even end up having s*x. Because I was so turned off I came back to my senses and more or less found the closure I needed. 

I remained super nice to him the whole time. he wanted me to wear his sweater and I put it on. We played some video games and then it was time for me to go. I really gave him a shot but I knew I wasn’t interested the minute we said goodbye. 

I packed up in a hurry because I didn’t want him to see my instant regret face. But anyways when I got home I started looking through tinder again and planned to never see him again. 

We texted a few times but he kept giving me an uneasy feeling the whole experience. Which I denied because of my wants at the time lol. 

I kept telling him I was busy and I couldn’t hangout and couldn’t call. I had never done this before and I was only looking for a hookup and never speak again kind of thing. 

That’s when things get bad. I know that was a lot of back story but this is happening right now and I can’t tell anyone so here I am pouring it out on please god anyone to help me out. 

Ok so he started being really mean, calling me names and getting his friends to text me so that I would text him. The uneasiness was almost unbearable and I did not want any part of this situation and I wanted out. 

He asked if I had mistakenly took his friends vape which I did. I had put it in his sweater pocket when I left. 

I told him I’d give that back and expressed how sorry I was. I know how uncool that was even though it wasn’t my intention to be uncool. I just let in a rush because I didn’t want to have s*x with this guy who was making me feel so uneasy. I even offered to fill the juice up for him. 

I began getting seriously busy and genuinely didn’t have time to see him or text him. And I would go about a day without even checking my phone. 

But his messages would get more offensive and rude as the few days went by. And all his friends were now texting me telling me he’s crying and he needs me to text him. Guilt things like that along with offensive and harassing things. 

And I was terrified they were all going to try to hurt me, I didn’t want a relationship and here I was feeling completely tied down. and I wanted out. I removed him from everything. 

I wanted him as far away as possible and I even removed his friends too. I regret it all so much I just wanted a hookup. I’ve learned from my mistake now. 

He made new instagrams trying to message me, he messaged me on vsco. Just straight harassing and belittling me. His friends tried doing the same. 

He started calling me and calling me off of his friends phones. And finally he sent me a photo of someone’s phone on the Police service online reporting system, like they were all reporting me for stealing his sweater and his friends vape. 

So yeah. I don’t know what to do.",11Mar2020,1

366,"Hi there! Thank you so much for reading. I came to advice because I'm not sure what I should do, or if there's anything to do/if it's worth it to even try to fix this. 

For 6 months I managed 2 gaming communities. It originally started as me helping a friend out, which turned into full time work, a great server, the owner abandoning the community which evolved into me managing the community of near 100 people myself.

For 6 months I ran a decent gaming community, where we made it our effort to keep things safe and comfortable. I made some good friends, I tried to be reasonable, but things eventually [collapsed.Now](https://collapsed.Now) here I am, sitting alone with my boyfriend while these groups continue on without me, having tossed me and all that I did aside.  It can all be traced back to one person. [Joy.Joy](https://Joy.Joy) was nicknamed Joy because of how ""happy"", ""cute"" and ""energetic"" she was. Joy, ironically being the total opposite of what this beast slithering in human skin embodied.

Things started normal when I met her, she expressed an interest in being friends with me. It wasn't until much further down the line she had issues with other girls around.  Things carried on peacefully, we all played games, myself and these individuals that I'm really talking about here, Joy, F, &amp; R.

Overtime, it became increasingly obvious what Joy was after. She used her face as her profile picture (carefully making sure to include cleavage) and had so many orbiters and simps around I had never seen the amount before.  Every single voice chat devolved into a group of sex talk, with at least 3 men discussing what they were going to do to Joy.  Eventually I had to create zones where this group could openly discuss these things, so I created an adult voice chat, for things that weren't 100% kosher for all members.

I wasn't trying to be a dictator, I let people exercise freedom, but I create a very specific set of guidelines that I wanted followed, they were as follows:

\&gt; No racism

\&gt; No discrimination

\&gt; Keep political talks to a minimum

\&gt; Keep 18+ content in the 18+ channel

This group, Joy, F &amp; R began using language that I didn't want to tolerate in the server, ""N-word this"" ""F\*\*\*ot that"". And we had to enforce rules.

As soon as I created emphasis on following the rules, 2 days later Joy decided to start flipping out in the main chatroom. She claimed that it was okay for people to mock religion, but that she wasn't able to use the N-word. This was, quite simply, never an issue in the server. We never once had a problem with religion being insulted, however, racist language and homophobia had become prevalent. I told her to direct message me, she refused. She instead took to insulting me in the main chatroom, and threatened to leave the server.

Myself and my admin team worked to resolve this issue for her (there was never an issue, she didn't like not being able to be a bigot) so we outlined anti-religious behavior in the rules, preventing it from being a further issue.

Things were fine, for about 3 months.

Joy, F &amp; R began making new plans to do a real-life meetup, and included me. Because the entire thing turned into an excuse for these two men to meet up with her and have sex, I backed out of the trip entirely not being comfortable with this. Joy attempted to pressure me multiple times into going so ""she wasn't the only girl there"" I tried to advise her that this was a very bad idea, but she never listened to me.

Ever since I had met Joy, she had many communities she was active in. She would continually use these other places to play games. Joy invited F, R, D, G, S all to these servers. I was never once invited by her anywhere. In fact, it seemed like whenever I would join a new server, she would stop using it. It was like wherever I was, she didn't want to be.

We had a mutual friend, ""D"", who developed a crush on me. When Joy found out about this, she chew ""D"" out (after at least 3 years of friendship) and stopped talking to him. She would constantly message him about how she didn't like that people talked to me, complimented me getting kills in games. This is factually UNTRUE. People barely ever spoke to me. I was always in the background being ignored 99% of the time because I wasn't discussing the 456 ways I can fellate someone. I by no means am pretty, I'm nerdy, I'm introverted, and with these people, I was always in the background. She eventually won D back, and D started ignoring me constantly, no longer wanting anything to do with me. Anytime ""F"" would talk to me, she would also DM him angrily, talking about how upset she was that he talked to me.

But ""F"" I thought F was different... F talked to me every day, we laughed together, joked together, did snapchat constantly. He would hit me up all the time for relationship advice on how to deal with Joy. Joy, had another habit. Joy would meet a man, get close to him, flirt endlessly, talk about screwing him, when he wanted a relationship, she would hop to a new man, and convince the new group that the previous man was a sex pest trying to abuse her. She did this to over 10 men in the 6 months I knew her. I tried to warn F and R, that if they stuck by her, she would eventually try to ruin their lives. They wouldn't listen to me.

Anyway, about 3 months after the religious event, I had to delete multiple images from the community server by Joy, F and R because they were posting transphobic images. I tried to explain why this was unacceptable, but they then began attacking another admin and posting what looked like corpses with the message ""get laid kid"".

After 6 months of friendship, and two small incidents, they all decided to leave my community server without even giving me the respect of speaking to me. They immediately created a new server and started using it.

Later, we got into a private call, and this is where things went absolutely south. I explained that the imagery posted was unacceptable, and gave an anecdote about a friend that was bullied with the same type of imagery who committed suicide. Joy, dropping every bit of facade that she had worn for months, even going as far as mimicking the way I sounded, said something along the lines of, ""that was on your friend, it's their fault they did it."" Then saying, ""it isn't everyone else's responsibility to hold back on what they say, it's the person offended that is at fault, they should suck it up"". She then told me to get psychiatric help because trauma from my childhood still affected me, and laughed at me over it, trying to gaslight me. She implied the things I went through were on me, and if they upset me, it's my fault.

When I tried to explain the mental state of one of my admins, giving no details, I explained to Joy, F &amp; R that they had been abused. Joy actually said outloud about a \*\*17 year old\*\* who had simply deleted transphobic and disturbing images, ""They're a piece of shit, and if this is how they act, maybe they should have been beat harder, then"". Appalled at this, I told her ""I think that if there's a line over what's right and wrong, you've crossed over to the wrong side."" She then mocked me, and said, ""that's your opinion"". She called me crazy, said that having stuff in my life that happened to me is something I should get over, and should get psychiatric help. She said everything is my fault.

After 6 months of feigning friendship with this beast, I deleted her from my friend's list. F and R now had a decision to make. They were there for the entire conversation, they heard her curse at me, shout at me, and say these awful things.

They stuck by her through everything. They then continued using their new server every single day, not inviting me for a few days. When they did, I refused to join in the voice rooms. F and R approached me asking why I couldn't just drop it and join them, play games with them like ""how things were"", and I simply told them that I couldn't be around her anymore, that I was done with that friendship. Verbatim I said, ""I'm done watching an abuser parade around as a saint"". In turn, R and F took turns blaming me for everything saying ""I was ghosting them"" and that I should just stop being dramatic, which really felt like victim blaming. They defend her and stick by her side through everything. Because I won't join them when she's around, I've essentially lost them 100%.

Honestly? I was horrified to hear the things she said. She has two children, and speaking about another child the way she did, I am terrified for her children growing up in that house.

Anyway... this is the end of the huge wall of text. As I sit here with my boyfriend, friendless with no gaming group anymore. Their chat is filled with 6 people. Joy, and 5 other men. I lost every friend I had because I refuse to be around her any longer.

Should I do anything? Was I in the wrong here? I don't even know anymore. I don't want to ""suck it up"" and get over it. I can't stand her, her views are horrendous and downright dangerous.",11Mar2020,1

369,"If this isn't the right place please guide me to the right subreddit. I wanted to post to r/LegalAdvice but I don't think my country's law apply there. 

We (my group of friends) have a small discord server that was dying. And I wanted to overhaul the server to be a general games server instead to bring in new people. I talked about my ambitious project to the server owner. 

Lee was the server owner. He started the server and brought in bots (pre-coded AI) that can watch over the activities in said server. But his coding skill isn't as good. So he said I can customize the server however I wish. And I wanted to. So I asked a friend (who also uses the server) about customizing discord.

Adam is the one that was good at coding/customizing the server using bots (all made by other people). I messaged him and asked how to customize a Discord server and he said it takes time, and I can always outsource the whole thing to him. We agreed. But no contract or documents were signed as this was a friends project. We were all users of the server and wanted to improve it. He made quite the number of changes, and 90% of the customizing was his work.

A few weeks later a fallout happened between Lee and Adam, and Adam was removed as the server admin. Adam told me to regrant him admin status. I didn't read his text and he threatened that I and Lee will be owing him $600 for the whole project if I didn't assist him fast enough.

He took down every changes that he did to server and left.

Now I'm unsure if he can actually sue us for 'making' him do work. It wasn't completely me ordering him to do stuff, it was something we all worked on together. Its probably because I'm young but I'm genuinely scared. It's probably because my mind is clouded by this issue that I can't think properly. I don't work and $600 is a massive amount to me.

372,"hey y’all,

My old friend group that we’ve been together since the start of hs (it’s my graduating year right now) had cut me off for the past few months and like I’ve been depressed ever since. Basically what happened was within the group this girl (G1) sprung up the idea to be fwb and so ensued weeks of hooking up and I made sure we were both clear on the status of our relationship and how I really want this to be discrete. It soon turned for the worse as she started telling some details to some friends within the group, details about me that anyone would obviously be uncomfortable with. At that point I started becoming distant with everyone within the group because I felt uncomfortable being with everyone and like I sat their in silence. My Ex gf (G2) and also within the group and close friends with G1 began to notice this weird trend in me and asked how I was doing and all but I couldn’t come forward with why I felt the way I did as it was an entirely uncomfortable situation. So I just vibed by myself for the next week because I couldn’t stand being with any of them and I had nobody as an outlet to voice my feelings too. But after that I decided to voice my concerns to G1 and explained to her how I don’t feel the same and how uncomfortable I felt and how being around everyone makes me feel like crap. I voiced my genuine feelings to her and she suddenly stopped talking to me in the middle of the conversation. I tried to ask her what’s wrong and she just walked away from me. This is the part where it all went downhill for me.

G1 texted me the following day “delete my number”, I responded with “ok”. I proceeded to delete her number and block out everyone from that friend group because I couldn’t stand hanging with them anymore knowing what had happened between G1 and me and I had no clue what I had done wrong , which made it much more agonizing for me. As I was doing this I reflected on how much the group had wronged me too and justified blocking them on the basis of that. I felt relived running away from issue rather than dealing with it directly, this feeling was only temporary though. Most of the time during the lunch periods I would sit alone reliving the events that had unfolded in my mind trying to find some error in my ways and this inadvertently made me depressed. I lost all my relations that I’ve built for the past 4 years, I kept myself busy with school work to masque the pain I felt everyday walking by that group of strangers that I once knew as friends. 

One day I had the courage to text G2 first to say that I was sorry for cutting her out and I couldn’t give her the explanation because I don’t know myself. She didn’t seem to bat an eye to it and was cold to me. This had ridden me of all hope that I would ever get anyone back as a friend and pushed me further in my sadness. This made me realize is that she only knows G1’s side of the story, and made me more confused to if I had done something Actually wrong. I didn’t know what she told everyone but they all genuinely disliked me. 

Fast forward to today and I’m still not hungover what had happened, and still can’t figure out what I had done wrong throughout the entire fwb relationship. 

Question: Is there anything I can do to win them back over or should I just leave it and just graduate and leave this all behind. Please and thanks for the advice. 

tldr: fwb relationship gone wrong and now I lost all my friends over something that I have no idea what it is.",11Mar2020,1

375,"Hi,

For as long as I can remember, I have nightmares. Every night. Multiple each night.

I am 30 years old, male. I would say I am healthy. I had therapy for a few years to cope with depression coming forth from a life long not understanding feelings and being stressed about everything there is in life (highly sensitive). I use 2 kind of anti depressants at the moment. I feel good right now. The only thing no one can help with is the nightmares and waking up covered in cold sweat. Every night.

I have a good life: nice friends, a wonderful family, a girlfriend and a cool job. Psychotherapists and psychiatrists cannot help with sleeping problems. I slept a night in the hospital and nothing, beside the fact I woke up 12 times out of 'nothing', came out of it. I don't have any trauma either so emdr is no solution.

I am not very keen on seeing spiritual help as I don't believe that helps.

Tonight when I spoke with my parents about it I thought : maybe I can ask the biggest community: reddit.

I am looking for help and advice. Who can help me?",11Mar2020,1

378,"I would like to hear from someone who has personally gone through multiple decades of debilitating depression &amp; neglect from others and have come out the other side and achieved multiple years of contentment/happiness. How did you do it? How would you suggest that I navigate my life in order to not only figure out what I want but also to have the motivation to keep trying when I have no love, no affection, no passion, nothing that refuels me.

I'm a 30M with very little. I have some shallow friendships, but none of them are emotionally available. I'm broke with a dead-end job. I was developing a decent career in my 20s, but it wasn't right for me, and I haven't found anything that is. I have no idea if I want to settle down and get an office job or try to find something where I can live in a van and travel. All I want is a stable life where my mind can stop racing and worrying. I know that it's possible to stop suffering if I can view things without reacting to them, but I just don't even know how to describe how deep this hole is that I've dug for myself. This feeling of hopelessness is so overpowering, and when my hopeless attitude goes up against these gargantuan issues that I'm facing, it's obviously a lost battle before it's even begun.

IDK. I honestly don't even know what details to provide for you. I'm basically just trying to convey that literally everything in my life is in terrible shape. There are literally zero relationships I can open up in. I probably can't even try for talk therapy for another couple months probably, due to insurance stuff (there are some avenues I could try, but it's always so much work and never pays off). I feel weak, ugly, stupid, slow, pessimistic, and cruel. It's become an identity, and I've been unable to let it go.

379,"Sorry this is a bit long but I do really need some help on what to do, thanks

Ok so, backstory, I had feelings for her, she didn’t, we didn’t wanna ruin our friendship, we started friends. She got a boyfriend for 2 months. They broke up at New Years. Halfway through February we both find out we have feelings for each other. She wasn’t ready to get back into a relationship at that time. Couple weeks later, she ‘asked me out’ I took things too fast and ruined it. She lost feelings. And turns out I wasn’t really what she wanted anyway.

Ok so, I’ve know this girl for over a year now and we’re really good friends. It’s annoying though cause I want to get over the feelings I have for her but I can’t. She’s everything I want, like, she’s funny, kind, supportive and all that shit. I’m not really what she wants though. She’s told me that she wants a Dom. Like someone who will take control in the relationship. She wants to be the little one. And I’d wanna be the bigger one in the relationship but I just don’t really, show it, I guess. 

Like I think a big part of it is my confidence in myself cause, ok idk if I am depressed but I just feel sad a lot and I have a lot of self problems. But when I’m with her or friends in general they go away for the most part. But uh, yeah so I guess I just don’t show I wanna be dominant and I don’t really know how tbh. Like, I don’t wanna push her boundaries and go too far cause ik it might ruin things so idk what to do.

Any help is appreciated, thanks",11Mar2020,1
380,"So this girl, we've been talking for about a week now. I know for a fact that its too early to ask her out. But I know she's a part of the LGBTQIA++ spectrum because of the rainbow flag on her bio. We've talked about a lot of stuff, not necessarily romantic but I plan to go there. Problem is, I just heard from one of her classmates that she's a lesbian, and I thought initially she's just bisexual. 

I'm cool with her being lesbian and all. But after hearing it, I became more conflicted about what to do. I really like her, but since I kinda want to take it to the next level sometime in the future, if we get to know each other better more, but if she's a lesbian, I just think my effort will go to waste. I don't want to lose her though.

Don't get me wrong, I'm open to the idea that it's a hit or miss if you ask a girl out. But she's a lesbian, and I have yet to confirm that from her, without being nosy and shit. I don't want to ride the coattails of a rumor. She had a girlfriend last year. But bisexuals can have a bf or gf as far as I know

But seeing this situation, I'm now sure its a hundred percent miss if I do. 

TL:DR: Have a crush on a girl, rumor she's a lesbian, don't know what to do.

382,"I’m not sure how I exactly want to write this, so if it’s all over the place or confusing, I apologize lmao. I’ll just lay it all out and let you guys say what you think. 

I am currently 21 y/o, a full time college student, hold an easy job, trying to exercise my passion on the side, and ready to start living independently. 

College: I’m a junior studying exercise science. It wasn’t until this academic year, ‘19-‘20, that I began to feel like college may not be the route for me. I’ve lost most motivation and have adapted the mindset of “C’s get degrees” which is true. Main reason for that is the idea that success in school doesn’t matter in the real world, except for a degree to some extent. The one and only reason I stay in college is because of how close I am to graduating. The job I have now only requires me to be 18+ and I could easily let it be my career without college. 

Job: I am currently working as a personal trainer at a local gym. The job is cool due to the social aspect and being able to help those who seek their fitness help. What I don’t like about it is that hours aren’t always guaranteed. I work a guaranteed 10 hours a week plus any clients/groups I have scheduled (5-10 extra hours). It’s not a bad gig for a student as I bring in anywhere from $300-$450 every two weeks. Staying at this gym long term, I think it’ll make me feel comfortable and I’ll end up settling here. Upon taking this position, I worked at an airport as a ramp agent. This job was pretty fun and usually went pretty fast. I only left because my school schedule interfered and I had this job as a trainer. However, at the airport job, I was making anywhere from $600-$800 every two weeks depending on various delays and extended times. I have been thinking about doing leaving my personal training job and going back to the airport job. I would then do 20-30 hours minimum at the airport and then do independent personal training as a side gig. 

Passion/Side Hustle: I believe I have found one of my most favorite side hobbies and something I have fun doing. I believe the best side hustle should be something you enjoy and that can bring some sort of income in. What I enjoy doing outside of work is creating content for YouTube (gaming, sports highlights, etc). This tends to keep me creative and not feeling like such a robot. Along with that, I have also began flipping sports cards purchased off of eBay which has brought me a pretty good amount of side money (sold two cards for $300 each the other day). 

Living Situation: My first year of college, I lived in the dorms since I went to a school an hour away from where I grew up. This independence was really nice as I matured and grew up noticeably. I would love to move into an apartment soon to further my maturation and give me a taste of the real world. However, staying at home with my parents isn’t bad either considering it’s free and they’ll always make sure I have the essentials. I love having my parents around but there’s something about having my own spot that I can’t help but think about. I also take care of my own necessities (gas, food when parents don’t cook, laundry, phone bills, and overall expenses). The only thing they pay for is if we all go out to eat together or when they go to the store for groceries, everything else is out of my pocket. 

Summary: I guess what I’m saying is I’m ready to be “free”. It may not be all sunshine and rainbows but the hardships are what matters. I ultimately want to live my best life when it’s all said and done. The best way for that, in this moment, is travel (in my opinion) which working at the airport can provide to me for free. Having fun is also a top priority and I’d like to believe that all will come with what I said above. Sorry for this being so long and time consuming, feel free to leave your thoughts!

383,"So, I've been hooking up with one person for a few months. Aside from just hooking up, we are very domestic (ex. go grocery shopping, cook together, take naps). For a long time, I was really guarded around him because I don't trust men after some terrible experiences with them. Anyways, he would always give the impression that he liked me more than I liked him. He would say ""I like you"" and ""You're so beautiful , smart, funny, and lovely and I like you so much"" and always make time for me. If he didn't text me for a while or we couldn't meet, he would send me a message unprompted apologizing and saying he hasn't been avoiding me, just is extremely busy. He would call when we have sex ""making love."" He would also always joke about us getting married. I wouldn't reciprocate in full at first because I was concerned about it being insincere and getting hurt.

Anyways, I started to fall for him and until just now was feeling the tragedy of us being sent home early from school after just realizing my feelings. I've never really had a crush before or felt like this. I was considering how sad it was that he's a fourth year and I'm a first year and our relationship only started to develop. I've become very open with him, telling him I miss him and that I want to see him or that I will miss him a lot when he's gone. He almost always makes time for me, sometimes canceling things with his friends and missing events for me. If I'm upset about something, he responds well because he doesn't want to see me hurt/be the one to do it. These days, I tell him things like ""I've never felt so comfortable with someone/this way before."" And he'll respond that we have perfect chemistry and everything.


I was sad about leaving him but then I find out he's been consistently seeing someone else. We aren't monogamous or dating and that's been discussed before. But in the words of the person he was seeing, ""they've started catching feelings for each other"" since hooking up a few times for this last month. They made brownies together, etc, etc. She even said she wanted to petition to stay on campus just to be with him. I also heard he's apparently slightly aggressive with girls he meets on Tinder, eager for them to respond so they can have other romantic/domestic dates.

I guess my thing is, I don't care if you're hooking up with other people. But why play at romance with so many people? Why look for new consistent hookups and do romantic things for them every time you're together. Why, when I was so obviously guarded, go to level of getting my guard down when you know you can't commit emotionally to me. Why tell me I'm your first priority and you care when that's clearly not true? Like, I understand people who sleep around. But convincing all these people to be essentially ""dating"" you in the emotional sense at the same time? What's the point of that? Why do you need to use behavioral tricks to make us like you and they're all the same tricks?

I guess I'm just really upset. I feel heartbroken and betrayed. I knew he was sleeping with other people and I didn't care. It just hurts that I was made to feel like I mattered when I clearly don't. It hurts really, really bad. I don't know what to do now.",11Mar2020,1

393,"GF asked me to post this. It is written by her. We are both 23, if its relevant.

I'll try keep this short and sweet. I've put myself in a really tight spot and i think i have a rough idea how it will turn out but as a last resort i'll ask for advice here.

First of all; the essential info: i first started at my job only a mere 5 weeks ago, i have had my 10 week holiday planned since June last year, an abrupt redundancy saw me unemployed from the end of December until i found work in my current role and they did ask me in my interview if i had any holidays planned. Which (i know, i know) i straight up lied about and said; no. 

The management and coworkers of this (office) job are very progressive. They have a much more laid back attitude about work than i expected, which makes this more difficult for me.

My plan going into working for this company was to have a temporary low paying job to keep the funds coming in for my SO and i, so when the time came for the holiday i could give them my two weeks and cut ties. I wasn't entirely prepared for me to actually really enjoy the job, which, has since become a reality. I also have a very good relationship with my management team and co-workers. And they all regularly hint at me working with them for an extensive amount of time (the guilt is paralyzing).

The dilemma being: i'd love for the company to keep me on after 10 weeks but i know my chances are low. My BF thinks i should give 4 weeks notice as a courtesy but i worry that i will get fired. I know its a bit ridiculous but we need the extra weekly income right up until we leave. I thought 3 weeks would be the perfect amount of time but he thinks it would be even more damning in my case to give such short notice. 

I would love some advice on how i can possibly word this to my supervisor and also a good timeframe for breaking it to them. I know i'm an asshole, but i'd appreciate any witheld judgement for some help in the matter.

I will add: My contract does not have any mention of this issue so legal repercussions are not necessarily a worry.

They stole the jeep and also his professional camera setup he had in the back. His first instinct was to run to a nearby house and ask them to protect them while he called the police.

404,"Hi everyone, I'm a woman whose college is facing an infrastructural issue for which I'm seeking some advice from you smart gentlemen. 

So, we have a huge tank underground in our college to store dirty water and faeces from the washrooms. It's made of concrete from all 4 sides but the bottom is open so that the water seeps into the ground and only the solid waste is left in the tank that can later be taken out. 

However, our tank is filling up very quickly. This is because the water that is supposed to be absorbed by the ground cannot be done so because my college is in a rocky terrain, so instead of sand, we have rocks. 

My two questions are:
1. Is there a way we can increase the absorption rate so that the tank won't fill up as quickly? Or other ways in which the tank would slowly fill up?

 (If you could please suggest a layout drawing for some mini tanks we could plant or use a pump, it'll be great)

I never told her to, or told her I liked her so I guess she just wasn’t happy in her relationship. And I don’t want to be the cause of the girl I like and her boyfriend breaking up (although I doubt that will happen since they both seem happy with each other). So should I keep talking with her but not make a move until she breaks up with him?",11Mar2020,1
407," I'm 22 year old guy in his final year of University. I have 2 months to go before my final exams and 6 weeks before my dissertation deadline (and I haven't started my write up) I've just realised that I'm very likely to have ADD and I don't know how to tell my parents.
For the past YEAR consistency in my routine, being able to organise and balance different aspects of my life, lack of focus both in lectures and in just about any task (except what interests me enough) and just being productive have been my biggest struggles. I've tried just about everything to solve these problems. 

Routine problem? I changed it and made it the best I could to ensure productivity while not taxing myself too much (and even the task of creating a weekly plan I postponed for weeks just because I felt it was too much effort).  

Mindset issue and maybe I'm just making a mountain out of a molehill? I started breaking my work down into smaller chunks and keep saying to myself that it's easy and it'll change. To be honest the first part genuinely helped but not nearly enough to get me the level of consistency and productivity I want. The second just didn't help as much.

I've been wondering for SO long what the hell is wrong with me. Why I'm so lazy, unfocused, unserious and complacent, even though I gave myself so, so many harsh pep talks to try and hammer the point home. The guilt that I've been feeling from that has been KILLING me such that it's such a relief to find out that I'm likely to be none of the things I mentioned. For months I always felt I've been missing the last piece of the puzzle to get me out out of first gear. And now I think I know what the problem is.

 The hardest part of this is that it's invisible to most. I look very normal on the outside and so friends and family set their expectations accordingly. And when they're not met, I'm harshly criticised. My parents especially, know nothing about ADHD symptoms and have a very grit-like mentality. The have zero tolerance for complacency, laziness and slacking off and they will go BALLISTIC on me if they find out I'm so behind on my dissertation. To make it more complicated, they are super-religious and have even less tolerance for stuff like dishonesty, as they believe it's a 'sin against God and a means through which the devil will wreck my life'. I've grown out of that mindset long ago but that's what makes it so hard to be completely honest with them. That fear of being harshly judged. I don't know what to do at this point...

 I'm just in a very difficult spot at this moment in time. If anyone has any helpful tips and advice, you're welcome to share them.",11Mar2020,1
408,"Hey reddit,

So I’ve been stuck these past couple months because I feel like I’m going nowhere and that I’ll never be good enough to get the job I want. I want to join the Marine Corp, but also want to be a police officer (not military police tho). I’m just worried that if I become a cop then I will regret not joining the Marines and I cant keep on a regime to get myself built enough for the MOS I want in the marine Corp. another big factor is my gf. I love her to death, but I can tell she doesn’t want me to join the military and it really is making it so hard for me. I guess what I’m asking is for those who are cop,military, and gym goers what is the best way to get in shape and what do you think of your job/should I join. 

TLDR: wanna join military or be a cop, but my gf doesn’t want me to",11Mar2020,1
409,"Okay so this is my very first post on Reddit so forgive me if I do anything wrong. I'm a 18 year old male and I have never gone to a party, concert, or any type of social gathering like summer festivals. I think the reason why I have very few to no friends is because I went to a all boys school. I haven't talked to a girl for the past 4/5 years outside of my family ofcourse. So this means that I am very socially awkward when I'm around girls my age. I thought that by going to university this will all change but I still find myself being an outcast / excluded from groups. I've always lied to people (like my parents friends) that I don't go out because I want to focus on my studies, but in reality I don't go out because I don't get invited to anything. It's gotten to a point where I have started to believe this lie, because I don't want to face the reality of not having friends. And it makes me really sad. Because I see people my age going out and having fun, while I stay home.

414,"Hi there,

So my ex boyfriend and I broke up with me on Valentine’s Day, initially over the phone, two days before our two year anniversary. It completely knocked me for six, but I was paranoid that week that he was drifting away from me and it was coming to an end.

So it’s been three to four weeks and I’m still very down about it. I think he stopped being attracted to me and wasn’t ready for a LTR, despite him suggesting to get a place together after he graduated.

I initiated no contact the day after the breakup, I’ve blocked him on social media and I’m trying to keep myself busy to move on. But the fact that everyone was so shocked when we broke up, and because of all of the plans we had made for the future, I can’t shake the feeling that we are supposed to be together one day.

So do you have any REALLY GOOD advice on moving on? And, probably harder to get but I’ll ask anyway, any long term plans or SOLID advice to rekindling a relationship with a previous partner? Know it takes two to tango, but what could I do from my side to give in the best chance.

However, I'm already in the third week of the second semester and I'm behind on every single class. The thing is, I'm an engineering student, so it's really hard to catch up with everything. The real issue, though, is that I've got no will to do anything. I'm constantly anxious and even when I have time to study, I don't. I just lie on my bed listening to music or something equivalently unproductive. I know that I sound lazy, and I know that this is 100% my fault, but it's not that I don't want to study, because I want to (not for the sake of studying itself, but to succeed), but I just feel like I can't. I always feel tired too. For example, I've tried pulling all-nighters, but I ended up just wasting even more time. Sometimes my mom asks me how I'm doing, and when I try to tell her that I'm behind things and that I feel like shit, she just tells me I must study more and then goes on how it affects her when I tell her I'm not feeling okay. I know my mom as a parent is worried when I tell her I'm not doing well, but she always shifts the attention to her and ends up blaming me for hurting her by talking about my mental health.

Sorry this is a bit long but I do really need some help on what to do, thanks

Ok so, backstory, I had feelings for her, she didn’t, we didn’t wanna ruin our friendship, we started friends. She got a boyfriend for 2 months. They broke up at New Years. Halfway through February we both find out we have feelings for each other. She wasn’t ready to get back into a relationship at that time. Couple weeks later, she ‘asked me out’ I took things too fast and ruined it. She lost feelings. And turns out I wasn’t really what she wanted anyway.

Ok so, I’ve know this girl for over a year now and we’re really good friends. It’s annoying though cause I want to get over the feelings I have for her but I can’t. She’s everything I want, like, she’s funny, kind, supportive and all that shit. I’m not really what she wants though. She’s told me that she wants a Dom. Like someone who will take control in the relationship. She wants to be the little one. And I’d wanna be the bigger one in the relationship but I just don’t really, show it, I guess. 

Like I think a big part of it is my confidence in myself cause, ok idk if I am depressed but I just feel sad a lot and I have a lot of self problems. But when I’m with her or friends in general they go away for the most part. But uh, yeah so I guess I just don’t show I wanna be dominant and I don’t really know how tbh. Like, I don’t wanna push her boundaries and go too far cause ik it might ruin things so idk what to do.

Basically last year at Uni i fucked it on one module and then failed all of the resits, my own fault, it was a module that i had to pass to move on, so my options were apply to a new course or wait 4 years to do that course again, the other option was to apply for an appeal to let me do one final resit. I went for the last option and the appeal took until way into the first semester of year 2, at which point it was denied, meaning i was without a course until September 2020. 
Now I'm really terrible for feeling ashamed and worried about all this stuff and lied to my family, I'm still in the course but changing in September is what i said, and then i said i was dropping out semester 2 to change in September. But they pressured me into not dropping out, and seeing it through until it's done, then change in September...but i was already out...

And now I'm living in a flat my mum owns, with a mate, and she's wanting evidence that I'm going in, and now is saying things about how I'm a slacker and wasting my life and that feeling low is just an excuse and that she's disappointed and I'm at my whits end.

we talked face to face only on sunday, all other communication was on the phone, past midnight, since she refused to talk to me about it during work hours when we were both at work. when i asked why i'm being transferred and not her friend, she tried listing some issues with me, none of which held any water and she backed out of when i tried to question them further. one of them was me not 'clicking' with the other receptionist, and when i asked why that's important as everything was civil and the job was getting done, i got no straight answer.

 it's overall been a very shitty experience where plans were made for me without me even being asked, and when i was asked, was given only a couple of hours to decide with virtually no choice at all, really. since monday, the new girl, me and the other girl employed on the post worked together, one too many for this particular job (receptionists).

the place where i work has multiple owners who are very much involved in the whole thing. they're very approachable people who care about the image and how their employees are treated. my question is, should i go to one of them and let him know what's going on? i don't want the job back, there's nothing to be done right now, but i'd like to tell him that what happened wasn't right and my case was handled extremely poorly, taking into consideration how great of a worker i was. until sunday, no problems were mentioned to me about my performance, and everything was going great.

434,"My two friends (that are international students from China) were lab partners. They got points taken off because they were speaking Chinese TO EACH OTHER. Not to the teacher, not to other students, not on the assignment. My friend said that he’s okay with it, as the teacher had told them that he wants them to practice their English, so he thinks it is his fault. Keep in mind, this is CHEMISTRY class. Not ENGLISH class. I don’t think the teacher has the authority to take points off of something unrelated to chemistry (this teacher has been known to give extra homework to the whole class if there was even one kid misbehaving, but my friends were not misbehaving; they were completing a chemistry assignment as they were told to it.) 

My school is very diverse. and we have lots of students from lots of different cultural backgrounds, including many international students. We celebrate diversity and acceptance here. The news regarding the coronavirus has been scary and isolating for our international students from China (cancelling their flights, missing home, feeling judged). I absolutely cannot imagine the insensitivity of this teacher by punishing them for speaking Chinese on top of all of the weight and stress they are carrying on their shoulders, especially now. 

I had asked my friend if he wanted to talk to guidance about it, and that I would go with him if he felt nervous about it. He told me he appreciates it, but that he feels he’s okay with his grade because he knew he “shouldn’t” have been speaking Chinese. I told him that if he ever changes his mind, I won’t hesitate to support him, but I respect his wishes. 

However, I do think someone should know about this, but I don’t know if it’s my place to do something about it. I just feel it is absolutely wrong and unjust. Our guidance counselors are very safe people, and I know they would keep any reports anonymous— I think they would just tell the teacher to apologize and act has if he came to the conclusion that it’s wrong on his own. My friends deserve more. They are in honors chemistry and plan on taking AP courses in chemistry next year. Their grade should not be in jeopardy because of things they cannot control.

Now... My mother gave me all the answers I wanted, like why they want to divorce and stuff like that. But my dad didn't really talk to me at all. 

I saw him texting with another woman and asked him about her. He said she has nothing to do with anything although he literally spent hours on his phone just texting with her. To me this was seriously suspicious. 

Since my mother and father own a house together, one of them has to move out. My dad immediately said that it was my mother who has to move out and he wanted her to be out until summer. My mother doesn't even know where to start. She doesn't earn enough money to just move out and pay rent for a flat all by herself. But he puts her under pressure. He wants my mother to move out as soon as possible and he also refuses to pay her for anything [although german law will force him to pay sth sooner or later]

This makes me angry. I love both of my parents of course, but since my dad doesn't talk to me about anything openly I don't know what to think about him anymore. I also am a pretty emotional person, so I kinda just want to tell it to his face that I'm disappointed of thow the whole divorce is going so far. 

And not just my mother needs some time... it's also very difficult for me to imagine my parents divorced. I wish I had some more time to understand everything before they go separate ways.

What should I do? And especially... how should i feel about this? Am i overreacting?",11Mar2020,1
440,"I shared this on a different account but lost the password for it. So, here we go!

Well, this just happened like 30 minutes ago and my initial thought was anger but now I'm questioning myself. 

(Apologies, I am on mobile.)
 So, here's the cast: 
Emily: Entitled Mother In Law (name changed but EMIL was one letter off from a name)
EB: Entitled Brat 
BF: Boyfriend (My fiancé that proposed and we never told his mama)
 Me: Me

So, me and my BF have been having more and more arguments as of late. It's around midnight and I couldn't sleep, so I called him up. He's getting ready to join the military (ARMY STRONG!!!!) so he decided to move back in with his parents as to not inconvenience me. 

His mother took that as ""Ooooo free babysitter!"" and has been taking advantage of his kindness. 

Tonight, ish* hit the fan. I finally voiced every one of my frustrations out to him. He listened with open ears and he took in every word without shutting down. He took it all in strides. 

Then, came the part of talking to his parents. I haven't been over to their house since around September last year. I refused to go because his mom REFUSES to discipline her child. Here's the thing, I couldn't care less about how people parent. That is until their children start to become a problem to society. 

Lets start this at a reunion party for BF's family. Well, enter EK. This little crotch goblin decides to come up behind me and start touching and petting my hair. I am a woman of colour and I've already dealt with entitled people touching my hair because it's styled a certain way. I am also a rape survivor. I don't do well with people coming up behind me or hovering. 

Thankfully, the first time I reacted, I didn't haul off and hit EK. I asked him, please don't touch my hair. He gave me a creepy look and walked off. Second time, I'm just on my phone and EK does it AGAIN. I start to boil and sadly BF was talking to someone else and didn't notice. I tell him to back outta my space. EK runs off giggling. 3RD TIME: I grab my stuff and I walk out , grabbing my BF. That was the last time I had ever seen his family. 

Cue tonight. I decided to finally go over tonight because BF wanted me to let his family have another chance. I finally said yes. We go over there and we began talking because Emily is a ""Rational person that loves open communication"". So, I'm open and honest. I tell her it was disrespectful for her to let her child keep touching me even though she knows of my past, dealing with all the garbo. 

Me: You know I've had random people come up to me because of my hair texture.

Emily: So? You should be prooouuud to have that hair. Aaaallllllll hair is beautiful.

**me seeing the Boeing 747 fly above her head**

Me: That's not the point. I'm talking about personal space. You know I'm still dealing with PTSD from the whole...situation....that was forced onto me.

Emily: But, you also need to know. This is my house. My children can do whatever they want on this property.

Me: You...didnt...just say that....to a RAPE SURVIVOR?!

Her: That was different. You weren't their child but you were on their property.

**meanwhile, BF is sitting there, vein popping, red faced, and tears in his eyes**

Me: Sooooo, you're saying if I'm on your property and your son suddenly touches my breasts...

Emily: My son's are touchy feely. We are a touchy feely family. It's them welcoming you!

**my BF suddenly snapping into reality**

BF: You have NEVER raised me that way. What the hell happened?!

Emily: Watch your language!!!

Me: well, it's almost 2 in the morning, time to go!

BF drove me home and we had a long talk. The thing is, she's got me questioning myself... I know I was a victim but, was it really my fault? Also, is it bad that I'm now too scared to ever go back to that house, in fear of being molested?",11Mar2020,1

457,"Throw away account, I didn't want anyone find this in my business account. It is long, my problem is... big.

 I am 18F, I have 2 siblings, 21M and 11F.
 Growing up my mother always have been sexist towards me. Her favorite children were my siblings. She didn't care if they failed or they were rude towards her, she didn't care. I used to be naive child, my marks are much higher than my siblings, I don't raise my voice to her, I did everything she said and I was the only one who bought gifts for her. Despite this she doen't call me by my name or ""my love"" like she does to my siblings. She calls me ""stupid, animal,bitch, honourless"" everyday. When I ask why she says that she loves my brother more because he is her only son. When I ask why she says that she loves my sister more because she looks like her and she is little. When I do something great, good, at leat shomething to be proud of, she makes fun of me. I got 90 from math and class average is 60. So? I am stupid. I am drawing too much, I am a mistake and a dissappointment. I can't talk with her without having an anxiety attack.
 When I want to spend some time with my classmates, she punishes me. Locks me to my room and leaves me to starve. She doesn't like any of my friends, actually. I am friends with boys usually. She thinks that I am with them in order to hook up. One day I hugged a boy and she punished me again. Punched my face,pulled my hair, took my phone and locked me to my room. I starved for two days.I got nausa so she cheked if I am pregnant or not. She called be a bitch over and over again. I am still a virgin, I guess she just likes to torture me.
So this is basically why I don't talk with my mother.

 About my mother, 5 years ago we moved to a new house. Since my childhood she've always been a paranoid. I couldn't tell my friends I was moving and I could not see them again. Because my mother told me my friends were agents of goverment, the president wants our information. 
 We moved and she started to have problem with our neighbours. She said they were swearing at her, they were part of the mafia, and even if they were poor, they had 8 house and lots of cars becuse they were stealibg money from us. She cursed the pregnant woman,then her new born baby. Because according to my mom,the woman is a stripper and didn't get pregnant from her husband. Also she tried to lure my brother and my father. Not only that our neiggbours tried to kill us everyday, stole everything from us, they wanted to kidnap me. According to my mother.
 My mother used to put a glass on the wall and listened them all day. She is a clean freak, she cleans herself with Domestos(a detergant), she is obese, she doesn't let anyone to clean anything. As she started to listen them our house turned to trash. We begged her to clean, we begged to her at least we can clan anything. She refused. When she wasn't listening them, she was sleeping. Still to this day, she is same.
 She started to record their voices from our phones. (My brothers, hers, mine). Phones couldn't work because of 70GB voice recordings, so I removed. She got angry. My mother also took photo of random people in the street because they were working for our neighbours. They were following us all the time. Her phone broke. We got 2 more just because of that. She broke them too.
 One day she fought with our neighbours. We lived in apartmant, she yelled at like 16 people. Cops came to our house when I was in the school. They did nothing but I learned that my mother tried to attack a woman with a knife.
 My father warned her thousand times. ""I bought this house. I worked fır it over 20 years. Don't create a problem. Or I will leave you."" She didn't care. She fought with them again.
 Last year we moved again. My father said ""Don't create a problem; clean the house, be a proper housewife"" First months she tried. Then found someone to swear. 
 It was our neighbour's 17 old daughter. My mother sweared at her everyday. Saying that she is a bitch and has a connection to mafia. Not only that, a guy on our street wait for me everyday so he can abuse me.
 I tried not o listen her. I knew ıt was bullshit, but day by day I got weaker. She yells to me from the living room: ""Did he kiss you? Did he abuse you? Tell me the truth bitch!"" She sits ar one sofa, listents her recordings, then swears,curses at random people.
 I am in my room all day. Sometimes she comes and swears ar them at my room. I thought my room was only safe place frım her, but I was wrong. I locked my door. She treathened to kill me.
 She opened her recording to me and my bother. She said that they were swearing at us all time. And by swearing back at them she 'saved our honour'. According to her, in the oice recordibgs, 17 year old girl used crypted language with a man and my mother was the only one who can understand them. 
It was just 12 hour long water sounds. Yeah, she listens this shitty recordings everyday.

 2 months ago, everything started to go worse and worse. She started to hear them from her head. When I talk with my sister about anything she got angry at us because she can't hear them. Sometimes she beggs at the voices to ""leave her alone, get out of her head"" so she can sleep.  
She has full conversation with them. She meets with a new people everyday, saying that they are bitches,working for ISIS. She says that these people think they are genius by using new name everyday.my mother couldn't find any evidence towards these people but she will report them to police. Funny enough she thinks that police works against her.

 I talked about this with my father and my brother.(about emotinal and physical abuse, her hallucinations and her shitty cleaning habit) My father didn't want to spend any time with this woman. My brother said he can take her to theraphy. 
 They didn't go to theraphy but my brother said to me ""don't tell her to shut up, she need to be happy for recovering. This makes her sad.""

 I can't take it anymore. I've already suffered from self harm and high heart rate because of stress my mother created. I hate leaving scholl because I hate listening this woman 16 hours straight. When I run away from her, try to find peace she screams more and more. She won't shut up.
 I am at the edge. I will lose my mind. I went to school conselor, she just told me to stay away from my mother.

459,"Hi! I F(18) am dating my boyfriend (22) for about year now. A year was enough for me to see some differences between us and I do not know if it is really a deal breaker or not. I would love to read your opinions.

I am always very talkative, open to share my emotions and I am always honest about everything I say. But sometimes I am really moody and when I get into my ""sad"" state it seems like my boyfriend doesnt understand my emotions at all. He is too racional and even I am trying to explain my emotions in detail, his attitude is "" You should not give a f\*ck, Do not stress about it etc."" His advices always sound very rude to me and I am giving up of telling him about how I feel because he just can not understand, even we tried many times. I feel like my emotions are not valid to him.

The second thing is that he loves to arrgument with people. At least he says he does. But I noticed that everytime he just makes up some scenarios in his head, he tells me about how he would roast that stupid person, but when it comes to real life, there were few times when someone was insulting me in front of him and he was quiet. I got sad because I was expecting that he would defend me, but he did not do anything. There was one time that a group of people were shouting at me, pointing at me about how I look. He was just listening to them, without a word being said from his mouth. I defended myself. When I asked him why he did not to anything his response was: It was not worth it, because those people were out of his league. I want someone who will understand me, take care of me and most importantly, someone who will make me feel safe.

tl;dr: My boyfriend does not understand how I feel even when I explained to him my feelings in detail. His advices always sound rude. In addition, there were some situations where I was verbally attacked by someone and he did not defend me. How do we solve this, or is this pure incompatibility?",11Mar2020,1

I want to get a job but I can't be on my feet for more than 2 hours a day without passing out for the rest of the day because of my heart issues. (And some days I can't even stand due to being in so much pain)  I want to apply for the Disability Support Pension but without an official name for whatever my heart is doing, i'm not sure i'll be accepted for it. I've had these heart issues for three years now and we still don't know how to fix it. Doctor has done everything we can do. 

I would do a course to get some kind of desk job but my brain doesn't have the concentration skills to do that every day, 5 days a week. I've tried 4 times in the last six years and had to drop out every time. Based on that, I'd probably be bad at a desk job. 

My health issues are so unreliable that I can agree to do something on one day and then with not even an hours warning have to cancel my plans the next day. It's what got me fired from my previous 3 jobs. Because they were too physically demanding. 

I'd just rely on my art commissions but I get approximately $20 or so a month from them. That's definitely not enough considering I and 2 others are now homeless. I need to make rent and bills. Most places here are $500 a week. Even split between 3 people, that's $166 a week on RENT.  

I now have to help provide for myself and 2 other people but I don't know what to do. I don't know how to go about this. Bond is approximately $2000 for every house here and Public Housing is 20% of your income but it can take up to 5 years for that if we can't get onto priority. 

I am really worried about everything and I don't know how to approach this. I physically can't work but I might not be able to get onto DSP to get proper financial support. 

Does anyone have advice or ideas on what I can do? Thanks.",11Mar2020,1

469,"Hey everyone! Sorry this post is going to be super specific but... Here goes.


I've had insomnia for as long as I can remember. Doc' said it was primary insomnia, so not caused by temporary stress or meds. So my sleep has been shit chronically. I rarely dreamt, and when I did it was usually nonsensical, or nightmares.


For the past two weeks though, I've had consistent amazing sleep. Like a full eight hours every night, feeling well rested and not dead inside. Which is obviously wonderful but... I started having dreams that are so realistic I think they are actual memories.

The latest example: I applied to a position at my university. Two days ago I dreamt that I got the answer (and it was no). I can still remember it clear as day, I was on my laptop, got the notification that I had an email, and the email read exactly like the emails my uni usually sends. So whenever someone asked me about it, I told them i had gotten an answer and it was no. Until someone pointed out that we aren't supposed to get answers before the 15th (which I had forgotten). I still believed my dream and went to check my emails to show them... But of course I had no such email.

It wasn't the first time. Sometimes I'd dream about getting something done and I'd truly believe I did it, until I open my planner and see it's still on my to do list. Then I check the thing and indeed I didn't do it.

What the hell? Does anyone knows what's up? I live in a different country right now so I can't really go to my usual doctor.

They hit me and say a bunch of stuff about me infront of me, i have told them countless times not to which they just reply wth stop being a sook. They also are very racist towards my somalian friend which he doesnt want to take it to the teacher since it would just start drama and there are 3 of them.

Basically my problem is that i want to get rid of them as friends but dont want to loose the friendship of the others

Any reply is appreciated greatly this is really getting to me",11Mar2020,1
472,"I'm going to need to be a little vague in posting this, but here goes my best shot...
I have this friend who, about two years ago now, was in an emotionally abusive relationship with her now ex (thank God), &amp; naturally had a lot of anxiety and insecurities. Around the same time, this friend &amp; I, as well as a few other people, joined a group together and my friend was given a leadership position which helped her anxiety &amp; self-confidence so much, which I love! However, this has come with some cons as well. 
Since then, this person has gone a little control crazy. Whenever someone brings up an idea that she doesn't like, she rejects not only the idea but the person as well, and has a way of making them feel unwelcome in this group that has otherwise accepted and loved her. I'm not sure if she's aware that she is doing this, but all of the friends we had at the beginning of this journey have left &amp; she's started doing it to other new friends as well. But, because she's in a leadership position, not only is there really nothing these people can do about it, but nobody seems to have a problem with it despite people leaving &amp; newer people being pushed away.
Now, as I mentioned I really love this friend. She can be really great &amp; I don't think she's aware of this thing. My issue is, without alienating her or making her upset at me, how can I address this? It's become an issue where, at the core of this ""group"", people are not being allowed to bring new ideas to the table that she doesn't like &amp; if they do, she starts talking crap about them and acting like they're the enemy. How do I get her to be more open, less judgemental &amp; more receptive to new ideas? We're a growing group and she is not the only leader but the other leaders are also close to her and don't seem to have a problem with it/agree that the people coming up with these ideas are annoying. 
I love both my friend &amp; my group - so how do I help her become aware of this issue while helping create an environment where she doesn't feel so threatened &amp; other people are welcome to share ideas/be a part of the group just like she has been able to?",11Mar2020,1
474,My parents both work in very high risk jobs (Teacher and EMS). I have siblings that attend local schools and we live with my 81 year old grandmother. I am also dating someone with a comorbidity. Several cases have popped up near us and it looks likely that my uni will close. I sent them the CDC guidelines on what a household should do to prepare and they laughed and said they’re not concerned at all and aren’t going to change their lives in any way. My house isn’t the cleanest place to begin with and my family rarely washes its hands or has extra food stocked up.

477,"So I'm 24 years old and moving out for the first time. It's late, I know, but my economic and mental situation has made it difficult. But I'm finally getting my own apartment and I want to get my own cat. We currently have a German Shepherd and two cats at home, so I'm used to taking care of animals.

I found the most beautiful 1 year old cat for adoption. She got thousands of likes on their facebook page and I was one of the lucky few to get an appointment to come look at her. It's about an hour away, and considering I don't have my license I asked if they could drive me. Again, I know it's weird for a 24 year old to not have their license, but I've struggled with social anxiety and depression for a long time which has made it difficult for me. But I'm better now, which means I will start working on my license asap.

They just *will not* drive me. No matter what I say. I will be moving 10 minutes away from them, and they **refuse** to drop by and feed it if I'm gone for a few days. My mom spends 70% of her time at my 30 year old brothers apartment. Cleans it, buys his groceries, does his laundry etc. But they refuse to feed my cat? I don't get it. I have no vacations planned at the moment, so it's not like I'm adopting it to then just disappear. I'm studying online, so I'm home for most of the day and will be able to take care of it 100%.

I'm so frustrated because I really wanted my own cat. I'm fully capable of taking care of her myself. I will feed her, take her to the vet, play with her and make her feel safe in her new home. I'm not a irresponsible pet owner whatsoever, and they know that. I feel really unfairly treated considering all the time and money they spend on my brother.",11Mar2020,1
478,"Hello everyone. My boss is a middle-aged man, who's currently going trough the divorce.

Job itself isn't bad, but he's the problem. We're a small computer repair company, where I got a job after my partner had enough of him and quit.

Most stuff is WAY outdated. Before my partner told him that they needed a new website, the company's website was from 2004, running on ancient operating system and on some old computer buried in the basement. Even when my partner did a new website, he's been complaining that it's worse than the old one and blah blah blah.

Before I started working there I were visiting from time to time and we decided that they should have cameras with some customers losing their crap. After few weeks he said to turn off the NVR we've built from e-waste we've found lying around the shop because he ""wants to save on electricity"". The very next day customer came in who was trying to beat him up and he ended with a black eye. Justice served, huh?

After I started working there because I just recently came back to the country, I didn't wanted to sign a contract with him. I'm glad I didn't. Even though it's his job to deal with customers on the front desk, he's been forcing me to have a half of my desk free to serve the customers. Since I needed two computers and monitors to do everything I needed, I had to be very... creative with how I set the things up.

Since I'm a woman and he's a sexist asshole, he's been questioning my work all the time. For example while cleaning boards with compressor he was like ""CAREFUL YOU'LL BLOW STUFF FROM IT, IT HAS HIGH PRESSURE"". I know what I'm doing you idiot. That's what you're paying me for.

He also never  to me and if we couldn't come to an agreement, he called my partner (for some f...ing reason). It never worked though.

About 2 months ago my coworker's compressor (who fixes phones) broke so he took the one I used. I told my boss I need new screwdrivers and compressor, and I haven't gotten them up to this day.

My partner told me I should quit and honestly... kinda feel the same. Maybe I know some stuff about computers, but I hate fixing them. I'm also afraid since we mostly fix macs which are very expensive and customers usually aren't very... smart.

Now, my partner earns \~6600PLN (1750$), sometimes 7200PLN (1900$) with bonus which is quite... a lot. More than sufficient to feed both of us. My boss offered me base pay of 1500PLN (400$) with bonus, which the most I've seen was 2000PLN total (530$). I couldn't even pay a rent if I lived alone.

I told my boss that I want to quit yesterday, he told me that he doesn't even want to hear about it. So today I put my phone on silent and slept until 11AM, woke up to 18 calls from my boss and 5 text messages begging me to come in today.

I told him, you have time until the end of month to find someone else in my place. He said that he'll try to convince me to stay. Leaving would be no brainer if it weren't for the fact that it's still mostly an office job and because of my past, family situation and health back then I dropped out of high school. I'm afraid that if I let this job go, I won't find a new one. Of course I'm going back to school starting this summer (I just turned 23) but it's going to take 3 years so... yeah.

I don't need much honestly, just boring 9 to 5 office job would be fine.",11Mar2020,1

another reason i feel guilty is that my girlfriend is struggling so much too and i feel like i should be there for her like she always is for me. i feel awful because i know she’s struggling and without me there i’m scared that she won’t cope. we're kind of keeping each other sane at the moment. i don’t even know if our other friend is in school, and if she’s not i’m scared that my girlfriend will feel lonely. 

every single day, school just makes me feel worse and worse about myself. there is so much pressure put on us to do well, and it’s like they don’t really care for our mental wellbeing as long as we’re pushing ourselves all of the time. seeing people around me do so well in class and seeing people who are happy just makes me feel so insecure, and i just couldn’t be around that today. 

i don’t want to feel guilty about this, but i can’t help it when i constantly have people telling me to ‘get over it’ and ‘stop being such a baby’. i don’t know what to do or how to even start to feel better. things are just so hard right now.",11Mar2020,1

484,"So a friend of mine has a problem. His parents (who are Chinese) want to send their family to China ""for the safety of the children"" because of the coronavirus since ""China has contained it"". He doesn't know when he'll come back but he does know that they already have tickets. He has repeatedly told me that his parents are heavily biased towards Chinese media and that's likely where they concluded that it's safe to go to China. He has also said that his father refuses to accept that he is imperfect and his mother, although saying that she and my friend are equal, doesn't say anything about his father's superiority complex.

One of the main reasons he (my friend) wants to stay (in the Philippines) is because we are about to graduate from high school in one or two months and he might be troubled by online school work (since he lacks motivation to independently study) and/or might be unable to graduate.

486,"There's a girl in my class that I'm having a bit of trouble with. Just to give some context, the new school year just started where I live. We've only been in this class for around 2 months, so no-one in the class really knows each other that well. Everyone is very nice, just not close. The girl that's troubling me (I'll call her A to make things easier) is not that popular in class. She usually eats by herself at lunch, that kind of thing. She's also known for being slower, in a way, from the rest of the class. It's a bit hard to explain, but she's a bit different from the rest of the people in the class and is usually kind of excluded. Because of this, me and one of my classmates that I'm closer to invited her to eat with us at lunch one day. A wasn't rude or anything, but I just found that I didn't want to be that close to her. Like, she was nice and all, but we didn't have much in common and I just found it easier to talk to other classmates. She's also in the same extra-curricular activity that I am. Thus, we spent more time together. I still didn't feel a connection with her or anything, but I was still friendly. I guess she thought it meant I wanted to be friends because she started constantly tagging along when I went to eat with other people or randomly trying to start up conversations. Normally, I wouldn't mind this but whenever she tags along, she will always aim her questions specifically at me and no-one else. It's starting to feel like it's stopping me from spending time with my other classmates because I'll always have to answer and break away from my conversation. This sound kind of bad, but normally, I would pretend I didn't hear her, but she'll always sit directly beside me and speak in my ear. I'll always find her staring at me in class and it's getting on my nerves and it's getting creepy. It feels like I don't really have personal space when she's around. I still don't have any interest in being friends with her, but I don't know how to tell her to stop in a nice way. I'm afraid of being labelled as ""mean"" in my class because my classmates don't know me well and might jump to conclusions.

My brother is 28 years old, He still doesn't have a job, he's lazy and pretty useless and unhelpful in the house. He constantly boasts about skills we never see him use, and is extremely spoilt to the point of seeing himself above other people, even his family. 

Lately with the whole Coronavirus outbreak, despite all our efforts to change his habits, and maybe wash his hands before he touches everything in the house after coming in, he still laughs it all off as a joke and just doesn't care. 
He barges into my room like it's a bathroom, and gets on my nerves(takes my stuff, hits me ""jokingly"" and close my laptop; stuff like that)

Today was the last straw for me. He wakes my mother up and lies to her to take her to my aunt's house. Usually my mother asks him to take her but his lazy ass never does it (but now somehow he wants to do it)

Turns out he has invited his gf to come to the house, despite my mother constantly telling him he's not allowed to do that. His friends are filthy and rude just like him, and don't think twice before going to another persons house without permission. I try to clean up afterwards so my mother doesn't find out.

I've develops a lot of hate for him for these reasons. He tells me i should ""act my age"" (I'm 20 and he's 28), but i just can't stand people like him. 
I also get very angry lately when he barges into my room, i force him out and lock the door but he teases me saying he has all the door keys in the house.

Thank you in advance

I am a carer worker in the UK, I was in hospital on Friday due to chest pains (no fever) got medication for it and then on Sunday I ended up back at the hospital due to a rash that suddenly appeared on my neck and it spread on to my torso (no fever). 

I had to start work late roughly about three hours due to waiting time. I was adviced by doctors to come off all medications as it could be an allergic reaction and to make a doctor's appointment as early as possible on Monday. Went back to work and told my boss whom was covering me that I needed to make a doctor's appointment first thing on Monday. 

The thing is I didn't have a shift on my app saying I was to work Monday but I knew I had team leading training so thought I'd be spending all day in office (had phoned to double check on Friday and was told someone would phone me back but they never did and keep checking all weekend but never got anything back)later Sunday night my boss then messages me saying I have an early shift on Monday after I told her about the doctor's appointment I needed.

So here is the dilemma I worked Monday had to call boss due unrelated reasons and took a coughing fit but I thought that was due to the allergic reaction and she was saying how I didn't sound good and to cancel training I had that afternoon but kept me on shuft. I had a doctor's appointment that day after work so nothing too bad. They could hear how bad my throat was but didn't take much interest in it. 

Tuesday I was bed ridden and couldn't move and was in and out of sleep all day coughing and sweating with hot and cold chills. Called them today saying I was unwell, just on the off chance I caught something from the hospital or have a server cold.

They started chewing me out saying that I needed to get tested for the Corona virus and that I have been in contact with people and shouldn't have went to work on Monday when they put me in last minute when I told them I needed an early appointment.

I was checked three time and had no fever and doctors didn't test or show concerns during these visits either. 

It has only picked up recently within the last two days but I am now worried in case my work take legal action or something like that if it is this virus and where do I stand? Every time you phone in sick they guilt trip you to work and what not because they are shirt staffed. 

I'm scared in case I lose my job over this as I need the money. I'm waiting on a doctor's phone appointment to get this sorted but I'm angry and scared.

491,"Hi all,

So, I've always struggled with anxiety and occasionally depression (caused by trauma). However, for the past few years I've also struggled to THINK!

I used to be very motivated and was also a great thinker, constantly coming up with new ideas and also enjoyed problem solving. I excelled at university, too. My first job was awful, which is partly what I think may be the cause of this. I was shouted at by my manager for small mistakes since the first week. Told I was ridiculous, that I was costing the company money etc. My counsellor highlighted that I seem to have a dear for failure which I completely agree with.

Now, when I have a problem, I am instantly overwhelmed, as if a cloud has just floated across my brain, I struggle to think! This has led me to just ignoring problems as I'd rather not try. I feel this has also made me more lazy as I just don't think of solutions anymore because I can't be bothered.

I've also just been made redundant and I don't know what to do. 

What is wrong with me!? I want the old confident, critical thinking me back!

Any advice would be HUGELY appreciated!

497,"I've been planning about this the past few weeks and i've thought about it. I was gonna write a letter to my supposedly ""best friend"" and decide to have space for myself. But i'm still hesistating if I really had to do it.
We were a group of 4 friends. We met each other when we were still highschool freshmen. After a few days we noticed we got along fine, so we went with going out more together. Then our ""leader"" - let's call her Rue, finally puts the label ""best friends"" into our relationship.
This year we had a lot of things that we've gone through

Fast forward earlier this year, one of us announced that she's dating Rue's ex. We hid the whole thing from her for a few weeks, or for around 2 months. We were afraid that it would break her heart if she knew it immediately, that it would come across as a slap on the face since they just broke up last summer.
Then the day came when we finally told her the truth. We told her that we're sorry for hiding it, and we were only doing that because we cared about her and didn't want her to get hurt. That was a mistake. It hurt her twice as much. And I knew it was my fault, I was the one who suggested to hide the whole thing from her.
Then that's when all the drama came.
Everyone else went with other groups, backstabbed each other and gossiped. We were broken, yet we try to hang out the past few months but its just not the same.

It came to the point where they've been hanging out with different people. 
But I was the only one trying to get us all back together again. One time i'll be talking to the other side and the same with anyone else. I was trying to hear both sides and tell the other what they feel, because none of them seemed to have the courage. But the hard thing is that people would call me fake for it.

I'm not the friendliest person who easily gets along with everyone, so when they started hanging out with other people, I felt like I was left frustrated and alone. And I was focusing myself on the matter to the point that it was the only thing running through my mind sometimes. It was like, ruining me personally. And none of them even gives a shit about the situation, or even me.

We tried to hang out fir the past few months, but its not getting better.
Like that one time when I started crying,
They were literally sitting in front of me, but instead of asking me what's wrong, they started whispering. I'm not surprised that it happened though, they did it with the girl who dated Rue's ex too.

It doesn't help that Rue, who was our ""leader"" doesn't return favors. Even before all the drama. Especially me. I would always, always be there for her despite her crying about the slightest things. But she wouldn't do the same.
One time I was having a mental breakdown and she was just a about a few meters away from me.
She did nothing. I would always help her out with small things like carrying her bag, but she won't do the same.
As far as I know, friendship is a two way lane, and I feel like I'm the only one doing the efforts.

I know that I did Rue wrong, and it had a massive impact on our relationship. We don't trust with each other the same way anymore. We're broken.
I'm an asshole. I know. But when I tried bringing us all together, no one seems to give a fuck anymore. Rue seems to be hanging out more with the other group the past few days, and I couldn't blame her even. Same for the other girls.
And the insane thing about the whole thing is that, they still consider each other as best friends. And I just can't take any of this shit anymore, it's choking me. Some people say that after hardships, friendships are supposed to become stronger. But I just can't see that happening with us. And I need time to heal for myself. I felt like i've lost more of myself after the whole thing.
Now the letter i'm gonna write is supposed to be for Rue, since my relationship with the other girls seem to improve. And i've been quite closer to them because they legitimately cared about me even though they had their problems.
I'm just gonna get out of the crew, maybe i'll come back, but we never know. I think its the one thing that I really need for now, space from people who bring me down.
I still love them, but I don't think I could handle this any more longer.
I can't go on with my life like this. I've been struggling with depression and I feel like this whole thing is one of those things that are keeping me from being better.
But I still hesitate about doing it though. What if we could still fix it? What if we'll be okay? Those kind of questions keep running through my head. What if all I needed was a little bit of space?
I could only decide until today and cancel tomorrow because last day at school is tomorrow, and we'll see each other the next school year.

I don't know what to do.
Please feel free to share your thoughts.
Thanks.",11Mar2020,1

About 2 summers ago I felt an upper abdominal muscle strain / tear when I was doing a 5kg weighted ab exercise, i didn’t think much of it and I ignored it, I can’t remember if I did go to the doctors or much but I don’t remember it causing me too much hassle. anyway it’s 2 years on and I keep getting on and off stomach pain, first it started where I ‘strained’ my upper abdominal (on the left side) but recently it’s started to radiate anywhere from between under my left rib, to the centre and then to under the right rib. It mainly stays in the centre however right near my sternum but as I said it radiates and currently it feels as if it is where my liver is located. The pain / dull ache / pressure is worse when I project my voice in class (I am a teacher) and also worsens when driving and sometimes taking deep breaths. I can feel it sometimes when I lay on my side to sleep - it feels as if something is weak / dislodged. When I lay down flat on my back I can feel a weird dipping feeling right at the top of my abdomen / lower chest when breathing in, it almost has a ripping sensation but not quite. Anyway I’ve been to the doctors, first I went in November where they gave me an ultrasound and said there was nothing abnormal going on, they told me if the pain continued then I need to go back to the doctor and get different kind of scans or something- anyway by this point the pain had gone. When the pain first came on in November it was made worse by walking / laughing/ talking and seemed to stay around my left upper abdominal. The pain / pressure / ache now radiates and laughing doesn’t seemed to affect it just talking loudly engaging my diaphragm and moving in certain ways, sometimes eating too makes it feel more ‘pressure’. So I went back to the doctors the other day and he has prescribed me something for stomach acid even though I don’t have any burning sensations, he also has sent for another ultra sound and he felt around my abdomen and didn’t seem to be concerned. I got my blood done aswell for liver etc and came back clear, just waiting on stool sample and ultra sound. I’m just a bit worried because it is affecting my daily life, I’m worried I have done some damage lifting weights (perhaps breathing incorrectly when bench pressing) which cannot be rectified, I’m worried perhaps I’ve ruptured organs or weakened my abdominal wall or pushed stuff out in places it shouldn’t be in? I don’t know if I’m just being paranoid :/ I’ve stopped weight lifting and just focusing on cardio but it still doesn’t feel correct. 

I just wondered if any professionals can help me or is it all in my head ? I saw a paramedic too who did a thorough examination and he seems to think a lot of it may be anxiety related but also a possible old injury that needs to be managed. Thing is the ultra sound never picked up an injury? Or will sometimes ultra sounds not pick up older chronic type injuries? Any advice would be great thank you, I’m really worrying about this as you can tell by my essay lol.",11Mar2020,1

502,"A quick back story, I am an only child of my dad. He left my mom and I when I was younger. I don't know when exactly, but I do recall him leaving, so perhaps in late 80s. Then he started sending me to see him in 1992 for the summers. He is Laotian (asian) and can barely speak English, so there was always a language barrier. I mean I can barely speak it. 

But I dont have any memorable experiences with him. In the summers when I came, he would be at work and I would hang out with my cousins. 

He used to send me gifts or buy me things when I was younger, because I wanted it. As I grew order, those things were never truly made me happy. I wanted the dad experience, you know?

I have a step dad who raised me from the early 90's and I feel more attached to him if anything. We did things, he shared emotions and I was disciplined when needed, etc.

I came to my Dad's house because my sister said he was gonna pass (due to liver cancer) maybe in 48 hours, but the hospice nurse actually said it's a variable and could be a few weeks. 

He is very content on dying at home. I have been here for a week, and it's really depressing just to watch him wither away. I am going back home because I have to move within 2 weeks. Should I be staying?",11Mar2020,1
503,"I've been friends with the guy for years. Whenever he suffers a break up or argument with his partner (which is often as he has pretty bad depression) he calls me or texts me messages that say ""I've decided it's time. goodbye."" It happens every few months, and once I reply he'll say ""dont worry about me"". 

He's attempted suicide several times before and I've always been the one to try and talk him out of it, as he doesn't have a relationship with his family. I finally persuaded him to go to therapy last year and he went for a few weeks before stopping for a bit, but wants to start again. 

He consistently makes bad choices in his life and I often try to do what I can to support him but he ignores my advice. 

He only really messages me when he's feeling bad, and I don't mind being that friend, but his constant emotional support needs and threats are really affecting me negatively. I'm constantly worried about him and worried that if I don't drop everything he will actually go through with it and I won't be able to stop it. I know how guilty I'd feel and feel responsible for his happiness. 

I've been struggling with my own mental health recently and I confided I felt totally drained because of just how much support he (and others) need from me. I've dropped plans (even on my anniversary) to make sure I could be there for him. He's grateful, but I'm just at a point where I don't have anything left to give. It's been going on for years and I just dont know how do deal with it anymore. I feel like I've done everything I can to be a good friend.

TLDR: friend expects constant emotional support from me, threatens suicide often and disrupts my life. I feel selfish and guilty for feeling tired of it.

Hello everyone!- this is long so if you read through and comment I thank you.

ok, I live on the upper story of a duplex. about a year ago my neighbors moved in with their 1 yr old. or he was about that age. my girlfriend and I immediately understood that this meant we were going from a peaceful quiet living to one racked with disturbance. however we remained reserved on the matter as it was a very young child, and there is only so much that can be done.. so the crying and screaming etc. were reluctantly accepted.

even though we are upstairs we can hear everything, even the likes of a normal conversation given we are in the same area of the house. (standing above them as they talk) so everything else that produces noise louder than that is heard throughout the house, i.e. no escape.

now that the child is able to run things have become much worse.

before when he would cry or scream it would only take a minute, if that, for the parents to respond.. but not the running, in fact, they occasionally encourage it by chasing him, stomping around and screaming themselves. again, we have the understanding that it is a family and we should let them be during normal hours.

I must say, however, even with this ""understanding"" my temper had risen to a permanent level of annoyed, even when I was not home.. I began to dread coming home to listen to them and their activities.

the parents have finally pushed me over the edge. 6:40 am Saturday morning for the 3rd straight week I wake up to the child stomping and screaming. it continued until I got up at 7:15 and stomped on the ground about 7 times until I heard no more noise.

30 minutes later I sent a text, it read: this is your neighbor. please start having more regards for how much noise you create. 7am on a Saturday I wake up to stomping and screaming for the third time. unacceptable.

the fathers reply: you scared my son. (1 minute later) he is 2 yrs old and wakes up at 6 am (shrug emoji)

this reply made me lose my shit. BUT I decided to not reply in anger.. and rather, waited until I was calm and collected to say: for the past year I believe we have been more than reasonable with how much noise is created. as of recently, it has become much worse with the stomping. I understand he is young but that doesn't make him uncontrollable.

ill cut off my exact reply there to save space, I told him your good ppl I don't want to wake up pissed off at you guys and that I was sorry for scaring him.

he says: you are going to hear my son, we are neighbors and children are loud. that being said sorry we woke you up this morning i will do what i can.

SO my question, finally, is his or my response out of line? how would you have reacted in his or my shoes? and are there any suggestions you have if the problem persists? I'd really rather not get the landlord or the city involved.. (not that the landlord could do much)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll also add, I am not annoyed anymore.. his response shot me up to perpetually pissed off. I now hate them. I find his demeanor to be that of self-entitlement. putting himself up on a pedestal unable to be touched because he has a young child. his response portrayed that he expects anyone around him to accept anything that his child may do. like nothing he's done has been wrong, and that he as a neighbor and parent holds no responsibility for his child's noise levels.

example: instead of an apology or even a reply of understanding about the problem, his reply immediately went to attack me for my stomping followed by I can't do anything about my child. thus him sitting on his pedestal scolding me.",11Mar2020,1
507,"In debt. Credit card minimum payments to pay. Not sure what's better, to take out a $9000 21.44%APR 3 year personal loan to cover them till I get a real job (working for a new company, won't get paid in full until they get funding, plus that's a coin toss, maybe), or just take $10000 out of my IRA, and take the 10% penalty. 

The web has lots of advice on one or the other, but not which one is better. My math isn't the best. The loan is in 3 years... and will cost $3000 if I pay it back on time (should be possible). The way the market is looking now, maybe I'm saving loosing $3000 if I take out money from my IRA, and add it back in after I get a decent and stable job over the next 2 years?

Sorry this is a bit long but I do really need some help on what to do, thanks

Ok so, backstory, I had feelings for her, she didn’t, we didn’t wanna ruin our friendship, we started friends. She got a boyfriend for 2 months. They broke up at New Years. Halfway through February we both find out we have feelings for each other. She wasn’t ready to get back into a relationship at that time. Couple weeks later, she ‘asked me out’ I took things too fast and ruined it. She lost feelings. And turns out I wasn’t really what she wanted anyway.

Ok so, I’ve know this girl for over a year now and we’re really good friends. It’s annoying though cause I want to get over the feelings I have for her but I can’t. She’s everything I want, like, she’s funny, kind, supportive and all that shit. I’m not really what she wants though. She’s told me that she wants a Dom. Like someone who will take control in the relationship. She wants to be the little one. And I’d wanna be the bigger one in the relationship but I just don’t really, show it, I guess. 

Like I think a big part of it is my confidence in myself cause, ok idk if I am depressed but I just feel sad a lot and I have a lot of self problems. But when I’m with her or friends in general they go away for the most part. But uh, yeah so I guess I just don’t show I wanna be dominant and I don’t really know how tbh. Like, I don’t wanna push her boundaries and go too far cause ik it might ruin things so idk what to do.

Any help is appreciated, thanks",11Mar2020,1

I haven't been to work in about a month and they've been phenomenal with helping me out and working with me, I've called in sick yesterday and today I help my family with something's yesterday and the pain was killing me.

So whale I'm laying in bed this morning my dad comes in and starts asking why didn't I go to work, how bad is my stomach really.

 I am currently travelling Turkey for 10 more days and I made a Turkish friend a few days ago we really hit it off, he's kind of homeless, selling bracelets and postcards to tourists and travelling his own country too. I was leaving the city where we met but we decided to meet up somewhere else and travel together Turkey since he has no plans and I as am a female solo hitchhike rit will be much safer to travel with a man and even better a Turkish man.

We met in the city we told we would meet but I was 6 hours late to arrive there so he patiently waited for me. When I got there suprise-surprise. The police had stolen all his postcards and now he had 0 money. The travelling we were going together I was therefore had to pay for both of us which sounds like the oldest play in the book as he knew I was Canadian and therefore from a ""rich country"". I decided to trust him and we travelled for a few days where I would pay for all our lunches and his expensive cigarettes. I felt like I was getting played and he kept telling me that I needed him because I knew nothing of Turkey (yes I know hitchhiking is dangerous yes I know middle East, and no don't condescend me I have travelled more than you have)

I was getting pissed about that and felt like I was being dumb for letting him take advantage of me but I was also torn away because he has such a beautiful soul, is really broke and so young he is 18.  (I am 20 btw) I felt like I would rather take buses for the rest of the trip then be thought by him that I was so dumb that he could take advantage of me and manipulate me  I told him yesterday I change dmy mind and weren't going to. Travel together anymore and I. Could see that he was so hurt.

I feel bad. I don't think he was playing me I think he was genuinely so lonely after travelling for 8 months and I really broke his trust and my promise that we would travel together.

I'm about 80 lbs overweight, and for whatever reason, my belly fat just lives at the bottom of my stomach, dead center. I'm not cute and squishy- I look like I'm always 6 months pregnant and a deformed potato all at once. The fat is hard, not soft, so I've yet to find a piece of department-store shapewear that makes a difference, and the corsets I've tried squish from the sides and not the front, but I've got no side squish at all. 

I am working on getting my shenanigans together and fixing the problem, but it's not going to happen overnight and I could really use an interim confidence booster because it's very hard for me to accept my starting point and even harder to leave the house to try to do something about it (I work long completely remote days so I haven't seen the sun in an age).

First of all, sorry for the crappy formatting, I'm typing this on my phone. 

Obviously this issue isn't the only reason I am depressed. My depression is rooted deeply in my childhood and some past trauma that I've experienced in college, but what I'm going to describe next is something that has been eating me alive for weeks. I just didn't know where to unload it since I was scared people wouldn't take me seriously or say that it's not a thing that I should be upset about.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So here we go. Depression has always made it very difficult for me to enjoy things. I rarely enjoy something and my options are pretty limited since I can't be bothered by anything and nothing really holds my interest. So naturally, when I find something that I love, I cling to it and it becomes the most important thing in my life. But it happens very rarely. 

Three years ago I discovered this band that really resonated with me. Their songs, their vibe, their lyrics, everything spoke to me on such a deep level. I loved this band so much that my depression pretty much went into remission when I discovered them. I would listen to their music every single day. I joined online communities dedicated to this band, I listened to their entire discography countless times, watched all the live performances, watched all the interviews, read all the books about the band, collected bootlegs, rare pictures and so on. Basically this band became my entire life and I connected so well with their music I just couldn't be sad or depressed anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now comes the real issue. A few weeks ago I started to slowly grow out of it. I realized I no longer enjoyed their music and I started to lose interest in my favorite band every day that went by. I know it's natural to sometimes change and grow out of things but for me, this was a disaster, because I was losing the only thing that made me happy for the past 3 years of my life. I desperately tried to cling to it but the more I tried to cling to the feeling, the more I realized it was gone. Their music no longer makes me happy, and sadly, it doesn't really make me feel anything at all anymore. I started being really depressed about it. I stopped eating and drinking, and my mental state worsened so much that I became physically sick. I would vomit every day, bawl my eyes out on the floor and cry myself to sleep every night. It became an obsession. Every time I am reminded of this band that I used to like, I start crying and I become violently sick, puking and having panic attacks. A few days ago Youtube recommended me one of their songs and when I saw the song pop up in my recommended I had an instant panic attack. Nowadays I wake up and this is my first thought: the memory of something that I once loved, and I no longer love. It saddens me so much that it's making me unable to function because I lost the only thing that used to make me happy. Food is bland, movies are boring, video games have lost their charm, even playing guitar has become torturous because it reminds me of the music that I desperately want to enjoy again. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

My question is, has anyone been in a similar position? How do I stop myself from self destructing because of this? It's making me so miserable I can barely function. It's the only thing I think about and I can't stop. Whenever I hear one of their songs on the radio, I start shaking and having panic attacks. Whenever I think about them, my feelings go crazy and I start crying instantly. It's taken such a huge toll on me that I simply can't live with this anymore.",11Mar2020,1

539,"**Background story:** I have a fairly sufficient command of english compared with the other teammates (we are a group of 5) and we've been sticking together as a team since the beginning of our university life. In the beginning, they noticed that and started to allocate tasks involving english stuffs like proofreading, checking the content, logic, etc for our reports, theses,... . During class periods that are taught in english (most of the courses are in my native language), whenever there's any group discussion, i am often the chosen one to deliver the group's ideas.One time i was not in the mood for presenting my group's idea (to get some bonus points) so i went outside the classroom to enjoy some fresh air (had told my teammates i didn't feel like ''doing the speech'') and when i came back, they seemed a little bit pissed, especially this teammate (let's call her C for short). C even gave me a quick cold glance. Since then i have noticed that C started to give me more glances.

**And here it goes**

Recently, we just completed a research report for our school-wide contest. I did my old job of proofreading, content checking plus formulating the questionnaire, research model and writing certain parts of report. During this project, it was near the holidays so she returned to her hometown early and didn't appear much for discussion (i think she only joined 2 meetings). We had to call her via messenger in discussion but she said nothing much during those calls. To my surprise, no one in the team complained about that, so i kept silent.

And just four days ago, we teamworked to turn in small report on ''lean production''. There wasn't much work:  
1 to find an example of a business applying LP  
1 to describe 2 to 3 external factors that affect the application of LP (C did it)  
2 to describe the internal factors  
1 to proofread, check the content (which was me again)  
I did my normal job, highlighting and giving comment on the grammatically incorrect, incoherent, illogical parts (with my suggested correction) for them. And this morning, C called out my name in the group messenger saying that i didn't do anything much while others had to write all of the report. Again, to my surprise, 2 other teammates gave her message a like (thumb up). The leader said nothing. I only replied ''well there seem to be no more courses in english''.

Is it me or everyone in the team in the group is actually against me ? should i ''make a scene'' and sort it out directly with them or should i just leave the group ?",11Mar2020,1

543,"This happened last night, at around 21:15. I had just picked up my younger brother from a friend of his. We got home, and went in through the back door(Which we always do), walked through the kitchen, and hanged our coats in the hallway, where the front door is located(Which we never use - only when we have visitors, which we haven't had in months). Nothing seemed out of the ordinary at this point. I go to my room, a side room to the hallway, herhaps four meters from the front door, and put my headphones on. In the meantime, my brother goes to the bathroom(opposite to my room) to prepare for bed. When he unlocks the bathroom door 5 min. later, the front door is wide open. Neither me, my brother or my mom(Who was in the living room at the time) had heard anything, not even our dog reacted. No immediate sign of breaking in, despite the door being locked. My mom says she checked if it was locked before going to bed the day before, and none of us has used that door since perhaps new year, and definitly not since my mom checked it the night before. And we had just hanged our coats right next to the door, five min. before, so there is no way we wouldn't have noticed if it was even slightly open. We immediately checked that we had all our keys, and that extra key in the shed was still there, which it was. The house is in a suburban neighbourhood, with very close neightbours, but none of them has heard or seen anything. After a couple of hours of failing to find a rational solution, we called the police. No footprints were found on the paved path going up to the door, however small scratches can be seen on the doorframe, but since we rarely use the door, they could have been there since we bought the house. The police also found a fingerprint on the inside of the glass door, which is very strange since the door was cleaned on inside the week before. Unfortunately, the print was not clear enough to be of any use to police.

I know it seems very far out, but we are yet to find a rational way for this to have happened. We have since checked the whole house, to make sure somebody didn't sneek in, however unlikely that would be. No items seem to be missing, not even car keys on a table right besides the door. We have also spoken to the previous owners(Who build the house), just to make sure no other keys to the door exists.

As of now, i think the most likely thing that happened, is that someone tried to break into the house when they saw the car leave. Somehow failed to notice us parking the car in the driveway(On the other side of the house) 15 min. later, but ran away when they heard someone was home. But is it even possible to open a lock that quietly? Remember, my mom and dog was home during all of this, but didn't notice anything. And the door is pretty damn solid. What do you think is the most likely thing that happened? And do you think we should do in this situation?",11Mar2020,1
544,"So today is my birthday and my significant other bought me a present online (he's at work atm) and as the curious piece of shit that I am, I opened the package it arrived in just enough to see what it was.

546,"I live with two guys I met in college, we're all young professionals in some right. I have several issues I need to clear up with them and I'm not inclined to talk to them because, as previous actions have indicated, my wants get swept under the rug with one of them.  


Problem 1: Roommate A has a girlfriend who has a dog. The dog is big, my house is small. She is still young and does not know her size. She also has bad anxiety, and has attached herself to me. I am friendly with the dog but I don't want it in the house. When roommate A's girlfriend comes over, she stays over for a week at at time, and the dog is left at the house while everyone is at work. I wouldn't have as much of a problem with this if roommate A and his gf actually cleaned up after themselves beyond wiping up surfaces and doing their dishes\* (\*occassionally, I'll get into this later). The dog has damaged my father's dining room table significantly, and she has scratched the back of the kitchen door so much that my dad will probably have to spend about $1k to repair it. So, because the dog sheds, there is hair all over the house all the time. Several wood surfaces are damaged. The girlfriend doesn't wipe the dog's paws so there is constantly gravel and mud in the house, on carpets, backs of doors, all over the kitchen. It drives me insane, and no one except me seems to notice this stuff so I am the only one who ever cleans it.  


It also bugs me that he leaves the dog in the house when no one is home, apart from the fact that they don't clean. I have brought this up to him before, but recently he planned a trip out of the country with his girlfriend and they asked roommate B to look after the dog. They assumed they could leave the dog at our house, and they didn't ask me if that was okay, presumably because they thought I would say no. I would've. His girlfriend doesn't live here, she can't leave her dog here. My rule with him when I discussed his leaving the dog at the house had been, ""If you guys aren't here, the dog can't be here."" He completely disregarded that.  


Problem 2: Roommate A never cleans anything. If he makes a sandwich he leaves the crumbs. If the dog is over he doesn't vacuum or wipe her paws off before she comes inside. He doesn't do his dishes. He doesn't wipe down the sink or the toilet after he uses them. And then he parades around if he does do something, and demands that both roommate B and I do more than our share to clean the house of *everyone's* messes, not just ours. That shouldn't be the rule. You pick up after yourself 95% of the time, and if all of our messes happen to pile up together, then you just clean everything up. I don't bring this up to him because he doesn't change. I have brought it up before, I asked him to do his dishes or wipe up the kitchen surfaces previously, and he said he would, and he doesn't. He doesn't change. So I've stopped asking.  


Problem 3: Roommate B also doesn't clean consistently. He is better about it than roommate A, but it takes him a few days to wipe up spilled egg or sauce from the stove, for example. Dishes take a day or two to wash, and he doesn't sweep the kitchen either. I do it while he's in the room sometimes because I don't want to leave these cleanups waiting, and then I know he feels guilty if I clean in front of him. I don't intend to guilt him.  


I am more bothered by this because both have whined that the house is falling apart. I dare say if they did something to actually clean up the house for more than 15 minutes twice a month the house might not be in such disarray. I feel like they don't care about or respect the house at all, and I have personal ties to the space, which compounds that bias considerably. I feel slighted because they don't clean. I need to fix it but I'm not sure it's even worth talking to them about. Help?",11Mar2020,1
547,"Hey guys I really need help, I can't think rationally on this one.

Thank you in advance

I am a carer worker in the UK, I was in hospital on Friday due to chest pains (no fever) got medication for it and then on Sunday I ended up back at the hospital due to a rash that suddenly appeared on my neck and it spread on to my torso (no fever). 

I had to start work late roughly about three hours due to waiting time. I was adviced by doctors to come off all medications as it could be an allergic reaction and to make a doctor's appointment as early as possible on Monday. Went back to work and told my boss whom was covering me that I needed to make a doctor's appointment first thing on Monday. 

The thing is I didn't have a shift on my app saying I was to work Monday but I knew I had team leading training so thought I'd be spending all day in office (had phoned to double check on Friday and was told someone would phone me back but they never did and keep checking all weekend but never got anything back)later Sunday night my boss then messages me saying I have an early shift on Monday after I told her about the doctor's appointment I needed.

So here is the dilemma I worked Monday had to call boss due unrelated reasons and took a coughing fit but I thought that was due to the allergic reaction and she was saying how I didn't sound good and to cancel training I had that afternoon but kept me on shuft. I had a doctor's appointment that day after work so nothing too bad. They could hear how bad my throat was but didn't take much interest in it. 

Tuesday I was bed ridden and couldn't move and was in and out of sleep all day coughing and sweating with hot and cold chills. Called them today saying I was unwell, just on the off chance I caught something from the hospital or have a server cold.

They started chewing me out saying that I needed to get tested for the Corona virus and that I have been in contact with people and shouldn't have went to work on Monday when they put me in last minute when I told them I needed an early appointment.

I was checked three time and had no fever and doctors didn't test or show concerns during these visits either. 

It has only picked up recently within the last two days but I am now worried in case my work take legal action or something like that if it is this virus and where do I stand? Every time you phone in sick they guilt trip you to work and what not because they are shirt staffed. 

I'm scared in case I lose my job over this as I need the money. I'm waiting on a doctor's phone appointment to get this sorted but I'm angry and scared.

Please any advice will help",11Mar2020,1

550,"Alright, I’m a male, 24, have a work buddy of 2 years. He is 30. 
We are pretty close, or at least I thought so. This guy approached me at work last week and said that he wouldn’t invite me and my girlfriend to his wedding. We all know each other and met several times. The reason is because me and his closest friend went at each other in a group chat. He said he really hopes to remain friends afterwards. Why didn’t he maybe ask me to talk to his friend and settle things? No, he just thought - fuck me. This makes me think that he maybe was looking for an excuse to not have me there? 
So a week has passed and tbh I’m quite unsettled about it. In my opinion this is a very bold move which says a lot. 
Now I really don’t want to talk or be friends with him anymore, but I also don’t want to make no drama about this. We sit within a square meter of each other in an open space and the whole teams views us as very close buddies. 
What do I do? I also want to let him know that this is not ok. Should I speak to him about this or just pretend everything is alright and let this relationship slowly fade?

554,"So me and this once was friend got into a relationship, (we were in senior year of highschool at the time) and within probably the first two weeks of dating we started to have a more sexual relationship. I see no reason to go into full detail here, but within the first week I went over to her house for the first time and saw her naked, and the second time I went over for a few hours and she gave me a blowjob and we watched a couple movies, and things just escalated from there. For about three or four months we would both go over to her house when no one else was there on weekends and I'd spend the whole day there watching shows and fucking her, however she was always very sexual and always wanted to do it, over half the time she was the one who started it and every time we finished the first time I'd end up cuddling her and she would Within a few minutes start moving down to start it up again. It became almost a weekly thing that we would try and be alone at some point and do something, we even left school in their vehicle to go and do things quickly during lunch. But after the school year ended oh, about six months after we got in our relationship, she insisted that she wanted to break up. And despite the fact that hearing that honestly crushed me, I said ok... because if she wasn't happy I didn't want to force her to continue not being happy. Fast forward to a couple months later and she tells me that she felt like she was only being used for sex, and that I was only saying that I loved her so that I could have sex with her. We stopped talking shortly after that, because she got very upset with me and didn't want to talk to me anymore.
 
 So basically she feels like I used her for sex, and although yes we did have fair amount of sex, she constantly wanted to and almost any time I was alone with her she was trying to start it. Honestly, and I realize this might not be believable but, I would have been willing to give up any form of sexual interaction if I knew that we were going to break up because of it.
 
Basically I'd like other people's opinions on whether I was in the wrong or not, I'm not wanting to blame them I just feel horrible for them feeling like that.",11Mar2020,1

557,"So today I reached a new low by clogging my room sink with dirt. In order to save my houseplant, I took out the dead branches and roots from the pot today.

Because I didn't want to leave dirt al over my room floor, I decided to wash down most of the dirt in my sink, hoping it would flow away and I could throw the remaining pieces away.

  
Naturally, my sink now is clogged with dirt/mud and I don't seem to get it clean. The dirt now is everywhere, and water doesn't flow away now;

I'm not a plumber, nor do I have any experience plumbing (I'm a student at a dormitory.) I managed to screw of the part under the sink and put a bucket there where water could drip into. After the sink was drained this way, I used a liquid 'unclogger' following the instructions: I let the sink fill again with warm water and put in 300ml of this unclogger, which ought to sink to the drain and clean it out overnight.

Naturally, no one in their right mind ever tries to flush dirt down their sink like I did, so the unclogger is mostly supposed to clean out the normal stop (chalk, food, etc) so I'm not sure I did the right thing here.

So bottom line: sink is clogged with dirt from house plant and I need advice cleaning it out.",11Mar2020,1
558,"M22. (Backstory)I was in love with someone in high school. Most people would say ""oh you dont know what you want during that time in your life.. you are so young"". I've been through a lot in my life and one thing I've figured out is when I meet a certain person whose heart fits with mine.. well its magical. It's been almost 3 years since that relationship has ended and I still hold many memories fondly in my head. They are fresh, yet I dont see pain in them like I did in the past. 

I just met someone else the other day. I decided to jump back on the old dating app (ok cupid, only one that seems to work for me). A beutiful young lady liked me so I liked her back. She seemed to be a very outgoing introvert (my type, they tend to attract to my personality). I proposed we go do karaoke because her profile said she would crush anyone in karaoke, but I'm the karaoke king so.. well... the date was amazing. The bar was a bit run down but the people in there where having a good time and so where we! When she went up to sing, she blew my socks off.. she had a VERY BEUTIFUL VOICE. So I put on a good show and she was into my performance :p. We decided to cut that bar short and try to find a place to dance.. which was unsuccessful.. so we went back to my place! ;)

As I stated in the first paragraph. Our hearts matched. It was beutiful. I knew what was on her mind and Visa versa the whole night. There where huge amounts of exact personality traits shared between us. She was like an exact replica of where I was at 1 year ago. Doubts in my head, sadness around me, looking for somthing. I'm not that way anymore but I could see pain in her. She opened up to me and I to her. She made multiple claims she would leave in the night after I fell asleep but I told her to just enjoy her time and that I would drive her or uber her wherever in the morning. (We ended up taking a shower and getting coffee and I dropped her off)

What she told me was she works for herself(I find individuality super attractive as well) and has not been back to her home state in a LONG time(give or take a year). She also repeated that anyone who wants her under her working circumstances would be crazy. She also told me she pushes people away more often than not. (Again I understand how she feels because I've been in that exact place before)

I want to be in her life. I'm not tied to ""I HAVE TO BE WITH THIS GIRL OR NOTHING"" like.. someone who I match with so well is someone I just want in my circle. So HERE IS THE SITUATION.

She gave me a snapchat. No number, no Instagram. She doesnt want commitment.
She has no clue when she will be back.

I dont care about the time.
I plan to keep my distance but regularly send her happy messages and updates on my life.
I'm not gonna over push.

What else should I do? Any advice in general would be great. Regardless my heart feels weird,and I feel kinda...sad? But kind happy? Haaaaaa.",11Mar2020,1
559,"I am already 23 but I have never had a relationship. No MU, no dating, none of those things. 

You see, I am quite goal-oriented. When I was in high school and all of my classmates were having relationships, I told myself I am too young to deal with emotional hurdles like that. When I was in college, I told myself I have to study first because things like that are just distraction. I successfully graduated and now that I am on my first job, my officemates were so surprised when they knew I have never had a boyfriend, much less have been courted. 

Looking back, I know I wasn't very social. But tbh there weren't any guys who made moves. None that I can recall. I have a lot of female friends and am mostly casual around guys because I don't know how to befriend them. Now, going back to my situation at work, my officemates (who have been married and have children) were telling me that I should have a relationship. Even my older brother says so. They said timeline wise, I might get compromised. So I did a little math.

I am 23 now, basically I only have 6 more years to have my first child birth (because it is recommended for first time moms to give birth before 30) so it means I need to be married probably a year before that. If I were to find a meaningful relationship, I'd need at least two to four years to know my partner well (some might argue that time is not a determinant for a successful relationship, I agree, but let's be honest, you need to get to know the person WELL). Plus the fact that I am to get my licensure examination a year from now (hopefully) to be a licensed architect. I'd be 24 then, plus the four years I would be in a relationship. Latest age I would be if ever I would give birth is 28 or 29 which is dangerously close to 30. Also, its not like finding a guy to be in a relationship with happens in a snap of a finger. The deadlines are all too tight and Im wondering if im the only one thinking this way? 

Also, im starting to think that the problem must be in me. My doubts are starting to creep in. Am I too weird? Am I not agreeable enough? Am I not likable? Am I not fun to be with?

560,"So, long story short, I learned german in a year and started university in Frankfurt, Germany and my whole course is in german. And i can barely go through my exams. Don't get me wrong, my german may be a bit broken but i do understand what i'm studying, i understand the questions and everything but when it comes to exams, i just don't know how to read anymore. So, first semester went alright, second semester, i failed 2 papers out of 5 , so in my third semester, i took only those two papers because i also started a new job and had to find an apartment and this would have also given me time to improve on my language skills. I just completed my forth semester and that's when i realised that i really have a problem and i'm trying to figure it out before things get even worse.

So, i had already lost a semester and i didn't want that to happen again. So as from day 1, i tried my best to study everything. I was rarely slacking off and during Christmas Break, i was in fully committed to my studies. I spent nearly everyday studying like a madman, working questions, past exam papers, model exams but when it was time to answer my actual paper, i just couldn't remember anything. I know that i could have done well because the very moment i got back home from the exams, i just knew what i had to write down and this is the worst feeling ever. 

I just got my results and i failed again and this will cause me to loose another semester because the paper(s) that i just failed are pre-requisite for some modules in the next semester and theses modules are pre-requisites for the Seminar which also needs to be passed before i can start my BachelorArbeit. All in all, if i manage to pass everything in one go, its another semester added and i'm started to doubt my ability to pass everything in one go.

I am starting to get a bit fed up with this whole situation because i am starting to get the feeling that i am just a fraud who convinced himself that he could study in a foreign country in a foreign language and also convinced my parents that i could do it. I also feel like i am just deceiving them, wasting their time and their money. I don't really have friends here who could help me with study groups and i basically here on my own and i am scared that i wouldn't be able to make it to the end before they kick me out. This whole Germany situation also started to make me Paranoid. In the past years, every project that went downhill just when i had too much invested but not enough to actually make something out of it, its like everything fails just when its too late to back down and i am starting to feel the same thing will happen again. And i think my anxiety is hitting an all time high also, i haven't spoken to my dad in a while (he's very supportive, but with work and studies and his crazy schedule, it was hard to call him) and i don't know how to break the news to him. All i ever wanted was to be done with this thing as soon as possible so that i could be more independent and be able to repay them for all the support that i have given them but........

I just want to give up because i feel that i'm just wasting everyone's time, money and effort and i will just let them down but again there is still a chance that i may get it right and do pass but is it worth the risk, i don't know anymore. Lately, I have been waking up in the middle of the night having weird dreams/nightmares about University, and when i wake up in the morning, i have a raging headache and the first thing i want to do is just throw up. I have lost my appetite and i just turned 23 and its bee 4 years since i left high school and 3 years in Germany now and seeing my friends graduating, getting new jobs, cars, getting married just bummed me out. i can't even speak with someone, fearing that they will judge me because of my German. I had to force myself to go to the counselling office today hoping that there was somewhat of a miracle formula to get me out of this hole.

With my luck, i'll get kicked our of university, the corona virus will be raging in Germany, and i will not be able to get back home because of this. I feel like subconsciously, I'm just looking for a way out and sabotaging myself. Does anyone have some advice on how to deal with this situation. I know that i sound like I'm just whining, which I'm probably doing, but all i am really looking for is some advice on how to deal with this situation.",11Mar2020,1
561,"Right now I’m 22 years old, never been to university or college. I’ve been working minimum wage at different places for a while and there is no job that I liked in particular. 

If I had to describe a job I see myself enjoying it would have these requirements.

An office job. My own room with a desk and computer were I spend most of my time. 

Not outside. Completely indoor, I’ve been working outside since I turned 18. 

Travel is a bonus, but not required. 

No customer interaction. I’ve also grown tired of dealing with the public in one of my many jobs in the past. 

Maintaining a website or writing articles may be something I’m interested in.

562,"I was in a committed long distance relationship for 6 months, and two months before we were a thing before making it official. We made efforts to see each other every month as we were only 4 hours away by plane. She was the best person I have met and made me feel a way that no one else had, and she had done things for me that no one else has either. I trusted her when we were apart, as thats what relationships are about, trust and love. Just last week I lost her as my girlfriend and we broke up.. 

Heres the story..

Her ex-boyfriend is so prevalent in her life even more so now that we have broken up.. She knows how I feel and how I felt about him, but she didn’t do anything about it. Not too long ago, during one of my visits to her I found out that a couple days before I arrived she had met up with him in the middle of the night. She lied to me that night telling me she was with another friend but instead she was with him. I stayed up until she got home, and tried texting her when she was out. She told me she got home at around 2am, and still continue to ignore until 4am.. I was suspicious at that night, but everything was confirmed the first night I was in the country visiting her and It broke me and the trust I had for her. I was never able to talk about this incident with her because whenever I brought it up she shut it down because she feels so much shame and upset towards it, I never got the closure I needed for that and any reassurance. I put everything aside and forgave her because I wanted things to work out and took whatever she said and accepted it, plus I only had a couple days there so we tried to make the most out of our time. After this, she told me she would block him and she did because she knew what she did was wrong. I am never the type of person to tell my girlfriend or anyone not to talk to anyone or anything like that as that is quite controlling and I am not the type. But this time, I didn’t stop her I told her to do it because I was broken and the trust I had for her was no longer the same.

Anyways, jump back to the past couple weeks now her ex-boyfriend broke up with his current girlfriend of the time because my girlfriend of the time and him were getting closer and he thought he had a chance. Yeah.. She unblocked him and started talking to him again. After a while I couldn’t handle it anymore, she didn’t respect my boundaries or how I feel towards him, she just didn’t care despite the numerous times I told her I dont like it. I told her I dont want him to be a part of her life anymore and she resisted. She knew exactly how I felt towards him but she resisted and told me no and that she wasn’t going to do that. I gave her an ultimatum.. (Something I never thought I would do), I told her if she wants to keep him in her life that much then she can, but if she does I am not going to be sticking around if you do. I gave her all my reasonings and explanations as to why but she still didn’t do it.. So I told her, if you are choosing your ex over me, I am not sticking around. I broke up with her on the spot.. She texted me again after and told me not to break up with her and she was really upset, I told her all I wanted was for her to do this one thing for me, I never asked her for anything else, but the one thing I had she wouldn’t give me. She gave me her reason on why she told me no, and it was because she never thought I would leave her. This made me feel like shit, I felt so dirty and walked over but I didn’t say anything or do anything about it, she told me she would change after that but I took her word for it because I wanted change and I hoped to see the best in her..

Now in the past week, we had another fight regarding her ex.. She texted him again and unblocked him and brought it up after hiding from me for a while after me constantly asking her and pressing onto her about what she’s doing. Whenever I asked she snapped at me sounding so annoyed, but later she gave in and told me she was texting her ex. She said it so casually as if she didn’t care about anything and how I felt. That was my last straw, we had a fight over how I felt as if she was just walking over me and didn’t care about how I felt and how she is always prioritising and choosing her ex over me. I felt ashamed and broken myself, to even be in this position. I broke up with her for the final and last time. I cried myself to sleep, and a while after I fell asleep she called me crying asking me not to leave her but I couldn’t go back to it.. I had to do it for myself. I told her “I know how this is going to turn out if nothing changes and I gave you so many chances to change but you have always let me down.. I tried seeing the best in you but when the opportunity presents itself, you just let me down.. I can’t do this anymore and I had to do it for myself.”. Ever since, I have felt nothing but guilt and sadness.. I want her back and I feel so guilty and so shit about it. I dont know what to do and I just want her back but I know I really shouldn’t… It just hurts so bad :(",11Mar2020,1
563,I’ll make this pretty quick. I’m currently at a job with a company that is comfortable for me as I’ve been in role for almost 2 1/2 years and have a good handle on the area i manage. My salary is 110k a year with bonuses on top of that and for the most part day to day I’m happy and the team i oversee runs fairly well. I have the opportunity to take the same role in my company but managing something more complex for 130k a year. It would most certainly be a lot more work to get the team moving as fluidly as possible and getting them to the point of where my current team is at. The new role would most certainly be a good springboard in to a higher level promotion if I ever decided to go that route.  Am I crazy to give up something I’ve got going well right now and is comfortable for an extra 20k a year and most certainly more stress?  Thanks in advance.,11Mar2020,1

566,"He is in the military so when he was gone he came back with a lot of new girls on his Snapchat. I know they are his friends but it still just makes me uncomfortable. I normally am not the jealous type so this issue has put a new type of problem on our relationship and it’s hard to know how to solve since it’s never came up before. However he is the jealous type he would always get upset with me if I met a guy and added him in my Snapchat so I would Unadd them because his feelings matter more to me than the person being on my Snapchat. So it’s also like the the tables were turn, and i went to the military and added a bunch of guys and came home he would be even more mad at me. But I can’t get him to see where I’m coming from.
 I know they are his friends but especially since he met these girls during our long distance relationship and being I have never even heard of them because he never talked about them weirds me out. And I can come to terms with it and just accept it but it’s like he would let me go on his phone before he left. Not to snoop but just to play the games in his phone or look at his stories with him but now he doesn’t even let me touch it. So that’s just a red flag to me. 
And on top of it, I got a little upset and mad at him about it because he wasn’t listening to me about my concerns, just defending his actions and instead of just talking about it, he brought up breaking up. 

I don’t know if I’m just being a crazy gf about this or just a little selfish of me to not want all those girls in his Snapchat, or if maybe my concerns are valid but I just need advice on if I should just let it go or bring you to him that it really makes me uncomfortable.",11Mar2020,1

Recently tho they seemed very close and now even ignore me when I’m hanging out with them. They seem to disagree with me or cringe when I make jokes (which before didn’t happen). I’ve been having family issues and I would have bad moods but whenever I want to talk one of them they seem annoyed by my bad mood and even complains I sometimes ruin their mood.

However now my mother belittles me and makes me feel useless. (To everyone else she has a heart of gold) She doesn't realize she does it. Also every time I try to get a new hobby, friendship, relationship she would put someone else responsibilities on me. It ranges from taking care of kids, house sitting in a dangerous neighborhood so I can't leave the house alone, makes me clean the entire house, or puts herself right in the middle of it ruining my chances to build connections. Every time I'd refuse she would guilt trip me until I agree. Now I've taken care of her for those 10 years. I would comfort her, clean up after her, make sure she is fed, take care of her health when she get sick which I had to give up high school to do. Due to her bipolar I can't confront her without her having a spiral of emotion which normally leads to a suicide attempt. We live in the middle of no where that is a fly in only community and puts extra expenses on me that I dont have to pay. Very limited jobs if none available.

575,"Compared to the posts published here, my request is really silly but it's been bugging me so here we go.

One of my high school friends has always been fascinated by Japan. Back in high school, she was what some would call a weeaboo (perhaps?) but I think she grew out of the cringy aspect and now has a genuine interest in Japanese culture. She went there as an exchange student once and regularly goes back for tourism whenever she can.

Anyway, that was for context.

This same friend likes to cook and has cooked Japanese food for us a few times when we visit her. Although I do not share the same intensity/dedication as her, I am interested in cooking and baking too and I really enjoy Japanese food. I'm trying to learn the dishes I usually eat in restaurants because: 

1/ it's fun to learn new recipes
2/ I'm a university student on a budget (and I realized it's less expensive to make stuff yourself than pay for a small portion for more money)

Today, I wanted to cook okonomiyaki. I watched multiple videos about it on YouTube and wrote down the recipe the way I always do (I write down the common ingredients and then try to figure out why this or that ingredient (which isn't common) has been added and if it's worth adding it or not). I remembered that my friend has cooked okonomiyaki for us once and she was very proud of the result, she told us she got the recipe from the mom of the Japanese family she stayed with during her exchange and since she was running a bit late, we arrived while she was cooking and we stayed with her in the kitchen and watched her while she cooked.

So at the beginning of the day, I asked her for her recipe/steps of it to compare with what I had written down and surprisingly, she told me she didn't have a specific recipe, that she just buys okonomiyaki kits from Japan and that it includes special powders/flours that I wouldn't be able to find in our country and I know for a fact that she wouldn't have been able to purchase it because she hasn't been there for more than a year (and yeah, no one around her went there recently to bring her the kits). I asked her about the sauce (which I DISTINCTLY remember her preparing in front of me because she told me ""I made sure to pick alcohol free products since you can't have any"") and she said she didn't know so I dropped the subject.

Obviously, I'm not mad at her and I'm not gonna bring this up again, if anything, this whole thing just confuses and amuses me at the same time lol I'm just gonna do my own thing but I have been wondering all day long about the reason why she wouldn't want to share the recipe with me? Is it because it's her Japanese exchange family one?

If you read all of this one, then congratulations! you successfully wasted time but here's a cookie because you wasted time on me &gt; 🍪

(PS: the only update I'll provide is whether or not I successfully cooked my okonomiyaki!)",11Mar2020,1
576," Sorry I couldn't think of a better title, I'm very stressed at the moment.

So  my crush and I are both 16. We were born five days apart. We've been  close friends for about five years now, and we've both hinted that we  like each other. To the point where we both know we like each other, but  haven't said it out loud.

She's  rather shy around anyone but me and my Mom thinks she's avoiding her  because she never speaks to her or waves or acknowledges her at all.

My  Mom feels she's already being excluded from my relationship with this  girl. I know all this from a not I accidentally found on the table. My  Mom writes things down when she's stressed. It's how she lets it out.

My  Mom means well and is a very caring person. I think she's just not sure  what to think about this girl cause she's never really met her.

The  girl thinks my Mom dislikes her, but I forgot exactly why she thought  that. One time she asked me ""Does your Mom dislike me?"" I answered ""No,  she's just never really met you so she's not sure about you.""

I  was thinking of suggesting that the girl maybe smile and wave when she  sees my Mom and speak to her when the opportunity presents itself.

I’m upset because I get that it could be annoying to try and reschedule my test but it’s not like I’m purposefully blowing it off. I have no idea what to do about this. 
There’s also another teacher, who’s really strict about assignments. I’ve been in and out of sleep the past few days and forgot to turn an assignment in this morning online. They sent me this email saying it’s required that I turn all homework in for the class, and I’m worried they’re going to take points off of the assignment if I email it to them this afternoon. I know it’s partially my fault, but I’m also on bed rest and super exhausted. How do I email them letting them know that I care about the assignment, but I honestly couldn’t turn it in the morning?

I've made a whatsapp group for people that like to tennis. (I'm 26M)
Among me, there are 2 other guys and 3 girls. 

We were arranging a meet-up and came to a concluding date and hour along with some banter.

When all was said and arranged, the silence was broken by one of the girls that uploaded 2 screenshots of our actual conversation along with the following comment: ""this conversation...""
It grabbed my attention that my banter was the subject of the screenshot. 
She's one of the shy girls that never really responds much. She had only been around a few times. 

Before I realized it, she deleted both pictures and her message. 

I responded a while later with a meme that said ""When you accidentally send a screenshot to the person you took it from."" I said I found it quite funny and that I too had mistakenly sent a pic once. I thought she was maybe talking to her friend about me, possibly being interested. 

The shy girl replied it wasn't meant bad in any way and was directed to her friend. 

Meanwhile, the other girls that were involved in the screenshot banter were really suspicious about it. They suspect her from talking bad about us, she denies it. 

Stuff is getting sour and really confusing, how do I recover from this, how do I handle this? I just want to have fun and possibly get to know new people.",11Mar2020,1

I’ve been feeling pretty homesick for a while and was hoping to go and visit my family in the UK at the start of April for two weeks. Today it has been announced that Malta is cancelling all flights (I believe)  to/ from France, Switzerland, Germany and Spain. 

I live alone here so the idea of getting sick here is pretty terrifying as being alone in quarantine for 2 weeks might actually drive me insane. Additionally my dad was very sick last year and has heart problems as a result of this. I worry a lot about him getting the virus because I know that people with underlying heath issues don’t seem to be fairing to well. If he were to get sick, I don’t want to not be able to visit him, he truly is my best friend.

So I suppose my question is, what would you do? Would you stick to the initial plan and go in April? Would you get the next flight out instead? Or would you sit it out and not go home at all? I don’t want to be selfish and I understand the importance of heard protection so that’s why I’m looking for outside opinions.

One day I was walking from school to Home, and I met this guy who was younger than me (by a year) and we had a discussion on a art, we talked about Art School and the subject of our Art accounts came up. We exchanged our accounts and later had no in-person interactions. Somehow he got snapchat a week after my getting my art account which was attached to it before. After that he kept sending me his versions of my drawings, my personas, my Cartoon ideas... everything I ever mentioned or drawn he drew. At first I thought it was flattery until I realized he does these drawing the hour I post them. And one day I looked in my snap stories to see who were looking first (I was bored) and every time he was there, this drew red flags for me, soon after I decided to remove him from my snap location. And which leads us to yesterday, he spammed 15  me asking me for my phone number, I left him on read.

601,"Me[24F] and my boyfriend[35M] have been together for 7 long years. His temper has escalated over the years and he began physically abusing me about 4 years ago. 

I fell into a really bad suicidal depression about 2 years ago because I lost the support of my friends and family due to me choosing to stay with him and on top of that I was pregnant and miscarried at 16 weeks. 

I hated him at the time but once he saw how depressed I was, he eased up and became that hero in my life again. He was loving and caring. He showed me that he was all I needed in this world and I fell for his evil ways again. This honeymoon phase only last about 6 months and he was right back to beating my face in. 

Recently I’ve found myself become more and more numb to getting hit. It still physically hurts but not like it used to. I emotionally feel NOTHING when he hits me now. In the past, I would always feel an aching pain in my heart and have hurt feelings but now I feel no way about it and I just want to sleep it away. I literally just go lay down and fall asleep. 

I don’t speak to him at all anymore unless he speaks to me. I don’t ask him for anything anymore and I just don’t trust him overall. Everything he does and has done for me emotionally, financially, etc. is calculated. Somehow it’ll be thrown in my face and used as leverage to hurt me emotionally or physically. 

I’m honestly scared that I will fall back into that state of depression I was in and I don’t want that. I can tell that he’s noticed my change and he’s trying to be that nice guy again. I feel myself falling for the lies again but I know they’re lies. I don’t get it. I 100% KNOW for a fact know that’s he’s lying to me, I know he’s gonna hurt me again  and I know he doesn’t care about me BUT I feel myself wanting to love him again. Idk if I hope that he’ll love me or what but it makes no sense and I can’t understand it. 

He says that he wants me to have his child soon and to marry me but I am sure that this is calculated too. This is the thing that hurts my feelings the most, is that he only wants me to have his child and marry him because he wants to have leverage on me. Also that after being with him for all of these years how can he not love me or at least respect me a little more. Like how after 7 years can someone not at least care for someone who’s been loving and genuine with them to some capacity. 

I don’t get why I love and care so much for someone who I know doesn’t care for me. I literally know all his games and tactics and I still want him. I feel like I’m my own worst enemy.

602,"The ghosts of my past (I had a severely abusive and unfaithful long-term partner) tend to appear and taunt me in situations that seem familiar to ones I have been in before. I don't like how this presently effects how I feel in social settings and how it effects my current relationship. 

My current concern is regarding how I feel threatened in situations where my partner will be potentially interacting with other females.

Example: I can recall a time when my ex was chatting up a female acquaintance of mine one evening while we were all hanging out, and he was trying to make her laugh, was really zoned in to her and was completely ignoring me. Later that evening he had her over to his place and ended up sleeping with her. Then they both lied to my face when I confronted them about it. 

So, let's say my current partner and I get together with some friends, and my current partner is having a conversation with a female there (acquaintance or someone new to us both) and he is making her laugh, and is seemingly really into his conversation with her. I immediately become uncomfortable/worried and I feel my heart rate increase, I feel my body get hot and I feel red with anger. It feels so threatening to me to observe and be present for this interaction. I don't react to it outwardly, I do trust my partner and I know he has my best interest at heart always, but the feelings from the familiarity tend to take over me entirely. It's so bad that I often try to avoid attending social events where I don't know who all will be there simply because I'm afraid of having that feeling come up.

Does anyone have any tips/experience they can share that could help me to try and overcome this? (I have been in counseling for 2 years and it has helped a lot! I'm just still trying to work on these little situational matters.) 

Tl;dr: Due to my past unfaithful and abusive relationship I have a hard time feeling comfortable with my current partner talking and being friendly with other females. I know this is unhealthy, I do not attack my present partner for these feelings I have nor do I act upon them in anyway. I would like advice on how I may overcome this issue because I hate the feelings of jealousy or insecurity that come up in these situations. I want to feel free and comfortable again!",11Mar2020,1

604,"I (17f) have this online best friend (15f) whom I met 3 years ago. We met through Wattpad because she was an avid reader of my writing, then I read some book, interacted with it and it turned out to be hers. Our conversations moved to instagram, then on messenger. Since then we've created a bond not like any other online friendship I've ever had. 

About a couple of months into the friendship, we started video chatting each other. I remember the first time so vividly in my head, and I recall both of us crying at the realization that the both of us were real people and not catfishers. We've had occasional video chats here and there. 

In summer 2018, we made another friend (16f *rn*) and from there we became this very close trio. We started doing roleplays online, and that was the thing other than talking that gave us leisure. The year was great, with occasional bad days here and there. I'm usually the one that comforts the two. I set aside other things for them, and I guess I was fine with it still because the shitty days were at balance with the good ones. When it was me that had the bad day, thwy would send gifs of my Kpop biases to cheer me up, and respond a lot to what I said. The thing is that the friend we made in 2018 became a little absent because she had her phone confiscated by her dad to focus on studies. Regardless, We had laughs often, we greeted each other good mornings in the morning before school and bid each other good night and i love yous at night before bed. We even shared promises of meeting each other one day.

Around the start of 2019, I started getting feelings for one of them (the youngest one), but I never really admitted it because back then I was still a closeted bisexual (still closeted, just not to them though). I got feelings for her because, I don't know, I admired her so much. 2019 was also a really shitty shitty year for me. All of us. In march I broke my foot from tripping off my bus, which made me not go back to my province, I wasn't able to go to this K-pop concert I had been saving up for, and I had to keep getting reminded that my accident was my fault and that it was a burden. 

Halfway through the year though, I realized she liked me since 2017 then stopped early 2019, but by the time I realized that, I have already established that maybe I just admired her cause she's so talented, pretty, and all that other cheesy shit.

Anyways

So it was a shitty start for me, and the Wattpad friend started getting more and more depressed too. I always told her that if she needed to vent anything, I was one to trust, so she did. I now know a lot (but not all) about her struggles and stuff. That year too, she started getting nightly nightmares. Basically more shit started happening to her. Things continued throughout the whole year, and in this year, we rarely video chatted. I am to blame for that though, because when she does want to video chat or we both miss it  I'd always be busy or somehwere important. Truth be told sometimes I just fear that when we do video chat, we'd run out of things to say and it would end up awkward and shit. So yeah. She became very open about her problems that year, or rather she was just very bad at hiding it, so I usually asked her how she was doing since I was very concerned. Even with my irl friends I'm the one that notices if people aren't okay, so I do my best in cheering them up or comforting them. She's had so many suicidal thoughts over the year that I've always tried helping her out of. Unlike the last year, when I'm down or sad, she barely sent gifs anymore, nor did she comfort me the way I kind of expected her to or the way I was used to. Sometimes when I'd be ranting about school things, she'd be in and out of onversation doing something else, unlike when it was me, I'd set aside literally everything to stay in the conversation reading whatever it is she has to say. 

It has also come to the point that I...absorb her emotions? Like when she's down, I suddenly become down too because I know she deserves to be happy. But at the end of everything, we'd be okay and still roleplaying.

In this year, on the days she was okay we started making wallpapers. We promised each other to keep those wallpapers as our lockscreens until the day wr all meet and we take a proper picture. In this year as well, we sent pictures of the skies and grass (cause she lives in the countryside) and pictures of skies and buildings (cause i live in the city) 

In the middle to end of the year I started feeling less cared for, since the cycle was all the same. I was putting effort into everything I did to cherr her up, comfort her, or give her advice, but when it was me she didnt even know how to comfort. She's told me that she doesn't know how to though, and I understand. But It kind of just bums me out how before she would do it just fine. Perhaps her struggles got to her. I couldn't even open up anymore, or even be obviously down like she could be, because my mentality is that when I'm sad when she's sad, I'd sound like I'm stealing the spotlight, so I pretend to be okay just to help her. But when I'm sad and she's happy, I pretend to be the same because....wow....for once she's happy. 

We still said i love yous before bed that year.

Then 2020 came. We all had hope for the year but then...it started off pretty shitty. For her mostly. Her nightmares got worse and she even started self harming. to put it simply, depression ate her up. I remember her leaving the friend group chat we had due to some misunderstanding, and I remember spilling to her nearly everything I said in the last paragraph. We had a deep talk about it and I thought everything would get better but it didn't. It got worse. Mornings when she'd be okay were very rare, she doesn't say i love you anymore and I don't know. For some reason it hurts me. It hurts to think that she's hurting. It hurts to know that someone as deserving as her is feeling like shit everyday. I hate to admit it but sometimes it gets tiring always putting my own mental health aside for hers, but I could never tell that to her face because then she'd feel like a burden and her anxiety will make her think we don't deserve her. It alsonhurts when she sends me pictures of her cuts cause it fucking hurts. It just hurts. 

Our other friend and I are the only ones saying I love you now, and admittedly I changed my locksreen to something else outnof doubt. 

I don't know what to do. I hate how everyday my anxieties usually stem from wondering how shes feeling, and if she's cut or done something that day. I don't want to lose her physically, and I don't want to lose her as a friend either, but I hate to admit how a lot of my pain last year and so far of this year is because of all this. My psychologist told me to detach myself from emotions shes feeling, and learn to take care of myself, but it's not just her to be honest. In real life I have also put so much aside for others. 

I don't know what to think or do. I don't know what to feel either because this person is someone with obvious mental health issues and I don't want my thoughts of feelings to be the reason why shed feel like a burden or feel like she should die

605,"I have a four hour drive to my parents house. I can leave at 10 PM or wait until morning. I'll only be on an interstate for about an hour and a half. The rest of the trip will 2 lane roads through rural areas.

606,"I need some advice 

I'm 25m my girlfriend is 23f we've been together around six months it's getting pretty serious and she's moved in with me since it dident make sense for us to be paying 2 rents when we were together all the time anyway. 

A few nights ago we were sort of arguing about where we would stay on a trip we're taking soon. (It was the dumbest arguement ever we were just deciding what hotel to book and we disagreed.) 

There was some yelling and I got annoyed and kind of went to stomp away outside ( childish I know) 

Anyway I go to walk out the door cause I was sick of yelling and it's like a glass sliding door and she's standing right next to where you walk out. Before I walked out the door I looked at her and she looked horrified and I realised she must've thought I was walking toward her instead of out the door. 

I probably should've just walked out the door but I felt guilty for scaring her and tried to hug her. She jumped away from me though. At which point I laughed and told her I only wanted a hug ( I realise she must've thought I was trying to hit her or something) 

She relaxes after I say that and she hugs me. But she's been acting weird ever since .. she's been so quiet which is very unlike her. I made sure to let her know that I wouldn't ever be violent toward her and I apologised for accidentally frightening her but she still dident stop acting weird ? 

I asked her last night if she booked the room for our trip and she looked like she was scared because I had asked. She told she booked the one that I had wanted. Which I did not expect... I fully expected her to still get the one she'd wanted and tell me to go suck myself like she always says to me... 

Idk I'm starting to get uncomfortable because she's acting like she's afraid of me. 

I really dident mean to frighten her like that. I'd never lay my hands on a female. How do I get her to relax again ? I feel really bad about this

My brother has been nothing but mean to me for no reason for maybe 8 months now(I’m 21F). I’ll just be sitting on the couch and the only words he’ll say to me all day are “you’re fat and stupid”(which I’m neither) and I feel like I have every right to be upset with him. He has nothing but disrespect for my mother and he gets away with everything he does. I’m just tired of my brother treating everyone like shit and not getting called out or punished for it by my mom. My mother claims it’s “just his age” but I think that’s bullshit. He never used to be like this, just quiet. I’m just tired of him getting a pass on everything. He even treats my dog badly, he “plays” too rough with him and it really gets on my nerves. I have no idea how to tell my mother she’s enabling his behavior bc she’ll just say “he’s the second child, of course he gets away with more than you did..you were the first child.” When I was depressed/borderline suicidal she told me I was just sad and I’d get over it, yet the ONE time my brother says he wants to die, she’s bawling and freaking out. She’s the reason i haven’t gone to therapy or tried to get on medication bc i know she’ll make this big deal out of it and make me feel even worse. She makes me feel like I have no right to be upset with either of them and I need some outside advice from people who don’t know us personally. Am I justified?

615,"Hello,
My mom works for a county school. However, every few months I get complaints about how she is being treated and how they're trying to push her out. 
The first few times I felt bad. But eventually after all these years, i have to start believing it's an issue with her .

She makes me update her resume every time and tells me on the verge of tears how mean her coworkers and superiors are to her. I don't know if a language barrier is part of the issue. 
She does get along with some people but overall, she ends up having to change school or district. 

I get irritated and try to reason that there must be something she is doing or perhaps she has depression that makes her assume people dont like her. 

I dont know what it could be or how to help her. It's been almost 10 years and the longest she has been in a school is almost 2 years. I have to believe 2 schools were actually a toxic environment but after that I am not too sure.",11Mar2020,1
616,"So we had been together for over 4 years going on 5 and we have a house, 2 cats and a dog. We had argued before about me working too much and never being home. We’re both in college and I’m going to graduate while she has one more year. 

I’ve figured out what I am doing and I’m getting job offers that are an hour or more away from our house. I was excited at the job offers and she starting telling me I’ll never be home and she’ll never see me, but I’ll work Mon-Fr   2pm-11pm
And I’ll be off weekends. 

So we argued about how I’m trying to work hard and provide for us, and she doesn’t know if commitments right because she has no clue what she wants to do and she wants to travel around like she’s always wanted.

We had a sit down and talked about our lives and our relationship and where it’s going. We talked about the good times and cried and figured it’s best if we split ways. I agreed I’d take the dogs and she’d take the cats. I’d try and move out and find my own place while she stays in the house and gets help from her parents to pay the bills.

***After that conversation, she went to sleep at her parents and I’d stay in the house til I found somewhere to stay. Well she came home crying saying how much she missed me, and how we might be doing the wrong thing, and we should try to work things out. Well I told her we shouldn’t fall back into it because we both had agreed to live our own lives and be happy and work on each other until one day we could come back and see if it’ll work after a year or two of us finding out our lives after college.

**so I moved out really fast feeling like I need to make the first move to finalize the break up and made her cry. So I moved to a rental my parents own, they didn’t tell me It didn’t have water so I couldn’t stay there, and now I’m back living with her and sleeping in the same bed.

**Should I still try to move out and fix that rental and be myself for once finally after 5 years and hours my life out, or should we ignore all the emotions we talked about and just work it out.

She has me confused and was telling me we should do our own thing — but on the other hand came back crying explaining how she doesn’t want to be alone. I’m still most likely going to work his job an hour or more away and I want to live for myself, but now I feel like it may be extremely difficult and it would be easier and more comfortable to get back together. Idk I am worried about her being alone and depressed by herself, but at the end of the day should I just worry about myself???",11Mar2020,1
617,"so some back story, my parents are going through a really messy divorce right now. and many months ago my dad would look through my phone. i started turning on ""screen time"" on my iphone only before i went to bed to see what my dad was looking at and it was ALWAYS my messages and life360. (location app i have with my mom) he claimed he only looked through my phone to make sure i ""wasnt doing anything inappropriate"" i think thats BS because really he just wants to keep tabs on my mom. occasionally he would search my mom up on my instagram to see if we followed each other so he could see her photos. we dont follow eachother so he couldnt see them.

anyway eventually it kind of stopped and i had the balls to start keeping my phone in my room at night. i am at his house for spring break and for some reason last night i was especially paranoid that he may come in my room to check my phone. i dont know why all of a sudden i felt all this anxiety, but i did. so i put a paper in my door, and in the morning if the paper had moved, i would know he opened the door.

i woke up this morning with a text from my boyfriend on discord that was in response to a meme i sent him. the meme was a photo of a black boy with goggle glasses who prob 11 or 12 with the caption ""tf is a titty? im a visual learner by the way"" anyway i sent this to my boyfriend and went to bed, i woke up in the morning to his response which was ""lol can i see tiddy"" my boyfriend was clearly joking, and i would never send any nudes to him. but if my dad saw him he wouldnt know the context because he doesnt know the current password to my phone.

also this morning, the paper was moved from my door, and my iphone made me use a PIN instead of my touch ID. im worried that this means he tried to unlock my phone but locked me out which is why it needed a PIN. what if he saw this text from my boyfriend?

my dad does not know i have a boyfriend. and he cannot know. ever. my dad is deeply religious, and would never let me date someone who is not from church. the common belief in my church too is that you start dating at 16, but you dont enter a serious relationship until youre 18. my mom however, is really chill, not that religious, and is totally supportive of my boyfriend and knows him and thinks hes really great.

im really scared my dad came into my room and saw this notification. he doesnt know i have discord. and i always would text with my boyfriend and then delete the app before my dad made me put my phone in the kitchen for him to check each night. but if he came into my room and saw it? thats no good.

i realize that im just probably really anxious, like i am basing all of my fears off a piece of paper in my door that moved and the fact i had to put in my PIN this morning. my mind is being swarmed with hypothetical situations for when he gets home from work today. i know this is probably my anxiety, but it also could have actually happened. i wouldnt put it past my dad to try this.

my current plan is that as soon as he gets home delete discord. and then if he asks to see my phone hand it over like its totally fine and say ""go for it"" and he wont find anything because i deleted discord. i will act completely normal otherwise, like i dont know he may have checked my phone.

what do i do. im kind of freaking out. if he saw this and confronts me on it what do i say? i cant be honest. im so scared that my relationship will be found out. my boyfriend is so great and treats me so well. 

is it typical to have your iphone ask for your pin in the morning? ahhh i just dont know. someone just please comfort me and think up a master plan to make sure i dont get found out.

thanks for the help all",11Mar2020,1

620," I am 18 years old and I had almost never been invited to a party, sometimes I feel like in my school I am a ghost, who is invoked for the interests of others alone, they never ask me how I feel, nor how I am, I'm just there, trying to get someone to consider me, I can bet that if they asked me that in my whole life how many people invited me from the school, with one hand I could count them, yes I am a loser, and apparently I am not alone, only that most of my interactions are interactions where I do not matter, my true friends live very far from me, and seeing them again was for a long time all I really wanted to go through a lot. see this if don´t believe me read this [https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/fg58oq/i\_am\_an\_18\_years\_old\_boy\_who\_used\_to\_heard\_fake/](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/fg58oq/i_am_an_18_years_old_boy_who_used_to_heard_fake/). It´s a secret, but I think I literally went crazy because I was alone for so much time, I lost almost all my important friendship, it was like they were dying for me, now I try and try to have good relationships, but all I get is shit! I hate school! I think sometimes that I have depression (a psyquiatrist told me once but I don´t think i am pathology depress but I think I have sadness for a long time, but after swiming I feel really good, (like after an orgasm)), but I know I am a sensitive person, and sometimes I don't manage my emotions well, I just want to be heard and comprehend from others, but in the school, I just feel like I am losing the time of my life learning useless topics and being farther away of those who I cared, I think the relationships you have are one of the most important things you have in life, and everything in my life is keeping me away from people who I care about them, even If I have some good friends ( apparently lonely as me) there in the school, I am just doing nothing, my biggest fear is death because all my lifed is being controlled by my obsessive mother who loves me, but in a very sick way, I get to the point I hate her beacuse, she is keeping me away from the things I want, school is the worst place from me apart from church, It only reminds why emotions are so irrational, look at me I don´t even know why I am telling to a bunch of strangers. I think is the right moment to change my life, go to make a new living in a new place, I still have hope, but fucking school just kill all the things I like, I used to love maths (I was in math Olympics), but now I hate it because school, I don´t want more control in my life, everybody is controlling me, and I can´t do anything about it, I have no right, no choice, I just have to keep going, being submissive, I eventually, get tired of trying to change my life, I get tired of all the bullshit I have to go, sometimes I wanted to just fucking end my life. for literally all my life I am stuck with my mother being so exaggerated about others, she still saying me that people are bad, and maybe part of them, but how the fuck I am supposed to know when people are bad if she keeps me controlled me? when I asked her the things I wanted is barely accepted by her, I wanted to have a bank account so I can start getting money (If you have some suggestions about making it, please do it). For a long time, my dream was becoming rich, so I can see my friends and support them, but I just realize that the kinds of friends who always depend on you are not the friends I have and I don´t want either, surely they will like a help from me, but they have their own dreams and goals, and the only thing I can do is to support them and try to help´him to achieve their goals, not to stop everything and completely depending on your friends life and money. Right now Reddit is the only place where I can say this kind of thing without being attacked by others. my god is hard to continue with your life knowing you are a piece of shit living in a cage without the freedom to decide where I go, where I learn, what I learn, what people should I relate, etc. Everything was decided by others, is totally abrupt, is my life I have the right to decide if I don't want to go the university of the film because I don´t want to learn how to make essays about the movies, and actually want to learn the practical knowledge of making i. I am too tired for this shit of the school, I don´t hate my classmates, but they are pretty different to them, and sometimes people come to me to advise, and sometimes I approach to them and hear them, but just a few know myself, the others just want to hear themselves and I can´t do anything about it, If they don´t want to hear is okay, but is absurd that I try to maintain a good relationship with them, because is a healthy relationship, not a narcissistic relationship, I am not saying that people are narcissistic, just that with the social media, make us prone to act more narcissistic, I see all time, they heard what they want to hear, is like everybody expectations about me are wrong, and they know nothing about me (mostly). Everybody has an idea of the relationships you have, they are not what I want, and for them I most of the time someone you can ignore because he has no social life. I think school and university aren´t the places for me, sure I love learning what I considered important, but now I feel that I don´t belong to the school, and it´s not the first time I wanted to quit and work on the internet (probably as a marketer) since I am young, I am losing opportunities while I am in the school, but my mom keeps me there, and I feel like she cared more about god and my education than me. I never talk to her because she never listens to me, she just heard what she wants to hear, what she wants me to be, she wants in the school, but never ask me on how I feel, never be considerer in the important decisions because I was too young to be conscious, and when I finally got something like a purpose she and the school just keep me apart from it until I learned that I will never see them again. On this moment I give up my dream of seeing my important friends again at least in the next 10 years, I will probably be going to lose them if I don´t see them in real life (is not the same in virtual life), so I decided to say thank you to the other thing where I feel with freedom; movies. I want to be a filmmaker or at least try, It is curious but I accidentally stopped watching films and reading, and I started to feel unmotived and depress (in clinical terms). For many reasons, I want to make films, and any suggestions would be rewarding for me, but I don´t want to say it because I can write a book of why I want to be a filmmaker and because I don´t how the reality is, is just my ideal, I will have to try it.

If you are reading this I have to say thank you for your time, I want to say that you don´t have to write something that you force, take it easy, my problems are complex and sometimes problems don´t have an easy or simple solution, but taking action and start putting your ideas in order is a good way to start. I could easily say a lot more about me, but I think this enough, My dream is that after everything I've been through, it was worth the wait. (You can say that life has no sense, but I will respond with that you are the want who gives it).",11Mar2020,1

622,"So i was involved in a chase the other day and im not sure what i should do now.

The situation was that a car in front of me was driving poorly so i decided to overtake in a safe place on a wide single lane road. The man in the car called ""Mike"" did not take this well and drove quite aggressively to try and cut me off and make me pull over which after one look at the guy i was not going to do, he was an angry looking guy.

Mike then tailed me for 4 miles constantly trying to get in front of me on narrow streets and i started panicking. So in order to get away from my pursuer i made a fake left turn in the city center and then swung right and then sped around another car at a red light, took a side road, dimmed my lights and got away. 

My worry is that the city i live in has really good cameras to pick up speeding and running lights and i dont know if its better for me to report the crime now or just wait and see if i get a ticket and then explain the situation in order to revoke said ticket.

625,"I have had a few very strange things happen to me, and I finally wanted to get them off my chest, so I came to Reddit for the first time ever... I'll post more of my problems/stories if people think this is serious enough. This is the second strange thing to happen to me, and it takes place over a long period of time, so that's why I'm posting about it first.

I used to have this reoccurring dream. I would wake up in the middle of the night, laying on my back. I was always unable to move. At the bottom right corner of my bed, stood a black figure. A man, I assumed, as it looked like he had a trench coat on, and possibly an amish-styled hat. This man never frightened me. I'd just stare at him until I fell back asleep. 

I always chucked it up to sleep paralysis. Nbd.

This dream continued for years throughout high school, maybe once a month. And then I went away to college and this dream stopped. 

I got a girlfriend at college and she came to my house to meet my parents. We spent the night there and she slept in my bed as I slept on the couch downstairs. At 7a.m., I woke up to her shaking me. The words that came out of her mouth were chilling...

""Last night, I woke up, and there was a figure standing by your bed.. just.. staring at me.""

I replied, ""Wait... Was it standing at the bottom right corner of the bed?"" 

""Yes...""

""Was it just black, not many details?""

""Yeah...""

""We're you scared?""

""No..""

And at this point, I went on to explain to her that this was a dream I used to have often. She became paranoid, and I told her it was probably just a shadow in the room cause by a lampost outside, across the street shining through a tree in my front yard. I had never told her about this dream because I didn't want her to be scared if she ever came to my house.

Well, after that, the dream died down. I had it twice during my whole college career when I would come home and visit. 

Her and I broke up during my senior year of college. I moved my bedroom layout around, and also cleaned things up in my room, changed my sleeping pattern due to a new job, and got a new girlfriend. Also during this time, the tree in my front yard had fallen over during a bad storm, and PennDot had chopped it up and taken it away.

I never told my new girlfriend these things. Again, didn't wanna freak her out, didn't wanna talk to her about my ex, whatever. I just didn't find it necessary. 

The first time my she comes to sleep over, I stayed in my brothers old bedroom since he was out of the house now. I was uncomfortable in his bed, so I didn't sleep well. I woke up at 5am and looked at my phone. I had a text from my new/current girlfriend that said, ""There's a man... Standing at the foot of my bed."" I jump out of my brother's bed, go over to my bedroom, and see if she's alright. She's asleep. I layed down beside her and fell asleep, myself.

I assumed everything was fine. The next morning, I wanted her to tell me about the dream without me bringing it up. She didn't.

I let things go figuring, ""Ehh, it's fine. I'm not gonna push this.""

The first night I get to sleep in my bed after she leaves, I have a dream that this black figure is sitting at the foot of my bed. He just sat there, looking at me. This is the first time he's ever done anything other than standing and being still...

He reached his arm out and grabbed my ankle. I sat up, and yelled! The figure was still there, he didn't leave. But my dad must have heard me yell, because her burst into my room, and as soon as my door opened, the figure was gone.

626,"Just a quick preface: there's a complete lack of structure to this and I'm essentially just venting so you can skip all of the paragraphs if you'd like. I just felt like putting this somewhere.  


I'm 18 y.o. in my first semester at uni, less than 2 weeks in, writing here because I'm over it. It's also nearly 3am and I've been up just thinking about this and I thought may as well get other peoples thoughts. I may also end up telling my life story, so strap in  


I think for the majority of my life, I was lucky. I was normal, did alright in school, had close friends until I was around 14 or 15, when I moved to a new country and had to repeat another year. Since I basically understood all the subjects that were taught as I'd just learn them last year, I did stupidly well. And so suddenly I become known as that kid who showed up outta nowhere and just came first in 3 subjects. However it ended up ""positively"" reinforcing me that I was actually pretty smart. So I subconsciously began to create a higher expectation for myself and I was somehow destined to succeed, even though I'd always tell my friends ""Aiming low then getting high is way better than aiming high and getting low"".   


This worked for about a year, and then my luck started to run dry. And this is where that mindset I had built up began to break me. My expectations of myself became too high for me to reach and I ended up ruining my last two years of school constantly being worried about my future, realising that I'd built myself up on a false sense of belief that I'll succeed no matter what. Even my university degree was purely out of luck and coincidence, because in reality I shouldn't be here. But this is the only path I knew, so I stuck with it. But I hate it. I'm doing it for the sake of just going to uni because, if I'm being honest, education has been the only stable structure I've had. At almost every stage of my life, school has been a part of it. So the idea of dropping out terrifies me. I'd love to work but I'm struggling to find it, I believe my family would be supportive but I'd hate to burden them anymore than I already have.  


Essentially that was all a long-winded bunch of context to this: I've never had a job, have no hobbies except for playing video games, going to uni but I hate it. I just want to work but I can't even find it. Do I stick with uni a little longer or do I get out now and maybe hope I can get a job?

I’ve been friends with the guy, Mark, for a few years, but I’ve been friends with his gf Haley since we were 13 (we are all 24 now). Haley and my gf talk every day and get along very well. Me and mark used to hang out a lot more when I was still drinking a lot. 

Anyway, they come over and are a bit tipsy. Doesn’t bother me, I was using my medicinal marijuana anyway so we were all having a great time. Toward the end of the evening, Haley went to the bathroom for like 15 mins. We’re all wondering if she’s ok. Finally mark goes to check on her, she immediately comes out, we all say goodbyes and they leave. 

Fast forward to yesterday. My gf goes to do her makeup and is missing like 4 different pieces. She’s incredibly well organized and she could tell her makeup has all been gone through and several pieces missing. Hell, even I could tell and I only get into her makeup jar for nail clippers. 

Basically, I don’t know what to do. I’ve known Haley for a little over 10 years and have never known her to just steal from someone, although we used to shoplift in Walmart as kids. Still. I wouldn’t think she’d do this but literally no one else has been in our home and my gf had just used her makeup earlier that day. 

What do I say? 

My girlfriend is understandably upset and is ignoring Haley until I do something about it, but I don’t know what to do. I’ve never had this happen with a friend. Especially because if I bring it up and things don’t end well, I will have lost two friends and that’s all I have. Idk anyone else and it’s increasingly difficult for me to make friends in this area because there isn’t much to do.

635,"I am the oldest of three daughters, and I'm 7 years older than my next youngest sister who just turned 18. She is about to graduate high school in a few months and will be going off to college where she'll be living in the dorms. 

My family is pretty strict and protective, but in a way that I think is almost a little dangerous. I was very sheltered before I went off for college at 18 and had a very rude awakening to the reality of our world when I was violently raped my first semester of school by someone who I had previously thought was my friend. I was very naive and had no clue how dangerous the real world could be. Since she's a lot like me and grew up in the same home I did, I'm nervous that my sister's own innocent nature will be taken advantage of the way mine was. 

I don't want to scare her or make her paranoid going off to school, she may not even take what I have to say to heart, but I want to make sure that she's not going into that world blind of the risks that are there.

 My thought was to take her out for coffee or something and tell her what happened to me when I was her age. I have really mixed feelings about teaching her to always watch her drink at a party, and avoid walking alone at night but I want to tell her just so she has an idea of things she can do to try and protect herself. Mostly I just want her to be careful of who she trusts, because my own mistakes came down to trusting the wrong people. 

Yet I'm worried this conversation could also do more harm than good. Any advice for me?",11Mar2020,1

637,"Dear reddit,

My little nephew get’s bullied in and outside school. It is obvious and they go to his house and bully him more. He and his parents went to school multiple times and to the parents of the bully. The school takes ther hands off and they say they can’t do anything. The parents say the rule is; “The toughest on the street rules”. The other kids are scared off the bully and are not doing anything as well.

My little nephew is really smart, good in football (soccer) and little in length. Friends of him tried to help him but they were getting bullied as well so they stopped helping him and now he is the main focus of the bully. He doesn’t want to go to school but they search him up in the village because it is really tiny.

I can’t help him because we live far apart. The bully also bites, kicks, fights leaving some marks behind on my nephew.

What could I do or his parents to make the bullying stop. They already tried several things. Is violence the answer?",11Mar2020,1

I have never made a reddit post yet as I am fairly new to it but I have had to get this subject in the air for advice.

I’m sure it is obvious what is going on with the virus and many people are concerned as am I.
I am supposed to be travel to Milwaukee tomorrow (by car) from Ohio and I was planning to see my brother who lives there. The only people going are myself and my Dad. I am concerned because although no confirmed cases are in the Milwaukee region, I still believe the virus is much more widespread then we currently know. So the overall question is: should I still make the trip even despite the instruction? Many will say no I am sure but I figured I would still ask due to the fact that if the virus is to get worse (which I am certain it will) then I may not see my brother for a long duration of time.

Anyways, I have applied for several jobs, and none have responded back. Also, let's just say that with my previous job, I did something terribly wrong, or had made a big mistake. Basically, I had insulted (pretty badly, at least in my opinion) the ""mega final boss"" (lol), the head honcho, etc., using social media, but I had sincerely apologized and made things right with them (I hope). Anyways, the process (or processes) for acquiring a job in this modern age is of course usually applying online.

She's   rather shy around anyone but me and my Mom thinks she's avoiding her   because she never speaks to her or waves or acknowledges her at all.

My   Mom feels she's already being excluded from my relationship with this   girl. I know all this from a not I accidentally found on the table. My   Mom writes things down when she's stressed. It's how she lets it out.

My   Mom means well and is a very caring person. I think she's just not  sure  what to think about this girl cause she's never really met her.

The   girl thinks my Mom dislikes her, but I forgot exactly why she thought   that. One time she asked me ""Does your Mom dislike me?"" I answered ""No,   she's just never really met you so she's not sure about you.""

I   was thinking of suggesting that the girl maybe smile and wave when she   sees my Mom and speak to her when the opportunity presents itself.

I was never really religious (borderline atheist) before but when i moved to my new state my friend I've known for years took me to her little church. I started serving, doing setup, helping with media and making friends. I haven't converted but I've learned quite a bit. Ive only been apart of the church about 6 months. 

Anyways one of the many new friends i made is one of the pastors (lets call her Juno). I have a massive crush on this young woman. She is a beautiful intellectual and a quirky sense of humor. Like i cant tell you how stunningly gorgeous she is to me not physically and emotionally. She has alot of her life sorted and she knows what she wants taking huge steps to make what she wants happen even if she has to go it alone.

And i on the other hand am toothless (no not from drugs or anything of that sort and im trying to get enough for dentures) and work white collar. I sleep on a air mattress in a nearly empty appt.  I haven't been able to do shit with my life. I haven't been in a relationship in 7 years. And don't even know what i want.
i haven't had a crush or liked any of my friends in years.  I kind of gave up on love or any of these feelings. 

Im asking for advice because im worried that the huge difference on where we are in life and how i look. Im still barely starting on my own and she is establishing her future.
I look like i got the bad end of a meth pipe and she looks like she is about to walk down the runway.
I don't want to do something brash and mess up my friendships at church.

647,"For some context, im 17 years old and pretty much all my life my dad (65 y/o) has sort of abused alcohol. The reason why i say “sort of” is because, from what i know, its not nearly as bad as other stories ive heard. Like hes not some raging drunkard who drinks himself to sleep every night. I think he just looks at alcohol as a coping mechanism when times get tough and also because its just sort of a hobby of his. He’s currently unemployed which has been going on since i was in like 7th grade (currently junior). He just needs to get his priorities straight. My mom is extremely anti drug, which is why my dad continuously tries to hide it from her. He’s also gotten a DUI which makes it harder for him to find a job. He also smokes weed which im fine with as long as it keeps him away from alcohol but it just sort of seems like he doesnt even try to look for jobs anymore and is just kind of free-loading. I came home from school once and as soon as he saw me through the door (theres a glass window in our door that goes to the garage) he quickly shuffled to the living room to hide the bottle that was in his hand. I found the bottle and confronted him right then while crying and hes jus like “if it really means that much to u i’ll stop”. I told my mom about the incident, then told my dad that i told her and he got mad at me, which just shows me that he isnt gonna stop. My dad makes me pissed off really easily, like REALLY EASILY, which i have no clue why. I thinks its because i just kind of see him as a failure and the only reason i still try to make myself a better person is so i dont follow his path. Hes a great guy and just wants to have a better relationship with me and i just feel like a piece of shit treating him like the way i do. I constantly tell myself that im going to do better, but for some reason i just cant. The thing that pisses me off the most is that he lies to my family about his drinking, saying hes stopped but hasnt. And then when we confront him about it he just continues to lie and says he doesnt drink. I tired of coming home to him looks high off his ass, and sometimes smelling like beer. And part of me feels like the reason he drinks is because he tries to form a better relationship with me but i just push him away like the absolute piece of fucking shit that i am.

During the school day they are totally fine. They laugh, they smile, and are just genuinely friendly and talkative. However, when it comes to the days end, they begin to act rude and distant towards me in an instant.

Whenever I try to start a conversation with them or ask them about something, they either sound irritated when they reply or just answer with one word. If there is someone else accompanying us when we walk home, they will start to act withdrawn and begin to be bitter once I engage more with the other person in conversation.

Hi I’m Tatiana and I’m 20 years old. I just needed a place to vent and some advice would be appreciated...

-In the beginning of middle school, I was diagnosed with scoliosis. The curvature of my back isn’t the bad part, but instead it’s the pain that comes with it. At the age of 14 I started experiencing pain which stopped me from taking physics education through out the rest of my middle/high school years. After MRI’s , doctors found that I have something called spondylitis (not ready sure what it is) but they explained that it is most likely the reason I feel pain though out my body. I’ve recently accepted that this is gonna be a part of me for the rest of my life, and I won’t be able to change it. My curvature isn’t severe and won’t require surgery, however I’m still following up with doctors to see what they want to do with my back. 

-a couple weeks ago I’ve been experiencing chest pain and was in the hospital for a day. I felt terrible that day and I wasn’t sure what was happening to my body as I felt like I was blacking our most of the time. After a long day, the doctors spoke with a cardiologist and came to the conclusion that a bunch of my symptoms I explained were not adding up, and he told me that I might have something else called POTS syndrome. I’ve heard of it, but never really knew what it was. They told me that the blacking out and the way my vision goes black when I do something is an indication of it. Now I’m following up for that as well with many appointments. 

-I have a hard time leaving my family and love being with them always, but if I’m away from them for too long, (over a couple days) then I begin to miss them and feel begin crying all the time. I love them to pieces and I wish I could just stay home all the time to be able to be around the ones I love. 

-growing up, I had a difficult time getting along with my older sibling who was super toxic to me and just never treated me with respect. To this day, I hold anger to them and I used to constantly get nightmares of them when we lived together. I want to have a good relationship with my older sibling, but when they came to visit this past winter, they were nothing but disrespectful the the whole family and kept counting down the days they can go back. I wanted to also point out that this same sibling has been calling home saying they missed the family and they were homesick, but when they were here, they expected to constantly be showered in attention and they expected to be waited on. 
-again I want to have a good relationship with my older sibling but they made me hold such big grudges against them by doing things like locking me in a room. (The room had an inverted lock, and the windows had bars over them since at the time we were staying in Puerto Rico. I was too small of a child to even know what to do) 

I know I have a good heart and always forgive, but in the end I always get hurt. I try to act like I’m okay with everything, but it hurts when others take advantage of my kindness like my sibling has always done. I feel an anxiety when I think of them and my heart races as I write about them. They’ve hurt me many times mentally, but I don’t know if I’m just being over the top. 

Sorry for the long post, but I guess what I’m trying to say is that could use some advice on how to cope with everything and what can I do to make myself feel better? Am I being too dramatic, or is it okay to feel down about all this? I’m super sensitive and I don’t know if that’s something I can get over. Let me know if there’s anything you want me to clarify.

658,"I live in a neighborhood with a small enough street and in a house that has no driveway. I was fine with it because the rent contract explicitly stated I was allowed to park there on the street. It has become increasingly difficult to find parking because a nearby hospital refuses to allow their coworkers to park there, forcing them to instead occupy our street and making it incredibly cramped. In response to this, it seems the city has imposed a regulation all across the road that nobody can park there for more than two hours from 7AM to 7PM. Obviously, as stated, I live here.

662,"Hello everyone,

I am a 24 year old college student studying in Germany.
My family is from China but I was born here in Germany.
Allow me to explain the German credit system first.
For every Class you pass you gain a certain amount of credits and when you have about 180 credits you can write a thesis and you will graduate.
I only have credits worth about 1.5 semesters. I am at my sixth semester.
My major is industrial engineering (Wirtschaftsingenieurwesens).
My best semester was at my fourth semester. I passed two exams and gained 14 credits. 
But the average amount of credits you are supposed to earn is between 25 to 30.
I have considered dropping out before but everyone around me has convinced me to stay.
Motivation to stay in college is very similar to the majority.
Having a good starting point in my career path, Earning a high salary and a lot of doors will be open for me if I have a degree.
Germany is a county that values degrees more that anything else.
On my last semester I studied real hard for an exam which i always had problems with.
I’m not a lazy person. 
I took a lot of time studying and asking questions on things I don’t understand. 
I really put in a lot of effort into passing that exam.
I learned a lot on that subject and also understood it. But in the end I still failed that class.
Right now i am feeling really down and defeated. All that hard work for nothing.
Watching my friends graduate makes me feel like a complete loser jerking around in college. 
I am feeling lost.

Now I don’t want to make any irrational decisions. 
I Should also mention that college in Germany is basically free and I am not in debt or something.

I’m considering going to trade school. 
But i am stuck between this dilemma.
I am having a hard time making a decision whether to stay or to accept the hard fact that college just isn’t for me.


Please give me your opinion on my situation.",11Mar2020,1
663,"I'll try to keep this short and concise, but if you need more detail just ask!

I am moving out of my parents place (to a location about 4 hours away), in less than a week. Both my parents already know I was planning on moving out some time this month, but I haven't really talked about exactly when since they didn't ask and I just didn't bring it up.

To say the least, my relationship with my parents has been very rocky over the years. They have a tendency to be very controlling of their kids, judgmental, and very verbal about when they don't want their kids to do something. Even as adults (I'm almost 22, my sisters are 29) my parents try to act like they have a right to tell their kids what they should be doing and think their kids are obligated to listen to them.

After telling them I am moving out my mother was worried but kind of okay about it, and my dad, per usual, was being a bit over dramatic. He went on this long tirade about safety and being prepared and making an action plan just in case something ""kicks off"" with the government (kind of in reference to any wars or just general danger) and also said he wanted the contact information of my friends that I have down in that area so that just in case anything happens to me he can recognize their numbers when they call.

I dont want to give him anyones number because these people are adults who don't know, and probably will never know, my parents. So it's frankly just not my place to be giving numbers like that.

They have always tried to micro manage and be apart of every little aspect of their children's lives, and frankly it's just suffocating and annoying. I love them and I'd like to have a good relationship with them, but their paranoia about their kid's safety and need to always be involved are driving me a bit crazy.

I'm hoping I can just ease out of here with no problems, but if my dad brings up getting people numbers again or they just try to be too overly involved in my moving process, how can I explain to them that I need some space and distance from them without setting them off?


*TLDR*: My parents are kind of paranoid control freaks about their kids. I'm moving, but I'm worried they are going to give me a hard time and try to be over involved during the process. How can I tell them I need them to back off without pissing them off?",11Mar2020,1

We don't interact with them and we are out from morning to evening since we are working people.

So mom and this one neighbour get into verbal fights at times, recently this neighbours mom has dropped by and she is hell bent on getting into a fight with my mom.

One fine day my mom is returning from work, She comments on her looks and goes as far as to almost hit her from behind, my mom turns at the right time. She doesn't hit, but it goes into a full on verbal assault, so my mom picks the broom in her hand as the neighbor and her mom are verbally abusing and getting ready to come to her. My mom just holds her broom and tells them you take a step and well see what happens. So this ends there for some days. This neighbours mom is one weird person, she keeps staring at my mom and commenting at her whenever she sees her. After few days, when my mom comes up from stairs she stairs at my mom again, my mom doesn't back down so she stares back, this women goes into a frenzy and starts yelling that my mom is some gangster or what who in the hell she thinks and all, her daughter joins and they both start verbally abusing. My mom calmly shuts the door this time and just let's them ramble, they go on for hours until this neighbours husband calms them down (somewhat). I didn't know about the incident where my mom was almost attacked for few days, my mom kept telling me not to interfere and she'll handle, even in this latter matter she held me back as she was worried that i would do something far worse. Even though i can say that i should have done something like talk to the neighbours husband or just shut these people down, i didn't, I know excuses like i couldn't go and shut them cuz i was worried what i will say or do doesn't help. Was thinking of filing a complaint to police about this almost attack incident, will probably do that because of safety reasons. Another thing to add is the other neighbour just starts bitching with this neighbour and they make my mom as the villain, and there are bunch of kids on the same floor, including neighbours own kids, they are also listening to this bitching conversation, they are exposed to this whole charade of verbal abuses and drama. My mom is good with other people beside these two neighbours. But we just can't make peace with this neighbour. I know this whole issue is not that big but it is still very bothering.

Im here looking for alternatives/advice that might help me understand what to do. Is there a way this whole thing can be solved subtly and will resolve in peace.",11Mar2020,1

668,"I have this male friend. We’ve been acquainted for almost a year and only recently we had our first hangout. But we did exchange messages from time to time and he initiated this hang out.
Some bg info: I was kinda unsure of this guy because on the first day we met (some orientation) he was really touchy, like grabbing my shoulders which I felt rather uncomfortable with but I just thought that he was a very friendly person. Around 2 to three weeks after that, another friend I made during the orientation suddenly complained about him, being obnoxious and trying to touch other people including her. So that’s when I kinda got a red flag about this guy. 
So now about the hangout: it went pretty well until we had to leave. It was pretty dark out and we were engaged in some small talk. All of a sudden he insisted on “helping me hold my phone”. I gave him an incredulous look like I had a portable fan which I was just using to fan myself on one hand and my phone on the other. Completely comfortable with myself. But he still insisted on taking it and I let him just cause. Turns out he just wanted to free up my one hand so he can hold hands with me. It was not so discreet, and then when I asked why he just sang very softly “just wanna hold your hand” to which I laughed out very loudly to (an attempt to shake our hands off but no he held tight) so then I tried to destroy whatever mood he was trying to go for by swinging our arms wildly and finally he let go when I said there were people about to witness our idiocrasy.
Then we arrive at the field. Almost pitch black. And he managed to weasel is hand into mine again. I joked: you afraid of the dark? To which he replied : “no I just feel very comfortable with you.” And so on. How I escaped from that? Told him to give me my phone so I can check the map on whether we were going the right way or not. And I never let go of my phone since then.
I would like to say that’s the end of it but, we went to another area and walked around there for a bit since it was still early. Nothing unusual happened then. But when we were about to part ways, he decided to get bolder. I was holding my phone on one hand, my other snug in my pocket. He suddenly went on about how he was glad we got to hang out, and put his hands around my arm and pulled as though trying to pull out my hand from my pocket. But I didn’t yield this time. Finally he stops but goes for a hug instead while saying the same things. I finally say “ why are you so awkward? You’re like my boyfriend when we started dating.” Then mimicked some reaction my bf did. And oh my god I don’t how he misunderstood what I said because he softly replies. “I wouldn’t mind if you were my girlfriend.” I replied “flattering.” I casually tried to mention that I was already taken, but I don’t know if he was just acting dumb or just genuinely did not take the hint. So plan B. I make a call to my bf. Asking whether I could go to his place and hang out and such. Emphasizing that I was already in an intimate relationship with someone. Then when it came to the end of the conversation, we did that really cheesy you hang up first thing. And even after all that, sadly, I don’t think he still got the hint.

Oh and I don’t actually have a boyfriend right now (recently broke up but meh). So I didn’t actually make a call, but I just recreated a convo I had. 

This entire thing would be easily solved if I just blocked and ghosted this dude, but the thing is we’re studying in a similar course so we’re bound to bump into each other a lot. And I’m utterly terrified of confrontations. 

Would appreciate some advice on how to deal with this sort of thing. Me and my friends planned some stuff to further the boyfriend card but honestly there’s a limit to that :/",11Mar2020,1

There isn't a lot of time where we get to see each other because of our jobs. We've spoken for a while about moving in together, and feel like its the right time to do it.

I've been offered a job that is 5 minutes from her house and its for a charity that does fantastic work, and would give me more weekend time off to spend with her, but it's a zero hours contract role, with no guarantee of work for the week. I've spoken with the recruiter and during holidays/summer I could be working full time, but that the average working week during winter/early spring would only be around 16 hours a week. But obviously this work isn't a guarantee because, zero hours.

I suppose the question is should I take it in the hopes that I would work more and get more weekends off to spend time with her, or play it safe with a guaranteed 22.5 hours a week, and not be able to see her as often.",11Mar2020,1
670,"Hi all~~

All I could think about when I was in college was moving abroad and teaching English. I love languages and I feel I was meant to do this... I haven’t experienced “culture shock” whenever I’ve travelled. I just feel enamored by the differences around me lol. I find it interesting and fascinating.

I ended up in a relationship, which I am happy about of course. I love my boyfriend and we have a dog. But I still feel so much regret for not doing this right after college. I think about it all the time. He says he would be fine with moving and going... but I just feel like I’m dragging him with me and making him alter his life for me. I feel so conflicted. Do I go? Do I stay? He doesn’t want to be an English teacher, and he doesn’t have a 4 year degree to be one. We would get married and he would have to find part time work. 

I just feel so torn. I’m 24 if that helps. Should I do this? Should I give up on the idea? I wish I even studied abroad more in college, maybe then I wouldn’t regret this so much. What would you guys do?",11Mar2020,1
671,"So i moved to a new city after getting accepted into a college, and was supposed to start as a transfer student. I had to move into a apartment because the dorms were already filled up. A week later after my move in, the school told me I wont be receiving any financial aid and id have to pay out of pocket. And I was expecting the aid/refund would help pay for the rent. (im in no way blaming the school or anything-just explaining) Because of that I had to temporarily pull out of the school. I tried taking to the apartments about what was going on, they said since I already signed the lease nothing could be done, unless sublease. Since then (this all happened in January) I have been looking for a job. I have been stressing over rent(which my siblings helped pay for-for 2 months), I sleep at anytime, eat anytime and just be in my room watching tv. like a bum. I would binge eat just cause I would feel really shitty. It has been one of my top low moments, 
which i’ll never forget. 
But yesterday, I did an interview and got hired on the spot! I finally got a job! Which I am so pumped and excited for! I feel like I’m finally going to be productive again! 
but the only problem is that I feel so tired and fatigue. I had to go to the store today and buy some pants for work and red bull. And i feel so sleepy. I feel like like its because of how I lived, and my brain his used to it?? I start in 2 days and I’m afraid I’m still going to feel like this on friday.

672,"I was dating this girl I was friends with for a long time. We broke up which it hurt but I got over it, we texted occasionally after then eventually we stopped. I know this sounds cuckholdish but I still wanted to be friends with her. After simply texting her how she is after like 2 months of no response, she said shes breaking off contact with me and unfollowed me on insta a few days later.

What hurts the most if essentially losing a friend over that the fact that we had a bad relationship and now she never wants to speak to me again. 

I have a scathing, vile message prepared to send in her DMs, and in debating whether or not to do it. I know it's wrong, but I want this to end on my terms, not hers, so i at least have some control over the situation.

673,"My partner and I have been together 4 years. At the beginning of our relationship we sat down and discussed our ambitions and goals. Mine being to get my degree, travel afterwards for a few months, get married and have children. He expressed mutual dreams and we went forward. A year into our relationship and the degree we took on his child full-time and I became a full time step parent. This has been the most rewarding change to my life, however this was never discussed with me prior and was quite a messy situation. I proceeded with my course and tried to plan with him travelling. Every time we spoke about travelling he appeared disinterested and unmotivated. I spoke to him that if he wasn’t interested please just let me know and that if he didn’t get more involved with planning that I would find someone else to go with (I.e. a friend wanted to go travelling with me as did my sister). He continually reassured me that this was something he wanted to do together and asked me not to proceed without him. I reassured him that I understood that it would be difficult for him to travel for a long period of time due to his child. Every time I opened the conversation up I would get shut down. So to cut a long story short, a month prior to my course finishing I applied the pressure further of travelling. Again he told me to wait which left me anxious. I am now post graduate and when I’ve approached the subject of travelling again he has told me he can’t travel as he had decided to purchase a house so we didn’t have to pay rent. A conversation we again did not mutually discuss. Although this seems a sensible idea, we argued which he told me he didn’t want to get married any time soon as there were financial benefits of not marrying. In a bid to comfort me a long weekend city break in another country was booked with my savings for travelling. I know it sounds spoilt but the trip wasn’t the relaxing break I feel needed following three years of hard work. Tensions were high during the weekend to say the least. 
this week my partner came to me telling me to look after his son while he goes away abroad on a stag do. He didn’t ask. I will do the school runs and deliver to and from the child’s mother over the weekend (1000-1900 as she only sees him every two weeks and cannot have him overnight). This is also the weekend of my birthday and I am really struggling. Am I overreacting by being upset?

676,"We have 2 dogs. The oldest is a golden Labrador who will be turning 12 this year.  She's of course done well to live this long and while i'd of course want he to live for as long as possible, I also don't want her to live in constant pain. There will come a time where we'll have to say goodbye and I dread it constantly.

About a month ago, she started coughing (loud ""HACK!"" noises). At first, we weren't sure if this was a big deal: she was fine otherwise; didn't do anything else out of the ordinary and the coughing was far and few between. But after a week or so, we took her to a vet. She was given medication for a couple weeks and told if it still persisted to consider coming back. 2 weeks of medication later, she still coughs on occasion.

This is where things get complicated: my mother believes our golden Labrador is suffering from laryngeal collapse due to ""Googling it"" and finding similar symptoms but also because our aunt's dog has been diagnosed with it and shows some similar traits. My mother is not willing to take our dog to the vet due to the cost and because she is unsure if the dog will live through surgery given her age. 

I have offered to pay for the dog's medical bills as I have double the required amount in my bank; I want to have an actual certified veterinarian check our dog over because what if it isn't Laryngeal collapse? What if it's something more severe or perhaps something less problematic that with the right treatment will go away?? But my mother declines and says our dog is fine and that I should look into laryngeal collapse more myself. It should be fine because our aunt's dog has had it for a year now...The last thing she said on the matter was ""I'll think about it"" when I persisted that we take her to the vet. (from experience that's like 60 no 40 possibly).

But ""researching"" laryngeal collapse still doesn't make much sense to me and always directs me to ""trachea"" which while my mother tells me is a different thing, I am concerned at how it always comes up when searching laryngeal collapse and by reading the description makes is seem REALLY bad for our poor dog. Thing is: my mother is the kind of person who will lie to me in order to not upset me and by extension, not upset my other siblings (even though i'm 22 and know better than to tell my younger siblings about how our dog is dying).

I'm so confused by it all and am scared for our poor dog. Other than the occasional throat clearing noise, she seems fine: doesn't back down from going on walks, likes to sleep in her bed or anywhere she can get comfortable, eats all her food; healthy weight. I bought her a harness today because it would apparently help if she does have laryngeal collapse. I just can't seem to get my mother to understand how unreasonable I thinks she's being; not willing to take our dog back to the vet due to what is ""a hunch"" that she might have something similar to another dog THAT WAS DIAGNOSED BY A VET!

Can someone please help me in this situation: I don't know what to do.",11Mar2020,1
677,"Hello, this is the first time I ask for advice like this, so please be patient if I'm not good at expressing myself or keep some information to myself.   
I am a 21 year old man who has had MANY ups and downs in my life, however the downs are piling up worse. I used to live my dream, but I gave in to the people who hurt me and I allowed the demons to consume me. Now I've been living with my mom for 2 years, and only recently got a ""job"".  
My life got ruined (I partly blame myself, of course, I'm not arrogant) and I have this ONE chance to make it right, but it's extremely risky and might be playing it unsafe.  


I live in a country where it's impossible to work yourself rich and the poor just gets poorer, and the majority of people are miserable. I am from a poor family, meaning I am doomed to die that way.   
I also live with my mom (but not for long regardless of what I do) but I have gotten a job offering in Australia and I am supposed to leave on Sunday.   
The job I have now is a slow, boring and the money is BAD (remember, I have to live with my mom).  
I also live in a poor, empty town where I was abused and it's a constant reminder.  
The new job doesn't give the best paycheck either, but I would be splitting an apartment with a friend and it's far away from this broken country.  


Here's the problem though, this might also be the part that is tricky to explain since my country might have a very foreign system, I don't know; My mother has sent an application for ""activity compensation"" (which I just found out I was granted) which would give me an ok sum of money for this shit-job. I'm also waiting to get an apartment in the town nearby, that unfortunately is very expensive, but I am eligible to get support for the rent.   
If I leave, but would have to come back home for some reason, I would no longer be eligible for compensation again.  
The taxes in my country are sky-high (i think it's 35% of your income) and I wouldn't have much money left after each month, but I would be alive and somewhat fed.   
This job in Australia is not a dream job, but it's good enough to get my life ""back on track"". I might only be there for a year or two, but if I play my cards correctly I could stay even longer.  
So I am asking you, friends.   
Should I bail on Sunday morning, and leave everything behind? This will break my mother's heart, and I will not be welcome home if everything goes to shit in Australia.  
Or should I stay in my country where I'm safe, and eligible for support, even though I feel like a failure.   
It feels like my dream can come true if I move, because I have so many things I want to do, and could do over there, but it might not last long.  
I am sorry that I am keeping so much information about the situation to myself, but I feel kind of embarrased over my life situation.",11Mar2020,1

679,"TL;DR We were arguing, and she said that i'm not her father, to which i responded that she's right and that she isn't my daughter. (I obviously didn't mean it.) I have since apologized, but maybe i should do more. That'd what i need advice on.


So, some days ago me (adoptive father of hers since the age of 3) and my 14 year old adopted daughter were arguing, and she decided to pull the 'you're not my father' on me during the argument. I was hurt by it of course, since i do consider her my daughter. I was pretty tired and busy with work stuff that evening, so i couldn't really think straight, and for some reason i decided that i'd fire back. I told her that ""You're right. I'm not your father and you're not my daughter."" She istantly started crying and ran to her room. After that, we didn't really talk at all for two days. During those two days i was still really busy with work, so i had kind of made her my second priority. Only after getting some of that work stuff off of my shoulders did i start to realize what i'd said. I decided to make an AITA post about the whole incident. (As if i didn't already know i'd fucked up.)  Pretty much everyone agreed that i was horrible, and i can't blame them, because i was horrible.

And a day after that i apologized to her. I told her that she is my daughter regardless of blood and that i will always love her as my daughter. I said i was so sorry for saying that and that i didn't mean it. She started crying and we hugged. Later she apologized to me for saying that i'm not her father. 

Now she's mostly fine. She's talking again, smiling and pretty normal all around again. But she still seems like she's a bit touchy or scared. I think that maybe my apology wasn't enough and that i should try to do something more. A lot of people in my original AITA post told me that we should get therapy. I didn't think it would be necessary at first, but the more i think about it the more logical it seems. I said something terrible, and she got badly hurt by it. Maybe she still has doubts in her head about my love for her.

What should i do? I really need advice on this, i don't want to traumatize her. I've already posted this on a few subs, but i really need everyones prespective.",11Mar2020,1
680,"My mom is 46 and has always struggled with being a functional adult. She was the victim of a violent crime in her late teens, and ever since that she's not been able to finish college, hold a good job, or live by herself due to PTSD. She does see a therapist, and since has been able to at least get a job as a secretary. She's paid minimum wage and has 5 days off a year total, and rarely gets holidays off. Because of her condition and poverty, she and my 17 y/o brother have to live with my grandparents in the absolute middle of nowhere.

However, I can't help but feel really bad about leaving my mom behind.

Plus, she lives hours away from the nearest airport.

My mom recently revealed to me that she's depressed and lonely, and she's scared for the day that my brother leaves for college, because she's afraid she'll ""never see us again"". I've talked to my SO about moving closer to her, but he hates the east coast and isn't thrilled about being far from his family, either. I've tried to encourage my mom to go back to school or move out of the middle of nowhere to get better job opportunities, but she's too crippled by PTSD to leave. I would be fine with her moving where I live, but it's very expensive here and she says she couldn't afford to live here or find a job here. My SO doesn't want her living in our small apartment, either.

I really feel stuck, and terribly guilty for having moved so far away in the first place.

683,"I created this account to post this because I really need advice. 

Ever since I can remember, I’ve always wanted to be a teacher. I have a lot of childhood memories that revolve around me explaining something to a bunch of stuffed animals. My parents bought me a whiteboard for my sixth birthday and I still use it. I prepare for tests by explaining the subjects on it and pretending that I’m on a classroom. That’s the only way I can learn something.

I never considered anything else. I really really want to be a teacher. 

Now, this shouldn’t be a problem. I want to study History and teach High School Students. But every damn time I mention this to someone, they turn to me and say something along the lines of “You shouldn’t do that. Teachers don’t get money. You’ll change your mind.” My parents   say that I choose a really difficult path, but they will always support me. Which is more than fair.

I just don’t know how to cope with it. At every family reunion someone tells me to give up and do something else. The most common “advice” that I hear from them is that I should go to Law School because it’s basically History that pay well. It’s getting really annoying and, honestly, I can’t deal with it. It sounds silly, I know, but I’ve had a couple of mental breakdowns because of it. 

You know those classroom horror stories? Yeah, I’ve heard every single one of them. I don’t care about them. I’m aware that it’s going to be a challenge, I still want to teach. I’m very passionate about it.

684,"I (M22) have a situation I need some help on. Please be kind, I will gladly take constructive criticism and some outside input so long as it remains respectful!

So I started dating my girlfriend (F20) last June. At the time, both of us were still living at home, and she’s got six other siblings (ranging from ages 6 to 23), so we spent a lot of time at my house because I only live with three other people, and we got (a little) more privacy at my place than we would hers.

Last September, she got an apartment with a friend of hers (M30). We had only been dating for a few months and we kind of mutually agreed that we were nowhere near ready to move in together, which I was and still am completely okay with. I had no issue with her roommate, I met him a few times before they moved in and saw him as no threat because I trust her. I’m not close with him or anything, but he’s an okay dude. (He’s not the issue here at all, just giving a little backstory on the living conditions at her place).

So when she first moved in, I spent a LOT of time at her place because it was really nice having our own little space and we definitely had a LOT more privacy than we could get at my house. She still comes over to my place once or twice a week, but I do spend a lot of time at her place (not nearly as much as I used to, in the beginning)

A few weeks ago, me and my girlfriend had a conversation about us spending more time with both of our families. I told her I didn’t want to take her from her family, and I wanted to be able to spend a little more time with my family. We had a really good, constructive conversation about it (we have really good communication) and I have been trying my best to spend more time at home with my family since then.

But here’s my problem: I’m feeling smothered. My family has been making passive aggressive comments every time I come home—for example, one morning my mom heard me walking around and texted me and said “I didn’t expect to see you today”—and a few days ago, I texted my sister (F26) (who still lives at home as well) asking her if she still wanted to watch the movie we were planning on watching, because if not I was going to go out and drive for Postmates, and her response was “not really, but I guess if I say no you’re not going to come home.” So I went home for a few hours, instead of going out and working. She said when I left “come back soon, I miss you” (we had just spent two and a half hours together watching her show and watching my movie—it just made me feel like it wasn’t enough)

It’s little comments like that, that are all said in a passive aggressive tone, and I hear them EVERY time I come home. That’s literally the first thing anyone says to me. My mom (specifically) will say, “oh honey I’m not trying to make you feel bad, I know you’re in love and y’all wanna spend all your time together.” And I’m feeling frustrated for a number of reasons, because:

1) I’m an adult. And I would very much like to feel like one without feeling guilty for not spending every waking second at home. I know they miss me, but I have been TRYING to go home and spend more time with them. I’ve gone to visit extended family with them, I’ve come home while my girlfriend’s at work and hung out at the house for a bit. And I just feel smothered, because I’m 22 years old and I want to feel independent. I want to feel like I can go out and do things without my family needing to be involved with every detail.

2) Moving out, as of now, is not an option. Me and my girlfriend have talked about getting our own place when her lease goes up later this year. Her roommate has even said that I could move in if I wanted to, but I’m not financially stable right now which is why I like the idea of waiting, so I can save my money and do it right this time. Plus, I don’t feel ready to move in with her yet—the last time I moved in with someone I was dating, it did not end well at all and our relationship is still very new, so I’d much rather wait until we‘re both ready to make that next step.

I just don’t know what to do. I love my family to death and wouldn’t trade them for the world, but I don’t know how to find that balance to where everyone is happy. I’m just tired of the passive aggressive comments every time I actually make the effort to go home and spend time with them. And I don’t want them resenting my girlfriend for it. We go over to my house once or twice a week, and chill there, like I said—and I’ll even come home when she’s working the overnight. But it’s still not enough. And I just don’t feel the need to spend every waking second at home—I just feel smothered.

I’m worried about what’s going to happen when I move out. I moved out once at 18, but I moved two hours away and would only speak to my family once every day or two since we were so far away from each other. But this time will be different, and I’m worried it’s just going to continue whenever I move out.

I really don’t know what to do here. I’ve brought it up with my therapist before and I’m bringing it up again on Friday. And I don’t mean to sound like an asshole—I really do love my family and I feel bad because I know they miss me, but I have been actively trying to find that balance and spend more time with them. But again, I don’t feel the need to spend every single waking second at home. And I just feel like I need to establish my independence a little more, without shutting them out, because that’s not my goal here. I love my family to death and I want to spend time with them. But not when every time I come home they make me feel like shit for not being there more.

What do I do? Am I wrong for wanting to have my space and not feel so smothered? Going home, on some days, is hard because a lot of trauma happened in that house. Some days I can handle it, some days I just can’t. I’ve been in that house since I was 6 months old (minus when I moved out the first time). It can feel pretty smothering being cooped up in it, and I spent my entire life being cooped up in that house. I feel like it’s time for me to venture out into the world and develop my own independence, or at least start trying. I’m just now getting comfortable doing adult things—like driving. I didn’t even get my license until I was 20, and even after that I had so much anxiety about it up until a few months ago. I want to build that independence up so that once I’m out on my own again, I’ll be okay and able to handle it better this time.

Anyway, like I said, please be kind—I don’t hate my family for wanting to spend more time with me, and I don’t want to end up resenting them or them resent my girlfriend. I just feel like I’ve been so smothered lately, and like I said, moving out isn’t an option because I’m just not ready for that yet. I just don’t know how to handle this without hurting anyone’s feelings or giving anyone the wrong idea.

I love my family, so much. I’m just tired of feeling smothered or them making me feel like shit for not being home every single day. I don’t know what to do about it. Am I wrong for wanting a little space? Or independence? How can I prevent this happening when I *do* move out?",11Mar2020,1
685,"I’ll try to keep this short, but one of my closest friends is pretty severely suffering from depression/anxiety. This started happening a year and a half ago. He dropped out of school, hasn’t been employed in over 2 years and the only time he leaves the house is when our friend group gets him out. 

I have also suffered with bad anxiety/depression, but I’ve been on medication for over a year and gone to counseling and though I still struggle I’m much better than I used to be. Because of this, I’m definitely the person in the friend group he comes to the most regarding these issues because I can relate to him the most. I always do my best to support him, listen, and ask questions. I try not to offer too much solicited advice but I’ve recommended a few things, and he always has reasons why they won’t work. 

He’s been on several different medications in the past year, and they all give him horrible side effects. When we hang out he often falls asleep, but then says he can’t sleep through the night. So he was prescribed another medication to counteract the drowsiness. None of them seem to have been doing too much to help. I’m not against medication at all because I’m on them, but I feel as if he only relies on these meds to help him and doesn’t really do anything else. 

A job or school may be a bit too much pressure, but I’ve tried to subtly recommend volunteering somewhere, finding a club or rec class so he can get out of the house and be around other people once in a while. He does fine when he’s out with us in groups, even with people he doesn’t know well. I’m not trying to be a jerk, but I’m feeling like I’m responsible for his wellbeing since there’s some pressure about the only time he has other human interaction is when I or another friend (which is a small group, me and two others and we are all pretty busy) makes the effort to go see him. Of course we love him and like hanging out with him, but it’s worrying because it seems like if we are busy or don’t hang out with him, he has no other way of social interaction or leaving the house. 

His parents also kinda condone it, they have their own medical issues and they just give him money to spend and don’t really encourage him to do anything. 

My friend wants to have a more “brutally honest” intervention with him, but he starts to shut down when we try to bring it up so I don’t think they would be a good idea. I want to support him but I am just getting frustrated because there’s not much I can do and I feel a bit responsible. Maybe I’m just giving myself too much credit, it’s just really hard to see my friend suffering and having my hands tied for a year and a half.

I dont wanna give genders. They were always like im homosexual but i was pretty sure i was heterosexual but they said it to me at the very beginning of our friendship and i didnt thought about it much but after becaming best friends and stuff i dunno anymore. Maybe im just liking them as a best friend. And they already has a crush on someone so even if i admit i have feelings for them it isnt gonna change much.

688,"I started group therapy (dynamic psychotherapy) at the beginning of the year to deal with social anxiety. I've gone to every session, bar one that I was out of the country for. 

So far it's been OK. It's been helpful to hear other people talk through issues and consider how the advice offered by the group might help me, or how people's revelations/thoughts apply to my own situation. Seeing other, fairly normal looking people, struggling with their own issues has been reassuring. Hearing about other people's progress also gives me hope. 

The problem is I've really been struggling to speak in the sessions. I've spoken maybe three times since I started, and it's always been prompted and it's been maybe a sentence or two. This is something I struggle with generally.

I'm starting to worry that the group leaders will think I'm not participating enough and will consider dropping me. Its an NHS service, so I know the place is valuable and I don't want to appear like I'm not trying to make the most of it. I listen hard, and really try to consider what people are saying, I just struggle to join in.

There's been occasions where I've wanted to say something but I either think too much about how to phrase it and the moment has passed, or I get so stressed I forget what I wanted to say by the time I've plucked up the courage. Often as well it feels physically impossible to speak, my throat closes, my tongue feels heavy and I struggle to breathe.

I've considered staying behind to speak to the leaders about this, or sending an email, but we're encouraged to keep conversations like that to group time so I'm hesitant. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can begin to join in? Or, if anyone else has similar issues and could share how they overcame them?",11Mar2020,1

The only problem I think I have is really connecting with people. I recently found out I have ADHD and I believe that adds a depression to my life. Both my college friends and high schools only really care about “how drunk they got” or “what bet they on whatever sports game”. I love playing sports don’t really care to much to watch them. I just want good friends that care for me as much as I care for them.

693,"This is in the United States for anyone who might be confused.

To keep it simple, my extended family likes to consume alcohol for plenty of occasions and just casually. Usually when someone in my large family turns 21 they make a big deal about buying them alcohol. If it's ever Christmas or a birthday and there's a gift giving/exchange, if you're old enough, alcoholic drink gifts will be involved. A lot of times they like to be ridiculous with it and make a joke out of buying a lot and what not...

I also think some of my friends and family friends would do the same (as a joke).

I don't drink though and I really don't want any alcohol. I wouldn't know what to do with it and I don't need it taking up space just rotting and collecting dust. I could regift, but I feel like it's a bit rude, I don't like the idea of gifting alcohol personally, and that just seems like a big hassle to deal with.

I was thinking of posting something on my FB just asking if people want to get me alcohol to simply just not. Or have a thing set up where they could donate the money to a better cause instead.

I feel like it's a bit rude to do that though and I'm worried about some family members or friends taking it the wrong way. I also don't want to sound entitled like I expect gifts, because I don't but because it's happened to my brother and my older cousins, I'm fearful it will happen to me whether my relatives know I don't like it or not. 

I'm just looking for a good approach to request this without it sounding bad or rude. My family isn't horrible, they just like to joke and poke fun at others, but this isn't a tradition I'm looking forward to, and as appreciative as I am with any gifts I receive, I don't know how to like these gifts.

Thanks!",11Mar2020,1
694,"I am turning 19 this month. The bully turned 19 last month.

I have an amazing group of friends, but I feel like can not turn to them for any sort of help.

When I was 13, I moved over a thousand miles away from where the traumatic events of my childhood occurred. When I was 14, I became best friends with a girl of the same age, and opened up to her about everything.

She used it all against me, effectively blackmailing me and controlling my life until I was 16. It was an emotionally abusive relationship, which I only realized after I had cut ties with her for good. While we were together, our relationship only got worse and worse for me.

After I finally gained the strength to cut her out late 2017, she became obsessive. She has been harassing me ever since. Over time her methods have gotten more and more insane. She is believed by many to have been the main reason for the suicide of an autistic girl our age who lives in the area a few months ago. She was a friend of mine.

This girl has openly admitted to causing the suicide of her best friend in middle school, along with bragging how she has “gotten rid of” the autistic girl for good. In the summer of 2017, somebody I looked up to had commit suicide, and when I came to her for emotional support (because we were friends at the time), she told me that he deserved it, and she knows I will share the same fate as him some day. I did not retaliate at all, I simply took her words as definite truth.

I have never been able to go the police about this. My parents have always prevented it. They abused and neglected me as a child, and has also failed to protect me from traumatic dangers outside of my home. It is no surprise that have no intention of protecting me from this person who has been tormenting me.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration at all to say this person truly wants me to kill myself. She has shown no signs of stopping and has only gotten more aggressive overtime. She has no remorse for those who commit suicide, and has a hatred for anybody who suffers from any kind of mental disorder, even conditions such as autism. She prides herself in the two people she caused to take their own life, one of them being a good friend of mine.

I wish I could at least get help from my friends, but I would feel ashamed explaining to them the things I’ve explaining in this post. I also do not want my friends knowing the truth about my parents, as they get along with and respect my parents very well.

I haven’t lost all hope yet, but this is a real struggle. I do not know how I can get this girl off of my back.",11Mar2020,1
695,"GF asked me to post this. It is written by her. We are both 23, if its relevant.

I'll try keep this short and sweet. I've put myself in a really tight spot and i think i have a rough idea how it will turn out but as a last resort i'll ask for advice here.

First of all; the essential info: i first started at my job only a mere 5 weeks ago, i have had my 10 week holiday planned since June last year, an abrupt redundancy saw me unemployed from the end of December until i found work in my current role and they did ask me in my interview if i had any holidays planned. Which (i know, i know) i straight up lied about and said; no. 

The management and coworkers of this (office) job are very progressive. They have a much more laid back attitude about work than i expected, which makes this more difficult for me.

My plan going into working for this company was to have a temporary low paying job to keep the funds coming in for my SO and i, so when the time came for the holiday i could give them my two weeks and cut ties. I wasn't entirely prepared for me to actually really enjoy the job, which, has since become a reality. I also have a very good relationship with my management team and co-workers. And they all regularly hint at me working with them for an extensive amount of time (the guilt is paralyzing).

The dilemma being: i'd love for the company to keep me on after 10 weeks but i know my chances are low. My BF thinks i should give 4 weeks notice as a courtesy but i worry that i will get fired. I know its a bit ridiculous but we need the extra weekly income right up until we leave. I thought 3 weeks would be the perfect amount of time but he thinks it would be even more damning in my case to give such short notice. 

I would love some advice on how i can possibly word this to my supervisor and also a good timeframe for breaking it to them. I know i'm an asshole, but i'd appreciate any witheld judgement for some help in the matter.

I will add: My contract does not have any mention of this issue so legal repercussions are not necessarily a worry.

697,"This story is close to ten years old and happened later on in high school. I’m leaving out certain specifics to keep some level of anonymity. I’m sorry for the length.

My first girlfriend and I had been dating for about 6 months or so. Her parents were wealthy and quite older. She had some much older half siblings, so she may have been a “mistake” or just a second love/final baby, I don’t know. But, she had a 30 year old half sister that looked a lot like her, who was her mother’s child but not her father’s. This is totally conjecture, but due to various circumstances and the mother’s age, I always wondered whether or not the older half sister was actually her mother who had given birth to her as a teenager, and that she had been up to that point raised by what were actually her grandmother and step grandfather. I actually spoke with my girlfriend about this and she did not rule it out, but wasn’t willing to push asking.

Her “father” was 70 at the time, and incredibly eccentric. He was a wealthy lawyer and sole breadwinner, but I honestly questioned how he accomplished this given just how weird he was, and this wasn’t some endearing kind of weird either. He was short, fat, refused eye contact, smelled bad, and spoke in strangely varying volumes that weren’t indicative of a socially normal person. None of that means anything, I’m just painting the picture. My girlfriend early on had actually indicated that they had to move prior to her attending high school due to “false rumors” about him, of a nature that was never disclosed. 

So fast forward to me getting invited on a spring break trip with them, the father did not go. The last night, my girlfriend starts abruptly bawling and after some heavy pushing, she opens up about how her father had regularly come into her room and molested her as a child before going to work up until she was 12. She said she had told her mother multiple times and that she refused to acknowledge it. Awkward car ride back, but as soon as I’m home I tell my mother. We talk about what to do and we go to the school counselor and give them the run down. They contact local police, and I’m called in to give a statement. I have multiple instances of text evidence in which she speaks on and confirms she told me. I show them this and recount everything she had said to me as well. Again, she admitted over text that her father had consistently molested her. That was the only time I spoke to law enforcement, they did not ever contact me further after taking my statement and downloading my texts. My girlfriend was a very nice, reasonable girl, I have no reason to believe she made any of this up. From my assessment at the time, it was far more likely she left out significantly worse details on what had happened.

In the weeks after speaking to the police, I am  harassed by the mother. I am threatened with legal action, and how “others had tried to ruin their lives with similar rumors”. She called and texted every few days and only stopped when my mother called her and threatened to take legal action. My girlfriend was questioned once at school and once by the police, and from what I put together she denied all of it, and pretty much put a clamp on anything happening. We were not speaking at this point due to her mother’s actions and demand she stop speaking to me. The school did nothing but defer to law enforcement, the police spoke with my girlfriend and her parents one time with no follow up. She was still living at home of course, and I’m assuming she was being manipulated through the potential negative repercussions were she to actually speak out. I had been in contact with the older half sister as well, who was incredibly supportive of both me and my girlfriend, but her power was limited as she lived across the country and was unable to visit until the following month. If it’s worth anything, she never came close to questioning that what my girlfriend had told me, or what I was saying, was false, and I think that means something given she knew everyone involved far more than I.

My question is, what else could I have done in this situation? Were there other options?

It boils my blood that these two people, likely some the worst kind of monsters, are allowed to live in wealth and peace as they age. There was peripheral evidence and an outright testimony that places this guy as a pedophile. Who knows the extent of his sick actions, but I feel like if he is going to consistently molest his young daughter, he’s done some other horrible horrible things in his life, particularly given they had to move due to “rumors”. It also sickens me to know that a 16 year old girl was pretty much faced with either coming forward with the truth regarding disgusting actions taken against her as a young girl, actions that will likely fuck with her mental health forever, or upending her life as she knows it, and then being forced into choosing the latter because she was threatened or manipulated into the “easier” option. After it had died down, my parents told me that we had pretty much done everything short of what was considered defamatory/targeting of this guy. I think about this from time to time, and I wish I had thought of something outside of the box of solely trusting the school and local law enforcement to handle it, because it didn’t work. It kind of just sucks being a key witness in an act of grave injustice, doing what you know to be right, going through systems that are in place for these kind of things, and the perpetrators of pretty much ruining a young girls life will forever remain unpunished. This whole thing was kept fairly quiet too, which pretty much made me realize that there is a whole bunch of horrible people walking around and you’d just never know it.",11Mar2020,1

The pain lasted for a day and eventually it passed, so I figured everything was fine, but ever since then I’ve had trouble with digesting certain foods and I feel a very slight pain in my shaft.

I know they both love my sister more and that’s okay but it’s hurtful enough that i don’t want to ask to live with my dad, not to mention the shame he would put me through.I am a student and to be honest i’ve been so depressed and mentally ill that i’ve barely done any work this semester. i can turn in assignments late but i know i need to get my shit together and i just can’t. my dad is mad at me because i don’t want to share my passwords to my email, school accounts, or bank account even though i told him i would send him any documents or receipts he would like to see. to him it’s about transparency and to me it’s about privacy, which i’ve never had in my life and i’m a fucking adult and he doesn’t live with me anymore and he only contacts me when he needs something. i’m over it i don’t want to go back to my moms ever and i am done begging for my dads attention and affection because i will never get it because i’m not important to him. fine.

Starting in the beginning of the year i caught a pretty bad cold, and i just never fully recovered. it’s only march and i’ve been to the doctor 5 times this year, that’s probably more than i’ve been in the last five years combined. i had strep throat and another illness that i think was very serious but i wasn’t able to get help from any of the three doctors i saw, and i’ve been in a lot of pain, very tired, and out of it from weeks of a fever that i couldn’t get rid of. I had to miss three days of work so far this year. i really wish i could have been there. My boss really doesn’t like me and i work so fucking hard. i promise i’m very good at my job and i try to go above and beyond every chance i get, i rarely make mistakes and i’m very intelligent and kind to everyone i work with, especially my boss. about three weeks ago i was at the absolute worst of my sickness and i woke up to my 6 am alarm and my sick brain was like that doesn’t matter, i can’t go to work, and i instantly fell asleep again. i woke up 10 minutes after my 9:00 shift started and instantly texted my boss (which is what she asked me to do if i was ever going to be out). and she responded “seriously, emily?.” i fucking lost it. i had the worst panic attack of my life, i couldn’t stop crying for three days, i thought i was going to get fired. she sent me a long text accusing me of not being sick and not caring about my job, and i apologized and sent her my doctors notes and receipts from urgent care. that was a thursday and since i’m part time i don’t work fridays anyway. the next week i came into my shift early and started working as fast as possible, when my boss got in she sat me in the front office (where my desk is) and had me face the window into the lab and berated me for not being dependable or reliable and i cried my eyes out and all my coworkers saw. it’s also worth noting that a month before this i had a performance review that was poor (the only person involved in evaluating my performance was my boss) and i was assigned a list to get done every day that’s like way to long for a normal person to be able to finish. i was already on thin ice before this incident. anyway even though the whole reason she was mad was for me not being there she sent me home right after screaming at me. honestly i get it i should not have been there i looked and felt like shit. i also have overworked myself in the lab and warehouse so much that i’ve puked at work 5 times this year and fainted twice. anyway once i got back to work i created a system and destroyed that list even though it seems impossible. i volunteered extra hours last week because the other lab technician was out for the whole week (funny how she doesn’t get any shit for that). yesterday i finished the list before my lunch break and decided to propose a new project to my boss. the chemical inventory was my project originally, but it was suspended before i could finish because of the list. my boss told me to stop working on it and focus on the list. i do everything she asks me and more. anyway it got really fucked up since i wasn’t able to maintain it for 3 months because it’s a lab and nobody has social skills or knows how to communicate. there are flammable chemicals outside of flammable cabinets and acids in with bases and non-hazardous substances and a litany of other violations. my boss knows this, trust me. I’ve brought it up before. she’s in charge of ordering new products and we have more ethanol than we can safely store because she bought 80 liters at once. none of the chemicals in the excel spreadsheet have a location and even if they did it wouldn’t matter because nobody listens to me because my boss has shit talked me to the point that i’m totally ostracized. I explained to her the extent of the problem and told her i wanted to fix it and she instantly blamed me for everything. most of these problems were here before i started at the company and i’ve tried my best to bring them to attention, but i’m scared to talk to her because she always freaks out and blames me for all her problems and gets mad at me. i started having a panic attack while we were talking about this and my eyes tested up, and she was like are you crying? why. and i was just like no i’m okay and then the second she left the room i lost it. i had to go to the bathroom because a couple people saw that i was clearly crying and i wasn’t able to calm down for like a half hour. i don’t even know what to do anymore i just wanted to fix the problem for her. i also noticed a couple days ago that i have a very prominent lump on my breast as well as swollen lymph nodes and ovary pain, which makes me worried about cancer considering the immune system struggles i’ve been having. i tried making an appointment at planned parenthood for a breast exam and there was a problem with my insurance. i would have to pay 200$ without it and i think my dad may have removed me from our family plan. I also scratched an illegally parked car and since i’m a good person i left a note and offered to pay for repairs. this guy barely speaks english and he wants 500$ for a paint scratch. i’m also about 3 months late to paying for this semester of school which should be about 500$ as well. i have 200 in my bank account and no savings because my hours keep getting cut because my boss hates me. and now i’m homeless. i’ll be crashing on a friends couch for the next couple weeks but it’ll mean i’m commuting 50 miles every morning in southern california on the i5. i love my job it’s just hard to manage the stress my boss is giving me. i haven’t slept in 3 days. i went over to my boyfriends last night and i just laid there dead silent. i watched him sleep for like 2 hours straight. i feel like i’m going crazy i’m already so mentally fucked up and every aspect of my life is just spiraling downward. if anyone read this, thank you. I would appreciate anything anyone has to say, whether it’s advice on any part of this or just words of encouragement.",11Mar2020,1

708,"I don't know if it's that suitable to put in NSFW as well, but in my current situation, this is what I'm struggling with so I might as well do it.

So I've been following a handful of lewd artists on Twitter for a while now and decided to open an account as well, since I draw THAT kind of fanart too. I might open a separate SFW account as well in the future, but right now, smut is the focus.

My problem is that, no matter what I try, who I draw (favorite character from a certain fandom that I choose), what and how many hashtags I put in, nothing seems to work. I tried to make my profile somewhat decent, with a basic bio, showing that I'm new here. I even tried people's advice of going on an art-share thread. It brought a few people and that's about it. I thought it would be relatively easy, as it is basically a Facebook - Getting something shared has a chance of ending up high, as more and more people reshare (retweet it). You might say ,,If big shots reshare, you are set."", but I can't just go around and spam every post or go into their DMs until I get them to view my content. I was given that point as well.

Now I don't claim to be the best artist out there. I'm not even a pro. I do it for well over one year now... but I know I have a decent art style and amount of experience... I really struggle to improve and get better and better, and I'm proud so far... but under five likes on a picture that I actually put soul and time into, is not ok. 

I know artists who have started under one year ago and already have thousands of followers and hundreds of likes on their posts, as well as countless commissions, and some of them have the same level as me and similar styles. I'm not aiming to have tremendous ammounts of followers, I'm not even aiming to get commissioned, but I just want to have my art appreciated and viewed, that's all. Money is not what I'm after.

I have had my patience, but nothing seems to change. And remember, we are talking about fanart here, not OC art. That would end up even worse, as you never know which characters would please the audience and as unknown as they are, they have high chances of going unnoticed. That's why I'm holding back with the SFW account in the first place. I want to know, am I doing something wrong? What do I fail at? What approach do I have to take? 

I might sound idiotic, selfish or cocky. I might have even put my ideas or expressed wrong and I'm sorry if that's the case. I tried to be and put it as honest as possible.",11Mar2020,1

It’s closer to home and school. However, the hiring process to the start of the job could take until August before I start training. 

The other job is an entry level position in the field I want to end up in. It pays $12.50/hr but they hire internally for more advanced positions.

714,"WIBTA for reaching out to an ex lover?

TL;DR: I was in a relationship a long time ago with an incredible guy. We broke up, and an attempt at reconciliation failed because I was entangled in an abusive relationship. I broke his heart and hurt him badly, and he never knew why. With absolutely no desire for a romantic reconciliation, or even need for a platonic one, I want to reach out and apologize for my behavior, and explain why I acted the way I did. This was years ago and we are both now in healthy, happy relationships. WIBTA to reach out? 

IG = Incredible Guy
SE = Someone Else

I was in an incredible relationship with IG, but it was long distance and we were ready for different things, so it ended. It took me a long time to get over him.

Then I met SE, and I fell in love very hard. After the honeymoon phase, SE turned out to be abusive, and was masterfully emotionally manipulative.

IG reached out eventually, saying that he knew I was in a relationship but that he made a mistake and wanted to make it work. His timing was such that he caught me right after a particularly abusive episode with SE. I left SE, and tried to get that spark back with IG. It looked for a moment like it might be possible, but SE had thrown himself into reconciliation mode. Anyone who has experienced an abusive relationship knows how hard it can be to rebuff that. 

I tried so hard to make it work again with IG, but ultimately it was impossible. I hadn’t had the time to recover from the relationship with SE, whose active efforts to reconcile while I was trying to move forward with IG had left me emotionally obliterated. I still missed SE, and even though I knew how he could be, I was naive enough to believe him when he said he could be better. I was trying to choose between reviving the relationship I knew would be better and healthier, and continuing the relationship that was so recent and so intense. 

In the end, I chose to go back to SE. I left little explanation with IG for why I couldn’t stay with him. It’s the worst mistake I’ve ever made, and it utterly broke IG’s heart. His friends, rightfully, hated me for it. The relationship with SE failed less than a year later, after more abuse. I was only able to truly leave because he was in an accident that left him unable to cycle into a reconciliation phase. I also learned after we broke up that SE had raped and abused women in the past before meeting me. 

I’ve wanted to reach out to IG ever since, to apologize for what I put him through and explain myself a little better. I never told him about the abuse I’d experienced with SE, because at the time I knew he’d confront him and I didn’t want anyone to get hurt. 

I haven’t reached out because I didn’t want to cause more damage. I wanted to allow him the clean break that is necessary to fully get over someone, because he deserves that. 

This was about 5 years ago. He’s married now, and I’m in a wonderful relationship with someone I love deeply, and who treats me right. I have absolutely no desire to reconcile romantically with IG whatsoever, and I have no delusions that we can be friends. But over the years it’s eaten me up inside that IG will never know what really happened and that he never did anything wrong. It’s the one thing I’ve never forgiven myself for and it hurts to think we will go to our graves never having made peace. For whatever reason, lately it’s been weighing very heavily on my mind, both in waking moments and in dreams. 

So Reddit- WIBTA if I reached out to him, to apologize? If so, how can I make this feeling go away without being TA?",11Mar2020,2
715,"Hi Redditors,

Ever heard of the saying, “No good deeds goes unpunished.”? That’s basically what happened with me. About a month ago, I took a friend to a local groceries store to help her get some groceries. She ended up putting a few extra things in her bag and without knowing, I paid for the groceries and pushed the cart out with her. We got stopped by Loss Prevention and the stores’s policy is the person that pushed the cart out the door is responsible. Therefore I sat in the room as they pull out stuff from her bags (make up, fruits, powder milk, etc) while she is sitting in a different room and it totals to around $50. 

Police arrive and writes me a citation for the petty theft and I have to appear in court later this month. I have since hired an attorney to defend me since it was a crime that I had no intention of theft nor need to (I made 120k income in Texas). Fast forward to last week, my company isn’t performing well and cuts were made. Our department got slashed and so I’m out of a job. 

While applying for a job, my wife asked if the court thing will affect me and just then it hits me, since this is a misdemeanor, would it affect my interview I have lined up next week? 

My wife and I are homeowners and we also have two kids, one is a newborn only a few weeks old. While we still have money saved to last us maybe half a year in bills, I’m now worried I might not be able to get a job with this pending court case. To add fuel to the fire, I googled a bunch of stuff on misdemeanor charges, how it can affect your job application, etc and I’m freaking out more now. 

Please help me with any and all advice. I have a few interviews lined up and one of them is with Amazon and it is a great job but I’m now I feel I’m trapped. 

Note: the friend was a coworker from many years back when I was working as a waiter on the side to earn extra income prior to our first baby since I figured I need to make more money for baby stuff (diapers, formulas, etc.). My wife and I known her for seven years and she is now a single mother of a baby with low income. She still working as a waiter and her mom helps her take care of the baby when she’s away at work.",11Mar2020,1

717,"Hi, 

This is my first post and I am on mobile so if my writing is off, sorry. This is also going to be a looo g story Anyway so backstory on this whole debacle is my boyfriend and I, for 3 years and 8 months, have been planning a spring break trip since January. My break starts the 14th. We are both college students and are 21. Our trip starts from March 13th-20th. Since we are not trust fund babies and bought tickets in February before flights became $1, our round trip tickets all together was $500 and are non-refundable. Both my parents and his gave us the green light to go if we wanted prior so of course we jumped on this opportunity as we’re both graduating and have never traveled together or gone anywhere for all our other breaks. 

Last Friday, March 6th, my cousin who we were planning to stay with while on Vegas called and essentially said she was uncomfortable with us staying at her place due to the Coronavirus scare, but she has an Airbnb available for a majority of our time there that we could stay at for free. I do not blame her at all as she has very young kids and an elderly mom that stays with her. I call my mom to tell her about the situation and she just blows up and will not let me talk. Mom says I need to cancel the trip and not go. It’s too dangerous and I should just stay home. Previously she had already expressed concern on me going to Vegas and stated she’d much rather me go somewhere closer to home (we live in the Midwest). She even offered to pay for both my boyfriend and I to go somewhere close to home but I brushed her off as I really wanted to go to Vegas. She’s really paranoid about the whole Coronavirus situation and keeps sending me news articles about it. I could honestly give two shits bc I’m healthy and young and I doubt anything bad will happen to me besides getting quarantined.

This brings us to today, March 11th. Last night I found out our flights were non-refundable even though we bought insurance and it would cost us more to cancel then just letting the tickets go. I cannot transfer them, I cannot receive a credit, etc. I talked to my bf and of course we’re bummed but decided if we don’t go to Vegas, it’s okay as we’ll let the tickets go and plan to drive to a neighboring state for Spring Break. I also found out my university will be “closing” campus after our spring break and all classrooms will need to be moved to be online courses. This was big news so I decided to give my mom another call for the hope of a) asking her to let me go on a trip, Vegas or not and b) to just tell her about the whole university situation. Since I know she is not one to let me talk, I tell her at the beginning I have a lot to tell her so she needs to let me talk. This is how it goes

Me: Hi mom, are you busy

Mom: no 

Me: well I have a lot to tell you so do you have a lot of time?

Mom: Sure

Me: okay so *explains the whole flights are non-refundable situation* now we’re wondering if there is a chance we can still go to Vegas or possible traveling anywhere else?

Mom: why do you want to go so bad? Is it bc of *bf’s name* I’m starting not to like him from this situation. He’s pushing you to go and is being a bad influence 

Me: ??? What no we both want to go we’ve planned this for a long time

Mom: no you haven’t 

Me: yea we have, since January 

Mom: he’s no longer allowed in my house. I don’t like him. You guys could have gone to Vegas for winter break why didn’t you go then?

Me: we wanted to stay home for Christmas and it just never came to mind 

Mom: but you could have gone anytime

Me: yeah, that can be said about anything but we’ve been planning this. If you aren’t comfortable with us going to Vegas can we go to Nashville? It’s closer to home and there’s not a case there (I know there’s a case but I’m just trying to appease her and still have a good tome)

Mom: why do you guys have to go now? Just wait for another time

Me: once we graduate, *bf* is going straight into his career and I’m preparing for graduate school. We also have separate plans to travel this summer. *my boyfriend will be going on a cruise with his parents as a gift and after he comes back, his job training begins. My parents and I have been making summer plans as well and our trip is supposed to last the month where my bf is gone and then starts his job*

Mom: he’s banned from my house. He’s no longer welcome to come even if you’re home

Me: okay??? Regardless we still want to go on a trip. Also it might be even more dangerous to travel during the summer or the future anyway. 

Mom: if you go, you’re not allowed home

Me: okay? You already told me when I bought my tickets that if I go on a trip and come back, I’m not allowed to visit you bc you’re scared of me spreading the Coronavirus to you *this is true, she said once I came back from Vegas I need to drive straight back to my university apartment and not go back to my home town to visit her or anyone*

Mom: yeah you can stay up there

Me: uh okay...

Mom: so are you going to go or not

Me: I’m still not sure yet since you’re so opposed but I don’t understand why and I’m really wanting to go somewhere. I don’t want to just stay home, that’s boring and I never relax when I go home. *this is bc I’m the oldest and best English speaker in the family so when I go home I’m usually used to be a taxi, free labor at my parents restaurant, a translator, or anything. I really don’t relax and I come back to university more tired then when I had left*

Mom: well you need to decide now

Me: okay well my other thing I had to tell you was *University name* has made an announcement that after spring break all classes are going online. 

Mom: so what’s your intention of telling me this

Me: uuuhhh just to let you know? I’m not going to stay in hometown though as my research lab is still open so I will be staying up here and taking my online courses

Mom: so are you going or not?

Me: probably yes as I want to at least go somewhere. Even if it’s not Vegas I’ll just go somewhere close

Mom: then you’re not allowed home.

Me: okay that’s fine, wasn’t planning on it

Mom: do you get what I mean

Me: yeah I get it, I can’t go home 

Mom: no I’m disowning you

Me: ...? What?

Mom: if you go I’m going to call our lawyer to write up a document for you to sign saying you are not part of the family and if anything happens to you that’s not my responsibility 

Me: ??????okay????? *im literally so shook I had stopped walking as I was on campus heading to a meeting*

Mom: so are you going to go?

Me: don’t know because I’m confused on what’s happening and you’re being crazy

Mom: if you go you’re barred from this house and our family. I advise you to be good and just come home for the rest of the semester. 

Me: okay. I’m heading to meeting so I’m going to go 

Mom: tell me what you decide

I ended the call and immediately called my bf to explain what just happened. At this point I’m crying from anger, confusion, and sadness. He told me if that was going to happen then he obviously didn’t want to go on a trip. I just tell him I need to go to my meeting and we’ll talk about it later. 

Aftermath:

My mom called me again later but I ignored her call and I’m not planning on talking to her. I’m going to send my dad and little brother on what happened. My plan is either go on a trip to Vegas or Nashville and just reap the repercussions bc I do not care. If my mom is willing to disown me just bc I want to go on a trip then I do not need that person in my life. I’m not going to be her prisoner. I’ve done so much for her and my family that this is literally the most ridiculous outcome she ever said to me. My other option is to just stay at university over spring break and the rest of the semester without traveling anywhere. I don’t plan to speak to her at all. So now my question to you guys is should I just go on the trip and never talk to my mom/get disowned, go home, or just stay at uni? I’m leaning towards just saying fuck it and go have the tome of my life in Las Vegas. I’m mostly financially stable on my own as the university pays for everything I need and gives me spending money. I also have a job and a research position that pays. The only thing I might lose is the car they gave me, insurance, and get taken out of their phone bill. If she plans to start legal action on taking all the stuff back she has given me I’ll also start legal action. So yeah, let me know what you guys think. It can be funny, you can call me crazy or her crazy, you can leave a joke idc.",11Mar2020,1

719,"We never really suspected our son (15m) was gay, but he came put to us a couple of months ago. He also presented his boyfriend (15m). Now we were glad that he had a boyfriend and the kid seemed very nice and a good person. My son invited him regularly to our house, as he hadn’t come out to his mother, so our house was a “safe place” for them to be. 

But one day I came into the house, and when I went to my son’s room to say hi, I saw both of them desperately trying to put clothes on. I waited until the boyfriend dressed and went to his house and then I had a talk with my son. I don’t like my son having sex, even less in my house, they are too young, and after all gay sex has a much higher rate of STDs and I don’t trust that they will use protection. So when I had the talk with him he confessed this wasn’t the first time they did it, it was a common thing for them to do. I told him that he had completely prohibited to have sex, At least until he was a little older, he could still see his boyfriend but just not have sex. He reluctantly agreed.

Time passed, and it they still spend a lot of time in our house. But apparently he didn’t take my advice. This time his sister found them, luckily for her they weren’t naked, just shirtless and the boyfriend in his briefs. When she told me again waited for the boyfriend to go home and had a talk with my son. I was angry ( which I admit wasn’t something good ), he had disobey me just because he wanted to have sex. I made it clear for him, his boyfriend couldn’t go to our home for a long time. I explain him that this was for the better of both of they, at that age they shouldn’t be having sex. He was very mad, repeating how this was the only place where they could be alone, but I stood my ground.

My wife disagrees with me, she told me that I was too harsh. I understand why he is angry but if he is going to disobey me and do something he shouldn’t do at his age, I will not change mind. I don’t really know what to do, I don’t really want to separate him from his boyfriend but I still think he shouldn’t be having sex. Any suggestions for how I could deal with this?",11Mar2020,1
720,"So my min has been through a lot. Me and my brother's dad left when I was 12, my brother was 15.

My mom suffered what called melancolic depression which is a severe form of depression. She couldn't work full time and such.

Being left by our father was a major hit on her mental health. For some reason our dad came back a couple of years later but the divorce was still final.

My mom became clingy to me and my brother, to a point where my brother stayed only with my dad. I switched between on weeks.

The last year she has tried to have a constant presence in my life and it feels like she's forcing herself into my life. I've taken action by telling her this and that I need space to no avail.

She is now feeling really lonely as I've taken a big distance from her and barely lives with her anymore. But she keeps saying that she can take care of herself even if that is bot the case as she's been on some new relationships where the guy has been abusive but she clings to the feeling that he wants her or something, and that she isn't alone.

Shaking, vomiting, feeling hot and cold, feeling like everything was crumbling. I talked it through with my husband, and I have a therapy appointment that I've been waiting on. *All of a sudden* I feel like quitting school and don't feel as in love with my husband as I used to. I feel the same today. I can't eat or sleep, I don't want to be with anyone or be alone either. I felt this way a few years ago when I was on birth control, felt great and motivated as soon as I quit. I'm not going to make any rash decisions at the moment because who knows, I may come out of it but I need some clarity. My poor husband has had to listen to me cry and puke all night and day and I can't look at him without feeling crushing guilt. I don't want a divorce, I don't want to quit school.

My parents advised me I could quit if I wanted, because I applied and got a job offer that would start in June at the end of semester. So i did.

So obviously it's a good plan for me to go there.  Only trouble is, being at work when she was flirting, I wasn't really able to get her number or give her mine, and I forgot her name.  I remember what she looks like though.  So if I go down there I'm gonna have to explain it to the receptionist and try to describe her and stuff so I can get an appointment with her.  To me, that seems kinda sketchy, like if someone came to my job and did that it'd be weird.  She told me to, but the receptionist doesn't know that.

730,"I made friends with someone online via tumblr five years ago, after I lost my friends after walking away from a fundamentalist church. Friend A has been helpful and kind for years, but now I feel she's stuck and dragging me down with her. She used to have another online friend she was obsessed with, even cheating on a 10yr-long partner with. When they fell out a year ago, it's like I took her place. She messages me all day and expects a good morning and good night message or else she thinks something's wrong. She makes passive aggressive comments about how 'secretive' I am when I don't share everything with her. She's jealous: when I made another online friend (""B""), A not only actively got upset at me about it but eventually went and became closer friends with her by very conveniently getting interested in all Friend B's interests and hobbies that Friend A never even feigned interest in before, effectively 'taking my place'. When I got a girlfriend, A kept telling me she felt she was being replaced and both wanted to know all our business (like what we've done sexually) in very awkward ways and also would get upset if I made plans with my gf without leaving any time for friend A.   


Every time I talk to her about it, she falls apart, acknowledges she's doing wrong, and apologizes- she cleans up her act for a few weeks, then it's back to square one. I don't even want to be online anymore because of her. I feel suffocated. Oddly, I feel really, really resentful and I don't even want to spend time with her anymore- I feel like I have to fake it and act friendly and now it's getting harder and harder to 'act'. I don't know why I feel so resentful. I feel like pushing her away from me completely, sometimes so much that it's hard to remember that I love her. What's wrong with me? What should I do next?

731,"So there is this girl I began talking to a few months ago... we work together, but in different departments and she's part-time, so I'll usually see her once or twice per week.

Anyways, we've gotten along really well and have had some great conversations... we're both kinda reserved, soft spoken people and we just connect easily, have similar interests and personality.

Last month I asked her if she wanted to get coffee outside of work, and she told me she's busy... (weeks before this, she had told me how she's busy with school, how it's stressful and she has lots of work etc.)

So she didn't say yes to coffee, I kept things civil and didn't make a big deal out of it... yet I was prepared for her to not talk to me anymore, and at best just a simple ""hello"" to be polite because we work together but that's it...

yet, to my surprise, things have continued exactly as before, even better! we've had even better conversations, she continues to approach me and ask questions when conversing, more personal conversations, she easily opens up to me... we always ask when we're working next etc.

It looks like she's also busy studying for the SAT and ACT tests in April and May,
along with work, which is what she responded with when I asked if she had any Spring Break plans...

and in the summer she said she's taking some classes so she can graduate on time... 

does it sound like she's genuinely busy, or making polite subtle excuses to avoid hanging out with me?",11Mar2020,1
732,"Made an account just to post this, tried AITA but apparently my story is too sexual in nature for the thread. Tried talking with some friends but they either dont want to give advice or have no idea what to do.

For some context, I have PTSD from being sexually assaulted. My boyfriend at the time I was attacked was not kind to me and attempted to medicate me so that I would be sedated whenever I was home. Once he left me, my wife was the first one to slowly work with me, and show me I had worth, and encourage and love me. Weve been together for about a year and a half with no problems. Were not actually married but plan to get a certificate so I can fill out my FAFSA; were engaged but wedding isnt until after I get through school and in the meantime we call each other husband and wife for gender affirmation, out of love, and for simplification.

Last night my wife and I both agreed we were gunna be sexual, because she wasn't feeling well. I had zero objections, completely agreed, and said we should go to bed now. I felt awesome about this because I've struggled with taking rejection nicely in the past, and this is the first time I took it with no complaint. I was still somewhat up bc I was giving myself a mental pat on the back and we went to be 2 hours early. I'm a creature of schedule.

About half an hour later, because I was struggling to sleep so early, I felt her... touching me, mostly pinching on my chest. I thought she might've mistakenly done it, so I moved a little and she stopped. Them a few minutes later she started again, and was fondling at my chest again, and this time I couldnt mistake it for anything else.

So i thought she was changed her mind, and was now interested. So I started to make some noise to let her know I was too. Well then she says ""Hey hey wake up you're having a bad dream.""

Me: What?
Her: You're having a bad dream.
Me: No. Wait. You werent just pinching on my chest?
Her: No

So I tell her I wasnt asleep, and felt all of that, and asked her why she was doing things to me while I was asleep, and what was she thinking. And I just feel... unsafe? Violated? How long has she been doing this? She says this is the first time but I dont know if i believe her. She doesnt even have an explanation of why. She just chalked it up to stress and feeling bad for rejecting me earlier. But I had no complaints and was very happy to come to bed?

Weve talked about doing things while I'm asleep before, but usually we talk about it BEFORE I sleep or I'll wear a special outfit to let her know I'm interested in doing that.

I ended up sleeping on the couch for a little bit, or trying to, I'm autistic and the texture of the blanket (she had my quilt) plus the texture of the couch (horrible) made it impossible. After an hour of trying to sleep I got back into bed just to sleep. But I am now spending this whole morning avoiding her and feeling cold to her. I'm very much in love with her but this hurts a lot. What should I do? I live with her and two of my best friends, and moving out would really suck as I'm the one who does all the finances, but I cant just kick her out since her job has been cutting her hours harshly.",11Mar2020,1
733,"Not really sure where to post this because it's not serious enough to clog up the Coronavirus subreddit. Thought it couldn't hurt to post it here? 

I'm in college and while there hasn't been an outbreak in my state or near my school (a few cases emerged about 2 hours away at the closest), I'm worried about it. I'm not one of those people who go to the store and buy all of the supplies actual medical professionals need to treat people (sanitation masks, purell, etc.) or massive cases of water because that seems just kind of irrelevant and dumb in my opinion. As a young healthy person with no immune system problems, I know that if I were to contract it I'd most likely be just fine in the long run. BUT I live with my parents who are on the older side and who take medicine for their health which have side effects of lowering their immune system response. I'm worried about passing it on to them even if I never see symptoms of it. 

I traveled to a state with a few cases for spring break because I made the plans way before the virus made its way there. I'm trying to be really diligent with washing my hands and doing all of the things the CDC recommends to avoid it spreading but I wonder if its enough? I'm probably being irrational but I'm seeing so many people being nonchalant about it because they have good immune systems and it won't really affect them. But the problem is that while it might not kill me, I'm worried about passing it to someone who won't be able to fight it. Am I being irrational? Should I just stop worrying about it?",11Mar2020,0

long story short, its been a year and ive changed so much. i am depressed and have no friends. even now that i have told my parents that i dont want to be married to him they take my phone and call him from it pretending to be me so that we can prove to the court that we have a relationship so he can be granted citizenship. i cant explain how i feel. its not as simple as just leaving.

i will be expected to be a happy wife to him and everyday of my life is a struggle. emotionally being blamed for my decision and how its a commitment and that 'men will be men'.

 i will shame my family and everyone will be broken up because of me. i only married him to make my family happy and they know it but also use my words against me. i was only 18 when i was asked to marry him, given various reasons and expectations and how i wouldnt be understood by anyone else and no one else would want to marry me and i didnt know anyone. throwaway account for obvious reasons. serious responses only, its urgent.",11Mar2020,0
737,"  So my cousin (18 m) just moved back to Colorado, where I (18 f) live, with his family and because we haven't seen each other in a long time, we started hanging out a lot. He's one of my best friends (I think?) and me and my little brother spend pretty much every weekend at his house. We always joke about how I'm such a heavy sleeper and I'm always the last to get up in the morning. 
  Well one day I heard him coming down the stairs to wake me up, and I was super tired from staying up all night playing video games, so I just kind of stayed still on the couch because I thought he would go away. But then I felt him move the covers away from my legs. I was like, ""Oh he's just trying to wake me up"", but then I felt him touching my ass. I was shocked and I didn't know what to do, so I just stayed still. Then after he stopped, he kind of shook me ""awake"" and I just pretended not to know. I figured it couldn't be true and I imagined it somehow. 
  Then things went back to normal for awhile, until it happened AGAIN shortly after that. Then a third time a few weeks ago when he stayed the night at my house. He slept in my room with me, and I had kind of forced myself to forget about the whole thing because I had to be around him. In the morning, the same thing happened again, except this time he pulled my shorts down and touched me. Then after he ""woke me up"", I noticed he had opened my phone to try and look at my nudes. I don't know if he saw them or not. I don't even like sleeping in my own bed anymore because it made me so upset. 
  He keeps bugging me to hang out again, but I don't want to. He also keeps making incest jokes all the time, and it makes me sad and angry. What do I do? I have to be around him, he's family.

739,"So I was talking to a girl, in our case, we will refer to her as girl A. Girl A &amp; I had been talking since just after Christmas, it all seemed to be working as things were moving forward slowly but surely. I really did care for her, after the semester started up we went bowling once, and on valentines day we hung out (and I did not kiss her, which will be important later in the story). It was all going well, however since we are both in engineering, it is not always that easy to find time to hang out. After Valentine's day, we were still on good terms but when I asked when we wanted to see each other again, she never truly gave me a valid answer. This set off some flags, as I had previously talked to a girl who had done the same and in fact it wasn't worth it. But from our chats, everything else had potential, it felt perfect. I tried to even ask her to spare thirty minutes of her lunch hour to just catch up but she had trouble even doing that.

Girl B is a friend I have had on residence at my local university for a while, she had a boyfriend for three years and I was always good friends with her, and I was truly content that way. A week prior to her and I hanging out, her boyfriend broke up with her. We had always said that we wanted to meet up sometime and do something, so it didn't seem out of the blue to make plans with her as we spoke about it even while they were dating. I told girl A that I was hanging out with girl B and there was nothing significant about it. Girl B and I went to her place, had a few beers &amp; listened to music and one thing led to another but after a few hours, I had lost my virginity. I did not think about who I could have affected and made a mistake.

I was honest with girl A, I told her what happened and it turns out she really did care about me, and that made me feel awful. I never really thought I would be in this situation but I was. We called and spoke and she referred to the time I did not kiss her and how it was so easy to just lose my virginity to girl B, which she has a valid point. From her perspective, if she did to me what I had done to her, I would be extremely hurt as well. I am still in shock.

&amp;#x200B;

Its been a few weeks, we were genuinely on speaking terms a week ago, however, she decided to disconnect and I asked her and she said it's just better for both of us. She thinks I never really was interested but I truly was, and for the past three weeks I can't stop thinking about what I have lost.

&amp;#x200B;

It really hurts because each person who I have talked to says, ""why did you tell her it happened"", yet I thought being honest was the right thing to do since I cared for her.

My question is how hard would it be to transfer to a college in one of those countries if that is even possible? I only have some college under my belt and I am young. I also understand that going to college in a foreign country would still cost quite a bit in loans (as i would not be a citizen of said country) but from what I can tell those options are quite a bit more affordable even if I am still taking on debt. I also know that there would be a language barrier and I would need and want to learn the language of said country.

So 1) how hard is it to get into german or danish universities? (acceptance rates and such)

2) how does housing work for foreign students in these countries?

3) how long has it taken you to learn a foreign language well enough to converse?

and would it be better to just finish college in the states before I jump ship to a better country.

Today I found out that my boss is already plotting what to do after I leave (even though I haven’t handed in my notice yet or mentioned that I will!) and one of his minions spread the word amongst colleagues too! He hasn’t tried to talk to me or to fix things in any way, instead he’s acting like nothing ever happened more or less. I was also meant to have my probation meeting which he cancelled and has not been rescheduled yet. 

I also found out something even more disturbing.. he made a colleague write a complaint about another colleague to use as evidence against the second colleague. I am being really paranoid that he might do the same to me. I’ve only been there a few months, I don’t understand what’s happening or what’s I’ve done to deserve being treated like this. 

Everyone is telling me to hand in my notice but I’m concerned because of a)money b) how it looks on my cv and most important because my boss can’t keep his mouth shut and shares personal and confidential info about everyone with anyone he speaks to!

747,"I'm 29 in the military. I have the opportunity to go on a duty (MSG duty) for 3 years in which.. long story short.. I'd re-enlist for 4 years, leaving me 35 upon end of contract. It's a duty where I'd be in a position to save roughly $2k monthly, and over the 4 years that would add up to 96k, and obtain a TS clearance.

I'm torn between moving back home when my first contract ends in 18 months, not re-enlisting, going home and making about $90k salary after a year or so. (I have a job hookup at a fire department that pays well).

The dilemma, I don't really want to go back home on the east coast, and I'd like to stay on the west coast. So I think the \~96k would be a great buffer for me to get on my feet in the west. Conflicting with that logic, is the reality that at a salary of 90k back home over 4 years would be more than enough to save 96k as well.

So in summary, I'd probably save more money by going back home and getting to work. It'd be in an area where I wouldn't be extremely thrilled about living, but I'd be happy. But if I take this duty, I will get to live in foreign countries, obtain a TS clearance, and have more time for free college courses.

The fire dept job back home appeals to me because I will work 8 days a month and do side jobs.

The military gig appeals to me to see other countries, and I quite enjoy military life sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

But in reality, I think at age 35 I should have a large sum of money saved.

748,"So, to start this off, i’m a liberal. I’m a proud Bernie Sanders supporter and i’m raising my son to have the same values as me.

Anyway, my son has joined the soccer team at his school. He’s been having a lot of fun with his friends and seems to be in a great mood every day after. But i also noticed a slight change in him. Today when i picked him up.

All day he had been spouting off right wing sayings and beliefs, i’d ask him what he was talking about but he said he didn’t know and couldn’t elaborate. We were driving home and he just off handedly mentioned that he wanted to go camping. I asked why? (He’s never been an outdoorsy kid, more of a homebody). He said “We need to practice being self sufficient, so we can be prepared when the government takes our guns away.”

During dinner, He complained i made just salad and vegetables, no meat. He spouted something off about vegetarian eco nuts. Then he tossed a soda can in the trash and not our recycling bin and he said “Recycling is just a scam to undermine the aluminum industry and puts hard working Americans in the streets.”  

He also asked if i had him a savings bond or anything set up. That he needs to make money  now because “Social Security is a pyramid scheme being gutted by bureaucrats”.

The last straw was when we were watching a game show together, there was a commercial showing Bernie Sanders, his campaign. I said something to him positive about Bernie and that i was planning to support him. He said “Why would you vote for a communist trying to undermine the value of hard work?”

I asked him where he was hearing all this junk. He told me his coach. I’ve met the coach and he’s an older white guy. I found out he’s been talking politics to the kids and filling their heads with junk. I don’t want my son hearing that stuff and growing up as a kid who supports the party of racism and discrimination.

To get straight into it, I was very recently tipped off about the fact that my ex partner (haven’t been together for many months and I have moved on long ago) had been skipping several court appearance dates/interviews with police relating to grooming and sexual activity with minors. I knew nothing about this while we were together. Our relationship was awful and he was emotionally abusive to me, but only put his hands on me in one extremely minor instance. For this reason I didn’t report anything as I didn’t genuinely believe him to be dangerous.


I decided to look into it myself and let’s just say I found evidence online that the allegations may be true and he may have been engaging in predatory behaviour for a while now. I was sick to my stomach at learning this. In my eyes, he went from a nasty piece of work who didn’t deserve a second thought, to someone who could genuinely hurt people - worse, may hurt children... may have already done so. 


I decided to file a report under a law in my country that allows women to give police as much information as possible about a partner who was abusive in any way to them. I gave details about what happened to me. This means his future partners will be able to look up reports made against him if they choose to do so.


I received a call from a support worker who reached out to see if I needed any help or someone to talk to. He told me that the police would be in touch to speak with me about my allegations.


Sorry if that backstory was long. Basically my question is this: I am already going to be speaking with the police about the abuse I dealt with, as well as raising concerns about what I’ve found in regards to grooming underage girls. I also have information about other criminal activity when we were together that I didn’t report, including drugs, fraud, illegal weapons etc. I’m wondering if these would be useful to mention to the police alongside the evidence I’m already providing. I don’t think this dude should be on the streets. I know for a fact he has slept with at least one underage girl purely because of the fact that he has a child with her and I have seen proof of their ages and how old they were when the baby was conceived. I’d let those other criminals things lie before this because I didn’t believe he’d hurt anyone, just that he was a stupid young-ish man who wanted to feel tough. But now I’m not so sure.",11Mar2020,1
752,"Yesterday I had an interview with a potential employee, I thought she was fantastic and asked when she could start and she said tomorrow (today now). I gave her a time to come in and instructions for parking, she also has my phone number and knows its mine.

Well today she hasnt shown up, maybe she changed her mind but I'm not sure. I'm new to this position and I havent dealt with this before. I've decided to wait until tomorrow at noon so shes had at least 24 hours to contact me and let me know that there was an emergency or other valid reason for not showing up without calling in advance.

However once noon comes I think itd be safe to say she doesnt get to keep the job, if she contacts me after then how do I tactfully tell her she isnt going to have the job anymore and why without coming off as rude or disrespectful? Should I give her more than 24 hours? Am i being too nice and should tell her no even if she contacts me after today? I really am not sure how handle the situation.

Note: I'm pretty sure she just changed her mind and decided not to show up instead of telling me which is whatever but I worry about there being another reason and how to react if that's the case.",11Mar2020,1

754,"I will keep this as concise as I can – sorry in advance, but I am feeling so inane here. 

I started this job in January. I am a graduate, and this is a minimum wage job. I work for a particular doctor on a particular clinic doing admin/cashing up (it’s private). I am based in two places: the office and the clinic. I spend most my time at the clinic. On more than one occasion, my manager looks for problems. Most people strongly dislike her as she’s rude and nasty. 

Many things have occurred that have upset me but they consumed me to the point that I was like a boiling kettle – I exploded. I exploded in the sense that I would cry myself to sleep at night… this then turned into crying at the bus stop after work, and then I started to cry in front of patients. I felt/feel intense sadness. Like, a really sad and trapped feeling. 

Finally, six weeks of this building up, I spoke to the doctor I work with. I started to cry, I feel so embarrassed still but… I just started to cry in his room. I am suffering anxiety and stress, I am on beta blockers again. I felt so much better speaking to the doctor but it didn’t change the situation because I just wanted him aware of this feeling of dread and sadness. 

Today, again… she sent me an extremely passive aggressive e-mail in regards to the smallest thing. My clinic happens alongside other clinics, so we have our own everything, i.e. card machine, folders, notes, payment style, etc. I spoke to the secretary for stamps to send a letter, she said we have our own and therefore I cannot have theirs. 

I emailed my team and manager to find out how to send the letter if I had no stamps here, I was sent this in a nutshell: ‘can I ask why you are emailing myself and the team about this when you can speak to the practise manager? I have spoken to her and she said you can use hers’… ‘also, you need to form a relationship with her because I have noticed you keep bypassing her, she is your line manager when I am not there.’ This is far less harsh than it came across. I cannot believe she is telling me that I keep bypassing when I have a set of things to do, and just get on with it – it’s the same thing every day, just different patients. Furthermore, when I mention things to the practise manager, she always tells me to speak my line manager and fobs me off. 

I am sick of this. I feel bullied. I feel sadness. I do not want to leave this job but it’s at the point I am too scared to check her texts/e-mails because of what rubbish she spouts. Should I speak to her boss? Should I take it to H.R.? Or not bother as I will be leaving come Summer (if I make it to then)?

This is one situation of many.",11Mar2020,1

759,"TL;DR: my family (apart from my mother) have become too unhealthy and controlling for me to bare so I have forced myself to cut ties, but this has left me heartbroken and I just want a little advice or some encouraging words to help me.

So, I never really write my issues for everyone to read but I guess it might help, it’s just an extremely sensitive subject to me. 

I come from a very broken family, I haven’t spoken to my father in years due to him being the destructive one in the family that caused all of this pain and separation in the first place.

Well, I have a brother, sister and my mum too - I am the youngest. Ever since I was a kid I was very different to my brother and sister in regards to personality, which meant I was always picked on and didn’t fit in. This has extended into our adult life where I have turned into the type of person that looks at my past and learns from my mistakes and those of my parents; I never forget where I came from and I stay humble and very open to many things. My brother and sister however, do show some of these traits but they prefer the “it is what it is, gotta move on and that’s it” approach...this has made them very stubborn, hard people (even if they don’t realise it).

They still speak to me like I am dirt and love to control my personal life and relationships (especially my brother). I haven’t spoken to my sister in a year properly since I always attempt to message her and conversation naturally turns dry very fast (she’s lived far away from us for a long time now). Whenever I answer back to these comments, my brother comes back with “we’re just trying to help and we’re older and know best etc”. It got to the point where I told him I have had enough and it doesn’t give him any excuse to speak to me like shit. Now I haven’t spoken to him in almost a month. 

This means I don’t have my dad, sister and brother - I only have my mum left. She tries to tell my brother and sister to speak to me properly etc but they’re too far gone and even speak to her like crap sometimes... I just think it’s heartbreaking and it’s got me really low. I have my other half, and his family treat me like their own, but it’s not the same. They’ve shown me how a real family should function and how siblings should communicate with each other. I know people will just say that it’s good that I got rid of the toxic relationship and that I don’t need it but it genuinely hurts me. There’s no way I can turn it around either, I’ve been enduring this for too many years.

There’s a lot more to the story, like they criticise everything from my career choice to my dress sense and body shamed me since I was little (even though I am now at a normal weight). My self image is so warped and my confidence is so low because of them and they don’t realise nor care because they think they’re doing the right thing...my other half has definitely helped with that though. 

I just want a little help...I don’t think I can take any harsh comment either, they’re still my family and I love them regardless, even if it’s extremely hard.",11Mar2020,1
760,"Im at a really bad situation. My mom is relentlessly horrible to my dad, and verbally abuses him frequently. my dad is a sensitive guy who was abused growing up and still deals with it, and to see my mom, who knows this and pretends to be sympathetic, doing the same thing, infuriates and really upsets me. 

last night my dad was talking to me about this and i straight up told him that he needs to divorce her. i know that sounds like overstepping, but my dad is in a terrible situation and he needs to hear that his is not ok and that he needs to get out of this relationship. i told him that and he said he thinks theyre almost to the point of divorce. 

i want them to get divorced. my dad would be so much happier, and so would i to have half my time with just him. its not a good relationship. the problem is i live in los angeles, and if they divorced my mom would surely want to move to a small town about an hour from san francisco, which i would hate so much. i couldnt live in a small town like that. 

but so this is a really shitty situation because one of these 2 things will happen:

1. my dad and mom stay together and my dad continues to be miserable and abused and probably have a shorter life cause of all the stress
2. i have to leave my big city and all my friends and move to the middle of fucking nowhere

the priority for me is my dads happiness but it still sucks that those are the 2 options

another thing is idk if my dad would even be able to move to the same area as my mom for financial reasons. so theres a chance wed live like 400 miles away. if that was the case, i would do everything i ccan to stop my mom from moving or help my dad move, but either way everyones lives would be all fuccked up and in turmoil.

764,"This has been an ongoing issue for me (23/f) for a while. I’ve known my friend (26/m) for over 2 years, we share similar hobbies and get along really well. However, I’ve had issues getting along with his friends (around the same age group, mostly guys but some gals) and it’s eating at me a lot.

I don’t really have many other friends anymore after college/adult life and I spend most of my time at home, essentially conditioning myself to be socially anxious (not sure how else to describe it). Each time I’ve gone to events and they’re all there (10+ people), I’d freeze up and become absolutely terrified of talking to them. Usually I’d just hang around and smile, speak when spoken to, I don’t think I was rude in any way like I’d talk with someone for a bit if they said something to me first. But they don’t like me because I’m too awkward/weird/quiet according to my friend. 

The first time I was ever at one of these events, my friend invited me but left me hanging for several hours, and by the time he decided to find me and say hi I was pretty upset for being left alone like that and ended up walking away (we had a falling out months later but reconciled and I think it’s been a lot better). I get that wasn’t the best thing to do... some events went by (about 3) and I thought it was fine. I had really bad issues at home in January and I was extremely upset when I went to the event that month. I probably shouldn’t have gone. I again was kinda quiet after being stressed out and later I was really upset to the point of tears so I left without saying anything, again... idk why I thought that was a good move then. 

So this became an issue and I sought out therapy for it. Now I feel like I can handle those social situations way better and I really want to make a better first impression (especially since one of his friends told him “if things don’t improve [with me and them] then it’s just not going to work out”). But I’m not sure what to do and I’m not sure if I’ll have an opportunity? I’ve tried talking about it with my friend but it bounces between “oh yeah I’ll invite you next time” and “idk they’re not too fond of you so it would be weird if you came by.” The other day when we were hanging out I broke down crying because of a lot of things going on, and I mentioned how awful I feel about the situation with his friends and how I really want to make a better impression after working through being socially anxious, and I want to fit in so we can all hang out more and I can be included in our mutual hobby. 

He said he’ll try talking to some of them but he doesn’t know. He mentioned an event they’re probably going to and maybe I could pop by for a little bit and then leave. But he said they’re kind of a**holes and that it’s ok if I don’t get along with them (I feel like that’s not the truth). He said that sometimes they’d give him beef for it since we met online and teasing that we’re dating or something because at some of these events I’d hang around him more closely since he’s the only one I know, etc. I feel absolutely terrible and honestly it’s hurting me a lot emotionally. Is there any way I can turn things around here?",11Mar2020,1
765,"I recently made a post  about my struggle with dealing with a verryy clingy kid (my partner's niece) and I realize giving a bit more context would help. I was recently sexually assaulted and I am now in my first relationship and I have learned to address my feelings and ""triggers"" with my partner and they help me deal with this trauma a lot. But now that we are staying with their family, his little 6 year old niece has been extremely attached to me and I am having a hard time dealing with this. I grew up taking care of my siblings and my younger cousins and I have always had a younger kid looking up to me. I have gone through a lot of abuse and trauma and I understand everyone needs someone they can trust, no matter the age or person, but she is next level clingy and I am feeling very uncomfortable lately. I feel very bad for feeling like I don't want her near me. 
She is always kissing me and touching me (rubbing my thighs, petting my head, arms, etc. hugging, smelling me, in my face, sitting on me, leaning on me, touching my breasts) I tell her these things either aren't ok, or they make me a bit uncomfortable and I will let her hug me but it is literally all the time now to where it is awkward for all of us. When we are with her mother she always holds my hand crossing the street, says she loves me, etc. I had a talk with her mom about inappropriate touching and also with her but she still doesn't ""respect my bubble"" and her constant attention seeking being directed towards me is very exhausting. 
I feel like maybe it is just in my mind but her family also tells her to tone it down, she is always talking to/about me and always missing me when I'm gone even just to the bathroom.

768,"now, I'm well aware the title sounds slightly petty, but let me give a little background (it get's pretty long, sorry about that).

Best friend: BF
Ex: N

So, BF and I have known each other since 5th grade, making our friendship 7 years old at this point. She knows so much about me and vice versa, I've gotten to grow so close to her over the years and I never had anyone like that in my life, so I held onto her tightly, as any good friend should. My ex, N, I met when I was a freshman in high school and didn't date him until we were both sophomores. Everything was really great to start out, but it was clear that he couldn't meet me halfway financially, emotionally or physically to put it briefly. He drained me every day with his clingy behavior and I couldn't handle it anymore, I was really worm out. We ended up having a really nasty breakup during our junior year, we tried to stay friend like he wanted, but it N told me he was waiting to try again with me after the summer, which I had made the mistake of telling him I'd wait even though that idea was made in a fit of frustration and guilt. I had moved on after that, we didn't really talk after.

Little did I know that N and BF had been talking often after we broke up. Now, I usually wouldn't have any issues with this. I felt that I had a separate relationship from them until BF told me about how close they had gotten after I asked how they were. I wasn't expecting much more than something along the lines of, ""Yeah, we talk here and there but it isn't much."" Much to my dismay, that really wasn't the case. Things between them got as far as getting intimate over Discord, which as you may expect, made me want to cry. A lot. 

They managed to grow super close to each other to the point that N would be sending me messages every time he was spending time with her, presumably to make me jealous or something, and BF just kind of let it happen. I could see it though, one time we all met up together, the minute I left, N scooted really close to BF and had his arm around her, after that, she would spend more of her time with him. 

I was honestly so hurt in that moment, I felt really sick and angry with the both of them. I eventually sent a pretty long message to BF about how I felt about them getting that close, which I feel I was pretty entitled to because of mine and N's nasty falling out. I didn't like the idea of having a toxic person back in my life. BF apologized and said that she had just gotten caught up in the idea of somebody liking her and giving her attention, like I didn't try to always make time for her during the weekends, breaks, etc (she attends a school where she's usually drowning in schoolwork, so I feel bad asking her to hang out too often for fear I'm causing her to get behind on her school). Even now, she's always saying that she's busy, but I can't help but think they're still spending time together and are trying to hide it from me.

BF mentioned that she'd cut N off after hearing about how much their relationship had hurt me. I felt happy, but slightly guilty as well because I feel I had overstepped a boundary in some way, especially because she immediately asked if we could hang out after the conversation happened. 

It's been a few months since all of this, but I've seen that she still keeps in contact with him, which made me question what ""cutting it off"" really meant to her. I've been starting to question the value of our friendship to her and haven't really spent time with her all that much since. I know it's better I just leave her alone, but I keep wanting to make time for her, despite my mother (who has made it very clear she's upset with BF's actions) saying I should just drop her completely. She justified in her answers, she mentioned she's upset with her over the fact she picked N over me, which I completely agree with. She brought this up recently because I wanted to have her over for my birthday, to which she responded, ""Why do you still try to make time for her?"" It got me pretty heated, because she doesn't seem to grasp the fact we've been friends for so long, I can't just drop her from my life (comparative to my mother, I'm a very emotional person, so it's easier for me to become attached).

It's incredibly heartbreaking to have to watch my best friend grow apart from me after all of the things we went through and I'm desperate to keep our friendship, as it's the one I've been able to keep for so long. However, I feel that BF has moved on from me and N got what he wanted. I'm still hurt a lot from this and I don't know what the best course of action is at this point. I appreciate any advice you may have, thank you for reading.

783,"I don’t even fucking know where to begin.

I guess, i want to know if me having this built up anger and hatred is normal, or if this parenting is normal, and if not what it would be called.

My whole life my mother has treated me like a pest. I’d be having troubles or issues, and she would just brush me off as being a crybaby kid. I was never held or consoled for these childhood issues, and i never talked about them.

Growing up it was always “do as i say because i’m the parent” which i’ve come to find is pretty common. It was always a “dont question me” household. 

I remember growing up, my mother would always try to hold me to the standards of my brothers, so if they did something at a certain age, i should be too and if i wasn’t i was the problem. Things like driving, or getting a job, or schooling. My brothers are 10 years older than I am, to me that’s a whole different generation, a whole different mindset.

She openly admitted a few weeks ago that she treated me the same way her parents treated her, and I told her that’s now how you should do things, she disagreed and dug her heels in as “shes the parent, shes right.”

Growing up, it always felt like she did the minimal she had to, because she was afraid of getting in trouble if she didn’t. 
As we got a new dog and she treated him in the same way, even getting mad at him when he does something they didn’t like, but they never bothered to train him or take care of him, I felt like this was definitely true.

We’ve never shared an in-depth relationship, she barely knows about my life and I barely know about hers. We are not close. I’ve stopped listing her as an emergency contact.

All of this, combined with other things I might have left out, have led me to feel hate towards her. I don’t want to be around her, I don’t want to answer my mom’s calls, I don’t want to be there if she needs me. Because like i said, i feel like she only helped because she FELT like she had to, not because she wanted to. 
I think it was tougher for her to admit she didn’t want me, than to just deal with raising a third child, because she just let her sons raise me.

My whole life I heard “i cant wait til you’re 18 so i can kick you out” and i feel like some families joke about that stuff, but for me it was another stab at my emotions, me thinking i’m a failure or i’m doing something wrong again.

She will never reason with me, she never can talk about serious subjects, she rejects them and uses her superficial superiority to affirm her opinion, and continues about life.

Whenever i say something it’s “i dont need this”

But she’ll ask me to help her.

I can’t do this anymore.

I’ve never felt what a family feels like and everytime i see one or am around one i feel dead inside, like theres an entire part of me missing that should be there but isn’t.

784,"Hello,

I don’t know if this is the right place to ask this question, but I will give it a go :-)

This week at my school we are supposed to create some kind of performance in groups and then we have to showcase it for friends and family.

So, I already find that very nerve wrecking. But my problem is that basically my group’s performance is to find a person in the audience and small talk to them for about 10 minutes. Then we have to get on stage and summarize our conversation with the stranger. 

Yes, I know it sounds weird. 

I know I need to challenge myself, but I don’t have the mental resources to do this right as my anxiety is really bad and I can barely talk to people I already know.

So should I just be say to my group this is out of my comfort zone - although it would ruin the whole performance and they probably would not understand as they are very talkative. I also feel uncomfortable sharing my social anxiety. Or should I just come up with an excuse for not attending the final performance since they would still able to perform without me?

Thank you and have a good day! :-)",11Mar2020,1

799,"I really like this boy. We have been really good close friends. We talk a lot on snapchat and gotten really close. First he got a girlfriend. Then I got a boyfriend. Short after that he broke up with his girlfriend. 2 months later I broke up with my boyfriend. So we are both  kind of single. 

We were there for each other when we had hard times. We were also both expressing that we wanted to be were the other person was and stuff. Just quit a lot of flirting. 

So a few weeks back he came to my place. We went out for dinner and drinks.  It was amazing we laughed and had just loads of fun. After that we went back to my place and played our favourite game. After a few rounds I suggested to watch a movie. We lay in my bed and watched a movie. The movie buffered and I started kissing him. He immediately kissed me back and started to feel my body. (For more details. Go to my other post about a guy that couldn’t get hard) 

So we basically had foreplay. And went to sleep afterwards. We slept in the same 1 person bed really close to each other. Every time I put my hand close to him, he would take it and put it closer to him and hold it. 

He had to leave early the next day. So he woke up while I could stay in. He got dressed and and said some sweet things. Kissed me for 2 minutes or so and left. We have been talking a lot since then. We’ve been calling each other cute nicknames and have sent plenty of I miss you texts.

800,"Background: I am a mid 20’s male in healthy shape living with a mid 70’s male with pre-existing health conditions. We get along just great and honestly he is one of the coolest roommates I have ever had. We have had no issues up until we found out we are in a major hotspot for COVID-19. Just this week there were 10+ new cases less than a mile from where we live. This man has lived through multiple wars and many crazy “fad diseases” (his words lol) and he is not too worried, but honestly I’m fucking terrified. I can only avoid so much human contact due to the nature of my work, and I have tried to limit how often I go out. 

I clearly will be safe if I get infected by the virus, but I don’t think it’s safe for me to be around someone who is susceptible to such a terrible disease. He literally fits the demographic of those who die after contracting the disease. And I don’t think I could live with myself knowing I transmitted a disease that killed a sweet old man. 

Should I move out to go live with family temporarily until this whole thing blows over? Or should I just stay and take “precautionary measures” and avoid as much contact as possible?

801,"My sleep is very fucked if i would say so like that, i sometimes go to bed at 1-2 am or sometimes even 4 5 or even 6 am. And then i end up waking up at 12 or 1 pm. This needs to stop. I'm a small streamer and i just set solid stream schedules that i wanna try holding in. 1:45 am is where i end my stream. I put in 15 mins to raid someone else and watch them and another 15 mins to get myself bed ready, and then another 30 minutes til i fall asleep in bed. so it would be 2:45 am.

Anyways i need a Bed and Morning routine to keep me motivated to go to bed and wake up. Because motivation is one thing in my life that i'm really lacking in. So i need advice for a bed routine. Since i'm living with my parents i cant really do things like taking a bath at night because of noise etc, i also don't have any books nor the motivation to read. All i have is my PC and Phone.

For a morning routine i wish i can simply wake up and have breakfast but that is not possible, i'm living a harsh life and despite the fact that i'm almost in my 20's they don't allow me to cook. So i need something that doesn't require cooking and tastes good. Heads up i'm not a fan of oat meals. I could drive to the gas station every morning but that is too expensive and stressing, despite the fact that i also have a cover for my car to protect the paint that i would have to take off and on my car every morning so that's not a long term solution, maybe once or twice per week. But what about the other 5 days.

804,"hi all! this is really complicated so i'll have a tl;dr at the end.

basically, in late august-ish, my now-ex partner (i'll call them mace, they/them) and i decided to form a poly trio with a third person, who i'll refer to as grey(he/him). the relationship was good for the first month or so, but grey was spotting a bunch of red flags between mace and i's relationship bc it tended to be a very one-sided give and take, with me giving and mace taking. i would coach them through daily(if not 2-3x daily) severe breakdowns because they had no other support system. mace would frequently admit to not wanting to change or get better.

eventually, i got tired once i finally realized that i didn't have to give everything i had and more to my relationship w mace, and i started falling out of love around late september/early november. i started to pull away and take care of myself a little more, and i started spending more time away from mace and i's shared bedroom and doing over to grey's house alone. now, i want to keep myself accountable and say although i desperately needed the distance, there were times where i acted in selfish interest and left mace emotionally stranded because i chose to leave the house when i was tired of being their only support system.

we broke up in mid december, but we both stayed in a relationship with grey (so i was just friends w mace, but grey was in separate relationships with the other two of us). during this time, it became really clear that grey was prioritizing the relationship between him and i instead of both relationships, and there was not actually a lot of contact between grey and mace. mace broke up w grey after getting tired of the distance around mid january, and that's when things got REALLY rocky for all three of us.

a lot of stuff has happened between then and now, but the important stuff starts at around 1 month ago. here, mace started trying to tell me that my relationship w grey was only ever manipulative, that he's taking advantage of me, that i am not as safe as i think i am, etc. but mace doesn't know our relationship; i know what i feel, and i feel happy and safe. grey and i are able to communicate about our issues really well and really respectfully to each other. mace has actually been coming off as more manipulative.

they checked themself into a mental hospital and got out around two weeks ago and since then, they've just been lashing out at me repeatedly even though we have already talked about where i was wronging them in the relationship, and even though i've also made steps to be better. we tried not talking for a little while, but the next day they texted me in crisis saying they had no one else even though they live with very supportive parents and they have 3 therapists and a handful of other supportive friends. i tried to humor them and talk to them like normal for a couple days, but about a week ago we got into a huge thing again bc they blew up and again tried to convince me that my current relationship is toxic. we haven't talked since then.

--- tl;dr ---
my now-ex partner mace has been continually lashing out at me and trying to gaslight me, telling me that my current relationship is manipulative+i am being taken advantage of, and that they know my feelings better than i do, even though i (the one actually in the relationship) am feeling very secure and for good reason. they hate my current partner and we constantly have arguments about the relationship, so mace and i's friendship is almost nonexistent now. i don't plan on leaving my current partnership any time soon.

i have some stuff i need to return to them on saturday, and i'm thinking of saying goodbye for good, but i'm really conflicted. a large part of me doesn't want to lose them; i want to be stubborn and try and work this out and have them trust my judgement in my own relationships. i know that i want to have a talk with them on saturday and really try to listen to each other, but i just don't know what the ending should/is going to look like :(. is it worth trying to be stubborn together and work into a friendship again, or does the relationship with mace seem doomed to repeat the same ugly patterns of give-and-take while they lash out?",11Mar2020,1

812,"So a while ago, my girlfriend and I threw a New Year's Party and a friend of hers (we'll call simp) starting flirting with her and then going up to me and disrespecting me. After the party was over, I spoke to her about it and she found it a bit unbelievable because of the way he was treating her compared to me. He then invites her out on some that's more akin to a date. She declines and he gets very bitter.
He joins her group of friends to go out, he hijacks our house keys and ditches her at the party venue. 
Myself and a friend of mine kick him out the house after this stunt. Not long afterwards, a close friend of my girlfriend calls her asking if everything's ok with her and I. When she asks why, she's told that Simp and his friend have been saying the following:

OP is raping his girlfriend.
I saw OP make her cry and then force her inside a building she didn't want to enter.
She wears so much makeup to hide her bruises, not because of showcasing her makeup skills.
At New Year's OP yanked her out her pool forcefully, I saw it happen.
OP gets angry when she doesn't do as he says.
OP gaslights his girlfriend into thinking the abuse is normal.

Usually with rumors, I wouldn't care. But these are bad. Very bad. I was under investigation for allegedly raping a girl when I was 18. Meanwhile, she snuck me into her house, I lost my virginity to her and then screamed rape when her stepmom found out about it. I was let go thanks to the WhatsApp messages and voicenotes I kept. Regardless of how it ended, that destroyed my highschool image because kids believe the juicy stuff more and now if a second allegation had to come up. I'm borderline screwed because the previous allegations will always follow me.

I'm really scared and freaked out at what will happen. She's  a very popular girl with alot of friends and if one of them calls the cops, they'll come down on me hard. I can just feel it.

A bit about him: He has a petite build and is lighter than me, and he has really only had sex once before we met up, and before that he only got a few blowjobs. 
When we met up, we tried having sex but had to stop midway because the thrusting action for him was getting too tiring (and we already took turns with me riding too). He also couldn’t orgasm from my blowing because he had apparently jacked off earlier that day (before we agreed to meet up). We cuddled and had great conversation, and even though we didn’t finish, I still had a great time and he says he had a great time too. He has never had a relationship and he is completely new to the whole concept of a fwb.

since then she’s been texting and snapchatting him, and he’s been responding. all of this is fine, i try really hard not to be possessive or crazy. i’ve never ever tried to control him or search his phone or anything toxic like that. 

Anyway, last night he told me he was going to bed early and i was sick so i passed out fairly early (8:30). he stayed up till 12 talking to her? and i know he’s been exhausted lately so that’s out of place. and he wouldn’t’ve done that for me :(. 

I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it 

TLDR: bf stays up late chatting with his ex after telling me he’s going to bed early",11Mar2020,1
819,"hello, i'm speaking right now on behalf of someone else. let me just give you some context first:
1. we live in a very conservative and religious country
2. the person who wants to run away is above 18 
3. his parents are horrible, i can't tell you everything they've done but please trust me when i say, he needs to be as far away from them as possible.

anyway, this person (let's call him bob) is trans, he has been trans for four years now. he lives with his family and has very strict parents. they are horrible, his father especially. bob's father is a cop with a very high rank in the force, so he abuses his power to control his son. he put a tracker on bob's phone, tapped him and broke into his room many times...

bob ran away a year ago, he went to another city (the country is small but the city is almost 80km away), 
he got an apartment there (used the cash he was saving up before) he ditched his phone and didn't tell anyone about it.
he was fine for a week until his father tracked him down (no one knew how).

he wanted to transition and live peacefully but they found him and made him go back home. 
now he's 18 and things are even worse for him (they drugged him and gave him a facial surgery to look more feminine alongside other horrible things) 

he wants to run away again, last time didn't work even though he took every precaution. 

please if anyone has any ideas on how he can run away this time without ever being found by his parents. it'll mean so much to us. thank you for reading this and we'll yake any advice really.",11Mar2020,2

823,I got into a relationship a month ago and a couple days ago she broke up w me saying that she wasn't ready for a relationship anymore. This is the first girl I've talked to since my last toxic relationship and it's been very difficult to open up to anyone and I was able to open up to her. Now I can't stop thinking and I have three exams coming up and I can't study for any of them. Does anyone know how I can start to forget and just move on?,11Mar2020,1
824,"So here's a bit of background. Back in June of 2019 I had my 18th birthday party. Me and my bestfriend share the same birthday and we decided to have a joint party at my house because I have a nice garden for it. 

I had dated this girl (call her J) for a short while a couple months back and we ended on reasonably okay terms but because she was a bit mentally unstable I began disliking her a lot. However my friend still thought she was a really good friend so he insisted on her coming along to the party.

After having had a couple of drinks and playing some beer pong, I ended up blacking out to the point that I couldnt walk properly and I didnt remember anything. J saw I was stumbling and decided she should take me up to my room. I dont remember anything happening from that moment onwards but one of my friends walked in while looking for me and saw J onto of me, naked and myself without pants on. He promptly left not knowing I was basically unconscious. A few minutes later my sister walked in and told J to leave immediately, emphasizing on the fact that I was clearly not in any state of mind for any sort of sexual activity. 

The next morning came around and when I was asked about the events of the night prior, I couldnt say I remembered any of it. I was informed by another mutual friend and then by my sister about what happened.
Sick to my stomach. I message J inquiring about what had actually happened and she admitted to having swx with me (although to me it felt more like sexual assault). I ended up telling my parents and they blew it off as being pretty unimportant.

My close friends know about what happened but I haven't talked to anyone about it since those first couple of weeks. As time went on I began seeing how it affected me. I was unable to make friends with women anymore, let alone make any moves. 

I just want to know if there is any way this will pass. Will I always feel like I have no control over this fear? How do I overcome something that affected me so much but no one takes seriously? I just feel exhausted even writing about it. Explaining my side of the story feels so tiresome because everytime I do I get asked questions in defense of that girl, J. 

Also, a message to all men out there. You matter just as much as the next guy or even the next girl. If someone has assaulted you speak up, you deserve to be heard.",11Mar2020,2

828,"I know that I'm a parasite. And the reasons I keep living with my parents are mostly due to easy living. Living alone is very hard for me, because I crave having a situation where I can have someone to be admired by, but I want to challenge this. I had once lived alone and it was okay, until I had nothing to do, no responsibilities, boredom, etc.  My health and social life went down the drain for three months. If I get a place, I would be going to school and staying busy. Does this seem like a reasonable argument for moving out?

I still have some problems though.

My parents were paying for my rent at the time, but now  I'm realizing that the reason they do this is to attach invisible strings to me. This ties back into their whole idea of letting me stay with them in the first place; to make me dependent on them. I've saved up a ton of money though, so I could afford to move into the place that I'm interested in.  I'm not going to have a job in the near future, so I'm thinking about having one of my parents co-sign the  lease with me. I know that the cosigner has no rights to the property, but is that true?  Also, my parents are probably going to want to look at the place, since they 'think' that they have rights over the property (people trying to set  ANY boundaries with them won't work). I don't want any further attention from them other than a co-signature. If they look at the place and notice that there isn't a washer/ dryer, they'll probably say no to me. 

Solutions I had in mind: 

1. Don't do it because holy shit this is stressful.
2. Try to get a washer and dryer before I have them cosign anything.
3. Just run away",11Mar2020,1

832,"Hi! so as the title says I work at a preschool, my class is 14 students and since the children are very young they spread germs everywhere. We have them wash their hands after every activity but they’re constantly touching their face and mouths so it’s almost impossible to keep our classroom germ free. I’m constantly getting sick where I work because of this. My boss and co worker are not taking this seriously at all, yesterday when I went into work the first thing I did was disinfect everything, including the kids toys and my boss told me there was no point in disinfecting the toys because “if one of the kids get sick then they’ll all get sick” 
There’s no policy here regarding attendance if a kid is sick, parents are constantly dropping off their child even though they’re sick. 
I live and take care of my elderly parents, my mom’s a diabetic and both my parents have high blood pressure and are almost 70. I cannot in good conscious continue risking myself when I know their lives could potentially b at risk. I know if I ask for time off I wouldn’t be able to have more than one week off. And as the virus continues to spread its freaking terrifying and there are already reported cases in my county. I find it very difficult to justify going into work when I could potentially be exposing myself and my family to the virus. 
My boss is going on a spring break trip on the week of the 23rd of this month. I know if I ask for time off I’ll only be able to have next week off from work. If I quit then my boss won’t be able to go on her trip w her fam. Am I over exaggerating? Should I just keep going in and hope for the best and keep doing precautions on my end aka not touching face and constantly washing my hands/using hand sanitizer? 

TLDR- I work at a preschool where there is no policy regarding sick kids. My work is not taking the necessary precautions regarding the coronavirus and I live with elderly parents. The most time off i can get is only a week long, but there already reported cases in my county. Am I being dramatic or are my fears justified and I should quit?",11Mar2020,2

I just sat down on my phone (eventually since there was no one to cover, the principal had to). 


In 9th period, the some of the kids told me that someone ""snitched"" on me, and I asked the kid why he would and his reasoning was ""because I would get in trouble if I didn't tell"".

Kinda pissed off, and that teacher doesn't really like me already. So I don't know how I'm going to convince my teacher how I didn't steal (there's nothing to steal, like what am I gonna take? A pencil?)",11Mar2020,1

It makes me not even feel comfortable enough to leave my room anymore so I've been locked up in here except for to go to school and work.

We are a full on catholic family, and my sister has been with a Muslim guy for the last 2 years. She is living in his apartment while he’s finishing his last year of university. He’s slowly converting her. 

I have nothing wrong with dating outside of your religion, but there has to be respectful boundaries. He doesn’t let her buy pork or cook any pork in the house. She can’t drink or friends/family cannot enjoy an alcoholic beverage in their home when they come over. He doesn’t let her wear certain short shorts during the summer or tight/bare back dresses. She can only wear mid-thigh length. She isn’t allowed to be out late. She hasn’t gone to church with out family in years. I don’t think she’s allowed to have a bible in their apartment. 

They already got Muslim married (I don’t know the proper term) and they did it while our parents were away. The only family member present on her side was our brother (a male figure has to give the woman away). I wasn’t even invited or aware of this event. They have touched the idea of having kids and he’s expressed that his children will be brought up in the Muslim religion. 

He is taking away all of her catholic beliefs and she is settling for it out of fear of not finding someone else.

Up until now, I’ve had this great friendship with this guy for two months. We supported each other and talked to each other about our days. It was good to have a friendship that was 50/50 for once.

A few days ago, I told him about a sexual experience I had with a guy and tried to ask for his advice because I wanted to know if said guy was a douchebag or not. And my friend immediately shut down the conversation and was like “I feel like this is TMI and I don’t feel comfortable having this conversation while I’m pursuing a relationship with another girl”. And I just thought that was really odd because 1. He’s only dated the girl for a week. And 2. I wasn’t flirting with him or sexting him. So I really didn’t understand why he was acting like that. We argued a bit then he just asked if we could just move past it
because he didn’t want to argue or resolve things. Just move on. I said “I guess” in an attempt to forget about it then he said “You guess? You’re making this out to be a big thing” then I really got annoyed with him. 

We argued a little more then he asked that we just not talk for days then “reconvene”. I told him that would probably make things worse for me because I hate putting things off and I would be hurt by that. Then he said stuff like “well I don’t base my decisions off you” and “I’m not your boyfriend so I don’t know what to tell you”. I just get like he was being ridiculously hurtful. I never once flirted with him or anything so I don’t know why he’s being so standoffish. So I told him I didn’t want to talk to someone who says hurtful things to me then he said “sorry this didn’t work out” then immediately unfriended me off Snapchat.

I told another one of my friends about it and he said maybe this friend had feelings for me and that’s why he acted that way.

Supply: Are you Op?
Me: Yeah, I was just at reception 

I go and sit down

So after a few minutes I realise I need to get something from my bag, another bit of context was I had crops for break and I hadn’t finished them, so I’d put them in my bag for later.

I’m not really sure what was said but it went something like this

Supply: What’s your name?
Me: Op
Supply: (Some form of annoyed eye roll etc.) You need to put that crisp in the bin
Me: Ah ok sorry

I start to reorganise my stuff, and she continues

Supply: You were late coming into class, but you had a good reason, you don’t have a good reason for this

It hits me that she thinks I was goofing off or something, I don’t respond as I’m processing what just happened. She then continues:

Supply: You know you should’ve told me where you were

I didn’t say anything but I was thinking: WTF? It’s not my fault that you didn’t hear it!

I put the single crisp in the bin and sit back down, she goes off...

Why do I need advice? I feel really bad (I don’t like to upset others) and I get this feeling that she asked for my name so she could make it seem like she “STOPPED SCHOOL CRIME IN ITS TRACKS 😱” and tell my teacher... I know it’s her lack of... understanding (?) but I felt really bad and I started crying (once she’d gone away)... 

I needed to just tell random internet strangers and I want to ask your advice on how I could handle this differently if it happened again.

Thanks",11Mar2020,1
860,"The quick facts:
1) My room is 110 sqft
2) I currently have a Full size bed and I wanna add a Queen size bed.
3) I wanna keep an L desk, I'm open to getting a new L desk if it saves space.
4) The black A/C Window Unit needs to stay as the room gets very hot in the summer.
5) I'd like to add closet doors but it's already hard enough to access the closet without doors.

I'm open to any ideas that help me achieve these goals.

861,"Lately I've been feeling as if I don't love my partner anymore. I've felt like this before and so because of my feelings I broke up with him. I ended up regretting what I did and I realized that I still loved him, so we got back together. Currently, I am feeling how I felt back then, but it’s worse. I can’t bring myself to tell him that I love him because it just feels wrong, I have lost trust in him due to things that he has done that hurt me and disrespected me (This is not an abusive relationship), I feel as if i can’t be truly myself around him, i’ve started to think less about him and think more about someone else, and i’ve also started to miss him less.

862,"This struggle has been very exhausting lately, so I’m turning to the people of the internet for help. 

I’ve been married for several years. I love my wife. We met back in college and dated for several years before finally getting married. We clicked in college. We did everything together and spent hours talking regularly. We have a young toddler now, and I have a fairly prestigious job. 

For the past couple years, she has pretty clearly lost interest in maintaining her weight. Food has clearly become one of the things that is her source of joy. On the other hand, health is extremely important to me. I train regularly and am very careful about what I eat. It simply makes me feel better, and I feel that I perform much better at everything I do. I weigh myself weekly and keep track of my body fat and muscle mass. It has become a bit of a thorn in our relationship. Whenever we go out to eat, she typically wants something along the lines of cheeseburgers or pizza and gets annoyed when I want something lighter. She has gained a lot of weight since we were married. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love her for her, but her weight has become very distracting for me. Sex has become almost nauseating to me at times. I absolutely don’t want to fee that way, but it feels out of my control. As a male, visual triggers is what turns me on. However, we always do it in the dark since she doesn’t want me to see her, because she’s conscious about her weight. Lately, it has been such a turn off for me. I still reciprocate, but it’s taking more and more effort. Sex has almost become more like a chore rather than enjoyment. 

Needless to say, this has stressed our relationship. I brought up the issue once a couple years ago and was immediately shut down. She told me it’s shallow for physicality like that to affect me so much and that I should love her for her. It was such a big argument that I’ve never brought it up again. I’ve given hints in the past like trying to eat more healthy together or go to the gym together, but she shoots me down every time. Says she hates working out and that eating healthy food is miserable (it’s really not if you simply make the effort to find things you like and stick to it). 

Like I said, I have a pretty prestigious job and work around a lot of women. I’m not very good at knowing for sure if someone is flirting with me, but I think it’s happening quite a bit with someone in particular, and it’s extremely distracting. Like I said, I love my wife. I love our family. I would never do anything to jeopardize that, but her lack of effort makes me resent and blame her for having to struggle with the temptation. I feel that I have a strong need, and it’s not being met. 

I realize how selfish and narcissistic this whole thing may make me sound. I’ve tried for a lot time to push through it, but it just seems to be getting worse. If anyone is kind enough to offer some advice, I’m sure the first thing would be to talk to her about it. I tried that in the past, and I regretted it. I don’t know what to do. 

If nothing else, it just feels good getting this out. I haven’t told a single person about this, and it’s been killing me. Thanks to anyone who offers advice or simply support.",11Mar2020,2
863,"Me(19m) and my ex girlfriend dated for about a year and recently broke up. She cheated on me and I broke up with her. I went to her house to get my hoodies back because she liked sleeping in them and I just wanted them back since we’re not together anymore. It’s not like I told her she could have them. 

So while I was there she said “ I’m going to expose your fa****(homophobic slur) ass” because she use to play with my butt and use a strap on me in bed( we recorded sex videos)because she’s pansexual too. I’m still in the closet though. Nobody knows except my previous partners. I don’t want nobody to know I’m gay, I’m not comfortable enough to come out. I’m going to get humiliated and my family and friends will be embarrassed of me. What should I do, she’s mad because I told her mom we’re not together because she cheated.

864,"She was my first friend in grade 7 and I loved her handwriting and drawings. I used to talk with her everyday and grew attached to her. Class 8,9,10 came and we were in different  classes. I was crazy after her. I didn't  have any crush other than her the whole time. She changed her bf thrice during the time period.  I helped her with exam stress, bf stress and friendship stress. I was always there for her. She never considered  me a true friend and pretty  much used me. I used to fight with her to change her bfs because  her bfs sucked and one of them called her a slut before SHE proposed to him. She never even showed  up on my bdays. I knew each and every thing about her like fav color, food,movie etc.I gathered up the courage to speak the truth to her in grade 11 to which she replied that she is already in a relationship(to the guy who called her a slut) and she wants to marry him(lol)  and I should forget about this and remain friends with her. I removed her from my contacts  sensing  she is just there to use me but I can't  get her out of my head.

However, I have once again started talking to her because  I am a piece of shit who can't  stay away from her. She still talks to me sometimes and discusses things like chemistry  questions  but again doesn't give me any kind of special attention.  In these 5 years, she has blocked and unblocked me countless times on her own. What does she want from me? Just friendship? Emotional  support? Why is she like this. Either block me completely  or talk to me like a genuine person. I even told her not to act so bad to me to which she said she doesn't know what  to reply and so she ignores my messages. I can't  understand  her. I can't  leave her. She knew I liked her all this time but never confessed about this( I know becuz her friends used to make fun of me drolling all over her).",11Mar2020,1

866,Me a (22m) her a (22f) For a long while the 4 years we've been together I've suspected shes autistic nothing about the way she talks or does things bothers me. She was so shy getting with me but I made her feel comfortable and her melt downs dont bother me I'm always there for her. She was never diagnosed with autism but was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and held back a year with her identical twin sister who was diagnosed 4 years ago with schizophrenia. There mother has pcos and so does my wife and her sister if that helps. My wife says she sees colours and shapes sometimes and she can feel soft textures like blankets or clothes in her mouth when she stares at them as well as concrete or wood under her nails. She freaks out about loud noises even if they are small buzzing and gets so focused on her activities and sometimes wont realize I'm there. She cant stare at other in the eyes and gets overwhelmed about very small things and will talk to herself at times. She also slurs her words and shakes her hands alot and rocks back and forth but the concerning issue is her melt downs if she feel extremely uncomfortable and overwhelmed she repeats words crys and she smacks her hand on her head it bothers and worries me bc it's sometimes the table or wall she smacks her head against. She has a hard time talking to me but shes very sweet when she does. I love her so much I just want to help her. I'm thinking about getting her diagnosed as soon as I can but I have no idea where to even start or if these things are a sign of autism I spoke to her family about her history these are the things her sister has told me as well as the things shes done as a child and her mom doesnt believe in mental health issues and only got her diagnosed ADHD when a teacher showed concern for her behavioral issues.

I've always just wanted to have a chill stream, I don't give a crap if no one comes I just want to do this for myself. I don't want any Co workers knowing, no friends that I know IRL. Just certain people I've talked to for years. We have stronger bonds and I trust them more. Everyone else id rather they not come or even know. I'm tired of them ditching me.

872,"I'm a 19-year-old female. I live with my parents, my mom, and stepdad. My dad died when I was about six months and he was a murderer. Since he died it was only my mom, me, my aunt and grandma living together. We were really poor but we had each other. When I was about 7 or 8. My mom met my stepdad.

They dated for some time and a few months before I turned 9 we moved from Brazil to Sweden. I never wanted to go, I was great in school, one of the top students actually while really young. I considered my grandfather my dad since he treated me like his daughter and I've always called him dad, I still call him dad. My mom and I were best friends the whole family was very close. But ever since we moved here things have taken a bad turn.

My stepdad is an alcoholic. Now that I come to think of it the first sign that this wasn't gonna go well was when he and my mom had a fight while dating and the day after they were talking just fine. She told him that she was gonna go to the bank with my grandmother and left me with him in the apartment. He waited a bit and then started to pack his bags and told me he was gonna go down to take out some money. I was alone in the apartment until my mom came home which was about 3-4 hours after that. I wasn't even 8. I forgot about it. And so did my mom apparently.

We moved to Sweden and he started drinking more. When I was about 10, he had a fight with my mom, drank a bunch and fell out in the garden, kind of hit his forehead on the fountain outside. My mom was inside and she told me to go get him, check if he's okay. Me, a 10-year-old. I did, I cleaned his cut and put a bandaid on it. He thanked me. He continued drinking and them fighting. when I was about 13 I got my first boyfriend who after my mom made me break up with started calling me names on the internet, became very racist and abusive to me in school. I fell into depression. Or whatever it was, but I wanted to kill myself. At 14 we moved to the US where I studied for a year. I went to Brazil with my mom for Christmas break and when we came back he was drunk in the apartment with dirty clothes all over the place and vomit, he was passed out on the bed or floor. I kind of blurred that out of my mind for my own sake. We moved back to Sweden and I started at this boarding school, I didn't live there since it was only 30 min away from my house by bus. It was the worst time of my life. I woke up too early came home too late and I met someone there who I thought loved me, took my virginity and cheated without me knowing. Worst of all is that I was forced into it, the sex. The only person I've told is my current boyfriend. That was the first and last time I let anyone touch me until I met my current partner. When my mom found out, I was sl\*t-shamed. I still am. They were upset because it was an expensive school and I focused on the wrong things and I regret that now that I'm older. So much.

Starting high school I repeated a year due to too many failed classes and we had moved to the city. Where I started at this new school. Where I still go now. With my dad still drinking, my mom and I still fighting. I made friends here in the first year and second. Things at home kept getting worse, parents kept fighting, mom and I kept fighting. With her often calling me names, telling me she regrets having me and that I'm here today because of her. That I'm ungrateful. Every time we fought my stepdad took my side but she changed that, by constantly being mad at him whenever he did and telling him how bad of a person I actually am. To sum it up. In my second year, I met my boyfriend and he became the only person in my life I loved and felt safe with. I wish his family were mine since they treat me so well, with the exception of his brother and his dad. But his sister and mom really like me. He stood by me during worse fights with my parents and my mom never really liked him. She expected me to date someone older and maybe with more money. No, definitely with more money. I have never told her I love him, I don't talk to her about my life. While she often complains that I come home and go straight to my room that she doesn't know who I am. She constantly puts me down but at times she almost fools me by being nice. They try to buy me with gold necklaces, Gucci bags, expensive shoes, and trips, first-class on planes, money without me having to work, etc. All to maybe make up for the fact that we have a drinker at home who often offends her when they fight and I'm the one by her side, Always.

She accuses me of being a bad daughter, a bad person. Claiming that she needs to change her will because I might kill her for money. That I'm waiting for them to die so I can take the money. I don't know what to do. I started running to get the anger off my chest, but I ruined my knee by running too much too fast and now I have to go to therapy. So I'm stuck at home without being able to exercise. When my boyfriend and I had a fight and broke up I cried to her at 3 in the morning in my room. But she took this as a way to finally have a say in it. We shortly figured things out but she wanted him out of my life. I am no longer allowed to date him. At almost 19 years old, I can't love who I love or be with who I want. Her house her rules. Fine, but we're still together, she just doesn't know.

My stepdad went recently to rehab after drinking and falling in the bathroom. Where I picked him up and not my mom. I have constants fights with my dad too whenever he drinks due to him saying I could never be like him, as rich or as intelligent. That I am nothing. My mom recently had to get tested for cancer and I was terrified. He, on the other hand, booked a trip to Dubai a day before her test and looked up online for 18-year-old hookers. My mom swore that after this she would divorce him and I stood by her side. But he drank too much again and fell in the bathroom, again. Where we both picked him up. He had told my mother the day before that he hated me. Because I was so bad at school. I was still failing so much. I am, failing a lot. But nobody seems to care that I am damaged. I grew anger inside of me, I have never broken a single thing at home but recently started to get aggressive. I'm never heard. Ever. It's only pointed out how bad I am, ungrateful and today I was called a cheap wh\*re for what happened at boarding school. I'm constantly compared to my real father. That I'm as bad as him, that I'll become a murderer like him. It's been almost 11 years of the same thing and they just somehow expected me to come out of this normal? I didn't even notice myself changing until it was too late.

Now I drink whenever I feel sad and I blame them. I went to school drunk the other day and thank god no one noticed but the scariest thing is that it made everything easier. I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm ashamed of my boyfriend who was the one who took care of me when I drank. I drank too much and did something that kind of hurt my relationship and I see that I'm starting to self destruct. I can't help but feel that they did this to me. They ruined me and, in the end, blamed me. They want me to move out after I graduate and I have started looking for jobs and apartments to share. But I'm extremely scared of what's going to happen to my future. I know that once I move out I am going to be isolated from the rest of the family since everyone loves my mom.

I also thought about killing myself. Just end it, make it easier for everyone. But I'm too scared that if I do something, I'll regret it. It will go wrong or that I would be missing out on what's meant to happen. But I feel so hopeless, beyond saving. I wish I could just know what's ahead and that I'll be okay. I feel broken and ruined. That it's somehow my fault and that I should have been more selfish, stronger even. But I cracked, I've turned into a mess. Aggressive, drinking, self-destructive, suicidal. I hurt my boyfriend now and he was the last person I wanted to hurt or to see me like this. I've wanted to die before and he was the one who encouraged me into staying that life would get better. I don't wanna leave him but I'm so scared of becoming a horrible person on top of being damaged and I just can't let that happen. I just don't know where to go from here. Where should I start? She's starting to poison the whole family against me now!",11Mar2020,1
873,"Ok, so I am finishing up my first year in college and I really really don’t like college. Especially living on campus.

878,"TLDR - I have ADHD and Depression but take meds for both. A psychological evaluation (while on meds) concluded that I have a “undiagnosed learning disorder“. What does this mean?

I’m a 23 year old male. Basically, I did some psychological testing a little over a year ago, and the results found that I have some indiscriminate “undiagnosed learning disorder”. I was advised to get some special tutoring for school and that was about it. I had some other shit going on at the time, and didn’t really want to spend a lot of money and time getting even more intensive testing done, so I (and my psychiatrist) decided to just leave it at that.

I’ve previously been diagnosed with ADHD and Depression. I take ADHD meds and antidepressants, and was on both of them when doing the testing specifically so that I would know if I had something else. I also had a stroke in the womb, which as far as I’m aware has only resulted in some physical weaknesses on my left side and lack of grip strength &amp; muscle tone.

Anyways, i’ve been having a lot of issues for really all my life, most of which are attributable to ADHD but many of which are not... and I just want to know what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to really get more testing done, between the expenses and the inconclusive results it just kind of seems like a waste. I can list off my symptoms / strange mental issues if people are curious, but I’m not interested in a self-diagnosis.

Took plan B. Late period.

So I need some reassurance/advice/help. My girlfriend and I had sex on February 7th and we were both drunk, so we didn’t realize until after I had finished that the condominium had slipped off at some point. Her period had ended the day before (feb 6th). She took a plan B the next night, not 24 hours after the mistake. She did start bleeding within the next few days as is not uncommon, and after that was over, we had sex again the next weekend with no leaks or tears in the condom as usual for us. Then we went for a second round and I didn’t finish then. About 45 mins later we did it again, but this time I went raw for just a few strokes before putting a condom on. No leaks or tears that time either. She is now (on March 10th) 7 days late on her period according to her app, but is feeling moody and is feeling pain in her breasts and last night, “didn’t feel good”. Should we be worried about pregnancy? She hasn’t taken a pregnancy test yet, and we both know that both stress and plan B can delay a period. She’s also had some stress from a separate home situation, as well as feeling anxious about this situation.

And there's no exception including my family and friends. It persists rather long once it starts, lasting weeks or even months, before I'm back to being normal.
Symptoms include feeling depressed and being extremely tired of other people. I'm not an outgoing person to start but it's a little more than being introvert (I think?). I just don't want to meet other people. Thinking of greeting other people when I go to work makes me sick. I wish people to not talk to me at all but it's highly impossible in lab and when I'm working out my way for PhD.
I'm due to graduate this semester and just have to meet others more than usual. I think about just living in forest all alone when I'm feeling this way but then i know that I can't because I also can't handle loneliness. So I don't know what to do and  just decided to write in reddit with a new account. Thanks for reading.

So today I got home from school and my parents are obviously paranoid about the coronavirus even though it isn’t near my school district at all. Schools are talking about closing but it isn’t confirmed at the time. 
Walking into the living room my parents are there discussing if they should pull me out earlier than the school will intend to close. I try to give my two cents but end up getting nowhere as they are ignoring my ideas. I felt that they should discuss this situation with me as am the main point in this decision. I walk to my room a little agitated as they did not ask for my take on this problem and I felt a little insignificant. My dad walks in a little later to discuss the situation with me. We end up getting in a debate on whether I should finish out the week(the district will most likely close the schools soon) or pull me out. I tell my dad that I do not want to be set back any work that I will miss or be absent(I had the flu back in December and missed a week). I also say that by pulling me out a school is a disadvantage as work being done in person(like papers) will not get to me. He then storms out of the room saying I am being selfish for caring about my education and my grades. I obviously care about my family more than my grades and I told him that.

893,"On mobile.  I have a 3 yo girl and some of our best friends have a son who’s just a few months younger than her.  The kids have been hanging out since birth and are good friends.  Both are affectionate loving kids.  Yesterday at a play date, the boy started holding my daughters hand and saying he wanted to kiss her.  She politely declined and he kept pushing the issue, kissing her hands and wanting more affection.  I had her come sit with me for a moment during this to explain quietly that she was ok telling him no thank you and that she doesn’t have to hold his hand or kiss him if she doesn’t want to.  Nothing was wrong with it as she was able to refocus on what they were doing, but I’m proud of her for standing her ground and setting boundaries with unwanted touching. 

Today the dad posted something on FB calling my daughter (in his direct words) “Prude.  JK”.    

Yes I’m aware he meant it as a joke.  Do I think it’s funny?  Not really.  IMO this is rape culture thinking and never did I think that my daughter at 3 yo be called a derogatory name for not kissing his son on the lips.  I’m flaming mad and replied that we’d have to talk to his son about consent (left the tone light on FB).  

The guy also is very affectionate with our friends group kids.  Relatively harmless as a whole as we all hug and care for each other’s kids, but he will often “take” hugs from my daughter even if she’s actively saying no and pushing him away.  The friend group is pretty old-school so no one really talks about not doing forcing your kid to give hugs as a bad thing.  

To be clear, I don’t think this guy would ever do anything EVER to a kid.  However, I do want to say something offline to him about how my daughter is not something you or your son is entitled to touch or kiss if she says no.  My DH disagrees vehemently and thinks I’d be making a giant mountain out of a molehill.  The guy would not take the talk well at all. Any ideas on how to address this without ruining a friendship but still clearly defending my kid and ensuring that doesn’t happen again?",11Mar2020,1
895,"My husband and I (F) keep getting asked to get together with one of his cousins and the cousin’s live-in gf who is trying to get the cousin to marry her. He doesn’t treat her very well and has told my husband point-blank that he will never marry her.  

Although it is awkward to socialize with them because she constantly mentions getting married, (and it’s awkward for many other reasons too) we don’t mind seeing them once or twice annually. The problem is… she always invites us to get together more often.  Like, right after we see them, she invites us the next week or month. 

We aren’t unkind people and we feel really bad about this. The GF has moved from another state and really wants friends. We are tired of making excuses for why we can’t get together — and every second or third time they ask, we put them off by a month or two but they just don’t take a hint. 

She has also over shared with me and disclosed that she has extreme social anxiety, so I don’t want to hurt her feelings. 

Is there a way to say something about the frequency of these invitations so that they will not feel hurt? Or should we just keep doing what we are doing and fend them off with excuses and resign ourselves to seeing them more than we want but less than they seem to want? 

I can’t help feeling that when we turn them down all the time, they get hurt. We just saw them around XMas and once in January and now they want to get together again. It’s too much.

I love my co-workers, I get to teach, which I love, but the job is about 300 miles away from home. When I took the job, my wife and I planned to move, but my father passed away shortly after I started last year, and my family situation would make moving difficult now. Currently, I spend the work week in a hotel, and come home for the weekends. I have recently been offered a job that pays roughly half of my faculty job. I wouldn't be teaching, but it is still in higher ed. The major benefit is that it is a short commute from my house, and I would be able to spend every night with my wife and our pets, be able to see my mother and grandfather often, etc... I will save all my out of town lodging expenses, but it will still be a pay cut. I'll make enough to get by, but my salary now is pretty comfortable, so its a scary decision to make.

902,"I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. I was born and raised in the US, and moved to Mexico 2 years ago to be with my now-wife (34). I've always been a very happy, relaxed person who was always out doing things. I never struggled to make friends, and was kind of a ""social butterfly"" if you will. 

Then came Mexico. The country itself is fucking beautiful. People are very nice and welcoming, and the food is amazing. No complaints at all. 

However...

I've never felt like this before. Right when I got here I instantly isolated myself because I was afraid people would make fun of my lack of Spanish. That wasn't and has never been the case and I'd say I'm not 90% fluent in speaking and listening (there's the occasional slang word I don't get or some accents from people in smaller pueblos can be hard). I work in music and am always around guys due to it. 

The thing is, as soon as I think one of them is my friend they try something or express interest in me (not saying I'm hot shit - more like they just hit on any girl) and it honestly leaves me feeling hopeless. Girls I've found are harder to make friends with since I don't go to school and don't have a place I actually go to work. My Spanish isn't so great that I'm witty like in English, where I could think of something to talk to anyone in line at the grocery store or whatever. 

My family has never met my wife, never been to Mexico and refuses to come. I've seen them once in 4 years and that's also made me feel worse. These are my concerns :

Emotionally: I feel completely alone. I have no one to talk to and trust that knows me and my wife. 

- I feel paranoid people are always staring and talking about me. I'm assuming this sprouted from when I first came here and noticed there actually were people staring at me. Now I don't even think it's really happening, aside from in my mind. 

- I feel like literally the smallest thing could make me either cry or explosively angry - neither of which I've ever experienced in my life. I feel like I do not recognize myself at all anymore. 

- I do not want to do anything. I get extremely nervous if I'm somewhere by myself. Everything, even the smallest things, take a world of effort and leave me feeling exhausted. 

- I constantly wonder wtf I'm doing with my life. 

- My wife and I fight every day. She's threatened a split countless times. 

Physically: My neck and back hurt on a daily basis, even though I've been fit my whole life and taken care of my health. 

- I lost 20 pounds without even noticing. I wasn't even overweight to begin with so that was surprising. 

- I feel dizzy or off-balance. My hands and feet are numb often. I have been wondering if I have a B12 deficiency or it's something else. 

- I feel like I have a hangover every day. I haven't even been drunk once since I came here. 

Any ideas how I can fix this? Idk how it got to this point but I'm at my limit. I need to do something. Please help.

She wanted to hang out yesterday, and I asked her if she'd thought about what I asked. She said her answer was yes and although we were both a little flustered (in a nice way) we've started dating.

This morning I walked her to class and gave her a hug, and on the bus ride home I had my arm round her. She seems pretty open to being physical, but I'm not sure if we're technically boyfriend and girlfriend so I don't want to push it too much. 

This is going to sound ridiculously naive and immature but I'm not used to slow relationships. My last serious relationship was a shitty LDR that moved too fast and the one before that (which was my first relationship) lasted about a half year and me and that girl had sex within a few days of going out, so it was super easy to get into a rhythm of kissing and being physical with each other.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not used to slowly progressing through a relationship, physically. I've been good so far and I think things are progressing pretty naturally, but I'm a little wary of things like holding her close and getting into her personal space.

For example, traditionally on the bus we've sat in adjacent rows but the past two journeys I've had to sit by her, and she seems to be happy to move over to me. I was thinking about just sitting next to her on the bus tomorrow but I'm overthinking it and I'm worried she'll feel smothered if I chose to squish myself next to her instead of taking my own seat when there's an empty one behind her.

909,"I am an 18 year old male in his senior year of high school. I am middle eastern, but not religious in the slightest. I have all but publicly declared that I am no longer Muslim. For the past couple of months now, I have been depressed, and struggle to find happiness and enjoyment through my days. 

For starters, I don’t have any friends. Sure a lot of people know of me, but no one truly knows me. They know my first name, my last name, and that’s it. Suffice to say, no one gives a fuck about me, both students and teachers alike. I probably don’t need to even mention, but for the sake of it, I’ll say that I have shit luck getting anything like a girlfriend. 

And as you could probably tell, because I don’t have friends, my past 4 years have been spent alone playing games at home. And even now, I don’t find enjoyment in that. I don’t find enjoyment in anything i try to do.

Going back to the whole senior year of high school, I now have to talk about what I am going to pursue for the rest of my life. Well, I originally wanted to go to the military and enlist in the Marine Corp, but currently, it is unsure whether or not I’ll be able to qualify for enlistment. I have been waiting for months, and I still haven’t gotten a decision. Furthermore, guess who is getting denied by every college he applies to? This guy right here. Slowly, I am begging to fear that I will have no where to go, and I will be left behind.

And all of this has had an affect on my grades. I can’t concentrate on my work, and have multiple F’s in multiple classes. Furthermore, I have been skipping school at increasing amounts. To put it in perspective, I’ve skipped school more times in my third quarter of senior year than the rest of my high school career combined. 

All of this has accumulated to my depression, and my mental state is slowly declining. Along with the thoughts of suicide, I have been increasingly more easy to anger, and have had thoughts of harming others. To clarify, I have not done anything, and the only ones who know of this are my parents. 

Now you must be thinking, if this is as serious as you are describing, why haven’t you told anyone? That’s due to the fact I fear that I could get disqualified from military service. I have already waited months, and I am still waiting. I do not want this to be the nail in the coffin. I am afraid that I will run out of options, and I will kill myself in a couple months time. 

To be blunt, if I ever was going to kill myself, I think what I would do is go to a gun range or gun store, and use the guns there to kill myself. Either I get a gun and kill muscle, or someone else kills me,
So it would be a win win scenario.

Not going against the millennial stereotype, I tried looking for Instagram a while after that. I was able to find posts from her teammates but noticed she was never tagged in any of them. I assumed she had no Instagram and gave up looking. Weeks had passed and her school would never be at the same competitions I was at. 

Out of the blue, I decided to check Tik Tok and I found a post she was tagged in. Her profile is public but she hasn't posted anything.

914,"So, to start off, I've always been a little obese. Not morbid, but not skinny. So, I'm in 6th grade, (13F) and my class is going to run the mile sometime in spring.  The boys and the girls are seperated in P.E., which means I'm with the girls. All of my friends are boys, so I can't walk with them while I do it. I've always been a bit insecure of how I look, especially when I run. Now, the problem: If I run, I'm afraid people will laugh at me because of the way my body moves. If I don't run, I'll finish last, meaning everyone will be waiting on me. I don't run much because of this, which also means I can't run as fast or as long as everyone else, so I might be last anyways. Our coach won't tell us when we're doing it, just that it's in spring. 

We have already done this once last year, and I couldn't even run then if I wanted too since I had injured my knee a week before. I had to walk the whole time and finished second to last, and that was only because there was another mildly obese girl that walked the whole time too. But she's left our school, so now it's just me.

918,"I've lived with my housemates for 1.5 years and they're like my family. We've always been a drama free house and get on pretty well. However, ever since we've been here, one housemate (we'll call her Sophie) has always had a bit of a mean streak, and we're all getting to the end of our tether. 

However, Sophie suffers from anxiety/depression/maybe oncoming ED whereby she has even admitted to me that when her mental health is low, she can make others (unintendedly) feel like shit. She had a doctor's appointment today, but decided to go back to her hometown (we're at uni) instead. Idk, selfishly, I'm so angry at her for this. 

It's kind of just about petty stuff - she'll comment we're not cooking food right (not in a helpful manner either), brag about herself even when one of us isn't doing to well in a similar area, or tell us ""don't do that again, please!"" like we're children. Even say ""you're a bit dramatic aren't you?"" when I legitimately had quite severe back pain. Sophie also doesn't like my boyfriend (who comes up every 2 weeks) but she won't tell me, she'll just randomly ask ""so when is he leaving?"". I have made it clear to my housemates that if they have any problem with my bf being here I will not take sides and address it almost professionally. He also hasn't done anything wrong and actually does not want to even eat infront of Sophie because she makes remarks about his size portions every meal (he previously suffered from obesity, and Sophie herself worries about her weight so this is bang out of order).

I also suffer with anxiety, and because of my upbringing I find it difficult to stick up for myself which isn't over dramatic (was the only way I'd get my feelings recognised as a kid lol), and, because Sophie also suffers with her mental health, (and thus has reasoning for her behaviour) , I feel like I should instantly just do as she says, or not even tell her she shouldn't be saying that and be done with it. Apparently, even my flatmate without anxiety also feels this. 

Don't get me wrong, she's a good, kind person, and deserves to live without her mental battles. But surely there's a point where she needs to be confronted about this? For us? 

But how?

We didn't want to do an intervention type thing as, even though it's out of ALL our best interests, we would be throwing a lot of shit at her regarding why she's being an asshole. I don't like her, but don't want to hurt her either.

I also don't feel I can approach  Sophie on my own - neither does another housemate. She's too intimidating. Furthermore, the way she treats me kind of reminds me of my mum, and therefore I respond to her similarly - e.g (and I know this sounds awful) if she cries, or gets upset, or mad, I don't feel any sympathy. I just, in my head, roll my eyes. I'm not proud of that, it's another seperate issue, and don't want to convey that too her in any way.

It's causing a lot of stress, and for me to reminisce who I am as a person. She's made me cry, and given me an anxiety attack the other day.

We are moving out in June, but all going on holiday together (if the cornovirus isn't too bad lmao) in May. So I won't be living with her forever, but I don't want it to feel awkward (or rather her left out) if I meet my other housemates without her after we graduate.

I thought she was just having tearful laughter but no she ran  and locked herself in the bathroom. I could hear in there she was crying with sadness for definite, but she came out just laughing again?

This is just one example, we took her to get her photo id taken and when the camera man tried to take her photo she just burst into laughter and he couldn’t get a photo.

The first time I thought it was weird but it’s happened quite a few times now, she will at something like a crisp packet that’s empty and say a really shit joke to me like “oh that’s your dinner for tonight” and just has uncomfortable laughter like she can’t speak she’s laughing so hard? This would be fine if she didn’t start crying afterwards and locking herself in the bathroom",11Mar2020,1

923,I liked this girl that when I was in the 7th grade up until sophomore year in high school. Unfortunately I moved away but I never forgot about her. Up until recently I was hanging out with an old friend of mine catching up and we were talking about people we used to know before I moved away and he told me that girl that I liked had a huge crush on me. I was shocked but it’s crazy to think that 5 years later I still remember her and I looked her up on Facebook and I have to admit I still have a crush on her till this day. Would it be weird to follow an old crush on instagram ? Do you think that she would still remember me? Also we used to talk and see each other quite often because we were both orchestra kids so I would see her everyday for practice. But before I moved away sophomore year I stopped talking to her and everyone else that year due to some personal issues. But she even asked me why we stopped talking the last week I was there and I kinda just brushed it off like I didn’t know what she was talking about. Also my friend told me she would ask about me a while after I left. Do you think she would still remember me after all these years if I were to follow her on instagram?,11Mar2020,2
924,"Hey all, I'm new to this community. I joined because I really don't know how to handle this situation that I'm in.

I live in a fifteen unit apartment building that is for low income families. There are a lot of single parents here who often help each other out when needed. I have lived here with my three children for three years and this is the first time I have been in a situation like this, so I am not sure what to do.

A young mother of one (currently pregnant) moved in across the hall from me last month. Her daughter is the same age as mine, seven, so they have played together in our playground. Mom and I are civil, but don't have much in common as I am an older mom and she's in her early twenties. 

Last week, her daughter knocked on my door and said her mom wasn't home when she got home from school, so she wanted to know if she could stay at my place. Not wanting this child to be home alone, I agreed. I had no way to reach her mother, so I just kept my ear out for her to come into the building. (Our units are right by the entrance to the building). Mom shows up about two hours later with no explanation, just thanked me and took her daughter. I stopped her and explained that I need notice in advance if she's not going to be home so I can plan accordingly. She agreed, and I gave her my number.

A few days ago, it happened again. The exact same scenario. I remind mom to please give me notice. She claimed to not have a working phone, but whatever, it's 2020, there are apps for free calls and there is free WiFi all over the place. No excuse. 

Now, today, it happened yet again. This is now the third time she has left her child to come home to no parent. Thankfully, I was home each time. I really don't know what to do. The little girl has been here for over two hours. I've fed her dinner and helped with homework, but my own kids need to start getting ready for bed very soon. Obviously, talking to the mom is not doing anything. Should I call CPS?",11Mar2020,1
926,"I don't really know where to start with this. I (21f) am stuck in a lease with my ex (22m) until this summer. If the situation was simply awkward or uncomfortable, I could handle it; but he makes me feel unsafe in the apartment. 

Backstory: we moved in together in December. We had been dating for about a year and a half by that point, and he was insistent that we move in together so he could move out of his family's home, as he could not financially manage to do so on his own. I was previously living on my own. He has no other friends, and was extremely against getting a roommate due to being rather antisocial, even when I helped him try to look for one. Even though I was against the idea, as I didn't like him being so dependent on me, he pressured me for about 6 months until I finally gave in due to him threatening suicide if I didn't.

Our already deteriorating relationship only became worse once we moved in together. I felt forced into the situation and was resentful of it, and he was more needy and demanding of both my time and emotional support than ever before, even though he claimed that this move would be a good thing for his mental health. (Even though he was/is seeing a therapist, he often still unloaded a great deal of his emotional issues on me and expected me to be able to solve his problems. I was always willing to be supportive, but I'm not a mental health professional). I struggle with depression myself, and had been going through a rough patch due to my doc changing my meds, so this was especially taxing for me at the time. I decided to end our relationship, and spoke to him about it.  The discussion was fairly calm, and in the end, it seemed like we were in agreement that we didn't wish to continue on as a couple like this, and could remain civil if not friendly.

In the next few weeks, we tried to establish new boundaries living as roommates. We spoke about how we would handle seeing other people, and decided that we were going to go with the don't ask, don't tell approach. No talking about new partners or bringing them into the apartment. I also told him I needed more space to be able to process everything that was going on, both with my personal struggles and the end of our relationship. He continued to attempt to monopolize my time, and I began to feel increasingly suffocated.

About a month after we ended things, I went out with a friend to the bars after work one night. We met a chill guy who lived fairly close to me (only a few blocks away). We ended up leaving the bar with him and walking back to his place to hang out and maybe smoke some weed, walking past my apartment in the process. 

This is where things start to get weird. I head home as the night comes to a close, and my ex is already awake and furious when I get there.  He claims that he heard my voice as we walked by because he had the window open, and looked out to see us with a guy as we passed. He then apparently continued to watch us to see which direction we walked off in, as he later cited the name of the street the guy's apartment was on.  He screams at me, calls me a filthy whore, ""how could you do this to me"", etc.  I'm confused and offended, as it seems to me like he's the one sticking his nose in my business and getting upset when he doesn't like what he sees. We've already broken up, so his extreme reaction made no sense to me. He leaves me alone for a bit, then comes into my room as I'm trying to go to sleep and dumps a cup of cold tea on me, then shakes up a can of coke and proceeds to spray it all over my room. 

After that night, things only got worse. I've been trying to avoid him as much as possible, but when he's angry, he's confrontational, and refuses to leave me alone. He's been physically violent with me several times when he's in a rage over ""the incident"" (biting me, twisting my arm, choking me), as well as doing things to intimidate me, such as punching the bathroom mirror and ripping my bedroom door off the hinges. The only time I was aggressive back was the first time he hurt me. I was so upset that he had bit me that I bit him back as a kind of ""see how bad that feels"". Not that that justifies it, but I was hoping he'd come to his senses when he realized how much he had hurt me. I took photos of myself whenever things left a mark.

Last week, I went on vacation w/ family for a week. He tried to stop me from going by threatening suicide again if I left, telling me I'd come home to find him dead, etc. I avoided talking to him extensively on the trip except for one instance, in which he told me (while we were facetiming, so I don't have proof) that he bought a gun so he could kill himself. He's lied about buying a gun before, he said he wanted to see how I would react, but I don't know if I should risk even being in the apartment with him at this point. I've been staying with my parents since the trip because I'm too scared to go home. 

All in all, I'm fucking scared and I don't know what my options are. We co-signed the lease for the apartment, and I know he can't afford it himself if I leave, which would screw us both over. I don't know if I'd want to stay even if he left (even though I can afford it), considering I don't think I'd feel safe with him knowing where I live. What can I do to protect myself/get out of there?",11Mar2020,1
927,"How do I move on from the mistakes I’ve made? I never learn from my mistakes even though I want to become a better person. Sometimes I believe that I’ve learned from my mistakes, but I end up making the same mistakes again and again and my life has only gotten increasingly worse because of it. 

I’ve been the same unchanging person for the majority of my life and I hate it. The choices and mistakes I’ve made have been at the expense of other people and I feel immense guilt for how my actions have affected them. I think about my mistakes all the time and feel bad but somehow I just keep doing the same things again even though I know they can make things worse for me and others around me. 

I’m not an inherently impulsive person and I sit and think about my choices before I make them,  but somehow I always seem to make the wrong choices. I think this is because I overthink everything. 

My life is in shambles and I just keep making irreversible mistakes that make everything worse for everyone. I’m tired of living like this and I have almost nobody to turn to for advice. 

I genuinely ask, how do I move on from my mistakes and truly learn from them so I don’t make them again?",11Mar2020,2
929,"Since I was a child I've hardly dealt with my responsabilities.   
If I didn't want to do something I would simply find a way to avoid it and not to deal directly with it, no matter if this ended up being harder than the actual task. For me, having an insane amount of trouble to avoid a simple thing worthed it, because I didn't want to do it **therefore** I WOULDN'T DO IT no matter what it costed me. The only situations in which I would deal with a duty was if someone else was involved, because I would never dare to leave anyone in a bad situation because of my own issues.  
But now I'm a 20y/o adult who is 100% unable to deal with duties and responsabilities.

  
Mostly bacause nowdays I'm in college, and everything there is on me only. Anything I do or don't do is my problem only, therefore I don't need to do anything. It's my duty to go to college, study, do homework... But I won't, because I can't. They are my responsabilities, and I would rather do anything **(ANY-THING)** other than dealing with them.

If I have nothing else to do I simply start staring at a wall while the time flies away.

There is this constant voice in my head saying I don't have to do my duties. Because I don't want to. 

I don't know what to do. Whatever I think of doing to change my life or become a better person I simply can't do. Because when the time comes I realise I don't want to do it. The urge to avoid these tasks is so strong it's impossible to simply ignore it.",11Mar2020,1
930,"I'm in the tech field. I started a new job 2 weeks ago in a lead role at my department, and it's going okay okay. Let's just say I'm not *dis*satisfied with it.

935,"I am a 35 year old male, single and gay (irrelevant to the topic, but provided for potential context). I live in a cool city, I have friends that desperately care about me, and I'm about to be starting a promising new career. I'm generally regarded as highly intelligent and I'm well-respected professionally.  


At times in my past I have struggled with self-esteem and depression, with varying extremes. I've made changes in the last couple of years that have helped me realize I'm not ugly (hell, sometimes I even feel mildly handsome) and I've seen progress with my overall mindset. However, one thing has not changed, and if anything, may be even worse now.  


I mentioned earlier that my friends care deeply. They've seen me at my lowest lows, I've been completely open and honest with them about my struggles, and they've been there for me. They try incredibly hard. To that end, I'm now unable to take compliments from them without it backfiring. This doesn't happen with one-off compliments from strangers, typically. As an example, if I walk into an interview and the interviewer compliments my shirt, I'll smile genuinely and feel at ease. However, if a friend compliments my shirt my brain immediately jumps to the assumption that they must be trying to make me feel better and I rapidly devolve (internally) into self-doubt, or worse, slight resentment.  


This can manifest itself in the dating scene, as well. If I have an active dating profile, it feels great to get a message saying, ""you're so handsome"". But when the compliments turn more towards, ""you're so fucking hot"", my brain immediately goes to the assumption that they know I'm not ""fucking hot"" so they must be trying to make me feel better about myself (even though I'm much more attracted to ""average-looking"" guys myself, so I should be able to understand that ""hotness"" is subjective, but no, I can't seem to flip that logic back on them).  


I'm sure to some extent this is a classic case of over-thinking, but how do I turn it off? How can I do better at believing somebody is giving me an honest compliment rather than artificially trying to inflate my confidence?  


Any advice would be appreciated, thank you so much.",11Mar2020,2

946,"So I’m a college student and my school recently announced they were extending spring break and moving to online only courses in light of some confirmed cases of coronavirus being near the university (based on my current knowledge it’s more likely buildings for our second campus and not the main one where I’d be returning to, which is four hours away).

My dad is firm on me staying at home with him and my mother, but I feel a bit like a prisoner cause I haven’t left my house due to all the concerns (there were confirmed cases in the next town over before I came home for spring break) and I want to go back to my off-campus housing for the rest of the semester.

Part of this is selfish and stupid. I have a girlfriend who lives an hour away from me and her family doesn’t know about me so I barely get to see her when we’re out for breaks and I know she wants to go back to school too. I also just wanna get real human interaction in and see my friends. Other major reasoning is that I can’t focus on my schoolwork when I’m at home (I’m way less productive), having my own space would be less suffocating, and I genuinely think there’s less risk of infection back in my college town cause there’s no actual confirmed cases there as of yet.

947,"So some background, I am a 25 yo M who has been talking to this 23 yo M since January 2020. I was home on winter break from school, we matched on tinder and hit it off. I explained up front that I was only going to be in town for less than a week bc I was going back to school, but we still decided to go on a date and meet.

Well, the date went amazingly for the both of us. We went out for drinks, then bar hopped a bit and went back to my car and made out for hours. All in all, we didn’t end up calling it a “night” until like 5am. We hit it off really well and clicked like I have never clicked with anyone before.

Fast forward a little more than 2 months and we have talked everyday since meeting each other. We text each other all day, everyday and the text conversations and initiations are equal and neutral; meaning I don’t text him more than he texts me. Mostly, the conversations are about random things, memes we find on the internet, things that pop up during our day, and occasionally the “cutesy” texts back and forth. Oh, we also snapchat each other everyday and occasionally FaceTime, but thats rare as our schedules are both pretty hectic.

I honestly did not believe that we would still be talking as I do not go to school close to where I live, so I was fully prepared to maybe never see this boy again. But over the past couple months, my feelings have been developing for him and I kinda wanted to see what he was feeling. Well I am very straight forward, so I flat out asked him and below was his response…

\[Him\]: ya know i have no clue! at the start i was like omg yes this could def be a thing but then i’m also like maybe we do stay friends bc i’m enjoying this and wouldn’t want it ruined??

\[Me\]: yay!! i’m not gonna lie, I really like you and was hoping things could develop, but get it if you don’t see me that way! I don’t really want anything ruined between us either haha

\[Him\]: sorry i was washing my dogs! but yea i mean i’m very into u as well but the distance isn’t really my first choice ya kno??but at the same time i wasn’t letting that get in my way bc we have sm fun tg ya kno?? cute i just said that twice!

Here's the text message she sent me earlier today:

""So [Neighbors] want to drop my petsitting fee from $12 a day down to $8 a day (not just for future reference, but for the week I already took care of their animals--which comes out to a $20 pay cut). They don't have a care complaint, they just think $4 per animal is too expensive. Also, $12 was their number to begin with, not mine.
Most services that I read charge about $20-$40 per animal per day and they're trying to act like I'm gouging them at $4 per animal per day."" 

My best friend has been petsitting for these neighbors for 12 years now. Anytime they go off on some road trip or something, they have my best friend pet sit for the entire time they're gone.

My best friend is unemployed and really only leaves the house to hang out with me. When she's asked to watch her neighbor's animals, she takes care of them like her own. I feel that her neighbors trying to cut how much they pay her is really unfair for the amount of care she gives them.

I'm paranoid about this because my father read my journal when he was going through my room about a year ago and my anxiety about that has been through the roof since then.

That journal has everything in it- drama, illegal things, suicidal thoughts, etc. I also have 2 razorblades stored in the rear pouch. Would the school legally be able to open it past the front page to see who's it is or would that break any laws?

This is in central Pennsylvania if that helps.",11Mar2020,4

952,"So long story short, I have a bestfriend that I love dearly. We’ve been bestfriends since high school. We have been pretty busy with our own lives and haven’t talked much. We got together yesterday to “catch up” and it was all good until about 45-an hour in she goes “let’s go take a ride” &amp; I didn’t want to do this because my transmission is a bit messed up so I don’t like to drive my car too far. I mentioned this plenty of times as well as mentioning that I still had things to do to get ready for tommorow. So, she checks to see how much it would be to Uber to her house (she got rid of her car) and it says that it would be $30. I offered to pay but she insisted I shouldn’t. Then, asked if I could take her to chipotle &amp; I said yes. It’s only about 10-15 away. So, I’m about to pass that and I say “Okay I’m not going any further than this, I really have stuff to do” &amp; she goes “no please it’s still $20, my house is only 15 more minutes away” yeah which means I am now taking her all the way fucking home which was 35 min away. I stay silent &amp; she goes “ you can’t be mad, we’re bestfriends, I would do it for you” the only difference with me is, I’m understanding and undersgand when someone cannot do something and leave it at that! Not make them think they’re going one place and end up going all the way to the fucjing house. Now I am annoyed and felt like she just wanted to hang to get a ride home.",11Mar2020,1
953,"Ever since last July, I’ve had a celebrity crush on Millie Bobby Brown. I was a little worried at first because she’s 2 and a half years younger than me, and I turned 18 in October. She of course is known for playing El in Stranger Things. Not only is she my celebrity crush, but she’s one of my role models. She’s nice, charismatic, and all the stuff you’ve seen online. I actually met her at a Stranger Things Convention in Atlanta back in December for my birthday, and she was wonderful. When I got back to the hotel, I cried of it happening so fast and how nice she was and I really wanted to see her again at a Stranger Con 2020. 

A couple weeks later, it was rumored that she was dating a rugby football player named Joseph Robinson. A picture of them together cane up online and I and many people of course knew that they were dating. I of course knew that me dating Millie would never in a million years happen, but I was still heartbroken. However, I read online in comments from the news articles from people who knew Joseph saying how he was a big bully at school, and how he laughed off his friends making a inappropriate joke about MBB on a livestream. He also has been with her to several meet and greet events, including one last month according to a Mom on Facebook where he “laughed at someone with a panic attack over meeting Millie”.  Over the past couple weeks, there have been photos of them from MBB fan accounts on Instagram looking couple like and Every time I saw pictures of them together I had a sick feeling in my stomach: due to Your crush being with someone not you and the rumors of Joseph being a bad person. 

Today, even though I already knew, Millie posted on her Instagram story her with Joseph, conforming that he is indeed, her boyfriend. I’m worried for her. It’s not that she’s dating him and not me (of course I would be naive, but there’s always that fantasy), it’s that from what I’ve heard I don’t want her to be harmed inappropriately. I know I should feel happy for her, but I don’t know. I feel like she deserves someone better and someone who is more like her. I know I’d never get to date her because I’m not famous, but it still breaks my heart knowing who she is with.

I don’t know what I should do. I know I have no part in this story as Millie probably doesn’t remember me, but as a huge role model for me, I worry for her. I’m worried that she and Joseph will be together forever, and it could cause a negative effect as he keeps being with her every where (which is an obvious cause he’s her boyfriend). I think Millie is amazing and I would love to see her again, which probably won’t be till next year just to let this cool off and the Coronovirus crap. I want her to be happy but at the same time I’m nervous for her. 


TLDR: I have a crush on Millie Bobby Brown and I’m heartbroken of her dating someone who seems like a jerk and I’m worried for her.",11Mar2020,1
954,"Cheated on my partner with a younger woman at work who is now obsessed with me

 I'm 40M and work for a company as a director. I've been with my partner (40F) for ten years, never cheated, bought a house and I am pretty confident she has never cheated also. Just before Christmas, I went for drinks after work and got really wasted, woke up in bed with my my 26F colleague, at her flat, both of us totally naked. I couldn't remember a thing, and she claimed she also couldn't, but I could vaguely remember is having sex, but nothing linear and concrete.
 She seemed really cold and I thought she was pretty hot, so when she was laying with her back to me, I came onto her pretty hard and we ended up having sex again, that was until I noticed my phone ringing (from my partner) and I stopped having sex with her to answer the phone, before swiftly booking an Uber home (this girl lived the other side of the city to me).

 After Xmas, I saw her at the office and she was super awkward, no matter how hard I tried to be nice. That night, it turned out I broke her favourite necklace, so I made a resolution to fix it, which she got super weird about as it took me a few weeks to find the time to take her aside and fix it. She sent me some aggy texts saying how I was dragging this out (which I had to surreptitiously hide from my partner, who by the way doesn't suspect or know a thing), which kind of annoyed me, because I was doing a nice thing by fixing this necklace. 

 After I fixed it, which I did over coffee, this girls whole attitude has totally changed. She's gone from being awkward and hostile to overly friendly and super, super flirty, both in person and via text. I've been quite cold via text, calling her 'man' and being dismissive of her texts somewhat, but in person I've been friendly and smiled at her and said hey whenever I've seen her at work.

 Tonight was her birthday drinks at work, and a few weeks ago she texted me saying she wanted me to come. I turned up and knew only one other person well, so wasn't going to stay, but she insisted I did and I ended up staying for about an hour, only sat chatting to her. I felt super guilty, as she was being mega flirty and I was flirting back, because she's hot, and quite frankly I enjoy the attention from a woman 14 years younger than me. But I can tell, this girl is super into me and I really feel like I've dug myself a massive hole. I left after an hour and she texted me saying how she was glad I came and made her night.
 
 I have no idea what to do. We get on super well as friends and of course I've already slept with her. But I've got my partner who I love and care about and have to live with the guilt of having slept with someone else everyday. Any help, Reddit, would be vastly appreciated.

My “apartment” is a very old house with 5 units in it, and me and my roommates are the last unit left because our landlord is waiting to sell the place after we move out and he also literally doesn’t give a crap about helping/fixing anything around the house until we text him multiple times. It also used to be an old frat house and has had multiple years of people from my uni renting it out. 
Because I’ve now lost my source of income because school is canceled, and my lease doesn’t end until June, is there anything I can do to ask my landlord to like ... give us a break on rent? It’s not his only source of income at all and it’s significantly cheap anyway, and the worst he can say is no right? But how do I say it in terms of legality? My parents really want me to move back home and since I don’t have a job or classes anymore I don’t really need to live in this city anymore.

958,"I (20M) used to be in love with my best friend (18F). We met at college last year and I fell for her hard, but she didn’t feel the same. I was pretty annoyingly affectionate with my words and gave her a bunch of compliments all the time basically, to which she just said stuff like “awe, you’re sweet”. Obviously this was obsessive and inappropriate behavior, which I’ve corrected, and I’ve gotten to the point where I’m able to just be friends with her and don’t obsess over women who I have feelings for. And that’s great, I’ve grown a lot as a person. This girl is also now my closest friend, and I am hers as well.

However, yesterday I learned something about her, and Im not entirely sure how to feel about it. While talking to another friend yesterday, he revealed that my friend who I used to be annoyingly affectionate to would show him the texts I would send, and they would laugh at me together behind my back. This obviously bothered me, because those texts were sent in confidence, and it seems like she just showed them to other friends of mine and ridiculed me about them.

I’m not entirely sure how to feel about the situation. It was over a year ago and I’m aware I was being a little ridiculous and pathetic in the way I handled things. On the other hand, this feels hurtful, and seems cruel. I understand I was acting like a loser, but does that justify being ridiculed? Is it unfair for me to be hurt and angry over something that happened over a year ago? Do I confront her about this? Is my anger justified?

Tldr; I used to have feelings for a friend, and would sent her annoying texts about how much I like her. I recently found out she used to show these texts to others and laugh at me about them. Should I be upset, and what should I do",11Mar2020,1

I don't enjoy school, I like going, but I daydream, I think about how life could be if I wasn't this stubborn or boring.

I’m a 18m who has 0 social life other than a PS4 friend who I’ve been talking too for the past 5-6 years, I’ve only ever been to a friends house once when I was in the third grade. I have a couple people at school that I socialize with in class but at lunch and in the morning I sit in the library playing on my phone, I go straight to my next class when the bell rings I don’t talk to anyone on the way there. Most of my classes consist of me sitting there not talking because I’m too nervous of what people might think of me when I speak or look at them. Last semester I almost failed because I didnt want to do a presentation about my dreams because I didn’t know and I’m very nervous about speaking in front of my class. Ive never been abused or anything i don’t know why I’m so self conscious about my looks when I’ve really never been bullied or abused. I don’t even talk to my father who I live with, I just can’t, in my head I’m like say something do something but my body just goes “ok” I’m monotone 24/7 other than when I’m with my mom. When I’m with her I’m like a kid again. Most of my life was spent with my mom but where she lives I can’t go to school so I have to live with my dad. I go over to her house on the weekend when Sunday rolls around I get depressed realizing I’m basically going to spend the next week alone. This mindset of me being a loner with no friends really only happened when I moved freshmen year, I’m now a junior. When I moved I was promised I’d go back. About a 2 months before I moved I was living with my grandparents and my dad, well my grandfather passed away, and this is why we moved. About a year later my grandmother passed after having a stroke. I never cried, I felt sad but I just woke up the next day like nothing happened. Everyday feels like the last, it’s like a rotation, I wear the same clothes everyday because I go to school with uniforms, I stay in my room everyday from when I get home till when I go to school the next day, I use to play video games but that has gotten boring. Everything has gotten boring. I used to skate but I don’t anymore, I’ve gained weight. I barely shower and brush my teeth. I rarely clean my room. My gpa is a 1.7, (I only have 4 classes) my grades are eh, did I say I have no motivation? I smoke pot as soon as I get home because I need some sorta escape. I actually just cleaned my room and brushed my teeth because today has been an extra mentally hard day and I feel like it helped.

I was very fortunate to be sponsored by my job, as it has kept me in the country and made things a lot smoother in terms of being able to live with my fiancée.

However, my fiancée and I want to move to my home country as it will provide better opportunities for us to earn money. Plus, we both agree that he should meet my relatives and experience my “world”. We are planning on leaving next month, which means I will be forfeiting my sponsorship at work. I feel so guilty.

I'm expected to go to college full time, buy a new vehicle ($25k but that's my choice, I need it), and pull 40+ hours a week. Before starting college i was constantly berated on bombarded with questions of ""why aren't you going to college"" ""you're wasting your life"" blah blah blah.

I mean, if the market tanked and I had nothing I'd probably just say ""damn"" and go about my way and that seems to enrage everyone because I just dont care. I dont feel much anymore.

I'm pretty care free for the most part but I guess it's the bad kind of care free lol. This isn't really a plea for help or anything, just some venting.

I don't want to settle for working in a grocery store or marrying some rando so I can leech off them for money. 

I want to actually earn my own money. And not just a sad tiddlywink that'll keep me from starving and being eaten by maggots in some moldy apartment in the suburbs. Or whatever hellhole awaits me once I leave or finally get kicked out by my two old farts.

But here's the problem. I have pretty bad social anxiety, my social skills are virtually nonexistent, and I have zero previous work experience. None. Nothing. 

I haven't gone to university. Yet. Was planning on this year, but I have too much on my plate and have not gotten proper therapy for my mental issues yet. 

Therapy is hard to get here. I have to wait months just to escape the waiting list and get a session. So no hope of doing anything before I get my head fixed. 

The only jobs worth getting here are related to pharmaceuticals, electrotechnics or economy. None of which I'm patient, stable or *cough* smart enough for. I could try, yes, but I fear I'll break preeeetty fast.

I was planning doing something with philosophy/languages, but teachers/translators are the lowest paid people in the country. So, despite my love for languages/philosophy, I'm afraid that's a no no.

978,"I have worked at my current job for 8 months. I loved it, and I’ve been promoted three times. Over the last few months, things have really gone downhill. It seems I can never do anything right in my manager’s eyes, and I’m at my breaking point. Staying in this job isn’t something I want to do. It is emotionally exhausting because of the way I’m being treated, and it’s physically demanding which is really taking a toll.

Over the last month I’ve applied for close to 100 jobs. I interviewed three times for one position, but the other “finalist” was chosen over me. I’ve interviewed twice for another job, but I haven’t heard back from them. The way they spoke at the second interview, I think I probably have the job. However, it’s the same pay rate I’m making now, it requires me to buy a whole new work wardrobe, it’s Monday-Friday (sounds great, right? Wrong.) which means I won’t be able to take my son to his doctors’ appointments, let alone my own. To top it off, the interviewers really talked the position down, and made it sound very undesirable. Now I’m not even sure if I want it.

I am so mentally burnt out that the thought of applying for just one more job overwhelms me, thinking about preparing for and schmoozing at another interview doesn’t seem possible, and having to learn a whole new process at a new job sounds so daunting and exhausting that I just want to stay where I am.

But where I am makes me want to quit, give up, and be homeless or lay in a hole and die. 

I guess you can add depressed to my list.

Does anyone have any ideas how I can lock my room or protect it when I leave the house? 

A few ideas I’ve got are: 
- Some sort of subtle camera 
- Taking my super private things (journal, money etc) and putting them in some sort of locked bag or something in my room like a safe or something 
- would be really cool if you could buy some sort of contraption that you could lock your bedroom door as you leave but there is no key or anything.

Hello r/advice,

I'm in a terrible spot in my life and I would greatly appreciate some advice and perspective. Some info- I'll be turning 30 after the summer. I'm uneducated (grade 11 dropout). My G2 drivers license expired under 20,000+ in tickets. My credit score is terrible (low 500's). I owe money to several service provider companies (phone/internet) totaling about 5000. Thankfully I don't have any credit card debt. I don't have any job skills- Im physically fit so I've always done generic labor work with basic tools. I've suffered from debilitating waves of depression my whole life and it's made it impossible to hold down a normal job. The longest I've had one is 10 months. I've taken all sorts of pills in the past but the positive effects are always short lived and I end up in a rut again. I got my testosterone levels checked 2 years ago and they came out at 400 peak. Doc said that was normal so I put that aside as a potential cause.

I'm currently working a gig job that covers my expenses. I live alone in downtown toronto- 1250 in rent, 300 in food, phone and internet is 250 because I use a pay as you go card (I cant go on a plan since I owe the major providers) and my job is heavily reliant on topping up data. I live month to month. If anything were to happen to my health, my phone- anything small- I would be out of an income. My family and friends have bailed me out countless times and are tapped. I'm on my own. 

I don't know what to prioritize first to get my shit together. I'm tired of being this pathetic loser. I want to enjoy life and stop putting strain on everyone around me.

988,"Hello, thank you for taking time to read my post. To give background information, I'm a 28 year old male, from the northeast of the USA, I am unemployed and haven't worked in several years, I have no college degree (apart from an associate's). I live with my parents in a rural town. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for many years. 

I'm posting because I've been feeling mostly hopeless about my future, but had a small hope that people here could help outline possibilities. I want to be a useful member of society and also be able to support myself eventually. I feel my options for that are very limited here, that I need some big changes in my environment if I'm going to end up changing myself, mostly because of the lack of work options here.

To that end, I've been considering things like joining the military, but I don't think I could get in on medical reasons (mental health, a few other smaller things), and I have some moral objections about the US military. However, I don't think everyone involved in it is corrupt or evil or anything like that, I'm sure there are positive viewpoints about it that I just haven't been exposed to. I also like the idea about it of serving others and how it would give me structure and put demands on me. I like that it would take care of basic needs like housing and food, and potentially offer a career.

I've looked a little at things like the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, but would worry that once my time was up with them I'd end up back where I am now, just older. I've thought a little about teaching English as a foreign language, but have a similar fear of it being a dead end almost.

I'd like to be able to finish a bachelor's degree at some point, I used to study Computer Science and might go back to that. I plan to try and get in contact with mental health services soon as well. Anyway, I'm open to any random thing that you think could be helpful, like if you've heard of a great trade apprenticeship or something, or anything.",11Mar2020,1

Not sure if I'm in the right place or that I'm following the rules to this sub. If I am, please check me Mods!

I'm seeking some advice around my insurance options...

The data:

1. I'm leaving my job on April 3rd
2. I'm currently living in Hawai'i
3. My wife is pregnant and due May 7th
4. We are moving to Seattle in September
5. I'm currently insured by HMSA through my job
6. I'll be unemployed but working as a 1099 employee after I leave my current job.
7. We see a naturopathic doctor... so insurance doesn't cover much anyway (eye-roll)

I'm wondering what my options are and what would be the best route for my unborn baby and my wife who will be recovering.

My perceived options:

1. COBRA
2. Medicare  

   1. EDIT: Medicaid
3. CHIP (for when baby is born)

Are these my only options? Which would be the best option based on the information provided? Is there anything I need to be weary of so I don't let my insurance lapse? Can anyone here help me out!?!?

I'm a college student and despite the fact that I'm concerned, I prefer to not freak out and be around people who also don't freak out and can make jokes. And I have been with those people who are my fellow college students. Everything was fine until they decided to send us all home.

My parents being upset makes me upset and I have always kind of absorbed my mum's fear just out of empathy or whatever. Anyway my mum has always been an anxietysupreme^TM and has been freaking out about all of this because she is in the age range (early 60s). We're in the US. 

Given that I'm going home soon my stomach is in knots and I feel nauseous thinking about the fact that I'm going to have to deal with her being a little in hysterics. I don't know what to do. And I admit it's starting to freak me out a little as well. Seeing my parents scared kind of makes me scared in a weird primal way. I just need to be around people who are taking it seriously but are chill because otherwise I'm gonna go fucking insane.

I'm sure this all sounds selfish because I'm just thinking about how I feel, but I can't be there for my mom if she's going to be scaring the shit out of me. And I don't want her to be afraid, it's not worth it.

993,"I find I often feel much more sad during the summer. I think it would help a lot if I either learned to manage my expectations or if I found more fun things to do. What are some small steps I can take to move in one of these directions. More details below if you're interested.

Just want to throw it out there that I'm not feeling sorry for myself. I generally accept how things are and will try to move on from there. But in the summer I do feel kind of empty. I want to do better this year.

I'm 23(F). I live with my partner and we have a great relationship. He has bad chronic pain. I find during the summer I'm more aware of this when other couples are out doing all these things that we cant do/used to do.

My two closest friends moved away around this time last year. I used to play tennis a lot with one friend, and used to go on long walks and have great conversations with the other. I dont have any tennis partners now, and I dont have any more close friends like this to chat to.

I have a neighbor I cat sit for on the weekends. She goes to live with her family during the summer, and I really miss her cat- as stupid as that is. 

Back in University when I had lots of friends around, I used to go to a lot of bonfires/BBQs or go on camping/road trips during the beginning and end of the summer. We'd spend a lot of time outside playing soccer and volleyball too. I miss these things and these people.

I am pretty introverted and have a lot of hobbies I like to work on. Usually, it's enough for me. In the last few years I've become a lot more comfortable spending time by myself as well. (More accepting of being introverted, really). But again, something about the summer just makes me feel down. I feel like I'm missing out on the life I wanted for myself, and I just become more aware of it when everyone is out doing fun things. Especially at work when people ask what I'm doing on the weekends- my coworkers usually have lots to say but I'm almost always staying home and doing routine things.

996,"Hopefully I can condense this to the critical points of information, but it's a tricky one, so here goes.

I (32F) met my ex-husband ""D"" when I was 19 and he was 20. We got married 5 years later. He then left me 14 months later out of the blue (another story). When we first started dating, I also met his ex-girlfriend ""T"" (15 at the time) as she lived across the road from him. Being kind of young and naive, I didn't think much of it at the time, but looking back, BIG fkn red flag. His version of their relationship painted him very much as the wronged party, that she had been emotionally abusive to him and he had attempted suicide after she left him (red flag 2). I accepted his story at face value, because again, naive. His mother also painted a similar picture, and was openly hostile to T. T and I got along well though, and D was happy with me establishing a friendship with her. 

Fast forward to a few years after we split, T and I were catching up, and exchanging mutual grievances that we had with D, and the true story came out of what happened in their relationship. The summary being, he had repeatedly coercively raped her, had offered to pay her for sex, had used his suicide attempt to try to guilt her into being with him again, and had deliberately twisted the story of their relationship to our mutual friends so that he appeared to be innocent. Again, he was 20 and she was 15 at the time. 

T and I have maintained a really strong friendship, and I absolutely believe her version of events because it filled in a lot of the gaps in his story, and he had since done a lot of things that point to him being a sex pest (e.g. he has been fired three times for sexual harassment, once while we were still together).

My dilemma: We still have mutual friends, and many of those friends are morally aligned with me in that, if any one of my friends were to tell me they had been abused or raped by someone I knew, I would cut that person off without hesitation. My friendship with T is really important to me, but it makes me sick that D is able to continue to just... exist within this mutual social group without any repercussions. Should I speak privately with those who I know are still friends with him and advise them of his past actions (especially given some of those friends are women), or is this a situation where I need to just... not tell anyone? I'm very conflicted, as a sexual assault survivor myself, and I'm not sure what the best option is here. I have been sitting with this knowledge for a long time now, and I'm still no closer to a solution.

So I live in a 2-2 apartment and a new roommate just joined me when it was time for me to renew my lease. So a key factor here is that both of our names are officially on the lease.

If i were to get a job, i would have to rely on my mom driving me until i get enough money for a car, and my license. 

Finally, even if I were to get a job, and convince my mom to drive me to work, and i somehow save up enough money to get a car, and then finally get enough money to pay for my car (as well as insurance for the car), I don't know exactly how to tell my mom/dad that i am leaving their house.",11Mar2020,1
1014,"I'm 17.

I have this girl for English class and yesterday she came up to me right before a club meeting and started asking if I was going to prom and asked why I wasn't going. She said ""Oh you play football and you do engineering club?"" I said yes and we just talked about a few assignments. She said she wanted to be my friend. After I told her I had to go, she asked me if I was comfortable with a hug and I said not really and I just kinda left for the meeting.

Now note that I'm usually the quiet kid in class and I have no experience with any of this. I refused the hug since I was trying to stay professional with the dozens of kids next to me waiting for the meeting to begin because I'm the president of the club. Was she just trying to be nice?",11Mar2020,1
