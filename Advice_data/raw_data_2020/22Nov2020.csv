3,"To start off, my mom has 3 years of college done but never finished her bachelors due to unforeseen circumstances. After her tenure at college, she was able to edge in a job at a bank in their lending department. She was able to do really well for herself, and she probably would’ve gone farther. A few years after she started she got married and had 5 kids and decided to trade in her career for being a stay at home mom.

Now just recently, we have had to endure the loss of our wonderful step father and because of this my mom has lost half her support. She  really wants to keep the house that she is in, but  does not now have the financial means to do so.

My question is what would be the best route for her as a middle aged women without a college degree be able to do to get back in the workforce and make a good livable wage right now?",22Nov2020,1

5,"Hey everyone,

I don't really know where to begin. I'm in this weird place where I simultaniously hate and love myself. I am proud of some of my accomplishments but at the same time I critizise myself for not being better. One of my biggest problems is that I'm wasting most of my time on social media. I want to do so many different things but at the same time I'm not really interested in them and I have the feeling that I would like myself to do them just because. I don't enjoy the things I used to, but at the same time I don't want to quit them. I feel like I have no really close relationship to anyone. I have friends and family but I would only share a limited amount about myself. I don't know if it's just puberty or what. When I come home after school and I still have time for things I just lie in my bed for at least 2 hours. I procrastinate until I can't anymore.

I'm just rambeling I know but I just wanted to ask if anyone has gone through this phase too? How can I motivate myself to do anything? How can I have meaningful releationships when I normally keep everything on surface level. How can I improve my appearance because that's something I want to become better at (starting to do my hair and make-up etc?). I feel like puberty has just knocked everything over and if it was up to me I would want to move away to a completly new city and start over. I know that my situation isn't bad. I don't have any real problems and I do have an enjoyable life and everything I need and more is handed to me. I just feel like I'm not living up to my full potential and I wanted to see what reddit thinks about it.",22Nov2020,1

7,"Sleazy business practice...

I want to make a company realize how sleazy they are...can I get some help? Here’s the deal...

My SIL’s father passed away recently after a hard fought battle with multiple medical issues. The day of the ceremony, the family returned home...they collected the mail from his mailbox and inside was a card...but this isn’t just any card...and is the reason I’m hoping some can help me point out the gross unprofessionalism...

The card was from a local realtor, with my SIL’s father’s obituary...(so they knew service times and dates)...offering their services to sell his home!!!! Please help us point out how extremely unprofessional that is! Let the family grieve! 

Please leave a google review and mark them as unprofessional.

8,"Yesterday my uncle went hunting with his buddies and had a heart attack, I won’t go into detail, but he was only 52 and it was a complete and utter shock through the family. 

In 2014 I lost my great grandpa and my grandpa, in 2018 I lost my grandma, and in 2019 we lost our great grandma. Needless to say, we have lost so much in the past 6 years but what’s different this time is that it was very very sudden. My other families members died to either an illness or some form of cancer, we knew it was coming, we had time to say our goodbyes, but we didn’t see this one coming at all. we didn’t get to say goodbye. 

He was very depressed after losing his parents, and we were so worried when we got the call that it was because of suicide. Thankfully, it was not. We were always so close, he took me and my cousins camping when we were kids every other week during the summer. We went to Canada to stay in a cabin and go fishing for a week, no internet, nothing, we got chased by a moose but that’s another story for a different time. Maybe I’ll tell it in the comments so I can remember a lighthearted memory. 

He was a father figure to me because my dad quickly fucked up my relationship between us two (see last post). My dad is the only person left alive that I have on that side of the family, we’ve lost everything. 

Does anyone have any advice on dealing with the first few stages of grievance or maybe how to be there for my dad, it’s heavy questions so feel free to pick one or both, or neither, either way I appreciate you guys listening to me. If you have any advice or even just a prayer, I would really really appreciate it

9,"My girlfriend of 3 years and I had discussed going down to her family’s place for thanksgiving (not going to say where exactly for privacy purposes, but let’s just say that it’s near locations that are seeing a surge of COVID-19 cases). I had brought this up with my mother, who clearly thought it wasn’t a good idea, but told me I am an adult now and that it’s my choice. I came home from work this morning and told her that I decided I wanted to spend Thanksgiving with my girlfriend (we barely see each other due to our jobs keeping us busy and she works days during the week and I work nights on the weekends). My mother proceeded to get very emotional, and even though she said it was my choice, she “didn’t think it was the choice I would make” which instantly made me feel terrible. 

I responded with telling her why would she say it was my choice if she wasn’t going to react this way when it didn’t go the way she wanted. I proceeded to tell my girlfriend that my mother was nervous with the health crisis and for her and the rest of my family’s sake I would be spending it at home. This made my girlfriend extremely upset, and I don’t blame her. She was so excited for me to go with her, and now I went back on my word. After going back and forth with her, I went to bed. Upon waking up, my mother is now telling me to just go with my girlfriend “because she wouldn’t be able to stand seeing me depressed at our family’s thanksgiving and now she didn’t even feel comfortable going”. She then proceeded to tell me that she never told me not to go, but it’s as clear as day from her actions that was the case. I spoke with my girlfriend a little while ago explaining everything that was said, but as I figured she still doesn’t want me to go and is still upset with me. She says I should’ve stand up for our relationship sooner, and that she was really hurt.

I understand where she’s coming from, and I probably deserve it. I’m just really hurt myself and now my decision will no doubt be the sore thumb in the room for both thanksgiving dinners. I spoke with my friend and he thinks my girlfriend is in the wrong for not understanding the situation with everything happening with the pandemic. But I also love my girlfriend to death and seeing her upset like this rips my heart out of my chest. I don’t know who or what I should be upset about, but I’m just super stressed and hurting bad. Any idea how I can fix all of this? I feel like neither my mom or girlfriend will want to speak with me for the foreseeable future. 

Thanks for listening.",22Nov2020,1
10,"I play cello at my church on Saturdays and Sunday’s. Our church is huge, and has a ton of room to social distance and space out. Right now, we’re at 25% capacity, which means up to 250 people can attend mass at a given time. People sit every other pew, sanitize on the way in, masks are required, and each party is seated 6+ feet apart. No one gets up for communion, and singing is discouraged. Where I sit and play my instrument is at least 12ft from all other humans, with the exception of my director. He sings and plays piano 6ft from me, unmasked. I am masked the entire time. With thanksgiving coming up, my sister and her husband are coming to town, and do not want the rest of us doing a lot, in order to be as safe as possible. Which I totally understand. However, I think me going and playing for mass is a pretty low risk. Now, I do go in my director’s office in between masses and we chat, and stuff, but we are masked, and I am able to space out. I suppose if he got it, I’d be exposed. I tried talking to my sister again, telling her that the measures are safe and all, but she got kinda mad at me, and wasn’t even willing to listen to the safety measures of the church. I’m torn, because I don’t want to jeopardize thanksgiving, or my own health, but I also don’t think it’s that high of a risk, and playing my music there brings some such inner peace, and a break from everything going on. It’s so soothing and I just enjoy it so much. Any advice or thoughts is appreciated. At this point, I’m thinking about just skipping this weekend, in order to make the right political decision for my sister.",22Nov2020,1
11,"

I work two jobs and doing my masters and my dad wants to talk every two three days. And I don’t think I unreasonable for thinking this is too much

The thing is my dad is kinda of a trigger for me, he’s kind but he was a huge enable to abuse I had (up until 3 years ago, which resulted in me leaving the house). I don’t talk to anyone else in the family but him. But he also played a roll in their behavior by financial abusing me, emotionally abusing me and holding me back from opportunities in life. Because if this, I’m 34 years and very behind in life and I blame them for it. I still however try to keep a pleasant relationship with my dad even though he has tried over the last couple of years, but it still doesn’t change that I have to work very hard to play catch up

The issue is he wants to meet and talk regularly and It honestly takes an emotional toll and prep to talk to my dad even though our convos are 5-10 minutes, it’s just the mental energy it takes to speak to him. We don’t talk about much but if we didn’t have such a history, this wouldn’t be this much of an issue, but because we do, I can’t.",22Nov2020,1

19,"Before I start I just want to warn that I have a real difficulty in expressing my feelings and this is part to blame of my problem. 

I have a habit of getting attached to a girl really quickly and I met this girl online who coincidentally lives really close to my house. So we started chatting, we met up and started going out. 

Last week it became official. I asked her to be my girlfriend (as cringe as it may sound) and then a tragedy followed. 

Her ex-boyfriend and best friend ( they used to go out a while back but it didn’t work out so they stayed best friends ) had committed suicide  the night I asked her out. And obviously this hit her hard and I thought that this could be a big opportunity for me to help her and show my affection for her. And I knew that if we get trough this we’d become a strong couple. 

But now a week passed and we were calling and talking about emotions. And I told her that I sometimes feel like I’m the only one showing affection and she told me that she finds it difficult to love someone and to miss people. But this gives me the feeling that she doesn’t even like me or anything. I know I’m exaggerating but what does this mean. I’m so confused and now it has left me feeling like shit. 

I’m meeting up with her tomorrow and I don’t know how to express what I’m feeling. Like im the only one trying to make our relationship work. I always ask to meet up, to call, etc.

21,"Is this what growing up is. I've lived in the same house my entire life. My parents are average at parenting, not so strict but also rather tough. Your usual ups an downs you'd get as a child type stuff.

I moved away at the start of 2018 to another part of the country for uni. Originally I came back over the mid semester breaks but eventually just went back for the Christmas holidays. Now it's 2020 and I'm home for this weekend and that's it. I have little reason to go home. I work full time with no payed leave and I'd rather just relax than have to organise planes and all that.

My family understand me only turning up once in a blue moon, but I dont think they realise how much I hate it. All weekend I've been berated for my weight (I've been underweight since I was born), for my lack of muscles (I'm extremely strong for my size), and for the clothing I wear. It's the same thing every time I come home.

I came home for the summer last year and ended up feeling a form of dismorphia. I felt like I was in the incorrect location, home wasn't home and I just wanted to get back to where I belonged, which would be my new home. I've experienced the same thing this weekend.

I've never been homesick, which I find funny because now I'm returning home, I'm finally feeling homesickness for the first time in my life.

Looking for some advice here. My car (2016 Mercedes C450) was having misfire problems last week so i took it in to a shop. They called me this morning with the lovely news that they found oil soaked in 3 cylinders. Long story short, engine is shot. As you can imagine a new engine isnt cheap, around 20k not including install. Mind you im 5k miles out of warranty as well. I still owe about 18k as well. Talk about up the creek without a paddle. 
Anyone have any advice? 

As far as i see it my options are:
- Pay it off and sell it
Would wipe my entire savings and investments
- try to fight MB into good willing a repair or a portion
Probably unlikely, spoke to service advisor and previous owner didnt keep up with it
- let it sit in garage until its paid off monthly

25,"As stated in my title, my sister asked me if I can take in my niece as she attends the local college (they live overseas at the moment and will not be relocating back any time soon).  I have no problems doing so but wanted to confer with my husband first.  What I want to know is...what ground rules should we establish prior to having her live with us?  Here are some things my husband and I have already brainstormed over but I’m sure we’re missing lots.  Any input is greatly appreciated.

•Funding.  I’m sure my sister and her husband will provide finances for my niece to attend college.  I’m also positive that she will provide cash for my niece for entertainment.  We don’t expect her to pay us for room and board and we don’t expect reimbursement for food.  But, I also know that my sister gives my niece a small allowance that I know will be burned through quickly.  Should I ask for emergency funding for whatever she may need while staying with us to be returned to them should we never dip into this funding?  (Eg. medications, etc)

•My niece is older than my own children.  Do I enforce a curfew with my niece even though my niece will be over 18 when she will live with us?  Is that even reasonable with an ‘adult’ living under our roof?

•Do I limit her visitors, especially boys?  My sister is a whole lot more chillaxed about her children dating young.  Yes, my children were taught sex ed and I have no qualms about answering any sexual questions they bring up.  I’m just not ready for my younger children to think it’s okay for them to have sleepovers, etc.  Do I make a rule that no males can stay past midnight?  Again, is that a reasonable request?

•When we go on family vacations (once Covid passes), do we invite her along?  Pay for her if she comes?  Leave her home alone in our house?

•Make sure my niece will have a monthly pass for transit fees that my sister will provide.  This will be her main mode of transportation.  At any time if she requires a ride home for any reason, we will pick her up, no questions asked.  (Not to be abused as an expected ride home when she parties past transit hours a little too frequently.)  We will do the same with our children when they get to that age. 

•My niece has a history of sticky fingers for things she likes.  Nothing expensive.  Just clothing from my daughter or toys, etc.  Do we install locks on all our bedroom doors?  Do we offer a lock on her room door too?  Do we let her know that we expect to be able to do room checks if and when we deem there is a need?        (Our children are aware of this rule but we have yet to enforce it.)

•Due to the nature of my husband’s job, we are a ‘zero tolerance drug’ household.  I’m sure my sister is a whole lot more lax regarding cannabis use.  How do we reinforce this without being overbearing?

We just want to make sure we look after our niece as we would one of our children without clipping her expanding wings.  We aren’t her parents but want her to be safe while living with us.  What else can we address to make this work for all of us?",22Nov2020,1
26,"I've never had a single in-person conversation in my life that ended well. For some context, I am 20 years old and I just got off the phone with my significant other. It was terrible. It started off as a simple bantering of why I liked a particular subject more than another one being discussed previously (this is vague, I know this haha). Quickly, our conversation escalated; it became me trying to explain my side, using minutes at a time when it was my turn to speak. Whenever I had finished, they would reply, ""I see where you are coming from but..."" and then they would state something I had already established and agreed upon in my own speech as though I had completely disagreed with it. I get frustrated, I attempted to explain that I had already said it, and that the fact wasn't even the topic of my previous testimony, but they completely misinterpret my words. 

And before you think that this is just a matter of them not listening fully or being a good partner, I must assure you that they have not been the only person in my life that such tragedy occurs with. Refer back to the first sentence. I get so frustrated that it never goes well, and I break down. I feel trapped in my own mind, and the only way out is through writing my words down. I'm always understood then, and it's actually how I was so lucky to find myself a romantic partner, through the internet. They were drawn to me because I was ""good with my words"". They comment the same on my letters I write them, or my essays and books I write and share with them enthusiastically. 

But I've never heard it about the words I say to them. It breaks my heart. 

They say they are madly in love with me, assured that they had no intent of leaving me even after my... past attempts to un-alive myself (if you know, you know). I want to make this experience more enjoyable for the both of us. I can't imagine life without them. 

I've pieced together some of the problems wrong with my speech as a reflection.

In short, I speak like the essays I write:

1. The word choice is often complex and hard to follow. I will sometimes use unconventional grammatical patterns when I speak and type. When reading, it is easy to understand. When speaking, one can get a little lost.
2. My claims are often hefty and have several points. For example, this that I am writing right now. I use specific points to clarify my main claim of speaking like the essays I write.
3. I elaborate, but always tie in at the end to my main point. It is hard to follow verbally, but easy to understand when one sees the visual representation of the language.

What I say is hard to follow, hard to grasp. Anxiety has made me insecure of my own word choice. I rarely speak anymore- I have become frightened of what I might say. It is well justified, oftentimes it results in my speaking partner assuming I insult them when I try to say it was misinterpreted. I always bring it back to my own fault when clarifying this, I make sure of it, so that they know it is not directed at them but it is completely my fault.

I thought I would have been able to keep even one person in my life, one person to understand how I think and feel. But I cause them pain with my words of affection. Something is wrong with me and I don't know how to fix it. I attempted to tell them I shan't speak anymore to them but they don't understand, they actually got frustrated that I wasn't ""making any sense"". Perhaps if I show them this they finally will. I don't want to seem rude and patronizing though.

I don't know what to do. I might go mad. I think I already have. I don't know. I'm a nervous wreck. Please somebody help me understand what is wrong with me. Am I stupid? Incompetent? I wish not. I find that the likely case is that my intelligence is on the opposite end of the spectrum. I've read stories of geniuses who resort to living lives of seclusion because of frustration with communication. If my assumption is correct, I'd rather be a blubbering idiot. 

I don't know if I can deal with this much longer. Therapy doesn't work (for obvious reasons). I'm a wreck. My life honestly depends on this. 

So please, somebody ease my mind. I beg that somebody will be able to understand this; I'm starting to doubt my own skill of writing now. Does my reasoning make sense as to why this is happening? What should  I do to improve things with my partner? Am I even capable of a relationship? Of love?",22Nov2020,1
27,"Hello, everyone! I'm a 21M from Mexico.

Currently, I'm in a situation where I have to choose between pursuing a major in something I love vs. continuing with my current one.

I come from a middle class family in the North of Mexico. My parents have basically dedicated themselves to work stressful jobs to pay for my siblings' and my tuition, expecting to see us have a great future. Both of my older siblings (I'm the third and the youngest) studied / study medicine. Medicine is quite a tricky profession to study here in Mexico. You basically have to go to med school for 7 years and then try to get into a residence (which can be really hard here in Mexico), and if you get into one you basically receive a very basic income unlike some other countries where you get a decent one. There are public and private universities, which means that if you got to a private school (and if you receive a loan) your parents will be supporting you for a lot of years.

That's basically what happened with my family. Both of siblings went to private universities in another city, which means that my parents had to support them for a lot of years (my brother is 28 and my parents are paying his loans, my sister is 23 and she's still in med school). So, when it was my time to decide what to study everyone pressured me to not choose medicine. I was 18 and deep down knew I wanted to study it, but I got under the weight of the pressure and decided I would study something else.

I first went to CS and I literally hated it (I was depressed  my first semester), knew it wasn't for me and changed to BI. From the very beginning I also knew I didn't like it. I went with one of my university's psychologists and told him about my situation. He told me to evaluate the pros and cons of changing to medicine and of staying in my career. I decided not to change and convinced myself I was okay with it. The reasons were that I really liked the life I had back then. I was studying in another city, living without my parents, I loved my university and had already made friends. Had I changed I knew I'd have to study in my local public university since my parents wouldn't be able to pay my medicine tuition for so many years to come.

(NOTE: back then I really didn't want to study medicine there. In my current college (where my brother wen to med) yo have access to great technology and teachers, the opportunity of doing clinics in the best universities in the world, great research opportunities, great connections, etc. Meanwhile the education in my other university is good, but there's a lot of corruption and the teachers have a very old mindset).

So, fast forward I'm currently in my third semester. I'm, again, sure I don't like it and that I want to study medicine. I've been recently having mental health problems because of this, it's really affecting me. I don't want to change my major for another medical related field, since they're really poorly paid and the work conditions are usually very bad too (nursery, paramedic, bio science, etc.). I'm trying to convince myself that this is the right option, but I think about my future and I literally have no dream and my only goal is to get a decent paying job, I feel I'll be miserable my whole life and I'll hate myself for not going to med school. 

My two options are:

1) Going to med school in my local university.

Pros:

\- I'd study something I actually like, something I believe it's my passion (I listen to my sister's zoom classes and I plan to read books just be 100% sure if I'm going to do it).

\- My parents wouldn't have to pay my tuition and my expenses of living in another city, which would be a relieve for them.

Cons:

\- I'd be studying for AT LEAST 10 years. My parents would be 69 when I finish. They wouldn't be supporting me financially, but I also want to help them with money through this years something that I wouldn't be able to do if I'm studying medicine.

\- I don't really like the university and I'd be losing my ""freedom"" I currently have. Though, I also keep in mind after med school I can move to a different city.

\- I'd be entering with 22 years with classmates being 17-19. I know I shouldn't really care about this, but medicine is a very long career so I'd be earning money at 33+ years.

2) Keep studying my current degree

Pros:

\- I'd be graduating in 2-3 years and some years after I'd be able to help my parents financially (though graduate salaries aren't really great and I'd have student loans, so I could take some years).

\- I'd stay in my current university and city, which I love both.

Cons:

\- Well, I wouldn't be happy with my job (probably even miserable) and I believe I'd regret it forever.

So, what would you do if you were in my position?

TLDR: I need to choose between studying medicine (which I love) at a university I don't like and without the possibility of financially helping my  parents, or keep studying something I don't enjoy at all.",22Nov2020,1

31,"I apologize for the long story but I need to describe everything.

So my relationship with my mom has always been tumultuous, but it's gotten better as I've gotten older but we still have pretty frequent disagreements and arguments. Now I'm a pretty hard person to get mad but my mother always riles me up and then tells me I'm overreacting or have an anger problem when I get mad at her. Even my husband told me he never sees me get as mad as I do when I'm with her and he sees that she pushes my buttons too.

Anyway, my family has a long standing tradition (20 years) of doing a homemade secret Santa every year that I organize. It's just 5 of us, we get given a name, and we make a low cost homemade gift for them. Every year we're normally together but this year my husband and I won't be traveling to see my family because of covid. I asked all my family members if they were ok paying for shipping if they got me or my husband and everyone was ok with it except for my mom who was complaining about shipping, so when I set up the draw I excluded her from drawing me or my husband so shipping would't be a problem for her. 2 days ago I get a message from her in the family group chat saying that she drew a name but ""with so many members of our family poor students this year try to do something on the cheap"" I immediately was annoyed by this because my husband, sister, and I are the poor students so if someone was to say something about that it should be one of us, but I just asked her if that really needed to be stated in the first place. She then asked if we were mailing items to each other and I told her she didn't have to because I excluded her from picking a name that required shipping. She then goes on about how theres a generation gap and how she and my dad were frugal growing up, and that we're lucky we didn't have to grow up hearing things about the great depression. I told her I didn't understand where any of this was coming from, especially since she didn't have to worry about shipping. I asked if she wanted to be excluded from secret Santa since she seemed to have some problem with it this year and seemed annoyed at the monetary aspect of it. She again starts talking about generational gaps and attitudes with money and I have no idea why any of this is relevant. I told her that my husband and I are both unemployed and have been so for a majority of this year and that I don't need any monetary lectures, I'm just trying to keep one of our Christmas traditions going this year since we won't really be able to do any of the other ones since I won't be going home. She then tells me I don't need to get irate and mad at her for all of this. 

This makes me the most mad because this is what she always does. She inserts herself or her opinion in and when you tell her to stop she keeps going and then when I crack and snap at her she acts like I'm having an unreasonable reaction. I'm trying to not let the Christmas secret Santa thing weigh on me but it's been hard this year knowing I'm not going to see my family for the holidays and now I feel like one of our favorite traditions has been soured a bit this year. 

The above conversation has me the most frustrated because this is how all of my mother and I's arguments go and I want to know if I'm actually being unreasonable, or is she gaslighting me and has been gaslighting me for a long time?

If you think I am being gaslighted, do you have any tips on how to proceed around arguments with my mom in the future?",22Nov2020,1

35,"**Backstory**

I moved out of my parents house and into a new (and far away) city just over 5 years ago.  It was the first time in my life that I felt free.  In those five years I completed my education and gained valuable work and life experience.  I also spent all 5 of those years in therapy, mostly processing my upbringing.  

I had been unhappy in my job and with my boyfriend for a while and in October I decided to make a change.  I broke up with my boyfriend and quit my job.  My parents invited me to move back with them and offered to hire me at their company so I could have some time to figure out what I want to do next because I am really not sure where I want to live.  I just know I didn't want to stay in the city I was in.

**The problem**

So coming home seemed like a good idea at the time.  I have been here for a couple weeks I cannot wait leave.  Here is why:

1. They told me that I cannot see anyone other than them.  Literally anyone.  I understand that covid is serious but it is not severe here and there are no restrictions saying I cannot see people.  One of my favourite parts of living on my own was only having to be accountable to myself.  Part of my problem in my previous relationship was feeling like I had no independence.  Back home, I have less independence than ever and I am so miserable about it.  Even if I do get to go do stuff, I feel they will want to know where I am going, what I am doing and who I am hanging out with.
2. They have their own life and don't have room for me in it.  I understand that they have lived just the two of them for over 5 years and its an adjustment but I feel like they aren't making any adjustments.  One example: They have a loveseat in the living room and that is it.  I am mostly confined to my bedroom.  Earlier today my dad was at the kitchen table and my mom was at the loveseat.  I sat on the loveseat to hang out with her.  She instantly, and I mean literally as soon as I sat, got up and went and sat with my dad at the table.  Like, I get it.  They both like each other more than they like me.  That is ok.  Doesn't mean they have to dismiss me though.  
3. They are so fucking rude.  They insult me and think its funny even though I don't laugh.  I am okay with teasing and poking fun but they just straight up insult me.  They don't listen.  I will say something to one or both of them and get literally no response.  When I finally do get to have a conversation with either of them, they constantly interrupt.  I have never felt so dismissed in my adult life.  One example: I was having a conversation with my mom and my dad called out because he needed something (not urgently needed though) and she literally stood up while I was mid sentence to help him and didn't even say anything to me like ""be right back"" which I guess is because she never came back.  She never heard the rest of my sentence and didn't want to.  They do not care about what I say.  I don't know why they invited me to live here.
4. My mom is trying to pin me against my dad.  She is constantly shitting all over him and just dumping their unresolved issues onto me.  Telling me about how he can't communicate and he does this, that and the other thing.  It makes me like both of them less.  She tells me how horrible he is all day long but if I say one negative thing about him (even just venting), she loses her mind and makes me feel like an awful person for saying such things about my dad.

I regret coming here so much.  They make me feel small, unimportant and alone.  All of which are things I have talked about extensively in therapy.  I had actually dealt with those issues because they have been recurring feelings from childhood and throughout my life.  I got to a point where I didn't feel that way.  But being back here they are all coming right back.",22Nov2020,1

39,"I'm 23 years old and trying to buy my first car. There is a $7,000 car I really like. I wanted to do a $3,000 down payment and finance the rest of it. Unfortunately, the car dealer isn't very flexible with their financing options. They only want me to pay about $200 per month for 2 years, when I was looking to pay about $100 per month for four years.

My brother in law (39 years old) went with me to this car dealer since he's very knowledgeable about cars and saw how disappointed I was when the dealer told this to me. When we left the dealer, he made me an offer.

In addition to my down payment, he is willing to cover the rest of the car's cost himself ($4000). In return, he would like me to pay him whatever I'm comfortable paying per month

I am shocked that he would offer this to me, and I told him I would think about his offer. I'm usually very frugal with money. I've NEVER asked to borrow money from any of my family members, so I'm very hesitant to say yes. I have not told any other of my family members that he made this offer to me, including my sister (his wife). Him and my sister have been dating since I was 2, so I've practically known him my whole life and he's like an older brother to me.

The rest of my family isn't well-off, but he works as an electrician and he's very well-off. I work as a caseworker, and my salary isn't very good right now. A lot of the postings for jobs in my field require me to own an insured car, so my goal is to hopefully get a raise at my current job or find a better-paying job.

Should I say yes, or should I tell him no? I was approved for a personal loan from my credit card dealer (peep my post history), so I have a backup plan.",22Nov2020,1
40,"So a few months ago I (15M) was working on a lawnmower with my dad in our garage.

All of a sudden I felt really dizzy, which was normal at the time and I just ignored it thinking it'd go away, I ended up passing out and hitting my head on a concrete floor.

When I woke up I didn't know where I was, and my dad was leaning over me freaking out, I didn't even recognize him until a few minutes later.

He told me i hit the ground so hard it sounded like a bowling ball, and my heart stopped beating, he gave me cpr and I woke up with a big gasp.

An ambulance showed up a minute later and took me to the hospital, I was there all day and they ran a ton of tests.

I didn't have a concussion but they said I might have been born with a deformed heart and it couldn't get enough blood to my head.

Fast forward a few weeks and it turns out I'm just growing too fast, I was fine until about 2 weeks ago.

I was spending the night at my grandparents house with my cousin (16F) all I remember is going to the bathroom and waking up to my cousin knocking on the bathroom door.

Apparently I passed out again and hit the bathroom counter, which knocked everything off the shelf.

I told my grandma the next morning and she called my mom, who was obviously freaking out.

Ever since then my heart has been beating weird, my breathing has been off, and I feel dizzy all day every day, I don't like being babied so I haven't told my parents. 

I don't know if it's a big problem or not, but I wanted to come here just in case.

42,"Hello all. If I'm being honest, I'm mostly seeking validation for my feelings but I don't have anyone here to talk to so I came here. I live with my parents, I'm a 23 year old college student and all my life my mom and I have never been on the same page. We used to fight alot because I was depressed and suicidal and she just didn't understand and thought I was overreacting even after I was diagnosed. Things have been better since she's retired and we haven't had any fights in the past couple months but that changed tonight. So growing up ive always had a problem with germs like I'm not super worried about them, I'm not a hand sanitizer but or anything like that but I refuse to drink from cups that other people have used and I know it sounds weird but it used to be worse ( I used to not eat my food if someone breathed on it or was near it) and I've always struggled with this and my parents are aware of this. So my niece came over to spend the night and i went in the kitchen to help with dinner and I noticed that my niece was drinking out of my cup that only I use every day because I can't use the other cups in the cupboard and my mom says "" she wanted to use your cup "" and then just walked away. So I was very upset obviously and usually I would just stay quiet because I don't want to start a fight but I decided to say something so I asked her if I could speak to her privately and explained that it made me upset that she didn't ask me first and there's a reason why I only drink from that cup. She got mad at me, surprise surprise, and said it wasn't a big deal and i was being too emotional and this made me more upset so I told her this is why I couldn't talk to her about anything because she always judges me and doesn't even try to understand where I'm coming from. I can't help that I have this problem and it makes it so much worse when i try to explain what I'm feeling and I get shut down and told that I'm being ridiculous. Am I over-reacting? I know it sounds kind of stupid but to me, it's a big deal and I'm not really upset about the cup, I'm more upset about the fact that my mom refuses to acknowledge something that bothers me.",22Nov2020,1

45,"I was at a local pub having beers with friends. It started out like a typical Friday night wit my friends, full of tons of fun and laughter. My town is small, so this pub is the only pub in town. We live near a city, but locals typically do not risk driving there for drinks. There was a guy that I had seen multiple times before and had caught him making eyes at me on several occasions. Well last night he was extremely drunk and belligerent. He is a mutual friend of one of my friends and coincidentally that mutual friend bought us a round of shots. The guy took this as an opportunity to make his move. He told me that he wanted me and found me to be very attractive. I politely declined and told him I was not interested. I guess his ego was bruised because he remained persistent in hitting on me and following me outside to the back patio where everyone was smoking cigarettes. While on the patio, someone made a comment about the size of dicks and he immediately dropped his pants. He was standing there in his boxers. I guess he thought he was being funny. I rolled my eyes and began to walk back to the door to go inside. He immediately pulls up his pants and walks up to me. He grabs me by the wrists and pinned me up against the wall. He held on tightly. I told him to leave me alone and to let go of me multiple times. He then looks me dead in the eyes and says that he could have me right then and there if he really wanted to. I was so freaked out that I pushed him off and ran inside. He was then escorted to leave by one of his friends that watched it go down. I am convinced that I should press charges, but I am afraid that he will retaliate because his wife is 7 months pregnant and she might leave him over something like this. I know that I can get a restraining order as well, but that doesn’t change the fact that I am terrified of this man. I am so freaked out. Any advise you may have would be greatly appreciated.

46,"I hope I chose the right subreddit because I need a non - biased third opinion. 

So a little background: 

I am F(19) I have a boyfriend M(21). We are in a loving three-year-long relationship (year and a half long distance). I come from a religious family. Growing up, my mother would dump information about their failing marriage on me (including cheating details). As a result, I never had a relationship with my father. Which as you can imagine, do not help. I have two siblings B M (17) and  L F(11).  I went to high school in a different city (around two hours away by train) and lived in a dorm there for four years, so I became self-sufficient. Now I'm on my first year of college away from my family. As I grew up and proceeded to be more independent, my parents stopped supporting me and taking care of me. I get some alimony from my dad, but that's it. I worked for every high school need. I have been working for the past two summers for my boyfriend's parents and basically living with them for those months.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we come to the problem:

I moved to the capital three months ago, the first time in a big city on my own. When it was the time to start thinking about moving and colleges, I  knew that I wouldn't stay at home. My boyfriend has lived in this city for two years already. He has an apartment.  When we started talking about places I wanted to stay I was very adamant that I don't want to live with him for at least a year so that I can get more independent and grow up on my own.  

My country provides students with dorm options but, as you are a student, there isn't anyone that keeps the tabs on you (like it was in my high school dorm). That means there's a lot of shit going down. Now being corona time there is much improvement.

Finally, the option I prefer the most, an apartment of my own that I could rent.  As rent is pricy, I agreed with my roommate from high school that we will live together for the first year. That roommate was, at the time, my best friend so, I put my trust into her. We were 19 and 18, fresh out of high school and on our own looking for apartments. We had no sense of expensive or what is a good deal in terms of real estate. I was pretty much self-funded from working summer jobs. In the end, after the whole tour of the apartments, me putting down the entire deposit on this beautiful apartment. She calls me that her parents are against it and I'm left to fend on my own three weeks before my college starts. I had to figure my life out after an enormous humiliation. A week after I found this cute but a but pricey apartment for one. I think I did the best I could. My mom thinks I did a stupid thing. We have a massive fight. She wanted me to apply to a dorm, but when my friend made her call the application date already passed. 

Now I have been living in this apartment for three months, and I ran into a big problem. I don't have enough money to keep paying for it because the ""cheap bill for utilities"" turned out to be more and more expensive as the month's pass. The condition of the apartment is starting to deteriorate. My landlord bought me a mouldy washing machine, the place began to mould along the walls, and I can never heat the apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

I have three options now:

Firstly, I could start working, but that takes time from my time to study (I'm a law student btw) and in the time of corona, there isn't much that I can do. 

Secondly, I can move back home, which I do not want to. I would not have a friendly study environment. 

Thirdly, my boyfriend offered me a place in his apartment. That was on the table from the beginning, and his parents didn't understand why I didn't do it right away. The apartment isn't that spacious. When they heard I could move in they went and bought some things that would be missing for me (chair, desk, etc.). They did all that with good intentions because they have been taking care of me for the past three years. They even bought everything I didn't have in my new apartment because my mom gave me nothing. 

So, being a good daughter, I tell my mother I plan to MAYBE move into my boyfriend's place. The first time I told her all this one the phone, she was pretty civil and didn't take it that bad. Ofc in four hours, her story changed. She started her shitting parade. She came to the city I now live in to get a pricey esthetic operation, and on the last day of her stay, at my place, she finally decided to talk with me. She made a whole show crying, guilty tripping with my duty as a big sister and influence on her. Saying it's against God's wishes, that it will throw me into a will pull of sins and how all this with my boyfriend won't work out. 

There is a lot she said, but the main thing is that she won't give me her blessing. She basically told me that she turned the whole family against me. She even went as far as to say that my decision was influenced by other people and my boyfriend's family. Mind you my boyfriend, has been so supportive. He wanted to be out of my decision and give me passive commentary. Now I have some concerns, other than my family, about moving in with him. I don't know if we are too young, etc.  

Since my mom decided to give me lectures and guilt trip me when she has money for expensive operations but not to help me. She won't stop spamming me with apartment ""deals"" and comments about the dorm (she is convinced that I can show up in the middle of the year) and is even considering my ex-best friend.

48,"So my husband makes a yearly salary of about 71k. He’s been supporting the two of us while I’m in school full time. Our apartment is about 1100 a month, and with other expenses like our car payment, groceries, and the cell phone bill, we basically break even every month.

He had been pressuring me to get a job for a long time, and I finally got one at Pizza Hut. However, I found I really didn’t like it and the hours were inconvenient for us to spend time together, since he works a regular full time job.

49,"Professor didn’t inform me of third participant in meeting I thought was private where I was discussing disability struggles and family crisis

I have a professor this year that seems to do a lot of assuming. I have another class where I knew I had been mis-graded on an exam. I didn’t realize my mic was on in a zoom class and was complaining about that situation. Professor in question was convinced I was talking about his class/TA. Weirdness ensues. Eventually have a meeting with professor in question to go over a test I took with him. I was sure I’d done much better, but I wasn’t there to argue. Just seek clarification. It got really weird. 

1-he started with all these claims that he “knows” students are cheating, he has the technology, yadda yadda. I have not cheated, so I know he has nothing on me. Furthermore, I’ve seen no sign of cheating in the chat app where students usually go. I shrugged and offered a dismissive, “well, it happens.”

2-multiple other inappropriate things, but trying to be concise. 

3-discussed my disability.

4-he asks “do you mind if I ask you a question?” The question was, “who do I work with in class?”To be clear, we’re allowed and encouraged to work together on assignments. To this I answered: “anyone that wants to work with me.” This seemed to make him angry. 

5-intimated toward a family crisis, to which he made a snide comment. The family crisis that I didn’t discuss was that I had just found out that my cousin’s young daughter had accidentally killed herself. 

6-near the end, I realized there was a third participant in the meeting that I wasn’t informed of.

51,"This might sound like a weird question to get advice on, but here is the story behind it. When I was 12 years old, my family moved from a tiny rural village in country A to be a big city in country B. One of the issues from moving countries was that I did not know the language of the country I was emigrating to. As an already shy kid who did not speak the native language, I had an incredibly hard time meeting people, which is when I decided to meet people online. Although I did meet people online, I also met many adult males who were extremely horny and lonely. To fill my void of loneliness I decided to engage with these older males. 

Because I was from a tiny rural village with little to no connection to the outside world (No wifi or TV), I never knew that pedophilia and rape were bad. Not to go too much into the details of what happened, but essentially between the ages of 12 and 18 or so, I was repeatedly engaging with much older men where it often led to rape and other unwanted sexual stuff. The reason why I continued to go along with it was mostly because I felt lonely and that it was very easy and accessible for me to get attention from these older men. It was never because I had sexual attraction towards them. 

Now I am 23 years old and I still find myself occasionally talking to much older men. But this time it is still not out of sexual arousal or loneliness. Its become a bad habit of mine and almost an addiction if you will. I have only ever been attracted to women. YET, I find myself talking to much older men while masturbating with them to this day even though I have plenty of great friends, family members and can talk the native language fluently. 

As stated before, I am now seeing a psychologist. I get along really well with him. He is very emotionally intelligent and has definitely helped me clear things up. The issue is that I am having a difficult time telling him that I am not bisexual despite the fact that I am still engaging with men sexually now while masturbating. How do I make it clear to him that I am not bisexual or gay and that the reason why I am still doing it now is out of a bad habit that I have been doing for almost a decade?  

I am not sure if this makes total sense, but I will try and clarify whatever I can",22Nov2020,1
52," There's something seriously wrong with him... I know that my dad has never been nice to him, and that being a dark-skin black guy must be hard, but there's something wrong with my brother. I don't see how he turned out like this. He brought cocaine into our house, and my parents still let him stay to be nice so long as he doesn't do it or bring it again after his mental breakdown last year wherein he left cum around the house and started throwing our stuff away. He poured salt on the floor and my mom cleaned it up for him, although I suspect that he did it intentionally in retaliation for them not letting him do the cocaine. I know that he's mentally ill, but he's never been diagnosed with anything other than depression, autism maybe, and psychosis... why did he threaten to hit my mom today? How could he be nearing 21-years old with no job, no college plans? He traumatized me last year, I remember him doing things to my mother. I'm in high school and no one understands. I want to believe that he's still the young boy I remember but he's a 21-year old man who lives at home and is making my mother, my hard-working mother, suffer. I can't turn out like him. I have to go off to a good school, I need to. I need to take care of my parents when they're older, they've taken care of us - they haven't been perfect but they've taken care of us and they don't deserve this. That's all.",22Nov2020,1
53,So I write and create music. I have made and recorded three songs in the past month that I feel are my best work. Even though I just started not too long ago. I haven't made anything I liked within the last song I did and it was even liked that before I did that one. I'm actually so torn and messed up by this that I feel depressed. Suicidal even. I struggle with things like that and with my decline of the things I love and the matter that I still don't know who I am and that this is the only career thing I have going for me. I'm so close to wanting to shut down. Even when I occupied myself. That still did not help improve my depressive state.,22Nov2020,1
54,"My GF and I had a fight the other night, and it feels like an accumulation of stress that's manifested in this one, relatively small thing.

We've been happily together for 4.5 years, and we moved in together about 1.5/2 years ago. We were both hired out of university and had a lovely home in our university city. She's a software developer so she was able to work from home during the pandemic.

A few months ago I received a job offer in my hometown (which is quite rural) and across the country from where we were currently living, somewhere my GF wasn't willing to relocate to. I knew she didn't really want me to take the job, because it meant doing long distance for 1 year +. I also knew she wouldn't outwardly tell me to turn it down because she isn't that kind of girl/wouldn't feel comfortable telling me what to do/give me ultimatums, but she definitely told me how she felt about it personally.

She made it quite clear she wouldn't be happy moving across the country, leaving her family, friends, home, and potentiall her job. Long term neither of us would have great job mobility there, but I figured we'd be able to manage for a year or so. It was a very nice opportunity for me and I really wanted this job. I didn't love the idea of long distance, but felt I could do it. I tried to sell her on the idea because I wanted us to move together, but she knew she'd have a very hard time building a new life there (and she was right, it would have been incredibly hard and isolating for her). She was a city girl and I was asking her to move to a relatively rural/isolated city. She told me she'd feel differently if we were engaged, but I didn't feel ready to make that step. I do want to marry her one day.

She made it clear she didn't want a LDR, because in the past those hadn't been fulfilling for her and that they've often been very emotionally taxing, but that she would be willing to try for me because of how much she values this relationship and sees its long term potential. We've had bouts of long distance before, but this was different. I didn't have an end date in mind. I think she was worried about the transition.

She told me if I really wanted it, she wouldn't get in the way.

I accept the job and moved back home. To save some money (and not be totally lonely) I moved back in with my parents. Since I'd gotten the call and only had about a week to decide on the offer, I left in a really big hurry.

About two months into the LDR things get hard. She moves back in with her family who live a few miles away from where we were, because they've unfortunately hit a very rough patch (relatives get sick and pass away), and she herself starts suffering from (non-COVID related) illness. She keeps asking me to fly in for a weekend to see her while she's home recovering/grieving. There are no direct flights, and it's a full day's of travel, so it's incredibly hard for me to come. It would also be difficult given my job/ working remotely and doing quarantine.

We've been doing LDR for about 5 months now. She's been very unhappy about it. We've only seen each once when she flew in after the 3 month mark. We usually text a little bit during the day depending on our availabilities, then we usually call before bed.

My GF is feeling more and more uneasy and unhappy about being in a LDR. She tells me how it feels like we lead two different lives - a virtual one and a real one, and that she feels like she's can't fully invest herself in her new life because I'm there in spirit but never actually there. She keeps insisting it just makes her anxious and is distracting her from her other relationships/work/family.

I often think back and regret taking this job, I know it's been very difficult for her.

Friday nights are a special holiday in our religion/culture, and it's all about spending time with family/those we love. We have this ritual of, whenever we aren't together/living apart, to always always call or facetime so we can ""celebrate"" together, even just to wish each other a nice night for a little bit.This was one of the things we bonded over with when we first started going out, it's hard to describe but it feels essential to our relationship. It was our first 'tradition' as a couple, and we've always spent Friday nights together celebrating when we have been in the same city/living together.

For reference, my GF would be more upset if I missed friday night calls than if I forgot our anniversary, it really is that important.

Last friday night, after she'd prepared food for her family/had dinner etc, she texts me to see if I'm free to talk at any point, and says she should be free for the next few hours (there's a time difference between us). I tell her I'm busy helping preparing dinner, so that later would be better. She says no problem. By the time it's 10 her time, she texts me to say she's probably going to go to bed soon if I wanted to call quickly. I tell her I'd be busy with my family for another while, that I'd call her at 11:30. She she stays up till then, I'm still busy and can't text her because I'm with my family. She doesn't hear from me and falls asleep pretty late staying up waiting for my call.

The next morning she tells me she's really quite upset I didn't take even 5 mins to call her all day, especially since she feels like she's often the one reaching out.

The reason I was so busy was because my mother had just submitted her last article to her editor and wanted my brothers, father and I to prepare and host a full dinner for her, do pre-dinner drinks, prepare speeches in her honor, (all in all it was a full 4 hour ordeal). My mom really wanted that night to be all about her, so I don't know if she would have been understanding if I stepped out, I don't think she'd have been ok with it.

I know the LDR has been hard on my GF, and I also really wanted to talk to her, but I figured I'd just call her at 1/2 am instead of 11:30 pm because sometimes she stays up late reading.

I told her this evening meant a lot to my mother, that realistically she (my GF) would want to stay on the phone for more than 5 mins because we hadn't talked all day and had both had busy weeks, and that it didn't matter if I called her a couple of hours later than I'd said because sometimes she stayed up really late and I figured I could still get a hold of her then.

She got really mad and said I was disrespecting her time, that just because she could have been free doesn't mean I should expect her to always be free. She figures my mother would be understanding if I excused myself from dinner for a couple of minutes.

My GF is incredibly observant and reads people like a book, but on the flip side this sometime causes her to be quite sensitive. In the past, she's been hurt when my mom says passive aggressive/condescending things to her/in front of her. My mom doesn't usually mean ill, but she doesn't have a filter so if she's mad at you, she'll let you know. She's very short tempered/blunt and is very particular if things aren't done to her liking.

My mother was a homemaker for most of her adult life, and recently got into writing. My GF just feels generall uneasy when she's with my mother, even though they've known each other for years.

Once, while we were all staying in the mountains, my mother yelled at my GF for using the shared open space to work/study and kicked her out because she wanted the space to herself alone for yoga. This really scared my GF who didn't understand why yoga was such a big deal (and why someone who did yoga couldn't control her anger at a 20 year old student).

I know my mom can be unreasonable/selfish at times. I can't say anything to her because she's my mother.

I also was going to be away that weekend (the weekend after that friday night) on a ski trip with my family (and thus out of service), and I didn't tell my GF in advance because it was super last minute. So I basically didn't talk to her all weekend, and now she's been super distant all week.

I don't know what to say to her, she seems really hurt. I know I misspoke and hurt her feelings. Any advice?",22Nov2020,1

58,"My friend is 22 and lives with her family for now (saving up to move out) and her mother legit treats her like she’s 12. She puts her nose in all her business, looks through her phone, stuff and listens to all our conversations. Today, she was gonna go on a date with some guy but it had to be cancelled because the mother heard the conversation and demanded that it needs to be stopped. Her curfew is always 5pm because her mother won’t stop worrying about her adult daughter and demands her home that early. Also when we’re hanging out, her mother keeps calling non stop asking when she’s going home. Her mom also looks through her Facebook friends and questions every guy that she’s friends with on Facebook while teary eyed. She’s not even allowed to go to the park. She’s 22... a fully grown adult. The mom also always manipulates the situation by crying when she doesn’t get her way. My friend is afraid that if she rebels, she’ll get kicked out however, she doesn’t want to be constantly controlled by her mother especially at 22.

59,"A and I have been friends since we were in 7th grade. We did to have much in common, but I believe that is why we were so close. After high school, he offered me a job to work at a daycare with him. I decided to take it because I was looking around to get experience with kids anyways, since my major is child development, and because I thought it would be pretty fun to be working with one of my closest friends. 

Due to the pandemic, I had fallen into a deep depression but this summer working with him was probably the most fun I've had. We had an understanding for each other. I mean, we've always have. 

My relationship with my boyfriend of four years started to fall when he just wanted to drink and hag out with friends selfishly during this time. A saw that and kept reminding me why I needed to end it. So when my confidence and standards were up, Thats what I did. But looking back at it now,  I think it was a way for him to manipulate me into being available, because I did not do it on my own time. He would do things like hug me infant of the kids during work, and I did not like it because I didn't think it was professional. He would get upset because he thought it was nothing wrong... We would go out to eat and he would play love songs and I'd tell him to turn it down because I felt kinda weirded out by that. I understood that he was just trying his best to show me what I should've deserved, but I just got out of a relationship and was still trying to understand if that was what I wanted because of course, it was still fresh out and I still was in love with my ex. 

Three months had past by and A was still trying, but I kept telling him that were better off as friends and that I wasn't ready to be in another relationship.. He had told me before that no matter what, we would always be friends, he would always be there for me, and he would always help me in my time of need. We got into an argument because I told him once again that I wasn't ready, that I needed therapy because the situation was bringing me great stress over my mental and physical health.. It felt like a lot for me... I did not want him out of my life, I missed how our friendship used to be but I never intended to hurt him the way I did. He unfollowed me on all social medias, and completely ignores me at work. He talks behind my back to our co-workers and now a few of my co-workers don't talk to me. 

For a while, I felt all alone. I was thinking that this was all my fault, that I deserved this but it took me a while to accept what has been done, that he wants nothing to do with my friendship. But I still miss the good times. I still wish we could be good friends again and I miss hearing your voice and playing 'among us' and talking about life and the future with you.

This was a lot, I just wanted to get all of this out because I've been holding no to this for so long now.",22Nov2020,1

65,"Hi. Idk if this is the right sub to ask this in but I’m gonna go ahead anyway. So here’s a little back story. So my best friend of 8 years left for college back in august. Now during all of quarantine, basically March-august we didn’t see each other. Not once. I tried to FaceTime her and talk to her but she became really distant. It was one of those situations where if I didn’t text her first I wouldn’t get a text from her for days. Anyways before she left for college we hung out once and it was fine but I think quarantine definitely harmed her mental health. She is a very closed off person and keeps her emotions to herself and hates emotionally connections. Anyways fast forward to now she is coming home for break and told me that we couldn’t hang out cuz the covid number where high in our county. I completely understand her worry about Covid. But I myself barley go out. I am taking a gap year and have no job so I just chill at home. She doesn’t even want to do a social distanced activity. My issues is that she never talks to me, takes days for her to respond. If I stoped talking to her she probably wouldn’t text me first for a good week. I don’t think she’s purposefully ignoring me. But I’ve asked her many times if she could try a little harder to talk to me and she says she will but she never pulls through. I don’t know what to do anymore. Do I stop being friends with her? She isn’t putting any effort into our friendship and it’s really hurting my feelings. Even when I tell her that she gets all cagey and closed off. Why would I want to be friends with someone who doesn’t put any effort into seeing me or talking to me. 
Anyways if anyone has any suggestions let me know!",22Nov2020,1
67,"When you look at the world gender ratios, clearly there are a lot more men than women in the world. Why would anyone think that there is someone for everyone when the facts just don't support that conclusion?

I'm sick and tired of my family and friends all telling me I'll find someone when clearly, no one has ever liked me in the past. I've been ugly for most of my life and started looking good a few months before this whole pandemic hit. 

I try to be thankful that I look good but at the same time, I don't have girls telling me like me. I only have a few gay friends that like me. It's like natural selection is clearly going against me because I can't get what I want. 

Sometimes I wonder if the people who orchestrated the whole pandemic made it to where only a select few can have success in dating and everyone else can't. Datings apps are a no-no for me because I haven't had much experience with texting people because I didn't have friends growing up and my parents would always find ways to ruin my friendships. 

And don't worry, I do my best to ensure that my friends don't meet my parents because my parents are very weird, they lack social skills, and they just suck at being parents in general. At least I can go to them if ever I need a kidney.

I just wish that I have friends. I wish I can girls crushing on me. I wish I didn't have people in my life having their sole mission to be ruining my dating life.

69,"i (22F) met my friend (26M) at a seasonal job a few months ago. we became really close friends really quickly and it also became apparent REALLY quickly that he’s absolutely HORRIBLE at managing his money. he would blow his paychecks almost immediately. he would constantly ask me and our other friends to buy him meals or groceries and he’d always say that he would pay us back “soon”. then, he would get paid again, buy us all like one meal, then blow the rest of it on things for himself. the only thing he ever paid me back for was $50 and it was about a month and a half after he had promised to pay me for it. he definitely owes me WELL over $150 worth of stuff.

a few days ago he asked me to send him $40 for some medication he needed and told me he’d pay me back the next day and i’m a dumbass and believed him since he has a job at home and i HOPED he would follow through. typing this all out now makes me realize how stupid that was, since he still has not paid me back for it at all.

besides the money thing, i really love him as a person, our friendship is literally perfect otherwise but this shit is seriously so annoying and stressful. i’m not tight on money myself right now but that still doesn’t make it okay. but i’m also a very shy, awkward person and i don’t know how to put my foot down and be like, “until you pay me back for everything i’m not giving you a single dollar” politely and without feeling bad. but i realize i’m being taken advantage of and i’m SO tired of it. any advice on what i could do here?",22Nov2020,1

71,"DISCLAIMER: This is not a mean, ranty, crazy person text. Just the end of a conversation basically. I wouldn't normally send a text like this but I thought about the situation more and realized it didn't make much sense.


I started a new job at a small bar(a new business) a month ago. I was let go this morning. Via text message. 
So professional. 

What happened : one of the nights I accidentally left the back door propped open a few inches, as the heating was malfunctioning and stuck on hot. I forgot about it. But nothing happened. Told her the second I realized.
Second was a group of ladies left without paying (totalled less than 10 bucks) shortly before this occurred I went to the restaurant next door to order some take away, which she knew, as I asked permission and let her know I was leaving and to mind the door. On my way back I saw the ladies get into their cars. I assumed she'd rung them thru. But no. I offered to pay the cost. 

The owner is a nice person, and I honestly think it just didn't work out, like we didn't mesh. And that's fine. What's not fine is blaming me for small things and making that the reason rather than just telling me the truth. Like ""dude you're weird, it's not gonna work out"" I'd be like Alright, thanks anyways, have a good one. 

I am a person who tells it like it is. If this is crazy and you guys need to tell ME how it is please do. I'm just annoyed and felt she needed to know. Send Y/N?
 Here's the message:

Hi, ok so, sorry but I was thinking about what you said about why you sacked me..there's something amiss here.
1. The 5 ladies that walked out on their bill - shortly before that occured I went to (restaurant) after asking you then let you know I was leaving the building. The workshop upstairs was still going, and I checked upstairs before I left.(it was not apparent anyone was going to leave) I think I was gone all of 5-6 minutes. (those ladies all left quickly, at the same time about 45mins earlier than everyone else. Neither you or I expected them to leave early) When I came back they were already in the parking lot. I assumed you'd taken payment as they were outside, as you knew I wasn't there. So how the heck is it my fault they walked out if you were covering the door? Really?
And I offered to pay for the cost, and forefitted what little tips there were that night.

2. The door was indeed an honest mistake, but nothing bad did happen, and I told you about it the moment I realized. And you can bet I was never going to even open that door again as a result.
I didn't try to lie or not tell you. So I'm sorry, saying I do not take responsibility is quite frankly bullshit. The learning and listening bit, well that's no surprise as I have ADD and a severe learning disability, learning and school was a great challenge for me. Thank-you for letting me know, really. I will work harder on my mental discipline.

I'm sorry you feel this way. People make mistakes, I am surprised you'd sack someone over so little. Over 8 dollars and a door left open by accident but of no consequence. 
I'm sorry if this seems unprofessional but so is sacking someone via text message. 
This isn't intended to be a rant, just some feedback. It is your business and %100 your decision how you run it. 
You've got something unique in that place and I hope you get through this covid bs.
All the best and good luck out there",22Nov2020,1

73,"Long story here but I'll try and be as brief as possible.

I had a good friend (21F) for about a year before I met my girlfriend. At one point during my friendship with said friend, I kinda developed very brief feelings for her, but when I found out that she had a long-distance BF, I dropped it. We remained friends although during our second year of college drifted apart a little. That's when I met my current GF.

Things were amazing between us for over a year and a half until I chose to spend a semester of college abroad. I had my heart set on the program nearly a year before and there was never any doubt I wanted to go, and my GF, though upset, never wanted to stand in my way. About a month before I went, my GF found out that my old friend was going to the same city and program as me for her own semester abroad. I had no idea until this point. I had openly admitted to my GF before that I had brief feelings for this girl once, a long time ago, but I hadn't long before I met her. Still, and despite the fact I had shown no signs of disloyalty etc. to this point, she was really worried about us going to the same place. I told her I'd likely not see my friend there, and that did reassure her. I had no plans to at that point.

You can kind of fill in the gaps here. I ended up bumping into my old friend quickly once I was gone, and it felt nice to have an old friend in a new country. We reconnected and became part of a small friend group with one of her friends, and one of mine. I did see this old friend abroad, perhaps 2-3 times a week, although always with the other friends. At no point did I have feelings for her, want to be disloyal to my now long-distance GF, etc. My old friend was now single, but she showed no interest in me in that way either. My GF knew this old friend fairly well from college, and I always told her when I saw my old friend.

I never once considered being disloyal to my GF, but I couldn't always meet her demands to talk on the phone. I had to wake up early for class, there was a fair time difference, and I really wanted to make new friends and experience a new country during my short time there. This began to upset my GF because she saw any time I spent with my friends (inc. my old friend) as ""time being taken away from her."" This friction over the old friend only grew, even though I tried to be very transparent about our friendship. I reshared a video of me and a few friends dancing on a train from her social media one night, and my GF blew up. I kept a Snap streak with her (and other friends, btw) and my GF hated it. I liked her insta pictures, and she hated it, called me a stalker. When my GF came to visit and we bumped into my old friend in the city and she made a joke to me, my GF told me that she felt that my old friend did it intentionally to upset her, that she hated her and wanted to break us apart. Long story short, this spiraled until I basically had to cut off my old friend to keep my GF happy (or with me). She never asked me to do this directly, but has later said that if I hadn't she probably would have left me.

So I cut off my old friend cold turkey. I ignored her in the last days of our program abroad, ignored innocent messages asking me when I was leaving etc, blocked her on all socials, and it was super awkward. This kind of alienated the rest of my friend group, although I have luckily kept them as friends. One of them was a girl, who my GF also didn't seem to like, but never to the same extent (and she also had a BF of her own). My GF and I remained long-distance during Covid, and I kind of moved on from losing my friend. We argued consistently about ""my behavior"" abroad and various other things, but made it through long-distance back to college together.

Of course, my old friend goes to our college too, so my GF was constantly paranoid about me seeing her around, to the extent where she even demanded I report to her anytime I saw her in passing, or asked me not to go out once in case I saw her around. When I did see my old friend around I did as my GF asked, but seeing her in person brought back a lot of the feelings I subconsciously repressed all summer. I felt really guilty about the way I had treated a friend who did nothing wrong, who I had blocked for seemingly no reason and treated her awfully abroad. For a whole host of reasons, I left my GF, and while we apart I unblocked my old friend and messaged her, apologizing and asking if we could be friends again. She ghosted me, which I expected and understood, but it hurt a lot. I ended up back with my GF a while later and she found the messages I sent to my old friend (after going through my phone ""to see if I had been talking to girls after I left her"") and flipped. How could I be sorry to this girl who tore our relationship apart? Why didn't I hate her when this was all her fault?

I'm in a rough spot figuring out if this once-perfect GF of mine is the best person for me anymore. I had to start seeing a counselor about the way our relationship developed over the summer, but I care about her deeply. And now I keep seeing my old friend around, and I can't get over how bad I feel about the way I treated her. I miss being friends with her and it hurts that she won't even look at me because of the way that I treated her. I never tried to follow up because it would hurt my GF (and I got the message the first time she ghosted me) but now we're about to leave for the holidays and I can't escape the desire to talk to my old friend and explain why I acted the way that I did. I know it's just going to trouble me for weeks if I don't. I'm still with my GF and she has been working hard to move past what happened, as have I, but it seems doomed and I'm miserable.

I'm scared to even ask my counselor or a friend because I'm worried that they'll think I have re-developed feelings for my old friend, so Reddit, please: is trying to talk to my old friend one last time wise, and is this in any way a normal relationship dynamic?

TLDR: I abruptly cut off an old friend for my GF and now I feel awful about it: should I reach out and try and explain to her why I did it?",22Nov2020,1

I have Tourette's Syndrome, and I'm already extremely nervous about the date, because my tics have been getting worse lately, and tend to act up when I'm anxious.

I don't know if I should tell her beforehand. I'm able to suppress my tics to a certain degree so that they're not entirely noticable, but there's a good chance that I won't be able to suppress all of them. There's also a possibilty that she already knows (from maybe seeing it on social media). Assuming she doesn't know however, I'm worried that she might change her mind about me if I tell her. She seems super sweet and kind, so part of me thinks that she won't care, but another part of me is worried that I'm just completely wrong about her.

I keep checking up on his social media because I can’t get him out of my head. I’m sure that doesn’t help, but you know... 

What hurts a lot is seeing how he’s changed and knowing that I wasn’t around for it. He actually used to be a “they” and used a gender-neutral name, but now he uses “he” and a very masculine name. My heart just really hurts knowing that I wasn’t around for any of that. I’m also a trans man, and it sucks knowing that we never had time to bond over him being a trans man, too...

Why the time stopped so unfairly for me ?",22Nov2020,1
82,"I'm 24, male, college student. 

Although I'm single, my closest group of friends right now are two couples, both of which have been together for 2.5-3 years each (which is quite bad on its own sometimes to be fair) and there are two guys on the periphery who also seem pretty cool people but I don't feel the motivation to ask them for their numbers and develop those friendships as of now.

Let's call one of the girls on these couples Annie, who's 21 right now. Now, I've known Annie for 3 years now, and we always had a pretty cool friendship. We were part of the same class, but she failed, got into another class, and I moved on. However, I still have 2 classes behind, and I'm taking them alongside Annie and her class. 

I've always taken my friendship with Annie as being a pretty cool friendship. She's a fun, sociable gal who gets along with pretty much everyone. Although we didn't talk daily or very much, every time we talked or hang out it would we would have a pretty cool time. I semi-got along with her best friend (former roommate but she has since moved out) and I get along with her boyfriend. I also get along with most of her (female) friends in her class, at least until last week (I'll get there).

However, several things have happened that started making me feel... left out, to say the least. Although we now hang out almost daily because we've been going to classes together, leaving together, and going for coffee or dinner after for 2 months now, there was this instance where a friend of hers got into isolation because Covid, and she was adviced to get into isolation too... and I was the last one to be warned. I mean, she literally forgot about me. I had to call the other couple we both get along with asking if they wanted to hang out, and they had to be the ones going ""Wait... you want to hang out? Annie didn't talk to you, did she?"". Only after they talked to her did she finally warn me through text, and on a pretty condescending manner too (""sorry for anything ahah xD""), despite the fact that I might have infected my parents and other people by this point. Fortunately, nothing came out of this.

From then on things spiraled downward. The next thing I noticed was she just not wanting to talk about things that interest me. Maybe she was always like this and I didn't notice it because I never hang out with her by herself as much I'm hanging out now. But whenever I talk about any of my extracurricular hobbies (learning photography, programming, creative writing), she immediately shuts everything down as a ""waste of time"" and asks me no questions and shows no interest whatsoever. Even if I'm speaking with one of our mutual friends over this without even talking to her, she'll jump into the conversation and go ""Please don't encourage him"". WTF.

There's this also guy in our class, let's call him James. James is not very popular in the class. He talks to everyone and everyone talks to him, but he mostly sits alone or with a small group during breaks. He was a romantic interest of Annie's former roommate and Annie always tried to get them together (kind of succeeding before her roommate moved out). She gets along with him a lot and is quite proud of that fact. For example I remember one time she proudly telling our mutual friends in that class that she was so bored in the last two classes she spent those 4+ hours texting him, which Imma be frank got me slightly jealous (on a platonic way, nothing romantic, I just feel inferior and uninteresting) because she replied to my texts in a boring way and ignored the last of them.

And last week might have been the straw that broke the camel's back. This guy James picked a fight with a teacher for the 6th time that week. Teacher got mad at him after trying to explain why he was wrong, he didn't listen, stopped talking altogether, and when the teacher proved him to be wrong he just shut up without apologizing. This is a reocurring thing. So I confronted this guy outisde of class and called him childish arrogant and we almost got into a physical fight after he insulted me and I insulted him back.

Even though it had nothing to do with her, Annie immediately took his side on that discussion, telling me that the teacher said he was right (untrue), that the teacher deserved it (irrelevant even if true in my opinion) and that he never said the teacher was wrong (untrue) and then ignoring me and telling me to shut up when I proved otherwise. She also said that she felt sorry James sat alone after that class and couldn't sit with her and her friends because of our fight. Ever since that day, hanging out with her is a nightmare. She's constantly picking fights with me now, no matter what I say she will attack me for it repeatedly, starting a conversation with her is almost always futile and won't get very far.

What do I do? Part of me wants to end this friendship but it's kind of afraid because she's the only connection I have in that class (+ the two of us are doing a group project) and I'm afraid to get isolated from the rest. Another part is feeling jealous and inferior because of the whole situation around James. There's also the issue of what will happen with this friend group as a whole if this continues. Any ideas would be appreciated.",22Nov2020,1

100," Within the past month two of my closest friends of about 5 years have made rant posts about how they’re doing ‘so awful’ right now and they miss summer of last year.

For context summer of last year is when I got incredibly sick and was in bed for about a month. When I recovered I found out they made an entire new group of friends. These were some pretty cool people but I didn’t fit into it and that was okay. There were a couple shitty people in the mix, would cheat on their partners with eachother, treat other people horribly and encourage everyone to develop a nicotine addiction. 

During this time my friends would still see me about once a week and spend the entire time talking about these new people. What bothered me most was how my friends thought they were the coolest people on planet fucking earth for hanging out with people who vape. 

Eventually this group separated and they started mainly hanging out with me again. They wouldn’t fucking stop whining about how great those days were and they miss being ‘wild reckless badasses’. Recently cause the world is fucking closed down we’ve just been hanging out in my basement playing games. All together what I would consider solid for pandemic hang outs. 

The more recent of the two posts implying they despise the parts of their life with me in it said “fuck I miss summer of last year. I miss the people. I miss the adventures. I hate hanging out in basements and feeling dead inside. I hate my new classes and pressure. I hate how energetic around some people I am, but that’s just who I am and I’m not ashamed for it. I just miss my old life.” 
The ‘life’ he’s talking about lasted 4 months max.  For even more context the classes he hates is the only class he’s had with me in two years. And I jokingly asked him to shut up when he starts barking and screaming when we watch movies. But apparently that’s a lot to ask.

I just really don’t know how to respond to any of this. 
It’s clear I’m not meant to since they’re actually going to come game with me in about an hour. I just hate that they silently shit on my friendship then expect me to always be there anyways. I really don’t know how to confront this or if I should.",22Nov2020,1
101,"I was dating this guy for about two months at the end of the summer. I trusted him, but he was a a few years older than me and terrible at communication so I thought it was best I cut things off, so I did. When I did, it ended on very respectful terms and we agreed to be friends. At this juncture he asked to borrow $200 and I didn’t think anything of it because it was a good reason and admittedly kinda felt guilty not to. I tried to send it through PayPal, but they placed a ten day waiting period on the money and he needed it immediately, so I tried again. It still didn’t work, so I tried on Venmo a last time with the agreement that he’d give me back the $500 when it cleared and the rest of the money in a week. In retrospect I take full accountability for making a series of stupid decisions but I really did trust this dude not to screw me over. However I should not have expected anything less from a man and following that he ghosted next for like three weeks, so naturally I assumed that he wasn’t planning to pay me back. When he decide he actually did want me in his life again I pestered him until he sent back $200 but he was getting pissy about it so I thought it was best to leave it alone for a while. I’ve asked him numerous times over the last few months, no response or unclear response on when and whether he’s gonna pay me back the other $500.

110,"My adult son came out as transgender. This blindsided both me and the rest of our family. Not once did he ever show signs of being anything but ""male"". He wasn't a typical athletic guy, but more of a thoughtful tech nerd. But he was physically strong, athletic with other activities (outdoors type things), into swords, guns, etc., and he's heterosexual (for his biologic sex, so he is attracted to women).

We were all stunned when he came out. I thought I was progressive with LGBT issues, but I cannot bear the thought of my son becoming a woman. I feel like I am losing the son I've bonded with for half my life. His identity was part of me. I'm spiraling into depression like I've never felt before at the thought that the man I knew as my son is going away. The depression is fed by guilt that I can't simply accept his transition. I turn to drinking to numb the pain of depression, which becomes almost physical sometimes. I'm not suicidal, but I feel more and more that I wouldn't care about dying soon (from something like cancer). When I research options for the situation, the only parent support for feelings like mine come from religious websites, which I'm not interested in. I guess true progressives don't feel the loss I'm feeling. Or the other advice I see is to just find ways to accept it. But ""just accept it"" feels like being told to ""just be happy"" to deal with my depression. 

My wife sympathized with my struggle at first, but now she resents me for not dealing with it. She thinks I am disowning my son and doesn’t want to be married to me. My world is falling apart.

114,"So my(22f) mother(40) has kind of a rocky relationship with my grandma(57). This stems from my mothers childhood. She feels that her parents didn't love and support her enough. They lived in Mexico and were really poor during her childhood.

A little background.

My mom was sexually abused when she was around 8 years old. I know very few details about this. So my perspective might be a little biased. 

Basically, it was her older cousin that had been raping her. Not sure exactly how long it went on, but I think it was a few years. Mom says her parents didn't believe her until other cousins started coming forward when she was already 14. By that time, I guess they couldn't really do anything about it.

Sometime during the rapists' adulthood he got into drugs and got depressed really bad and committed suicide. My mom says that my grandpa even helped to pay for his rehab. He contributed money to help his [the rapist's] parents. Idk how involved he really was. This also really affects my mom.

I am not the most empathetic person idk why. Its really hard for me to really understand emotional situations. I mean I can understand WHY someone feels a certain way or why they do something. I just can't understand how the person is actually feeling. Don't know if that makes sense.

So a couple of months ago my family had a small get together for my niece's first birthday party. Everything was going great. At the end of the night when almost everyone left, my aunt, some cousins, and my grandma stayed behind (my mom and little sister too). They were just hanging out and singing karaoke.

One of my cousins (13f) has a really nice singing voice, but she's kind of shy. My sister (13f) and cousin (15f) like to sing just for fun and were laughing and having fun on the microphone.

Apparently my grandma was whispering things to my cousin (with the voice) trying to convince her to sing. Saying things like ""why don't you take the mic and sing? Come on you're so much better than these ""pendejas"" (idiots/assholes). They have nothing on you. Don't let them dim your shine."" She was calling her other granddaughters ""pendejas"". 

Anyway my cousin got uncomfortable and went inside. The other cousin and my sister heard her but decided to just keep singing. My mom overheard her and confronted her about it. She asked ""why do you always have to do that?""

My grandma instantly got defensive and started yelling saying ""what am I doing to you?? Why do you always act like this with me?? What have I ever done to you to deserve the way that you treat me???"" My mom was surprised and asked her to explain what she was talking about.

All of a sudden my grandma starts yelling for my aunt saying ""come! Come look shes attacking me! Come help me shes attacking me!"" My aunt came over confused as hell and asked whats going on. 

My mom was still just sitting down confused too. My grandma was going on a rant about how my mom is always hostile towards her and is always judging her.

 She then blurted out ""what do you have against me??? Is it because you got raped and I didn't do anything about it??"" Then grandma starts going into a rant about how her life was hard too and how her parents forced her to live with grandpa when she got pregnant.

She then goes on to rant about grandpa that its his fault too and that she should also blame him because he didnt do anything and was suggesting that he is also a predator. IN FRONT OF MY YOUNGER COUSINS.

Then grandma starts to calm down. My mom is shooting daggers at her. Doesn't even know what to say. Grandma starts claiming ""you think I didn't try to do anything?? I tried to have a hit put out on him but blah blah"" then she starts trying to hug my mom and kiss her. 

My mom refuses and she instantly becomes the bad guy. My aunt is crying and telling my mom to just hug and forgive her. ""Come on stop being like that. Shes your mom. Wow you're being so dramatic.""

Grandma goes crazy again and starts saying shit like ""forget that you have a mother! I'm never stepping foot in your house again. I hope you're happy now that you have your own home. Just forget I exist to you."" My mom said ok. Grandma said ""you need help you're crazy you need professional help! You need to just get help so you can get over it already!""

So 3 months later. I'm kinda feeling bad for the both of them. Mom obviously because she is very hurt. She loves and respects her mom but obviously has unresolved issues and pent up resentment. She feels rejected and has felt rejected her whole life. It also doesn't help that she has anger issues. She keeps everything bottled up. OH and she's going through a divorce. So she's lonely and doesn't really have anyone to talk to.

My grandma because she's been seriously bitter for the last couple of years. She was an RN in Mexico and wants to be one here, but can't. She doesn't speak that much English. She works as a CNA and doesn't make that much money. And she's been having a lot of health issues. She recently fell at work and hit her head pretty bad. She's been suffering from the consequences of the fall that are pretty much debilitating her. So money issues, health issues, getting old. She also complains a lot and has been really negative so people kinda just don't go over as much as they used to.

Like I said before, I am not the most empathetic person. I tend to view things more from a logical point rather than emotional. At the same time this is affecting me so much. I think about this EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Trying to figure out how to fix this. 

I have little wins so far. I got my grandma to start smoking a CBD vape with very little THC for the severe nausea that shes been having. I also got her drops. She says its been helping. Especially with her insomnia.

My mom is a little more, skeptical, about Marijuana and CBD benefits. So, I my aunt discretely offered her a similar CBD product, but with just a little more THC... for her insomnia and anxiety. She accepted... she wouldn't want me to find out of course. So I don't ask if its working. Fingers crossed!!

I'm trying to plan a day where I could get them together at a place they both like to eat. I'll bring my mom and maybe my aunt brings my grandma. But idk I need perspective!!

So pls I would appreciate any advice or opinions. Even critical ones. I need to see this from an outside perspective in order to understand how screwed this is.

FYI before anyone asks if I've tried talking to them individually, yes and no. My mom yes. Kind of. I'm so weird about emotional stuff and I get uncomfortable when I see her tearing up. I let her talk but I can't seem to empathize with her emotions. I just start to think ""but they're just words. People say shit when they're drunk. Shes not the worst person in the world. I don't understand, if you wanna talk to her, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TALK TO HER??"" In other words, I don't understand why things have to be so complicated D: she says she wants my grandma to look for her, and then she gets all upset when she hangs out with her siblings, she always asks if my grandma asks about her.

I try to explain to her that my grandma likely said that because she is already feeling really guilty. And she got frustrated that literally everyone has to walk on eggshells when being around my mom. She gets offended over the smallest things and starts claiming the whole world against her. So I understand my grandma's point of view. I too get frustrated when I say the wrong thing around my mom because I know she's going to blow up.

I tried to bring it up to my grandma, but she started claiming that my mom kicked her out. I don't feel qualified to talk to her about it because I'm not the most sensitive person. I will start throwing out facts. Not to be harsh but just because I can't help it. If you're wrong you're wrong. You need to know so that you can right it.

Anything helps pls and thank you.",22Nov2020,1

Anyway, I’ve know this girl since middle school. Overtime in our friendship, I had developed serious feelings for her. When I had the courage to ask her out one day, she rejected me but that was completely fine with me. It wasn’t long before I thought I was losing feelings for her.

After a while, we started talking again. We became good friends! Recently, she confessed her feelings that she had for me and I didn’t know how to feel. I think it was good though. I was shaking from it, totally surprised.
I do really want something with her. I really want her to be mine. It’s just I haven’t been able to tell if I’m really in love with her, unhealthily obsessed with her, infatuated with her, or what.

Good morrow residents of reddit,

It has recently come to my attention that a dear friend of mine has a peculiar fascination involving the performance of (sexual) acts upon the carcasses of since departed serpents. He is what you might call ""a snake necrophiliac."" Upon the declaration of his morbid fixation, I was taken aback. I'm one to hold my tongue, but I spoke my mind on the matter and told him that frankly that I thought it was disgusting, what he does, and I had not asked for such insight. He called me, and I quote, ""a bitch-ass fopdoodle of a motherfucker."" My friend and I are now no longer on speaking terms, and it seems that at this point our relationship is irreconcilable. I'm simply at a loss and I just would like to know; is it my fault for our falling out? Was I too judgmental of my friend? Is necrophilia morally reprehensible, or nah?

Sincerely,

Individual\_Paper235

121,"Hi all,

My husband and I are planning to go see his family for Christmas. We have been very careful with all the Covid guidelines, so we idealy wouldn't have to travel.

BUT his dad was diagnosed with late stage cancer about 4 months ago...

The only way for us to travel is flying, since we are going from coast to coast...

Anyway, Im so stressed out to have to travel during the holidays, and I expressed that to my husband to what his response was ""don't come at me with your stressed, Im dealing with a lot, and I cant help you"".

So, i feel like shit, because I have been very suportive of him this whole time, he was also unemployed 4 months ago, so theres that too... And the moment I expressed an ounce of stress he lashed out at me. I honestly don't feel like going...

I should say, when we heard the news about his dads cancer, we droped everything to go see his family and we were there for 2 months. So now he wants to be there the whole month of december. Which again, I understand...

But he doesnt seem to understand that im risking my own health for him and his family! Or he does understand but doesnt give a shit. Again... I understand its hard to deal with his dad's stuff.

Its just been a lot of him taking all my support, but he is giving me none and right now we only have each other.

Recently (like a week ago) I was telling the owner of the company that we need security because the hotel sits in a very ghetto spot, and we do NOT have any form of security besides being able to lock the front doors (which isn’t enough) because I had a co worker get physically attacked and hurt badly during the night shift. Not too long ago about 2 and a half weeks ago a customer came in to get his deposit which I was told NOT to return because he got arrested on property and that was part of the agreement he signed etc etc (not sure about the whole thing) the dude got upset I didn’t return his deposit and proceeds to knock everything on the front desk to the floor, sneeze guards, computers, everything. I decided to text the owner saying we needed security and constantly pressing her, she set up a time for us to “talk” After speaking to the owner I was told that having security was out of budget and that my pregnant hormones can sometimes get in the way of how I should be treating people (putting the blame of a customer physically damaging property is somehow my fault)(???) she also proceeded to throw in that if I felt unsafe here and was moving on to let her know so they could start hiring someone else for my position (which I declined because it wasn’t that big of a deal I just wanted to know where we were on the security front) and after that “talk” with her my hours got cut like 70%, and when I checked the work schedule on our computer I have no hours for the next two weeks, is there any advice you guys can give on why they would do that and if I’m crazy for thinking being pregnant has NOTHING to do with how a customer treats me when I’m simply following orders?

128,"being close friends with a guy (i'm a girl) please help me..

i'm a 15 year old student in secondary school from singapore. at my level, students gets posted to new classes according to their subject combinations. i met this guy earlier this year. we started talking to each other at the beginning of the year (since were new classmates so why not) as time passes, we found common interests and talked a lot more. we became closer and soon became one of my closest friend. we dees (talk in discord voice channel) a lot. since we take the same subject combination, he always help me with my school work especially when it comes to maths and sciences as i was weak and he's really good at it. singapore's education can be very stressful but thanks to him, my math grades for my math tests improved tremendously that i even got full marks for one of the tests even some of the smarter ones didn't (3 marks higher than him heheh) he helped me get through my final exams when i was on the verge of giving up. i may even say that he teaches and explains better than some of our teachers.

whenever a girl and a guy become friends, people tend to assume that they're together. this caused us to interact a lot less or even not at all in school as he didn't want his friends to keep teasing him and it was really awkward since we interact a lot online. we had many late night talks and even stayed up until 3am since we never run out of things to say. after a very long time just last month (in october) before my final exams, we started interacting face to face more. he would come to my seat in class to see what i was doing and even bought a drink for me during recess since we bet a lot haha (i won the bet). however, we made a point to agree that we won't fall in love with each other. both our parents don't allow us to date. moreover, we were of different religion. i'm a muslim and he's a christian. my religion doesn't allow me to have a partner of another religion but i cant seem to stop thinking about him and i caught myself admiring him and just how caring he is and how well we get along.

the thing is i'm not sure whether it's just best friend love or if i actually like him. i asked him if he wanted to hang out a few weeks ago and he said he was busy. despite that, he suggested if we could go during the holidays since it's coming soon. i suggested to go ice skating and he made time for me. the night before, we texted on what to wear and he said he was really anxious and kinda panicking since he hasn't went ice skating for a long time. it was really cute and he went on how he doesn't have much clothes and how he had no fashion sense. he took photos of his comfortable home clothes and it was really cute haha. the next day, he texted that he would be late and tell me all about it when we meet. turns out, he didn't tell his parents that he was going ice skating as he was afraid they wouldn't allow him to. cutting the story short, he lied to his parents and said he was going to the park instead. since he lost his bus card, his dad insisted to drive him there.

upon reaching there, he ran to the nearest station (which is quite a distance), buy a ticket and went to the ice rink to meet me. i guess because he was panicking there were many other things that happened along the way too. in conclusion, he did his very best to come as quickly as possible. since he was late, the ice rink was already fully booked. we ended up exploring the malls nearby and went for a walk outside. i've never felt so comfortable around someone before. and by then it feels like the butterflies in my stomach was gone. it felt like sibling love since we tease each other a lot but i still feel that i'd wanna hug and kiss him at times ahhhh

that was a few weeks ago and now he's always busy. he doesn't text or make time for me anymore. he has a really good leadership position in my school and his CCA (co-curricular activity) which always takes up most of his time even though its the holidays. he's getting more and more responsibilities which made him even more tired. i went on to share wholesome memes with him whenever he has a long day to cheer him up. after a while, he said that he wanted me to stop as it was weirding him out. i guess it was a little too much.

when i text him, he would come online but he won't reply them but he replies to his guy friends and always joke around in our unofficial class group chat. i feel sort of angry although were just friends but i keep overreacting and thinking that he just doesn't have time for me and doesn't want to be my friend anymore. i really don't know what to do. i tried telling him whats on my mind but it ended up sounding like i have a mental illness since he interpreted that i'm getting on my nerves cause i kept thinking that he hates me. he just went to assure me that he doesn't hate me. i tried really hard to avoid texting him for the past few days. he doesn't reply to my texts anymore.. until now. his birthday is in december and i was thinking if i should bring him out to go shopping since he said he's lazy to go out to buy clothes and doesn't have many. but now i don't know if he have time or even wants to hang out with me..

i'm sorry for the huge chunk of texts it took me a long time to type this out and organise my thoughts but TLDR:

1. how do we differentiate between lover and best friend love?
2. how do i tell him that i am kinda attracted to him but i'm not sure about my feelings myself? or do i not say anything? but i feel like it will distract me even more if i let this go on
3. should i ask invite him to hang out again? i'm always the one asking and i don't want to seem desperate.
4. how do i tell my parents that i have this close guy friend without them freaking out? how do i convince my friend to do the same? 
since we're only friends, there's really nothing to hide but his dad is really against girls and it forced him to lie. i don't want us to end up lying to our parents all the time

i don't know what to do anymore.. please help me..",22Nov2020,1
129,"So, my best friend (19F) has strained relationships with both her mother and grandmother, who she used to live with. She lives in an apartment on her own and can barely afford to pay rent and buy food with her unemployment pay. Her mother and grandmother both have Texas EBT cards and her mother has claimed her as a dependent so she apparently can't apply for one herself. Is there any other alternative to food stamps that could help her out? I'm wracking my brain, but nothing's coming to mind except for WIC. Problem is she's not pregnant and doesn't have any children. Her unemployment benefits end on December 26th, so any advice given before then is much appreciated. Thank you in advance for any help.",22Nov2020,1

131,"I’m not sure how to write this out so I’ll try and keep it concise. About 2 years ago now I (M) was long distance dating someone (F) that is a family friend and that I’d sort of known for years because of that. One day we started chatting and hit it off and decided to give it a shot. The long distance is because I was in the military and she in school. The short and sweet of it is that it was wonderful, we meshed really well together in person and through texting and video calling. She made time for me and I for her when I visited home and we’d both drive long distances to see each other. I will go ahead and avail something that might be assumed, which is that we never were intimate, since our time together was short. Anyway, through a combination of me getting orders to Japan and also being an extremely heavy drinker at the time, I made a bad drunken move and removed her from socials one night (there was no arguing or anything, I literally got hammered and did it for some reason), and since then we haven’t spoken. We hadn’t been together long, but it haunts me. To answer the inevitable, I didn’t undo anything because I was too cowardly to have the conversation about why I did it because I feared I’d have to be open about my drinking. I’m back in the States now and I added her back on socials and she accepted. I want to apologize to her and explain myself. I don’t expect forgiveness or anything, I just want to make sure she knows I am sorry and that she did absolutely nothing wrong. I don’t know how to start that conversation though. Any advice? I’ll add details and answer questions if needed.

Edit: I got my drinking under control a few months after getting to Japan and have tried to add her fruitlessly a couple of times, until today. I would try as a way of testing to waters so to speak.",22Nov2020,1
132,"I don't really know where to start the healing process here , my original plan was to say our goodbyes and never see each other again. However she convinced me to keep being friends telling me how absurd it was to go away for this, and how ''if our friendship ever finished it would be because I wanted it not because she did ''.

I took this as she  wanting to keep a healthy friendship but she does not. She has cancelled every appointment we've made, never wants to do anything together, and since she got a new boyfriend barely talks to me ( When we initially broke up we continued to talk, play and spend time together almost as if we hadn't ). 

She didn't let me end our relationship with any dignity, blamed all the wrongs of the relationship on me ( I know I had  my problems and I didn't gave the 100% on the relationship, I tried to change and actually put the effort on it so we could live together, but she said it was too late ). 

She insulted me then blamed it on being drunk ( she wasn't really that drunk ). 

She has **backpedaled on every encouragement word she has ever said to me.**

For example I always had low self steem and once she said I should never talk like I was not good enough for her. Fast forward into the future she left me for someone she considered better and told me the only reason she was with me it's because she didn't think she could do better. 

She has systematically downplayed my feelings, every time I rise a problem with her attitude about cancelling something we were going to do or never wanting to do something she says I'm a manipulator, or a drama queen ( I just have tried to told her what I feel without blocks or lies like when we were together ) 

But every now and then she acts like she's worried about me and asks how I'm doing or if I need help. I don't understand if she's a selfish self assorted person who cares nothing about my suffering. Am I trying to demonize her ? How can I forgive her and move on ?",22Nov2020,1

My parents will be coming in three days to pick me up for the winter break but they are pretty old and are in many of the high-risk groups for COVID, and are understandably pretty worried about it. My girlfriend has decided to go to a party tonight, despite the increasing case numbers at our university. I asked her if she could skip just this one party or maybe stay a few days somewhere else until my parents come to avoid her passing the virus to me or them, unfortunately, I don't have the means to stay in a hotel until I get picked up. She said no and said she doesn't think the virus would pose a serious risk to my parents. I never had problems with her going out before but I'm just worried about my parents getting sick. Should I report the party she's at to the university? I hate the idea of snitching and I've never done anything like this before, but I'm pretty worried about my parents getting sick, not to mention all the other people's parents, and I'm a bit pissed.

138,"What should I do?

Can not believe I’m taking to reddit for advice on this.. don’t let me down, folks.

Background info to start this post- I am a 26 y/o female undergrad student at a really large university.

One of my classes is brutal— the professor is intimidating and expects a lot out of the class and I began to feel overwhelmed. There’s a TA for the class who is absolutely brilliant (not to mention attractive), so I went to his office hours in hopes of him telling me how to essentially not fail the class. I scheduled a slot in his (zoom) office hours, and to my surprise he was behaving really flustered throughout the meeting (he was fidgeting which is unlike him in class- he even spilled his coffee and turned all red when he was responding to a question I asked him about the class) It felt like there was definitely some chemistry between us, our personalities just clicked, and it felt like there was a mild sexual tension/‘hey I think we could get along really well’ vibe that felt similar to some of the better dates I have been on in my life. Aside from both of our social awkwardness, we had a great conversation about the class material during the meeting and I got a lot of helpful advice from him. He grades my papers fairly (decent grades- not perfect but not expecting that b/c this class is so hard) and he always leaves comments commending my writing- the last one he referred to as a ‘beautifully sensual’ writing style. 

In the following weeks, I began turning my camera off in class in hopes of being more focused (my prof. allows cameras off) and then last week, I decided to turn my camera on in the middle of him talking during class and he immediately lost his train of thought (very unlike him) and turned all red and started rambling about some book we weren’t even reading. I kept it on yesterday as well and he kept fidgeting in his seat, then he would get really close to his screen, stare at it for awhile and then smile. He never did any of this when my camera was off. 

Could it be possible that he’s interested? 
He’s about five years older than me and I believe almost done with his program— the quarter is almost over and the department I’m in is huge, I doubt I’ll ever have him as a TA in my last two quarters here. Is it possible if he’s interested that he will make a move after the quarter? If he doesn’t, could I? I’m just terrified that I’m reading too much into this and don’t want to embarrass myself.",22Nov2020,1

(I know everyone doesn't feel that way, so I wanted to make it known what I wanted before attempting a relationship) We have a great relationship, but everytime I bring up getting married and having kids, he says that he wants that too, just not yet. And I've been okay with that, as I cant force that upon him. But I'm to the point that I'm depressed and sad everyday because I just want to be a mom. I know it CAN wait, but I made the decision years and years ago that I would be having kids as soon as I could because I love babies and children so much(I want to foster, adopt, and have bio kids). Waiting at this point is awful, I hate it so much. I will do anything to be a mom, including ending my longest and best relationship in order to do that.

157,"Long story short, I recently moved to California where I started horse riding lessons. Problem is, my trainer seems to not give a shit about me. She moved facilities in early October (right around the time I started lessons), taking a short break while she got things settled, buy resumed teaching on the 12th. Said in her newsletter that she had a limited number of spots open for lessons the first week but, and I quote, ""if we can't get you scheduled the first week back, you will *for sure* be in the second week.""

Well, here we are in late November, and I haven't had a lesson in two months. It's been six weeks now since she's resumed lessons, and she hasn't reached out to me about getting a lesson scheduled. I texted her on October 22nd and asked if she had space for me, but her response was that one of her horses had been struggling to adjust to the move, so she was short a horse while she helped him cope, and as such was having to juggle people around and would try to get me scheduled soon. Totally get that. What I don't understand, though, is why she hasn't been keeping me updated at all since then. October 22nd was over four weeks ago, and even short a horse, I can't imagine why it would have taken this long to schedule me a lesson. At the very least I feel like she should have texted me or kept me updated as to what was going on, just so I could get a better idea of what was happening and when I might be able to resume lessons.

The final straw, though, was what happened yesterday. I messaged her on Facebook, explaining that I really needed to know when I would be able to start lessons again, as I'm in the process of registering for spring semester classes at school and need to know how my extracurricular schedule is going to look come January. I saw plain as day that she had ""seen"" my message, but here we are the next day and she still hasn't responded, even though I asked her to please get back to me with an answer as soon as possible. The real kicker? I noticed that she was active on the app at least a few times since I sent that message. So she's been on this fucking app several times since yesterday afternoon when I messaged her, and she still hasn't gotten back to me.

Should I just dump her at this point? Maybe telling her straight up she's got to start treating me like more of a priority, or I'm taking my business elsewhere? I've tried to be as patient as possible through the move and everything, but I'm starting to feel ignored and hurt. Frankly, I probably would have left a lot sooner if there were other riding opportunities in my area, but there just aren't. So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place here.",22Nov2020,1

Target had told me that they want me to work Black Friday and other holidays. I recently check my schedule, and Marshalls already scheduled me for Black Friday from 12 pm-8 pm. Target would also pay me $2 more the hour than what I make at Marshall’s. Yet it is in a different town than where I live. I would work both jobs, but I’m also busy with school.

163,"Hi everyone. So, I am in a pretty damn amazing relationship. I love him like crazy. Since pandemic started he became everything to me, supporting me... Now we are living together since the end of last summer.

BUT, my classes are online next semester and my family who lives outside the U.S. wants me to come back and continue my studies there. I miss my family a lot as well as the city so if it wasn’t my boyfriend I would go. I also suffer from depression in here because of being lonely and not doing much. My bf is a great guy who treats me wonderfully but he has some bad smoking/eating habits. He is even more depressed than I am because he needs a job until summer.

I sometimes feel like my depression is very induced by him and the way we are living. I wonder everyday if I should just let him go and move back for the semester. But because I love and care for him I know he would maybe even attempt suicide from depression while I am gone. He says I am the reason why he is surviving under shitty circumstances. But this way I wont be able to see my family for a year which is longer than it ever been. I miss them.

I don’t know what to do and what is the right choice. Should I be away from my family and try to grow in difficult circumstances or go home where I belong?",22Nov2020,1
164,"All my life I barely had friends, really. I had two internet friends and that worked out because we were both hesitant to show ourselves to the other before some sort of trust was built. Then, I had school friends which would only talk to me about school, and sure, there was some trust, but more in their answers or things rather than themselves and being comfortable around them like I was with my internet friends. This exception was only for one of my school friends who is one of the three closest friends. (the other two being the internet friends I mentioned). Anyways, this person in my school emailed me saying how I seemed interesting from one of the projects I did on Zoom. I emailed them back and we exchanged social medias. They seemed cool, but he immediately wanted to jump onto video games together or watch anime together because I said I only started to watch one. We were supposed to do it today, but I didn't log on all day because I was nervous about it and really would rather not. I didn't get this because for months, I just wanted to branch out from my three friends, but now that it's happening, I wish it never had. I really can't keep putting this person off for forever, and I do play the video games they want to play, I just don't want to play with them because I feel rushed. However, I thought people couldn't be rushed in a friendship; I thought that only applied to romantic relationships. How do I let them know I don't want to really hang out that much with them now? I see them on Zoom so ghosting them forever won't work. I know I seem like a huge \*ssh\*le, but I really don't want to hang out.",22Nov2020,1
165,"I know it’s fine to grow apart and stop being friends, but I think I just miss the memories. My old friend and I were very close for 7ish years, there were some racial jokes made here and there, but I never saw them as a red flag. Then one day she did blackface as a “joke”. Right then I stopped talking to her and blocked her on everything because uhhh........ duh. Anyway, she stays in contact with my mom a tiny bit because I didn’t tell my mom the full story. We’ve “broken” up a few times, not for that reason, but just general annoyances/disagreements building up and me throwing in the towel and her wanting to stay in contact still. 

We talked almost all day, absolutely talked every day, I miss that type of friendship but I don’t know if I miss the person. This is like the fourth or fifth time in our entire relationship that we’ve cut things off, each time of them being because I decided it was enough. Should I try again or learn from my many lessons with this person? I don’t mean to sound stupid, but we kind of grew up together. I cut her out of my life because I’m very BLM, and she supports it too, but what she did made me wonder and I wasn’t going to be silent about her fucking up, so I made it clear and left.",22Nov2020,1
166,"I (21F) have an issue with my cousin (30’s F) bringing all four of her children to my house unannounced and expecting me and the rest of my family to watch them. 

I don’t know where to begin with this but every weekend, my 11 year old brother gets picked up by my cousin to go to her house and he stays there for the weekend. Well today, we were not expecting my brother to be home so early and not only that, my cousin dropped off her children and left for an hour. I was the only one home. My cousin did not call me or even message me hours in advance about it and I can’t help but wonder what would happen had I not been home! I could’ve went out for the day as I sometimes go out with friends. The other issue was that my cousin called the very last minute when she was near my house. When I heard the doorbell ring, I was very surprised to see her and her children at the front door. It was very unexpected and it seemed a bit disrespectful that she decided to show up unannounced and not bother to call me a lot earlier.

Not only has she decided to drop her kids off unannounced, she was gone for two hours and her kids are absolutely disrespectful towards me and my family. It was extremely difficult to handle them. The other issue is that my cousin treats us like a free babysitter and bringing her kids to our house without warning expecting us to be ok with it and to be available. It’s not fair for us! We are busy people and we stick to a schedule. We also have social lives and things that we do on the weekends. My sister likes to go out every other weekend with her friends and so do I. We can’t just cancel our plans at the last minute to watch my cousins children! 

I told my dad about this and he didn’t really say anything about it. I told my sister this when we were on our way to get dinner and she didn’t understand why it was such a big deal. She said I was overreacting and I said that I was alone and imagine if I wasn’t home. It’s cold and my cousin decided to drive all the way to our house just to drop my brother off along with her children unannounced! 

How can I address this with my cousin and explain that what she is doing is a huge issue to me and my family?",22Nov2020,1

169,"Venmo let’s people steal your money and they will do nothing about it . If you look on any of there social media pages you will see hundreds of stories just like mine . They need to be stopped . They themselves are a fraud and this needs to get attention. Here’s what happened to me: I was sent a Venmo request from my friends Venmo account. This account looks identical to hers with her her exact first and last name and profile picture . The request stated “Spare tire, would not ask but I left my wallet I’ll Venmo you back as soon as I get home! PLEASE, my phone is dying!” So of course I  send the money right away . That is my best friend I would do anything for her.  I call her immediately after and she has no idea what I’m talking about . It was a SCAM. Allegedly Venmo believes that someone what able to use her exact name and picture and pretend to be her and request money from her friends and family. Because her transactions were public on her profile they could see who my friend normally sends money to and then in turn know who to target to steal from. This account was not my friends account but a scammer trying to take advantage of peoples kindness and Venmo completely doesn’t care.  How was I to know that the account with the exact same name and picture was in fact a con artist  looking to take advantage of people ? There’s no way I could have known that . Someone took advantage or my loyalty, my trust, my kindness  to steal from me and I really need your company to help me get my money back . There is a global pandemic going on right now , I lost my job , I have no money in my bank account. I’m struggling every day and this money is the difference between if I get to feed my family this week or not . If i get to pay my bills or not. This money might not seem like a lot to a multi million dollar company but to me it means everything . It would be very amazing if you could help me get my money back because I didn’t deserve to get scammed and stolen from . Venmo needs to take accountability. Being a good person is why I got scammed and in the world we live in now this is just one more blow to my life .   I already contacted my bank they said I would have to get my money back through venmo or it would be gone forever . Please help I’m begging you . This criminal also stole from my friends mom and roommate by using that exact same Venmo request . The account got away with stealing hundreds of dollars . Venmo already told my friends mom there was nothing they could do  and then froze her account when she protested. Which is something I really don’t understand . Venmo allowed this is happen and they are doing nothing to protect peoples money  ? What is from stopping this from ever happening to any one else again and running the exact same con and venmo not do anything to stop it or even help your costumers in any way ? I really hope my situation will be different , I’m begging you . I’ve been crying all week about this . I’m so stressed out . I don’t know whose more of a fraud the person who stole from me or Venmo. Maybe if this goes into the public light someone else might not have to be taken advantage of .  With everything happening in the world right now I don’t know how Venmo can live with themselves ? Actually I do , they sleep on the piles and piles of money this company makes by allowing scams to take place and do nothing about it . It’s not hard to do the right thing but Venmo doesn’t care .",22Nov2020,1
170,"So I (F21) have a small group of friends that I made in college last year. Two of them I’m quite close with and are my best friends,and the rest are more mutual friends who I’ll hang out with in a group but don’t really know THAT well. Still a nice bunch of people who I appreciate plenty. We’re all quite a strange group of people, half of us are medical students, some of us engineers and others mathematics or physics majors, so you can imagine how ridiculous our social skills are. Despite the fact, we make it work. 

One of the guys in this group, who I’ll name John, is quite odd and awkward yet an extremely handsome guy, and will get along with someone once he knows them well enough. He’s very close to my two best friends and you can tell how relaxed he feels when he’s around them. He also has a girlfriend who he’s been with for about 5 years, but their relationship is a bit rocky. 

The past couple of months, he’s been acting strangely around me and glancing at me in ways you probably shouldn’t glance at another woman. In other words, he fancies me and I don’t like it at all. Because I notice what he’s doing, I feel very awkward around him, and I also think he knows what he’s doing too, so he’s awkward around me too. For the life of us, we cannot have a light hearted conversation, and we cannot make eye contact. Any eye contact feels unnatural and harsh. 

I’m almost envious of my two friends who can crack a joke with him and make him laugh, because I can’t do that even though I wish I could. And it’s not because I like him in that way (I would never. I respect him and his girlfriend too much), it’s just because I know he’s a decent dude and I want to be his friend just as I am friends with everyone else in the group.

Before someone advises me to bring it up with him, I can’t. It’s not something you can just bring up and I’m not close enough with him to do it, nor do I have the guts. I don’t even have his number or social media or anything. His hints are so subtle that you can barely notice it unless it’s directed at you.

How do I stop feeling so awkward around him? I hate the feeling, and I just want to feel normal around my friends.

TDLR: A mutual friend might like me and we don’t know how to act around each other because we both don’t have any social skills. I just want to be his friend, but the knowledge of him liking me throws me off.",22Nov2020,1
171,"This is a throw away account. long rant but I have no one to talk to.i have no friends. My family has been torn apart by huge egos and greed. The thing I value most in this life is family and it is what I am missing.I am a 22 year old man about to finish college in the Boston area. I have worked since I was 14 in some form or the other. I’ve held 3 jobs for most of my college career but I am down to 1 since it is related to my field of study. My parents have abandoned me. I talk to them but I have absolutely no relationship with them since when I needed them most they seemingly gave me the cold shoulder. I like to believe I am a good person. I am one of those who doesn’t like asking for help since it will be a bother for someone to help me. I am usually the guy who is the most positive in the room. I have given people money who have never repaid me back. I have given people rides 2+hours away who don’t even answer my texts. My living situation right now is the worst. I am currently living with my brother who is planning on leaving out of the country and selling the house since it is a “sellers market” right now. He is obsessed with money. Any chance he gets to make money he jumps on it. He lives extremely low standard of life ( only has 2 pairs of shoes, maybe 10 outfits in all, doesn’t have much furniture.) He is one of the cheapest people I know even tho he makes 100k a year + rent from tenants. I have moved 4 times in the past year and I cannot even begin to think of another one. I am blessed to be employed by some company in my field of study however the amount of responsibility I have there is insane. Not to mention I am on a minimum wage salary. They don’t seem to understand I am still a student first and are throwing stuff that people who make 10x what I make are responsible for. I am at my lowest point. I have become numb to just anything and everything. Really hard to stay positive when everyday everything seems to get worse. I need positive thoughts and words guys please.",22Nov2020,1
173,"Keep in mind I'm 16(f) if that helps, and I'd totally got to therapy if I could, but I can't and keep thinking about it and it's not getting better.

I've always had normal paranoia as a kid, such as afraid if my parents are okay if they don't get home by 9pm or being worried about my siblings/parents in general since I don't know what I would do without them. But this paranoia really increased recently when something in my family happened.

I was getting ready for school (last year, pre Covid) and I had music playing as I was. My parents fight usually like normal parents, but it was brought to light how manipulative/abusive my dad was to my mom and they were fighting a lot more during that time. (Another broken family story for later) So my dad, being super strong, apparently wrestled my mom down and sat on her and she couldn't move or breathe. My parents room is right next to mine and so she called my name multiple times, but thanks to the music I couldn't hear it.  She eventually got free and ran out and that's when my siblings and I were able to come out and keep them apart from eachother and made sure my mom left to work safe and sound before heading to school. 

Like most children, I'm really attached to my mom and later on she told me how she was calling my name and to imagine her close to death or losing her just because I decided I wanted to listen to music that day just kills me every time I think about it. And I keep thinking about it. My siblings and I could've lost a mother because of music?? 

Now I'm hyper aware, super aware. Once I hear any kind of yelling or anything I get up and go over or listen. (TVs really don't help in this since they'll watch movies with yelling in them) 

I don't know I just keep thinking about it. How do I stop thinking about it? It makes me sick.",22Nov2020,1

177,"Had a door to door salesman come by earlier. This the second one this year and I swore last time I’d use the excuse I was exposed to covid so they’d go away. Of course, I didn’t this time either. They were selling a vacuum and they mention they’re trying to earn a all expense paid trip for them and their mom. So I’m already suckered in cuz I will do just about anything for anyone. They ask to use my own vacuum ( a $5000 brand)to vacuum my carpet. After that they use their’s and I cannot believe how much dirt and dog hair they pull out of the rug. So I’m suckered in more. And they vacuum my mattress as well and I was grossed out with what they pulled out of a mattress that’s only a year and a half old. So we start talking price. Note: I wouldn’t own the expensive vacuum I have had it not been given to me so I can’t really afford a expensive vacuum no matter how worth the money it is. It’s a $2700 vacuum and they have a payment plan of $112 a month. I work 2 jobs and don’t have the money to spare. I explain to them I can’t afford it. They drop the payment down some. Still can’t do it. They drop it down again. I don’t have a budget ( I know I need to put one together but I just end up forgetting to) so I don’t know exactly what I can and cannot afford so I just keep going with I can’t afford it. I tell them I’ll think about it cuz I don’t want to make a decision like this in haste. They’re like “ ok we understand”. As they’re cleaning up the vacuum they’re talking to me about my dogs. Then the one who I guess is the higher up of the 2 writes something down and hands the paper to me. They dropped the price to below the $2000 range and the payments are dropped down to the $40 range. That got me so we do the paperwork and everything and now I have new vacuum cleaner and now I’m anxious as hell about it. I’m conflicted on what to do. I can return within 3 days. But I’d really hate to be the reason someone doesn’t get to go on a well deserved trip but I know they’d most likely find someone else to sell to. I also don’t want to add another bill to have to pay every month, even if it’s only $40. I’m also pissed at myself for letting another salesman get me. The last one was for a security system and I have major regret on that as well. I’m in my late 20’s and am a new home owner. I never thought about door to door salesman being a problem.

181,"Hi guys,

I've been stuck at home with my parents since February of this year. I've searched and applied for jobs endlessly in my field with no luck. That kind of changed when I found a very unique opportunity back in September; however, that position is set to begin in February of 2021. Since then, I've been looking to apply to graduate school and have made that my primary focus. Ideally, I would begin my studies directly after the aforementioned opportunity ends. Basically, I don't know if it makes sense to find a job and move out now since it's only three months away. 

The biggest problem I face now is that I have reached an absolute low. My motivation is virtually nonexistent and I feel like I'm just barely existing. This has been the case since around April, as the fruitless job search really lowered my confidence and made me question a lot of things about myself. The pandemic, of course, hasn't helped much either, and it's just been a continuous cycle of highs and lows. Some days I find myself with really strong resolve and accomplish everything I need to do with as much effort as I can muster. Other days I feel down and can't find the will to do what I need to do.

I also have a bad relationship with my mom, who has actually been unsupportive of the effort I've put into researching graduate schools, contacting advisors, and applying for scholarships. She thinks it's a waste of time and that I should still be looking for work. A master's degree would give me more experience and potential for a higher salary, which I've explained, but that doesn't do much to hinder her negativity, which I suppose has really always been a part of her personality (she's a huge narcissist). My dad, who has always supported me and who I have always believed in, has always been a very sarcastic person, but sometimes he has also made comments that really sting, such as saying ""go get a job"" or calling me a good for nothing. That last one was something he said today, and I almost wanted to cry because I've been trying so, so hard for so long. Why would anyone say something so hurtful? And him, of all people? It feels like I'm in an environment where no one really supports me or my goals anymore.

I had planned on moving out back in July when I was so incredibly certain I would land a job. Unfortunately, that never happened. Maybe I should have left anyways, but coupled with the uncertainty of finding a job and the ongoing pandemic, I didn't take the plunge. Nothing I can do about that now. With all that said, should I just persist until I finally leave in February? It's so close and yet so far away. I know that I can push through, but I don't know if that's the best decision.",22Nov2020,1

183,"Here’s a quick rundown of the situation. My grandma had a stroke in September, got out of the hospital a week ago. I am in my last year of uni and came home to help out while she got settled at home. Turns out, she needs much more care than I expected. I’ve basically turned into a full time caregiver for her, with the help of my Dad, and my Mom and Aunt occasionally. Now my family is discussing whether we should move to a new house that’s big enough for all of us or renovate our current home. That decision is mostly my parents to make. The only issue is, if they decide to renovate, that means four of us living in a tiny two bedroom house for 6-8 months.

The decision I have to make is whether or not I’m going to move back home to help out full time. Like I said before, I’m in my last year of uni. Classes are all online until at least next year, so that won’t be an issue. I have my own apartment in my uni town that is three hours away from my hometown, the lease ends in September. I don’t have many friends left there because I’m doing an extra year and they have graduated, but I also have no friends close by at home either. I did recently start dating someone from my uni town who will be there for the next year and a half at least, so if I moved home it could be long distance or who knows. For next year, I applied to a grad school that is relatively close to my hometown that I could commute to if I lived there. Do I just bite the bullet, sublet my apartment and move home now? Or do I go back to my apartment after Christmas and enjoy the last bit of time I have there before I graduate, and also avoid sharing a cramped space with my family for 6-8months?

185,"Well, I'm 29M, still living with my parents. I work, but sometimes money's not enough so I need my parents' help. I'm still graduating in college (2021 will be my last year) and I feel horrible because I feel like I'm stuck in a prison.

My parents are great with me, but I feel like I will never grow up while living with them. However, it's impossible for me to live by myself because of money issues.

When I look at my friends, my workmates and my college colleagues, they are all set up. They are all dating already, some are engaged, some are already married. They are the same age as me, but they're so much ahead. They're looking for houses to live, sharing dreams and plans and thinking of a future. Even my best friends, who used to work with me, are moving to the countryside to a really far place to restart their lives.

Whenever I think about this, I feel the worst person in the world. I feel like I can't dream, because it just won't happen. I don't have anyone, like a partner, to share life plans with, and although I enjoy what I'm studying, it's not enough. I feel sick to my stomach, because I'm jealous of my friends, and I shouldn't be, because that's terrible. I can't be happy for my friends because I just feel horrible for myself.

I cry pretty much every day and sometimes I even think about suicide. Then I feel terribly guilty because my parents are good people and I'm just someone who's making them suffer, but I feel suffocated. I just feel like I'm about to explode, my mind would just stop working and I'd become someone with psychosis. I'm really sad and afraid of all this.

Back story: I (24f) and my bf (27m) live in Victoria, Australia. Our parents live in Queensland. Every Christmas we alternate who we spend it with, his parents or mine. This year is his turn. We haven’t seen any of our family since at least January 2020 before COVID hit. I have nephew about to turn 1. We are uni students, no jobs. 

Bf and I came to realise that our families don’t appreciate us as much as our siblings (he has 2 and I have 1). We’re always left behind or ignored or pushed to the side. We always have to put so much effort into everything including going he for Christmas but none of our siblings have to. They say they want us there but it feels like they only want us so we can finish the ‘set’. They have no interest in what we do. No one cares about what we are studying, or about what we say. We are essentially Christmas ornaments. 

Bfs parents also haven’t visited us in 2 years but regularly see his siblings despite being just as far away as us. My brother never takes the time to talk to me. My aunts and cousins have seen my nephew loads of times via FaceTime, sometimes twice a week, including family overseas but he never even calls me even once a month. He knows nothing about me and vice versa.  Basically we have started to resent them all. We don’t feel appreciated. They still treat us like children rather than adults, probably because we are the only ones without jobs or a degree. We constantly get fobbed off and it makes me angry. 

Bf says he doesn’t want to go to Christmas this year because he doesn’t want to deal with the family. He’s also obese so constantly has someone pointing that out. Like the only ‘meaningful’ conversation they have with him is about his weight, never any ‘how’s uni going’ etc. 

He cried about the whole situation and refuses to go home for Christmas now but I still want to go I think. It’ll be the last year we have to put all this effort into going because we are moving back to qld next year. I think I want to go but I also resent everyone a bit. I’d really like to walk out the door and not come back. It’s giving me so much anxiety that I’m falling into a depression and want to disappear for good. He thinks that if we don’t go, the family will realise how important we are but I honestly doubt it. 

What do I do?",22Nov2020,1

197,"I struggled with serious social anxiety and addiction to video games until I was 17 when I finally broke out of my shell, and I spent the rest of my time in high school making a friend group, which i really began to bond with fully and deeply before I went off to college. The stress of not seeing them in college was hard and exhausting for me, and I went through effort to put myself out there and make new friends, which was hard due to covid. I found myself mostly hanging out with a small group who did not offer nearly the same support as my home group, except for one person. We bonded well, but he left for home (a lot of people didn’t like campus life this semester) four weeks earlier than everybody else did for thanksgiving break. With basically no close friends, I put myself out there and I made some a lot more friends and now I have a really good group going, but we just left today for thanksgiving break and won’t be back on campus for two more months. Also, do not worry about how genuine these friends are. It may seem like I am rushing it because I befriended them on purpose instead of letting it happen naturally but I can assure you these relationships are completely genuine. The overall problem is I do not know how to handle the loneliness I will endure due to not seeing them? I have always had an inferiority complex of some sort due to the way I grew up as an antisocial nerd, and having to break off from these groups and having them torn from me after all I went through to break out of my shell is disheartening.",22Nov2020,1

199,"Hi all. 34 year old gay man here married to my husband-same age. We've been together for almost 12 years and married for a little over 6 years.

Like most couples, when we first started dating, our sex life was bomb. And of course we slowed down a little bit over the last few years, but still had what I would call a healthy sex life...fooling around at least once a week or so. We both had very intensive jobs so once a week seemed to be enough for both of us.

However, in the last couple of years, our sex life has come to a complete halt. And that is not the least bit an exaggeration. As I sit here typing this, I honestly can not really the last time something even remotely close to sexual has happened between us.

Every time I try to bring it up, he has quite a volatile reaction usually ending up really overwhelmed claiming I put too much pressure on him for sex. But we LITERALLY NEVER HAVE IT. Sorry for the TMI here but there was a small stretch of time in the last year that sometimes he would wake me up in the middle of the night for a BJ, but usually would just be him getting head and that would be the end of it. Barely any attempt on his end to reciprocate, if any.

And then there was a couple of times over the summer that I was so desperate that I would do anything for just that...just to give him head so I could get some sort of sexual contact with him. He usually wears these Wrangler jeans that give him hot daddy vibes when he mows the yard...and thats what initiated the couple of times I just gave him head and didn't even ask for anything in return. But then he caught onto the fact that his ""lawn mowing outfit"" really did it for me...which caused him to tell me he dreaded having to get dressed to mow the yard because he knew I would try to put pressure on him for sex.

For the record I have never pressured him into sexual activit. I am here day in, day out trying my hardest to make my husband feel attractive and let him know I'm still wildly attracted to him, when appropriate to do so and not in an obsessive way. But when almost two years have gone by without having my husband even attempt to penetrate me or show any kind of sexual attraction to me anymore, I feel so defeated. 

I don't bring up the subject often but when I do he always reacts as if I put so much pressure on having sex in the relationship. He has literally justified it before as saying that since we are getting older, we don't need to really be focusing on it anymore and just enjoy growing old with each other. Really?!?!? We're in our fucking mid thirties!

Now, with all this said, I love my husband. I still believe...and he says he does too...that we are each others soul mates. We've been through so much together and I don't want to ever go through life without him. But when it comes to sex, he just doesn't want it anymore. And flat out refuses to discuss it or claims to feel so pressured for it by me. I just don't get how he can feel pressured if we never have any kind of sexual contact...ever...and if I hardly ever bring it up because I know the reaction he will have to my concerns.

The reality is, I am frustrated to a breaking point with this. I don't need constant sexual activity from him...I can take care of myself on the daily. But I don't think asking for some kind of sexual intimacy every once in a while is too much to ask for. He is affectionate toward me in normal life and our day to day life with each other is fine I believe. But when it comes to sex...he wants nothing to do with it anymore. Don't discuss it. Don't attempt it. Just grow old and be okay with it. But I'm not okay with it. I want to feel the sexual intimacy of another man's touch in the bedroom. And I want that man to be my husband.

A month ago, it boiled over for me and we got in a pretty heated argument about it which caused him to ask ""So you would leave me just because I won't fuck you?"" I just want sexual intimacy back in our marriage. I'm tired of having nothing but plastic sex toys to take care of myself with....causing me to spend more and more money on toys I shouldn't buy...but do so anyway because I'm not getting it from him. He won't tell me any exact reason he won't even attempt *anything* in the bedroom with me anymore other than saying I put too much pressure on him. And that frustrates me more than I can even try to put into words.

I find myself at a crossroads with this problem and the amount of time that has passed without any sexual contact from him. I don't think its fair that he's taken this position of now that we're getting older we should just be okay with not having sex anymore. Sooner or later, I know it will not be a problem we can keep avoiding without a resolution. As much as I love this man...everyone has a breaking point. And the physicality of the frustration I feel is making me resentful toward him and thinking about what my future options are.

TLDR; I want sexual intimacy from my husband and my husband alone for once in almost two years, but his constant cop out of it being too much pressure-and refusal to discuss it further- has pushed me to a breaking point.

Any and all advice so appreciated.",22Nov2020,1

203,"A white coworker made blatant, disgusting comments to me in a one-on-one meeting; among other things, he called Black people dangerous and uncivilized. I was shocked, as my opinion of him had been neutral/positive up to that point, and I stayed silent. I must have appeared uncomfortable because he changed the subject. A few days have since passed and I regret how I handled the conversation. I recognize my privilege, that it played out in my choice to remain silent. Now, I know I must do something about my coworker, but I'm concerned about what the best way forward is. He is ranked well above me and has been here for decades. He appears to be close with everyone else. By contrast, I am 21 and new to my job. I don't have trusting relationships with my colleagues yet. I am debating between confronting my coworker to let him know that I find his views abhorrent and misinformed, and reaching out to an external HR dept. without giving him any sort of warning.

206,"We've been together for almost 2 years now and have been long distance for a little over a year. It's been hard but the visits kept us going. With coronavirus, it's been really hard, but the hardest part is her parents. 

They are controlling to say the least. We're both early 20's with bachelor's degrees and they are not ready for her to be an adult yet. They don't let her access her own money, so she can't buy a car, or have a lot of freedoms people her age have. Every visit we have had has gone through them and been shortened as a result. It's extremely stressful for both of us. 

Recently, we asked about visiting again because it's been about 9 months now, but they wouldn't even listen to us. It caused us to make a plan where I come get her in my car (11 hour drive) and sneak her out at night to come live with me. I have a good job and stable living arrangements so we thought it would be fine despite some doubts about how they would react. Well, I came to get her yesterday, and after arriving from the drive, we talked for about 10 minutes and she decided it wasn't right so she went back inside and I left. I tried proposing other options but out of fear of her parents, they were all shot down. The entire drive home it was all I could think about. It's been one of the worst days of my life. I'm writing this just after getting home. 

I later found out her parents caught her as she snuck back inside, and now they're monitoring her and want us to break up (they have since the beginning). We can't even text each other unless it's on an app because they are watching. 

I've asked for space for now because I have so many terrible feelings about this situation and am in a really dark place right now. I love her but with the grip her parents have on her life, it will be impossible for us to have any semblance of a normal relationship. I'm so hurt by how everybody has treated me, and I know she must be too and I want to be there for her but I can't. 

I have so many mixed emotions about what has happened, because there is a lot more to this than what I have written. On one hand, I just want to return to how things were before we attempted this stupid plan, but on the other I am so angry I wasted two whole days driving that I don't want to forgive anybody. In a way, this is the worst thing that could've happened because we both suffer the consequences of the plan but never even carried it out. 

I want to scream. I want to vent to somebody. The thing that made me the saddest was when I realized the person I would vent this to is her, but her parents might end us. There are so many things I want to do or say, but I know I would regret them. I can't stop thinking about this. For the first time in years I just feel totally lost and don't know what to do.",22Nov2020,1

I'm really interested in medicine. I like the mystery of it. But I have depression, and anxiety, and frankly, I can't handle med school or nursing school. I've done a bunch of research into it. Financially, I would need to live at home to go to nursing school, but there aren't any colleges that have prenursing and nursing programs nearby. I don't think I could handle switching schools, either.

I (22f) have lived with controlling helicopter parents my whole life. It's too much to go into, but this along with the abuse from my mother is what resulted in a myriad of mental illnesses as well. 

I moved out when I was 18 to go to university, but it was 2 hours away from home so my parents had an immense amount of control over my life still. In India, parents don't really just let you be after 18. Especially my parents, *especially* my dad. 

I have been in therapy for 6 years. Still, I am a scared, anxious, unstable people pleaser. I have worked so much on not being this person, someone who doesn't deal with crippling anxiety and someone who isn't scared of everyone around her. But being under their shadow hasn't helped me move on from the unfounded guilt, fear, and anxiety I live with. 

Of course, then COVID came, and now I'm living with my parents again. The part where I can't interact with people, make friends, feel like I am worthy, that has gotten worse. Because my dad is always around, putting unreasonable restrictions on, complaining, criticizing. 

I constantly find myself trying to please him, and this pleasing extends to everyone around me. I can't stand straight. I can't look people in the eyes. I cower with fear. I have gotten pretty good at hiding most of it, but it is still visible enough.

I go to a small school so being one of the better players on the team is not much of a feat. Everybody thinks that just because I am still playing and because I start that I must love playing, but that is not the case. I have hated playing football for years. It is a secret, no one knows except a couple of friends. I enjoy watching football but when it comes to playing, it is not fun to me and I don't enjoy committing so much time and work towards something that does not bring me any type of enjoyment. It has gotten worse over the past couple of years, to the point where when nearing the end of this season, while I was literally playing in the games, between every snap I would look towards the scoreboard and see how much longer was left. So my question is, what should I do?

217,"This is not a sad post or anything I just wanted to put this out to someone and hopefully they will see this and try to either learn from my experience to avoid this themselves or maybe help me with this. So I know this girl that I met three years ago during a time when I was very confused with who I wanted to be. We became friends and for a couple of months I found out that she had liked me and had asked for me to be her boyfriend (keep in mind I'm about 13 at the time) and I accepted her to be my boyfriend only for us to realize we weren't really ready to be together so we ended it after 1 hour. We remained friends and it stayed like that up until about January of this year when I started to have feelings again but they were simply thoughts. Then when quarantine started most of the people I talked to on a daily basis suddenly just stopped talking to me leaving me with about 3 true friends one of them being the girl mentioned before. I still kept quiet about how I feel but as this went on she started sleeping with older men (ages 18-25) despite just turning 15 and she would constantly call me and tell me about almost all the things that happened with no shame what so ever. Eventually she did get busted and I had to listen to her cry over the phone about how bad she messed up even though I had warned her before to not go down this road. During this whole thing she ran back to someone who was nearly 10 years older than her and she would tell me how much she missed him like I was some kind of therapist even though I was also going through many problems myself mentally being part of one of the most competitive schools in the country and having someone that I know kill themselves out of the blue despite never seeming like that kind of person. Back to the main topic she told me about how much she wanted him back and wanted to just date someone, at this time I feel I should have asked her but I simply bring myself to it even though I felt she would have probably accepted it. But as of recently she started talking with someone we went to school with and today while we were hanging out together he met up with us and while we were just chilling he just kisses her for all to see making me feel like a third wheel. Eventually they go off to smoke leaving me behind because I don't like to do that kind of stuff making feel like they just pushed me off and they didn't want me to be there. When I got home I looked myself in the mirror and just started asking myself why I was like this and have these feeling towards her?

219,"I apologize if this doesnt fit here, if anyone knows where else to ask please let me know in the comments. 

I (22 F), had recently got a dildo about a year ago. Its 8 inches for a better detail. I've used this thing before but usually with great difficulty, unless I use force or am really slick ""down there"". But the last 2-3 times I've used it I've had terrible pelvic pain that acts like my first day of my period cycle. 
 
I have a weird period that only lasts 2-4 days max, only hurts on the first day, that one day is the day I'm struck with liquid bowels, bad gas, and vomiting. I can hardly move at all and I dont even want to eat let alone take pamprin or midol. I dont even bleed that much! But the pain is excruciating! I'm talking full on knives stabbing your pelvis/ vagina/rectum like your giving birth! (Wouldnt know about that one, I've yet to have actual sex minus anal so I've never gotten pregnant). 

But now when I masturbate with this thing I cant even walk, my lower half constantly shakes and trembles, has spasms, and if I cough/sneeze/laugh I'm sent in shockwaves of stabbing pain. I've never had this problem before. I've used it in the shower every time except once when I decided to use the vibration function. This one has a suction cup base, made of silicone, and has a wite that plugs into a battery remote that has 3 vibrating settings.

Am I using it wrong? Is it too big? Do I have one of those pelvic diseases I see on tv? Does anyone else have any experience with this? If so what did you do and what was it? I tried researching the pain under ""what if a dildo keeps causing pain when I masturbate?"" And got nothing! It took me to pages for men masturbation problems not women! I'd like to go to a doctor but it's really embarrassing to ask your mom to take you to a doctor cuz it hurts to masturbate. Also covid is a pain here and i dont want to be put on birth control. Giving birth to at least one child of my own is very important to me. Nothing like ""continue the bloodline"" or anything i just want to experience it. One child from my body is my limit, and I've heard horror stories about women going sterile from those things and gaining weight and stuff. I dont trust drugs as is due to some previous bad doctors, I can touch up on that if your interested.

I also do have to admit that I have feeling a bit depressed because I haven't been able to see my friends for the last 8 months so instead of doing schoolwork, I always give myself an excuse to be on my phone (Social Media, Youtube, iMessage). So yea long story short, I failed most of my classes and dropped them before the deadline so I wouldn't have an C or D on my transcript. My parents are pissed because they paid full tuition but I am only taking 2 classes. I am doing ok in these two classes (Most likely A or B. Closer to B than an A). I am confident I will get above a C in both classes. I know, not the biggest accomplishment, sorry parents.

Argument and things going really bad:

So one of the things that really ticks me off is when my parents criticize me on my schoolwork or criticize me at all. I do admit that I act rude when my parents confront me on stuff like that. That is what happened today. This evening, my mom walked over and was like, "" You really need to step it up. You fucking failed this semester. What the fuck are you doing? Every time I come to your room, you are always on your phone and never help out with dishes or anything but you aren't passing your classes."" I got pissed and got defensive. At first I just laughed it off but then my mom said, ""What the fuck are you laughing at. Do you not take me seriously?"" I was like. ""All you do is yell. Of course I don't."" My dad came over and joined this. Oh boy. This took a pretty bad turn. My mom and dad both started yelling at me and started saying how they didn't want to pay for me to go back to campus next semester if I can't even handle 3 classes and that if I do so poorly academically, they will yell whenever they feel like because it's their house and that they are angry. They also required that I sit there and listen to them if I want to live in the house. Throughout the whole conversation, I apologized for doing bad but I was very dismissive and showed that I wasn't interested to talk to them. They kept bringing up that maybe I should not live with them and that they should not paying for me. At point in the conversation, I just got really fed up them continuously criticizing me. The conversation was 3 hours long and they kept basically putting me down and saying how I took no interesting in being a student. I was saying it was not entirely true (I did put in 50 - 60% effort in school). They replied saying that I am shit if this is how I am going to treat academics and that I need to reconsider school. At one point, I got extremely mad and hit my parents. Now I am not going to make any excuses for what I did because it's a horrible thing but my parents hit me a lot growing up (My parents have found all sorts of violent ways to punish me since I was 5 like punching me, taking a swing at me in the face and using nails to hurt me). Ever since I was in 8th grade, I have fought back and every time my parents fight me I defend. My parents are pissed that I do that. Anyways, this time, I hit my dad who was being highly critical and cursing at me for 2 hours. My mom did the first hour. My dad then told me that he wants me to move out the house and no longer is interested in paying for my college tuition. I have no money but my parents basically will think of a plan during Christmas to move me out (basically, my parents will help me settle in some cheap place and I have to make my own money and have to save up to pay for college myself if I still want to continue some time in the future). My punishment for the night is that I have no dinner (I accepted that one willingly because I myself also thought it was fair because of what I did.) I still plan to try to the best grade possible in both classes even though my future is uncertain.

222,"Hi everyone, first I just want to thank you for taking the time to click on and read this post. The main problem that I am facing right now is that I no motivation to do things. We have all be locked down during this covid situation at some point this year and it has affected us all in many ways. One thing this lockdown has done for me was give me the ability to sit back and evaluate/look at things from a hindsight type of view. The thing that I thought about and reflected on most was what is the point of all of this? People get so caught up in the rat race of life and the day to day activities we don’t get to stop and appreciate life for what it is. We then grow old and cease to be and then someone else is born and the cycle continues.

I am in a very challenging healthcare university program and I have recently found out through a friend that there are people cheating. (my friend is not one of the cheaters)

Because everything is online due to covid, some of our exams are written at home, and can be open book. People are cheating by writing the exams together (in groups of up to 6 people). I don't know what to do.

Do I tell the teaching staff that this is going on even though I don't know the names of any of the cheaters?

Or do I break my academic integrity by not saying anything when I know that there is cheating going on.

234,"I’m in my 20s and haven’t really been in any serious relationships. When I like someone, I tend to get stuck on them for a very, very long time. In the past, this usually meant that they moved, changed schools, one of us graduated, etc. and I don’t really see them again. I met my best friend a few years ago and although we’ve always been close, for the first couple years of our friendship I’ve had no feelings toward him. This year though I began to realize that I have very strong feelings towards him and they’ve only become greater as time has gone on. This wouldn’t be a huge problem....if it weren’t for the fact that I’m a woman and he is a gay man. I know it’s not going to happen, and the reality is if he was not gay his personality would be very different and he would not at all be the person I’ve grown to like a lot. 

I’m not really sure how to move on. I’m fully aware that it’s not something that will ever happen but I still seem to be stuck on him. Even when I’m on dating apps I tend to compare everyone to him and it’s really becoming a roadblock to me talking to anyone else. I’ve never said anything to him about it because I don’t want to make the situation uncomfortable and I don’t want him to feel bad.

237,"Pretty drunk so here it goes 

Should I seek help? Lol

Recently I’ve wondered if I have a problem. I only noticed it a couple months ago, but I’m 26 years old and I haven’t gone a full day sober since I was 21 years old. Sorry for the novel, but here’s my life story lol. 

I’m a white, thin, blonde, affluent Canadian girl, and I’m not overly confident so I hate saying this but guys do generally find me very pretty. Ugh that was painful to type. 

Anyways, I used to do coke very regularly when I was 18 but quit after about 5 months when I realized just how addictive it was. I did mdma from 18 to 22 pretty often as a party drug, too. I think I probably did about 40+ caps, but I eventually stopped after watching a friend O.D. (she was okay in the end but scary enough to ruin the experience, I did it once after and it was never the same). I still do shrooms once every summer, so I feel like that’s okay.  

I used to drink to the point of borderline blackout or straight up blackout at least 1-2 days a week from 15-17, and at least 4 nights a week from 18 to 21. I cut back significantly for a few years after a few too many mistakes, but I’ve slowly fallen back into getting drunk 3 nights a week on average. 

I started smoking weed pretty regularly at 18. And it turned into a poppers (cut cigs and weed through a bong) addition at 20 until I was about 22-23. Then I went back to straight weed and haven’t stopped since. It was very excessive for many years, like 2.5 ounces a month. I lived in a haze. In the last year (since my breakdown, more on that below) I’ve cut it back to about an ounce every month and a half to two months, and only smoke at night (or weekend days when nothings going on - but cutting back has really helped with getting my social life back so this rarely happens). I still get wrecked most nights though with back to back bong hits (sometimes mixed with a bottle of wine).

I’ve been smoking cigs since I was 17 too. It started as a when I’m drunk/ stressed thing but it turned into a daily thing when I quit poppers. I was up to five pack a week but now I have it under 2 packs a week at most. I’m trying to quit completely. 

So yeah, since I was 21 I haven’t spent a single full day without either smoking weed  or drinking (or shrooms/ mdma..... or doing Valium/ opioids once each). That’s about 5+ years. 

I guess I should mention that I was in an extremely toxic/ emotionally abusive 6 year relationship that I got out of a little over a year ago. I suffered through depression for years, was very suicidal for as long as I could remember and I self harmed from the age of 12 until I was 24. After a friend passed away from suspected suicide and I sought out a couple months of therapy, but I was still struggling though. July 2019 I had a very bad couple weeks of what felt like endless panic attacks and essentially a mental breakdown, but I’m so glad it happened now. That’s when I really put the effort into cutting back on weed and smoking cigs, and started doing yoga regularly, taught myself guitar, made/ reached out to friends and so much more. I’ve worked extremely hard on my own to change my mindset, and it’s worked for the most part. I’m in the best place I’ve ever been. I’m happy most days, and I have the tools to keep the depression at bay when it rears it’s head up.  

I probably still have an eating disorder. I thought I got over it because I’m at a healthy weight for the first time since I was 21 (113lbs, 5’6”) but I still feel super chubby most days, and after a long time of not purging I made myself throw up a couple times this week. But I know I can stop that. 

I’m seeing someone new after a year of “finding myself” after my ex and he’s really great (not that the bar was high), despite being a bit of a goof. I work for a very well-known company at the head office’s e-commerce team, my resume kinda kicks ass for 26, and I have a couple contract marketing gigs too. I’m financially secure with a cool spacey condo in the city. I’ve slowly built some of the friendships I ruined during my worst years. 

But I still can’t go to bed sober. It gives me anxiety just thinking of it. And it’s not like I just have one bowl of my bong. It’s always to the point of ridiculousness, or I have to mix it with alcohol, or be pretty damn drunk if I don’t have weed... but it’s only at night, rarely do I get drunk or high during the day (maybe 3 times a month..). When I drink I have a hard time stopping once I’ve had 1. Do I have a problem? Do you think I have it under control?

Two weekends ago I did get extremely drunk and a friend and I took a hard fall down the stairs being dumb, long story short it ended with so much of his blood all over the cottage/ soaked into my clothes (imagine a crime scene) and the ambulance coming at 2am to take him in to reset his nose and give him a fuck ton of face stitches. My tailbone is still in a decent amount of pain and my head still hurts if I move certain ways (not to mention the bruises/ cuts that haven’t healed). You think that’d be a wake up call, but I’ve been drunk 4 times since. Tbh I’m drunk and high right now. 

So yeah, if anyone actually made it though all that crap - Do you have any advice as to what the fuck I should do? Lol.",22Nov2020,1

239,"So ima just get to the point and say im 15 and i got pretty damn close to commiting suicide a few days ago.

When my freind snaped me. I sent her a snap back that was borderline suicide note and just kinda sat there to calm down so i could drink more. She started talking me down and stuff and i decided that fuck it ima try. So i put the alcohol away. So after talking a while i decide ima go to bed and she decides to send me one of these💗, so i sent one back.

Alright that was kinda chill right ?

But then we have been sending these❤💗 alot and i know she probably is just sending them to be a good freind, but i kinda like her tbh, she has a great personality ngl, she basically saved my life, im still depressed dont get my wrong but im not really feeling suicidal anymore cause of her.

I want to know what options do I have, I really want to get some scholarships, I don't wanna be in huge debt for the rest of my life.

There is more stuff but I dont wanna make this post too long so if it helps to give me tips then:

-No, I am not going to slack off during the gap year, I will get a job in the meantime and maybe even volunteer at my local pet shelter. Though I do also want to chill a little bit you know?

-I have a really good GPA and honor rolls given to me every bimester.

-I won 2 essay contest during my highschool life and went to the leadership program of one of them.

-I was given a brag sheet to put on all my accomplishments for my counselor to write down a recommendation card. I'll give it to him after the Thanksgiving break.

-My dream college is Ringling College of Art and Design but i was thinking of going to a cheaper community college first to be 100% art is my actual calling in life.

I have a business partner that that I met earlier this year. Let's call him Jerry. I am a programmer by nature and I don't have much knowledge when it comes to accounting and businy documentation. Earlier this year I managed find an investors willing to hear out my business idea. Around 6 weeks ago I told Jerry I need a 30+ page business plan, to give to these investors. 
I said I'll handle the design of the app, I'll code it and I'll even make the Pitch Deck. I even said I'll pick him up from his place so he doesn't have pay for transport to the pitch venue. All he needed is to create the business plan


During those 6 weeks I reminded him 4 times that the date is catching up on us. Each time he said I shouldn't worry and he'll have it done. This business plan is due on Monday (tomorrow), and we're pitching the idea on Tuesday.


This morning, at 12 am he told me that there's an emergency and his laptop broke, he said he won't be done with the business plan because he also writing an exam tomorrow. He's spewing stories on how his laptop doesn't want to switch on and how he's now using his friends.
I tell him I'm a COMPUTER engineering student and I can probably help him troubleshoot but he keeps avoiding the subject. The thing that what I noticed about Jerry sincd I started working with him is that he thinks he's smart. He's trying to make me offer to write the business plan. He's pushing the matter of emergency saying ""We're running out of time, what should we do ?!"".

Do I just kick out Jerry from this idea? I don't even know where I'm gonna get someone to write an propper  financial plan and business plan in 24 hours ?!?.

I know I need to cut out the soda and sugars and replace it with water. But every other time I’ve tried cutting out soda, I go through withdraws pretty bad and I end up giving up. I also am not a fan of water so I’m miserable when I’m drinking it. Flavored waters don’t have strong enough flavors for me, they all taste watered down (I know they’re supposed to taste like that) and gross. 

If I try weaning myself off, I will keep doing what I’m doing now because I can always justify one more so I have to stop cold Turkey. Any advice on how to deal with the withdrawals?",22Nov2020,1

254,"This is going to be very hard to explain, i really
don't want to say any names so I'll just make fake ones.
I had a friend, 'duck' we used to talk every day
from morning to night, i started to have a crush on him, i decided to talk to him about my school problems,irl friend problems and
my emotional problems, he blocked me and
said "" the people that i was friends with were stupid, they have problems "" that . That really hurt me. 

Time passed, didn't talk to him anymore, today
somebody tagged him where me and my other friends were doing normal stuff, y'know roleplay and just goof around, i erased the comments and told them to not tag them.

and here is when the "" fight "" begin.
after that i really didn't feel well, decided 
to leave wattpad and just try to calm 
myself, gave a look to wattpad before
going to sleep, I saw somebody, saying that they got diagnosed schizophrenia, duck insulted them, i got really angry. 
told my friends, they started fighting with him.
he insulted my friends, they didn't care though, but I think that ruined the ""atmosphere"", i already told them that I'm sorry, nobody has responded to my massage.

¿what can I do?, ¿it's all of this my fault?.

255,"I (23F) have a friend (23M) who I've known since I was young. He is the one person who I've been friends with the longest. We weren't best friends and we were out of touch after school until two years ago. I hadn't seen in his face in about 8 years and two months ago, I met him. It was amazing, it was like we were two lost puzzle pieces and we clicked together. 

In the many years we weren't in touch, he had lost his father and as a single child, the responsibility of taking care of his mother, earning and running the family, befell him. These responsibilities changed him completely, he is maturer in more ways and very conflicting in others. He knows his work limits and on the other hand claims that he is going to stay alone and not find a significant other for the rest of his life.

What I like in him, that I find lacking in most guys, is how good he remembers everything. He will often reminisce about how I was wearing loose fitted socks that fell around my ankles, the period where I had short hair, my dimples (which barely anyone takes notice), how I won badges for being disciplined and stuff like that. He once even proclaimed that I was his only crush in school. 

Since we were put in different classes in school, I wasn't aware of what happened there and he was in relationship with two girls during school. He never brought these up and even when we happened to talk about those two girls, he just dismissed the topics. So naturally I was to assume this introvert was never with anyone and with his conversations that he only had a crush on me and no one else. 

During one of our conversations, he would say things like I don't want to marry and then I would feel sad for him. At one point, I found myself thinking that what if I just be with him. I know that rather than a stranger I could be with someone who knows me and who has had a crush on me for a long time. I felt I'll have someone who loves me that someone who might, even if it meant a lot of compromise on my part. And I even talked to him about it. But we didn't take it any further. 

Recently I met a mutual friend of ours and when I went on to talk about this guy, I learnt about the pretty serious relationships he had during school. After telling me all the stories about him, the Mutual friend jokingly said, ""don't tell him I told him that, otherwise he will think that I am trying to sabotage his attempts to woo you "". 

This got me thinking that maybe the whole thing was a huge manipulation and all along he just wanted me to like him but in an oblivious way as if he didn't even attempt anything. I felt like all his conversations were an attempt to make me feel like he has liked me all along and no one else and the memories were just a cherry on top. 

I haven't talked to him in three weeks and I even bailed out meeting with him when I had a chance to. I don't know what to think and I am confused. Any help would be appreciated.",22Nov2020,1

259,"A very LONG story short (I realize it's still kind of long). I've been living with my three aunts who live in my grandparent's house. Two of them are amazing, they're like second moms to me. My other one has always been the ""problem child."" She has three children, two of them live with my grandparents in another state. Due to smoking weed, fighting, and a laundry list of others while pregnant, her first son is on the spectrum of autism. However, I think she has an undiagnosed disability as well. My grandfather, (not my mom's real dad) has a 100% service connected disability and actually had an older daughter, apart from my grandmother that had very severe health issues due to the effects of agent orange (she passed recently). My aunt's youngest is two years old and I am gravely afraid for my little cousin. Her other two boys have had their fair share of trauma induced by her but my grandparents were able to whisk them away to another state almost 6 years ago. My aunt is horrible toward her little girl. She makes her sleep all day. She leaves her in the high chair, often times ALONE. There's been so many times where I've come back from work and my aunt was standing on the porch smoking while her baby is sitting in the high chair eating, plopped in front of a television screen by herself. She yells at her. She rarely engages or plays with her. She leaves the house without telling us, leaving her baby in the chair. She's abusive. All the while my cousin is almost three years old and doesn't speak. For a long time she wouldn't even look at you. At some point we thought she was deaf because she would literally ignore the hell out of everybody. She just started somewhat giving eye contact and responding to her name. But she just makes humming noises. She also only drinks milk and eats potato chips. According to my aunt she's tried everything but my little cousin won't consume anything else. My aunt is delusional. She'll say things like my little cousin said something when we all know she literally doesn't talk. It's almost like my aunt KNOWS something is wrong, but refuses to address it. 

My grandfather is super controlling, he refuses to let my aunt move in with them because he thinks she'll steal from them or make friends with the local troublemakers and cause issues in the small town they live in. It's crazy because he's the reason she's like this. He has enabled her for her entire life. My grandmother is obviously miserable. She mentions to me sometimes how she wants to leave my grandfather and come back to live here. As the guardian of her two grandchildren, she's stuck now. Due to COVID-19 we can't go to the doctor with my aunt so we have no way of knowing what is being said by medical professionals. According to my aunt the doctor says my little cousin is perfectly fine. She's an incessant liar so we know its not true. 

Just typing this is making me so emotional. There are SO many things I've left out. But I really need some advice. I'm a college student and I work, while also dealing with my own trauma. I left my college apartment and my parent's house to avoid trauma, only to fall right back into it. I can't sit back and watch my aunt potentially traumatize another child. I was still a child myself when my other little cousins were born. But, now as an adult I can't let this shit happen. It's very unsettling that my family have allowed shit to get to this point. 

What is the best way of getting my cousin the medical attention she obviously needs if I'm not her guardian?",22Nov2020,1
260,"This problem began ever since I learned the techniques of burping from my cousin, I was 12 years old: it was the winter of 2017. During that time I attended a boarding school with a middle school education that lasted from September 2016 until 2019.

It was a very tough time for me, I was taunted and bullied almost every week, I was the dump truck for the popularity of others, and it only increased my anxiety which made me belch even more air. The schedule was absurd, every day I only had 20 minutes at most to finish my meal, and no more food was served after that, because they didn't care to bother: the parents aren't around to accuse. I often went hungry, so I would pile as much food as I can and finished eating it before the next activity. But it had impacted negative side effects on my esophageal well-being. To sum it up, don't go to a boarding school when you're 11 years old.

In the summer of 2019, I was lucky enough to be remove from one hell of a playground, and moved 550km away, where I attend my first high-school, the home environment (not the school, and never the school) assisted me to emotionally relieve myself, but in turn it spiked up my swallowing problems, which was already there to hug me unconditionally.

wOndEr hOw it WenT? On a beautiful sunny day of the October in 2019, exactly half a year after I left that damn school, I regurgitated my food during a tasty cereal breakfast on a freshly fixed lawn; the milk temperature wasn't how my stomach wanted.

Unfortunate events began crumbling after, a month later, I couldn't swallow as properly (not saying that swallowing didn't hurt a year ago) and every bite was like a trip to the ER after breaking your legs from the third floor, nothing helped nor relieved my pain: Medicine (it made the situation worse because of the hard tablets), therapy, special ""fluid"" diets, etc, nope. It gradually went from eating a proper thanksgiving meal with a die-hearted chicken broth in the heaven of 2015, to something that had to be carefully prepared and scheduled or I will die on a hospital bed, nevertheless, those options never benefited me in any way.

I've had a GI done while I was back in China, but they couldn't find anything and weren't convinced that I needed to get a Barium Swallow done. I had ""mysterious"" stomach aches whenever the food lingered in-between my esophagus, and more often than not I would find myself waking up in the middle of the night having to blow my nose with mucus full of what I had ate for dinner. Sometimes I couldn't breathe whenever I had food stuck, and etc, etc. The list goes on for so long I don't even recollect most of them.

For months, we visited doctors, and somehow none of them recognized that I had Dysphagia. Eventually, we found one, because the symptoms were becoming prominent, and so my father applied the treatment from the Medi-Cal insurance, and we waited. Fast forward to 2020, a year after, the insurance was still pending, as if praying that I would eventually forget about this and leave it alone. Spoilers, we didn't. We called them, and they told us to wait, but we already did. We still haven't found the resolution and I've visited the ER a couple times already.

There isn't anything special about this essay that I'm doing, I'm writing this because I'm desperate, I really want a solution, I feel suicidal sometimes because of this. The pain is unbearable; a needle poke felt like a gentle pat on head compared to my swallowing issues. Please, I want it to stop :(",22Nov2020,1
261,"What are some good self help books for addiction recovery without a religious component?   


I am 27 days sober. I hit rock bottom after I became black out drunk and sexually harassed a pod-caster I followed on twitter via dm. I turned to friends and family for support, spoke to a therapist about my issues and the situation, and felt I was taking the right steps toward recovery.   


Today I realized that I had replaced my alcohol addiction by becoming obsessed with a moderately popular tik-toker/only fan's model. She became the only person I followed on the Only Fans site and the only person I would think of when I masturbated.

262,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My wife and I split 3 years ago, amicably. One thing that she was adamant about, and I supported, was having family dinners every Saturday. We'd sit down with the kids, sometimes her boyfriend would join us, and we'd all have dinner together, talking about what happened to us that week. This was to keep a sort of family spirit around, and to set an example to the kids that just because two adults aren't together, they don't have to hate each other.

If I am to be completely honest, I haven't exactly been the most attentive father. I have a 19 year old daughter and a 14 year old son. We'd talk on weekdays on Facebook mostly, but it was all very shallow and even forced sometimes. They don't tell me everything, which is okay, I assume they don't tell absolutely everything to their mother whom they live with, it's obvious that they are going to have a stronger bond.

Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about last night. My daughter brought home her African American boyfriend for the first time. I wasn't notified about her having a boyfriend, but he seemed respectable, so I didn't mind the extra company. I did notice my son being more quiet than usual, but I chalked it up to sitting next to a stranger.

Everything was going great until my daughter's boyfriend started choking on some food. He coughed it up, but gasped for breath, and said ""I can't breathe.""
At this point, my son started histerically laughing and repeating the phrase ""I can't breathe"" with an exaggerated AAVE accent. It's like we weren't even there, he just kept laughing and saying ""I can't breave"", and one time even ""I can't sneed"", which I still don't know what it means.

Needless to say we were mortified. I sent him to his room as soon as I recovered from the shock, but it was obvious that he was making fun of George Floyd and black people. He even said ""I didn't do nothing"" as he walked off. The damage has already been done, and my daughter's boyfriend ended up leaving, which is something I can't blame him for.

I asked my wife what was going on, but she didn't know anything. My daughter, furious, filled me in. Apparently my son is a racist, and has been saying some pretty bad things for some time now. I don't understand how this could have happened, my wife obviously isn't a racist, so he couldn't have picked it up from her. It's not even his lack of interaction with other races - my wife had a black boyfriend for a while after we split, so he should know not to say these things.

I tried talking to him like a dad would, but I think he ignored me. When I finished talking, he said ""I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me, but I'll check my privilege every day from now on"", which didn't feel very genuine.

I don’t mind working hard, I bust my ass at work, but I just don’t log enough hours due to not that many customers or good jobs..

I can barely afford to pay rent. I haven’t had any money to spend on myself for a long time. I can’t stand it anymore. I usually work 90-100 hours a check and barely scrape by. I missed a shift this pay period. 

I move back home which is 1300 miles away East in July. From there I will decide if I want to finish my nursing degree (I can literally start the program when I return and finish with an RN), or go for a higher paying trade. 

But for now , I have a very strong work ethic and do not mind straining physical or mental conditions.

I am posting here because I feel like I am being pushed to my breaking point at my job and I just do not know what to do anymore.
I am a teacher and I was hired at this school to start in September. I have been working here since then. I spent all summer training with them (unpaid) and we are in person despite the pandemic. I am considering quitting and I am not sure if I can push through the school year anymore. I am completely overwhelmed.  The problem is not with the academics or the curriculum or even the children themselves, it is with all the expectations admin has of me. I feel like they are expecting me to be more than a regular classroom teacher, and this is not what I signed up for. They expect me to coordinate all these elaborate events that have to do with complex science, music, art, physical education, and I just don't feel qualified anymore for this job. The art and music teacher don't do their job correctly so somehow now it is my responsibility to do their job as well. I do not get any prep time or breaks at all during the day because I am constantly expected to be with the students monitoring their behavior, even when other teachers are supposed to be in charge. When I ask for support from my principal, she puts it back on me and tells me to confront the other teachers. I dont feel as if it is my place to tell other teachers they need to do their job. I am not an administrator, and I hold no power to do that. I am exhausted and I am tired of managing a group of adults who cannot do their job. I didnt sign up for this. 
On top of this, the principals daughter was a teacher at this school for 20 years and trained me. Right now , her son attends the school and is my student. Anything I do she is combing over with a microscope . She constantly critiques what I do and how I do it. There is also a teacher who taught here for 30 plus years who comes in each day to volunteer. She also watches me closely and critiques me constantly. 
I like the kids and I like the subjects I teach all day, but I am completely burnt out. I feel like I am going insane with so many adults breathing down my neck all day.

274,"Hi,
Before exposing my problem, I think I must clarify that I (25m) have always been a very insecure, introverted person. I am diagnosed as autistic. However, by some chance, I managed to have a girlfriend (24f) (she spoke to me first, she became interested in me and now we have been together for almost 8 years).

We have different personalities. While I like fantasy books, like Lord of the Rings, and video games, she likes things like photography, parties, going out to see new places and stuff. In these almost 8 years we have managed to reach a balance. I don't always go out, especially because it is very difficult for me to leave my house (but I do it when it is her turn to choose what to do). That's not the problem.

The fact is that she doubts me a lot. I don't think she has motives. She tells me that she doesn't think I'm that quiet and introverted with other people. Or that it is certain that I have hidden friends. I told her I had no reason to lie. That I dont want to meet other people and that I feel very good about her, and with my brother (my brother is the only person I talk to after my girlfriend). But she doesn't believe me.

The other day she told me, like a game, to change cell pones with her. So I gave her mine. She went through it for a while and she didn't tell me anything anymore. But it was my turn. So I told her to give me her phone. But she got very uncomfortable, and said she didn't want to lend it to me, that I had to trust her. So that made me feel very insecure. I felt that she was hiding something from me. I asked her several times to lend it to me, until she gave it to me. 

I didn't knew what to check. So I just got on her facebook ... She had been talking to a guy. She had been liking his photos, and things like that. Also, as I saw, they saw each other one day. I asked her about that. She told me it was just a friend, she got angry and took her cell phone from me.

I really don't know what to think. I don't want to doubt her, but that made me feel very insecure.
She and I have had a lot of trouble lately. She complains that I don't like going out, that I don't like meeting new people, that I'm just locked up and that makes her desperate. I've really been trying to get to know his friends, but I just don't know what to talk to them about. We have nothing in common.

I don't know ... I would like to ask you, what do you think about all this?
Should I doubt? Or is it just me, being me again, overthinking things?

275,"I need some serious help. I don’t know how to handle this situation. 

I had my friends over this weekend, as I normally do, for a few drinks. My one friend (22) went in the garage with my sister (19) and her friends. They were smoking weed and he got very intoxicated not to mention he was drinking a bit as well. Not sure exactly what happened, but he slapped my sister on the ass and things got very weird very quick. He came back to our friend group and looked very strange, like he did something he knew was wrong. Then my mom came out and said something to him witch made me believe he said something stupid to one of my sisters friends.

He explained he slapped my sister on the ass. I didn’t freak out or anything because I’ve know him forever and he never does stuff like this. It was a shock.  I consider him a brother he’s one of my closes friends. He started crying and had a panic attack realizing what he did. Threw up a lot too. 

Now I’m just confused as to what to do. Obviously he knows he messed because he started crying. And I know when tomorrow comes he will apologize. But I feel like my sister will say she doesn’t want him coming to the house anymore understandable. He’s like a younger brother to me and I think he just got to intoxicated and made a bad mistake witch I think a majority of us have done at least once in our life.

It’s a great place to work-my coworkers are kind,  friendly, eager to help, and value integrity and hard work. I’m learning a lot, and am getting something great to put on my resume. I’m seeing the inside of the business, and am getting to know professionals in the field I want to go into.

I’d say it’s basically perfect...except...no one wears a mask. I go to work every day and wear my mask, but am only one of two at a company of 40 to do so. I have never had an explanation for why this is. It has never been mentioned, or discussed. People just...interact normally, the way people did before COVID. 

Because it’s such a close knit company, there is constant contact between employees and very little room bff or social distancing. As far as I know, there are no cases at the company, which frankly is a miracle. 

I just don’t understand it. Why would a company that values the customer as highly as the one I work at put the company productivity at risk by not taking precautions? 

I haven’t heard anything about coworkers making a social bubble or anything. People just don’t talk about the virus.

Recently, I have also had somewhat tense interactions with one specific employee about wearing my mask. He hasn’t actively tried to dissuade me from wearing it, but he has joked “Do you have a tusk under there or something? Is that why you wear the mask?”. On friday, he asked me to show him my face because he had only ever seen my eyes.

I made an impulsive decisions take my mask off at one side and show my face for a few seconds before putting it back on. After, I was somewhat distressed, as I hadn’t really felt like I could refuse, what with there being other coworkers around (all of whom are easily 20 years my senior). 

I just don’t know what to make of an entire company with a diverse and intelligent community all silently agreeing to not wear masks. Can anyone shed light on this? How do I proceed?",22Nov2020,1
279,"A recent event with my son’s best friend ( 19M) and his actions came to light. I later learned that my son (18M) knew of this in advance but decided to keep the secret. 

His best friend was on his way to University in Australia . All of us live in Asia .  His parents ( close friends of ours) had moved heaven and earth  to get him to Australia in these COVID times. Organizing a ticket through the embassy, medical tests, paying for quarantine.... a lot of work and money was involved. 
2 days before his flight to Aus, he ran away from home and called his parents from the airport to say he was on his way to L.A! 
Imagine their shock! Luckily he was rejected at the airport because he didn’t have all the necessary  paperwork . He had no clear plan of action , nowhere to stay and some but not a lot of money. He had decided he wanted to be an actor and instead of discussing this with his parents , who btw are extremely kind and indulgent and adore him, he decided running away was the best course of action. 

We are all heartbroken at the callousness of his actions. He is 19 , technically an adult but as all parents will agree still really only a child. Obviously an immature boy as well. 
Imagine my shock when I find out that our son (18) was privy to this info but chose not to let us know. I know disaster was averted but it could have gone wrong in so many ways. 
We have spoken to him about not keeping harmful secrets but I really am looking for info on how to speak to him properly and any resources available to help . 

I am personally very upset at both the boys. My son admitted that he knew it was a bad thing and that he personally thought it was a betrayal of trust . This should give me comfort but it hurts me more because despite knowing this he didn’t tell. 
Any advice? How do we teach young adults to not keep secrets? Who can they turn to if ( he says) they don’t want to create problems?",22Nov2020,1
280,"My past is full of trauma. I was molested when I was a girl by boys at my school. I was also being abused at home, and continuously bullied at school. When I started high school, I started drugs. At the time, I suffered from at least 3 mental disorders (found out later when I went to therapy). I lied all the time; I was rude to my friends; no one liked me because of my behavior. I remember being called stupid all the time by my peers and even one of my teachers. 

Once I left high school, I took it upon myself to go to a counselor. At first, I went to a counselor at the university I currently attend. My counselor confessed that he had feelings for me after one of our sessions, which made me go to a female counselor (I did not report him, but I wish I had). I was able to get help for myself, but I still feel bad for the things I done. I feel bad for lying so much; I feel bad for being mean to everyone. I apologized to several people, but I still feel like they think I'm lying about the things I went through just to get sympathy. Honestly, I don't blame them because of the things I did. I hate having the reputation of being a liar, but I know I did it to myself. 

I think that at this point, I've been as transparent as I could with everyone, but, now, I want to forgive myself. I've made a new group of friends and have made a better reputation for myself at my new school. I've made some of the most wonderful friends. I've been making the Dean's List, and I can say that I am a lot happier than I used to be. The question now is how do I get over it?

TL;DR: Abuse led me to do drugs at a young age and be disrespectful and I want to learn how to forgive myself",22Nov2020,1
281,"Today, my sister revealed to me that she was assaulted by this boy about 10 years ago (he was about 15-16, while she was about 6-7). He used to work under my dad and used to visit our house often. He moved to a different country 5 ish years ago and we never saw him after. No one knew about this. She told me it was a repressed memory that has been coming back to her recently and that she has been having flashbacks. It broke my heart to see her try to tell me — she kept breaking into tears. The fact that no one could/can do anything about it is making my blood boil. I don’t know how to help her other than hug her tight — it is very difficult for me to digest the fact that my baby sister had to go through all of that and I can do absolutely NOTHING about it. I am aware this is a trauma that will live on within her forever, which honestly makes me feel worse. She has only told 3 of her best friends and I about this so far. Please, please let me know how i can make her feel safe as an older sister and help her through this.",22Nov2020,1
282,"So this girl I know sort of ghosted me about a year ago. Now I keep seeing her in my suggestions on I.G. And on top of that I’d been thinking about her.

I want to spend 30 years on. Is there anyone or any website you can go to for this kind of problem Somewhere I can even START to figure out?",22Nov2020,1
284,"I’ve always been really hyper focused on how others see me. Even if they aren’t around I live like people are watching me, like my friends would be surprised if my life was played on a tape infront of everyone I knew. So this leaves me always checking in mirrors, making sure I look good enough to approach anyone, and deleting all the selfies in my photo album on the off chance someone surfs my photos and thinks I’m conceited for taking pictures of myself. In every situation im thinking “would people think I’m selfish for doing this?” Or “would other people not like this?” I know most comments, if anyone does respond, are going to say, “life for yourself” but the problem with that is that i feel ashamed. There’s a voice in my mind that tells me I’m not pretty enough to be a human yet. My personality isn’t right. My weight isn’t what it needs to be for me to be real. 
An example of this unsatisfaction in myself is this: me and this guy are interested in each other, but I’m actually scared of him asking me out, because I feel like I’m not good enough for him. We could date if I finally lost weight, cleaned my skin, toned down. It’s more than date, even. I could finally live if I did all those things. My life revolves around them. If I just finally... flattened my stomach and fixed my body I would be at peace. I am shrouded in a daydream that’s just out of reach. It’s been like this for five years, please help",22Nov2020,1
285,"If you have the time, please read my last two posts.

I want advice on what I should do next. I'll explain everything, I have no parents or family to help me and I feel so lost. I also feel as though my friends lost faith in me.

When I was younger I felt like I could accomplish so much. My mother and grandmother always showed so much faith in me that I felt like I couldn't let them down. I was always ahead in my class and even got a small award to pay for some college in elementary. I got it in 5th grade and it was my first real feeling of accomplishment. I worked so hard for it. Class president since 4th grade, I did those goofy math contests, etc. 

In middle school I started to be in huge amounts of pain. I was always in the hospital and was told I might have Crohns. I took medication for it but was never diagnosed. But eventually I started skateboarding and maybe got less stressed out with my day to day and exercised. So it slowly stopped bothering me as long as I didn't eat anything bad.

Eventually my friends and I got better at skateboarding and wanted to skate a park. But there wasn't one around. So one friend said ""let's go ask the mayor"". We used to do random things like that to just laugh. Except this time we went to the town hall and to our surprise the mayor said that he'd work with us. It took us 3 years and we eventually got our small park in our small town. We were so proud, that we'd clean it daily after we skated.

Bare in mind my father never really expressed being proud. Not to mention through my teens we'd argue and he even almost hit me because I confronted him for cheating on my mother. He claimed he didn't and my mother had to take me to my grandma's where she told me she was upset with me. I second guessed myself and thought I made a mistake. It changed my father and my relationship. I always wondered why he would just treat me worse than my brother. But I did not resent my brother at all for it. In fact he was in my group of friends who built the park.

It was at this park I got a call from my mother that my grandma was in the hospital. I was 17 at the time and absolutely lost it when she eventually passed. This woman was my best friend and rock. She made me believe I could do anything. It was this same year I met someone in Mexico. She knew English and out of nowhere grabbed my arm and led me to a store where she bought me a soda. I had never met her but I did admittedly see her before. She showed me the whole town and for the 2 weeks I was there I'd meet her at the plaza to hang out. We climbed on top of somewhere and kissed and talked the day before I left. We kept in contact on MySpace and talked daily. Up until she stopped messaging me. A family member from Mexico told me she had taken her life. Apparently her father raped her. I was sad and angry and would often view her MySpace account. Until eventually I stopped...

When we graduated high school my friends and I had a day at the park where we talked about life and our future. It was a sad but exciting day. I'll never forget that day. I eventually fell in love with someone. It was the first heartbreak I've ever had. It made me feel things I couldn't control. I went to a party, got drunk and flipped my car. I remember getting out and seeing people already there. I must have passed out I thought. Cops were there in minutes. I sat on the curb silent. One cop asked if I had been drinking. I told him the truth and he said ""when you get home, I need you to pray because you should be dead right now"". My dad picked me up silent, I cried and said I was joining the Marine's because I was a fuck up.

I joined the next day. I spent two years in Okinawa and deployed to Afghanistan. This whole time I did not date anyone. I was focused on my life at this point. When I deployed I was part of the Fire Support Team (FiST). I was the radio operator and vehicle commander for my team. We provides air support for our convoys and at one point supported a random infantry foot patrol that couldn't get comms with air support. In the first time in my life I felt like I truly mattered. In Afghanistan I used my knowledge I learned in my first unit (3rd Recon) to make comms easier. I went to other units like Anglico and asked them for advice. Just like when we were kids at the town hall, I walked into a place with no plan. However, the comm officer there welcomed me in and gave me two antennas he made himself that were made for vehicles. I set them up on top of our COC with my Lcpl. I again did the same thing, but at a different company. There I found an egg beater antenna on a vehicle that was blown up. The Gunny there let me have it and it ended up giving our convoys satcom through the whole convoys.

I gained a love for science and decided to go to school for Physics when I got out. I had 50k saved up after I got out and used the GI bill. Everything was going great, until I got sick and passed out from a fever. My then gf found me on the stairs and had me come in and set up a nice bed for me with a fan and fed me. The next day I went to the hospital. I had an abscess that I embarrassingly thought was a hemorrhoid. I needed emergency surgery. After the surgery I was diagnosed with Crohns, I was septic, anemic and slowly lost weight. I cried my eyes out. I was a healthy 25 year old that went to the gym 5 days a week. I was in and out of the hospital after that and was still going to school. I luckily finished part of that semester and failed one class because I was hospitalized for 1 month. 

I was told I needed to be on an immunosuppressive drug called Remicade. It required me to have 4 hour infusions every 2 months. I eventually signed up for another semester thinking the infusions would work by then. I was wrong, I ended up using my savings to pay back the 5000 to the VA. Through all this my at the time gf and I struggled with our relationship. She cheated on me and when I found out I held her and cried and asked her not to leave me. I was bed ridden so I didn't blame her. Through all of this I was taking percusate and spending money on collectibles. At least 5000 went to my collection. I was naive to the fact that these pills were even addictive. 

Eventually I got better, her and I broke up and went our separate ways. I eventually met someone else and fell deeply in love with her. I'll call her Leia so this can be easier. I was at the time still slightly addicted to pain meds. I'd use every excuse to go to the ER and her some. Leia was heavily addicted to Xanax. She'd buy them because her doctor took her off when she had a suicide attempt. The first night we hung out, I drove almost 2 hours through a snow storm to meet her. That night was intoxicating and it felt so right. She told me so much about her self and that night said she loved me. I said it back. We had our ups and downs, but the worst was when I had to go to the ER and she went out. She brought home 2 men and did shrooms with them. I told her I was done, but she asked for a second chance. She seen that I was not in it and eventually got a tattoo with my nick name on it. It made me think that there was no way she could have cheated.

Eventually I lived with her, two hours away from my hometown. After 3 months I got a call from my brother. He told me that my mom fell and was in the hospital. Leia and I drove there right away and I was calm. I should mention my mother has MS. This happened 3 years before and I flew home from Okinawa to see her. I assumed it would be the same thing. She'd eventually get better with her family's love and support. When I got there my brother and doctor greeted me at the door. My brother was crying and my heart dropped. She was brain dead. I asked my brother where dad was. He was in Mexico with who I later found out was his mistress. I said fuck it and called my uncle. He flew out the same day and sat by her side daily for a week hoping she'd wake up. It was during this time Leia proposed to me so that my mother could bare witness. I said yes and felt a calmness.

Days later I had to be the one to end my mothers life. After meetings with her doctor and my brother and after saying no multiple times. I eventually said yes. I had to watch my mother, for what felt like years gasp for air while I rubbed her hand. She turned purple and eventually stopped breathing. I did not cry. I did not cry during the funeral. I just did not cry.

Leia eventually told me she heard a family member bring up my ""biological father"" and if he would show up for the funeral. I was confused. I asked my uncle and he told me everything. I felt betrayed and I felt like I lost both of my parents. My father even has the same exact name as I do. I eventually confronted my ""father"" about it after he accident let my dog run away. I have not talked to him since. Leia and I broke up off and on and she'd cheat more and more. We called of the engagement. And for a year I was alone. Until eventually she messaged me.

For 6 months straight I tried making my relationship with Leia work. She was with someone and would have to secretly meet up with me. During this time she was doing Molly and coke every week. I was scared for her life. One night like poetry she called during a snow storm at 2am crying and begging for my help. A friend of her was being invasive and she was scared. She needed me there to get her to stop. I got in my car and left, except this time I swerved into a ditch. Remember my buddy who walked into town hall? I called him and he drove me the rest of the way. At this time I was living with him and his family because when I left Leia's hometown I had no where to go and was often getting sick. I got there and stayed up the whole night to make sure Leia was breathing. She had just drank half a bottle of vodka and taken some molly. The next day I told her to get help and go to a center where she could. She did and I was so proud of her. Before she left I asked my friend to pick me up and take me back home. But before I grabbed her some flowers and things she might need.

She left after 2 days. But it was at the start of the pandemic and I couldn't blame her. Her ex eventually guilted her into moving back in with her and Leia assured me that she did it because he had no where else to go. For awhile we had to be secretive. She promised she didn't have sex with him but I was naive. She did confess to sleeping with him and even then I told her it was ok and that our plan to move to my hometown was still a go. However, she eventually met another guy and left her ex and I. 3 months later they are married. He recently sent me a message of a picture with the tattoo covered up with my nickname. I ignored it and moved on.

I met my current gf and she eventually became pregnant. She thought she could never get pregnant and still wasn't convinced that the baby would have been viable. So we went to a doctor after we found out. They took her in and had me wait outside in the waiting room. I was so scared, if it wasn't viable she would be devastated. It's all she ever wanted and I helped her achieve that. The doctor came and got me and when I walked in she was crying but unlike my brother... It was happy tears.

This is where my last two posts come in, they explain my current situation and I hope I can get solid advice as to what to do next because I obviously keep making bad decisions.

286,"To keep it short, I basically can't sleep because of hard to explain reasons besides just having negative thoughts that I haven't properly sorted or addressed. I tried to bring it up to my girlfriend but I fumbled hard and couldn't get to bringing up my negative thoughts without chocking and saying I would go to sleep and saying I was just tired and weird at the moment. I've started writing more as of typing this up to sort myself out but I really wanted to say something about this to my girlfriend. However I don't know if its right. I mean I've been pretty good these few weeks and have a lifestyle that does not really warrant this fear or negative thoughts but I don't know if I should try to sort it out professionally or just give in and try to explain myself to her again to see if that works better.

302,"A little background first, I (21M) live in LA and go to school here with scholarships at a local University. I graduate next year and will hopefully start medical school in the fall of 2022. Rent in LA is insane and unaffordable. I have 1850$ of income coming in every month post-tax which is not enough for food, bills, rent, and school in LA. We just moved across the country and I currently live with my parents. I do not know anyone at my new school so roommates is a difficult thing to do. 

Anyone who moved out of the home at 18-22 how the hell did you afford it? I don’t know how much time I can last in my parent's house till either a) I am kicked out for not following a useless rule or b) I have a mental breakdown and just leave. It is really confusing because on one have they have provided me so much by not having to worry about bills while living at home, a room where I can escape sometimes, and a support system. They have supported me mentally through life but recently it has reached a tipping point. I realize that COVID has really shaken the world and I am sorry if you have lost your financial security or housing based on the pandemic. My thoughts and prayers go out to you that in the next few months you will get back on your feet. I appreciate the money that my parents have supplied but abuse does not have a price tag and I need to leave soon. There are programs for free food for students but rent is out of control. I could try my hardest to grit and deal with their BS for the next year. Any tips? he “family” and I have to stress over my tuition still. They paid it this semester but they made it out like they were paying for it which they weren’t; My grandparents were. I like the beamer, but I wanted a 2013 Honda Civic for 10k but we bought an unreliable luxury car instead with my money. And they have the audacity to use the car repair bills as a bargaining chip, I did not want this car I wanted a reliable one that would get 350,000 miles and minimal maintenance. I wanted the remaining 20k to go into our tuitions to minimize loans and med school apps. I feel bad for my siblings who need to deal with this for the next 10 years. My tuition is an easy payment because I have several scholarships so it is about 2k every semester. I am seriously worried about applying to medical school because it is insanely expensive and you need to fly to schools to interview. That means weeks without work and spending money on flights, hotels, and the thousands to apply. And it all needs to be in cash because you can't take out loans to apply to school. 

In a year I will have a biotechnology degree with an insane amount of leadership. I should be able to get a job at a company really easily making 60-100k a year depending on location. I know that medicine is my calling, but I just have no clue what to do with my personal life because I know I need to leave but I cannot afford it. I feel that it is insane that I need to delay my dream in order to protect myself and my siblings from this situation. I want to move all of them out into a house I rent and pay for everything until I have the finances to attend medical school. Am I insane for delaying my career to save my siblings? I also could rent a larger apartment during medical school and live with my siblings wherever I go to school and go hella into debt.

I appreciate the money that my parents have supplied but abuse does not have a price tag and I need to leave soon. There are programs for free food for students but rent is out of control. I could try my hardest to grit and deal with their BS for the next year. Any tips? 

If only the federal government would give the citizens a stimulus check to fix everything. Or rent wasn’t 1200 for a shit 500 sq ft appt in LA.

304,"this might be a little lengthy but my family never wants to help me out with this and i’m not sure who else to talk to. my mother is a terrible, EXTREMELY mentally unstable person. she doesn’t really love me or my siblings, uses us as a twisted way to make men to stay with her and props for social media so our whole lives we have been through unspeakable mental, physical, sexual (for me), &amp; psychological abuse. i’ve personally never lived with her, so i’ve always had a choice to put up with her and obviously chose not to. i cut her off completely after a bad physical altercation last christmas. 

but it’s only getting worse for my siblings. they all live with her, split custody with their fathers but i don’t trust them either. they are always dirty and my mother always forces the oldest two (13 &amp; 11) to take care of my youngest (4 &amp; 3) literally 24/7. they’ve never had time to be a kid, especially my 13 yr old sister, my mom even demands her to take care of her. they have to go through endless emotional torture and had to have seen things i wouldn’t wish on anyone. they are already showing very troubling signs, and i feel like no one around me cares. i’m 17, i’ll be 18 in five months. when i get my own place, as hard as i know it will be, i really want to get at least split custody of them. that way i can get them the help they need, show them affection and make sure they know they’re loved. they’ll be safe with me. they are the only reason i’m still alive, it messes with me everyday knowing there’s nothing i can do right now. i never even get to see them, and now i’m pretty sure my mother cut off their phones to prevent them to communicating with me. my heart hurts and i can’t go on knowing they’re stuck with her. i don’t know what to do. 

the last thing i want to do is get cps involved because they do more harm than good, also i might get in trouble because my mom manipulated me into lying for her when she was going through a huge case i had no idea about. is there anything i can do?",22Nov2020,1

We were together for 2 years he lost the connection in the relationship I didnt I'm willing to try anything right now 
He said we could just be friends and if the spark comes back we could pick up the relationship again 
Right now my plan is the next time he contacts me to tell him these exact words
""Person I love you, i always have, I have supported you through anything and everything from your decision to change gender to your decision to become a cosmetologist. But I dont think I can ""just"" be friends with you, I am always going to love you, as long as I am in your life I am always going to want more than that and it's not fair to you to pressure you into being with me through a friendship nor is it fair to me too keep pining after you if you dont want that if you want to try and work on our past relationship together and move on from what I believe to just be a hard rough patch i will stay and work with you and keep supporting you in what you want but if that is not what you want then I need to remove myself for the sake of both of us... I understand you lost the connection and have lost sight of the love we had but that happens in relationships sometimes it's not uncommon. I still believe that we can work through this but you have to want that aswell or else it will never get better. The choice is yours I know its a hard one to make and I appolagise for forcing you into this position but i have thought about this alot and I believe this is what I should do.""

But, as I got to know him more, he started becoming a pain. He’s quite an insecure dude, and he does a lot of things I do. If he sees me watching a youtuber, he’ll watch that youtuber. If he hears I’m watching a specific anime, he’ll want to watch that anime.

307,"Hello,

  
So this is kinda a weird question. I am in the period of self-improvement and I am trying to change a lot of things I don't like about myself. I think my accent is too boring and I don't really like how it sounds (i speak with a mid-western american accent, btw, I live in Illinois). My father is a scottish immigrant, so I want something that connects with those british roots but also something that connects me to my American roots as well. The first two accents that pop to mind are trans-atlantic and original pronunciation. The trans-atlantic accent is an accent that was invented by Edith Skinner. It was very popular in 1930s and 40s movies, if you want to look it up. It was designed to be a blend of american and british accents a sorta universal english accent. It sounds quite nice and I like it, but I don't want to be made fun of too hard for completely changing to that lol. It sounds very aristocratic and it can sound snobby, which I don't like. The other is OP. OP is quite interesting because it is a real accent, but it was also sorta made up. Basically it is a recreation of the accent of Shakespeare's england. Despite what you may think, Shakespeare didn't sound like modern day brits, he lived before the great vowel shift (and before you comment, yes I know I am a massive massive nerd). So linguist David Crystal did some research and created an accent that is about 90% accurate. If you want to hear an example, look up the witchfinder general by atun-shei films on youtube. It has the roots of a lot of english accents today. When I first heard it I thought it was a really bad irish accent, but if you listen you can hear australian, american, etc. Also, early pilgrims to america would've spoken with this accent, so it connects to american history as well. I am a bit iffy on it though because it sounds very very different from how I currently speak and it may jar people I know if I come back to uni from break and sound like that. I need one that sounds kind similar to how I speak but also different and I can gradually expand the changes. So, do you know of any accents I should pursue?

I’ve honestly been managing these last few months well. Taking care of infants, particularly my infant because the kid never cries, is actually a whole lot easier than I was told it would be. I even have free time, if you can believe it.

So my concern, really, is about the long-term. I’m sure I can manage to maintain a relationship without issue for quite awhile, but if it turns out this girl is going to be sticking around, then things could get more complicated when my kid becomes a toddler. 

Another serious concern of mine is this girl becoming a mother figure to my son. She’s expressed that she’s ok with me having a kid, but if this relationship were to go anywhere then at some point she’s probably going to meet him, and I don’t want him to get attached to her only to have our relationship not work out.

I do definitely like her, I’m just worried about the long term, and my son is going to take priority no matter what. So I’m leaning on saying no, even though I don’t really want to.

I left the city, almost completely on my own....but I really disliked the city and I came back to her. We decide to move in again, and things are strange.

I don’t know what I honestly want from her anymore...things are better but between us it’s not...at least to me.

326,"Hi there and good day to everyone reading this.

Essentially the title.

Just a bit of background so you can get some context on the situation. I am currently a sophomore taking a Computer Science major (which I feel would help me the best in accomplishing my dream to become an indie game developer). 

I started college 2 years ago (2018) after my parents had forced me to go to college directly after Highschool even though I wanted to take a year break before I did, just to prepare my mind and just to do stuff that I was/am interested in (Website design, game dev, piano playing and drawing). 

To make matters worse they actually picked a major for me to do (Electrical engineering) which I did not enjoy at all (the damn course had physics, one of my most disliked subjects ever). I did fail my first year as a result and then switched to a computer science Major (to be done in the 2019 academic year). This went MUCH better than the first year and then finally managed to make it into my sophomore year. ""The future is looking bright right?"" I thought to myself. 

Fast forward to this year and things start to turn south once again. With the pandemic going on it really made life a bit difficult. Normally I'm used to studying in a disciplined environment, but at home it was basically impossible, due to chores that needed to be done, renovation plans and dogs constantly barking in our neighborhood. Also for some reason, I just lost motivation to study when I thought about people who are dying and losing their lives, jobs and only way to survive . I failed a course last semester (statistics) and failed another stats course (got 49 which was agonizingly close, just 1% more to  pass) this semester. Also provided that I don't get at least 50 for an upcoming Computer Science (A CS course from this semester as well) retest, I basically fail my major and will more than likely have to repeat.

My college however, in these difficult times, has announced that there will be no academic exclusions (nobody will be kicked out even if they fail).

I'm just a bit saddened that it's come to this. My parents are probably going to kill me if they find out and I really don't know what to do. They are the type to berate and compare you to other great top achievers and other guys who are smart etc.

I really love the idea of creating video games (starting to learn unity now), playing video games as well (as a matter of fact got some money saved up to build one before black Friday ends this year) and creating websites (I'm making one right now for myself), and sometimes I wonder that if I can't pass Computer Science is that dream/thought just a joke?

Sorry for all my rambling, just not really sure where to go from here.",22Nov2020,1

Today, we were at Walmart buying food and my shoe lace got undone?? (forgive my english plz) and since my mom was already carrying a bunch of stuff i put what i was carrying on the ground (they were wrapped in bags and stuff and we desinfect everything when we get home anyways) my mom basically lost her shit and got real mad at me for putting it on the floor and ye she was right i could've put it on the shelf or smth but she was real mad like borderline yelling she yelled at me to go swap whatever i put on the floor with new ones and come back. I was angry at her getting so angry over something  pretty small because she always tells me ""being angry is bad/control your anger/don't yell at me cuz im your mother/etc"" and i thought it was hypocritical that she punishes me for doing what she also does. I told her that and she gave me a half-assed apology of ""im sorry you feel this way"". I tried keeping calm but after a while of her nitpicking when she's pissed i snap and call her a hypocrite. She gets more mad and we leave(thank god for the masks, at least my silent crying didn't make a scene). When we got home after the entire ride was silent. We eat and she starts rambling about how when people are hungry they get snappier and stuff. I didnt say anything because i was still angry at her and trying to keep the peace.
Fast-forward to like 20 mins before i started writing this and i tell her while crying(i cry easily) about me still being angry about what happened and she starts with ""why are you still angry, i apologized"" and i told her i thought her apology sounded like she was pissed for even having to apologize for anything. She then starts the usual ""what do you want me to do? Cry while apologizing? Beg you for forgiveness?"" I just told her that i just wanted her to say ""I'm sorry i lost control of my anger"" she said no because she was hungry and that justifies it, that i should not be lecturing her, this is disrespect, ""she's the adult and mother and i should shut up and take it"" (literally her words, im 17 btw) i said that if i did the same thing she would've punished me and given me the speech of ""anger bad"". She said she didn't care. I told her she doesn't care about anything but herself. Then she said ""you're right i don't, from this moment on you're on your own.""

Maybe i deserved this, maybe i didn't. She often made threats like that in the past but since im old enough to actually follow on that threat idk if she's actually gonna stop paying for my school and stuff so im asking this:

What should i do now? Im gonna try to sleep but i just wanna cry rn.",22Nov2020,1

330,"I'm an 18 year-old who's had access to the internet for the longest time now. I went along with the friends I made online or the friends I knew from school but talked to more often online; Their humor, the way they act, and other stuff. 

I recently joined a Discord server a few months back and on day one met my current BF. He's a borderline SJW (self-proclaimed). So obviously, an immature, 18 y/o with a highschool level sense of humor paired with an SJW is not exactly going to turn out too well. We didn't know this about each other in the beginning of our relationship.

One day, I posted a meme into the Discord server we use, and I'm not going to lie; It was blatantly a racist meme. This flew over my head though, because in every other community I've been in before this one, and every other person I've interacted with up to this point would be fine with it.

My BF starts a conversation with me over this, saying that the N-word is never acceptable and that what I posted made everyone uncomfortable in the server, and I do even more things that make everyone uncomfortable, and a bunch of other things. He said this all in a hyper-aggressive manner as well.

Of course I knew what I was posting, and I knew it was bad but again, all I've experienced before hand were friend groups that would accept that sort of stuff and laugh at it, but now suddenly I'm getting hard-muted and berated from my S/O because I posted a meme I thought was acceptable. On top of that, what he said about how others were super uncomfortable with my presence in general really made me uncomfortable. It's one of those things that I just want to be ignorant to for the sake of simplicity; I don't want to have to think about my presence making others uncomfortable. Another thing is that his anger and frustration with what I posted was understandable. With how he grew up and the people he interacts with, I can understand how someone like him would be polarized by what I posted.

As for the aftermath, we both did some fucked shit that we later apologized for; He threatened to break up with me, and I played the victim card and baited him into feeling bad rather than mad. 

If it was just that situation, it would be one and done and I can try to forget. Ever since then though, it's been happening almost daily with other things. I'm talking too much, saying too much of this, too little of that; I shouldn't post that or say that, and so on. I literally said something out of anger in our DMs towards a frustrating situation I was in, and he got mad at me and got us into a two hour conversation about how it's not ok to say what I said even though I said it just because I was mad. Again, I didn't even say it directly to him; I was mad at something completely separate.

We get into arguments that last hours and he just makes me feel like shit. I know I shouldn't feel too bad, because I never knew all this stuff I've been doing was so bad, due to me being in friend-groups where none of it really mattered, but he really rubs it in and it's alienating me from him and all the other people in the server. I'm having fun with him and other people in the moment, and it's all fine and stuff but then we get to DMs after and he tells me about how I fucked over this person by saying something, or some shit like that and it just makes me feel so fucking horrible. Throughout all of this he comes at me super hard, but once the argument ends, he acts like nothing happened. He treats me more like his kid than his partner. I talked to him about this and he says that if we want a serious relationship, we need to have these arguments as frequently as we do, and that it's normal. Of course, I wouldn't understand, because I've only been in relationships that just ""work"" and there are little to no arguments. 

Is it really like this? Are relationships really all arguing with no REAL good times? Do I deserve to know and feel like everyone's always judging my actions, and I should have to always be conscious of what jokes I make or what I do around people just so I don't make others uncomfortable? I just feel like I'd be better off if I didn't speak at all. I really don't mean harm with some of the jokes I make, and I never intend to make people uncomfortable; Does that even matter?",22Nov2020,1

 About 3 months ago I met this girl on tinder in my new duty station. I was kinda a horny dick to her when I first met and we ended up hooking up but she fr became on of my closest friends out here. We kicked it and vibed hard till she weirdly distanced herself from me. Leaving me on read, not wanting to chill, one word responses and all. I figured she found a man or something so I kinda distanced in return cause I didn’t wanna press the issue. Then out of nowhere we ended up kicking it off again a few weeks ago. We FaceTimed and all, chilled one night for the first time in a grip, talked and everything. It got weird one night tho, cause we were hanging out and she was cuddling up to me while I drove, had a good ass talk and all, till she seen a girls name pop up on my phone. She understandably got pissed and asked if I’d been talking to other girls, which I had cause she ghosted me for a month. I kinda hinted to her that I didn’t appreciate her dipping on me, to which she replied that she was talking to other guys too, but then hit me with a line that said she thought she was the only one. Mind fuck there but when she saw that I got genuinely upset that I had apparently hurt her she was back to cuddling up to me. I said fuck it and we started chilling again. Went to the beach a few times and all, hung out, even ended up hooking up again. A couple weeks ago she was gonna sneak me into her room, which involved me climbing a fence to her back yard and everything. I was loud and almost got caught, shes pissed and ranting ab how I don’t think things through and think I’m a badass and all this. Again, I was visually upset, and eventually she cuddled up to me again. She never straight up apologized, which I said whatever she’s just mad. I kinda wanted to give it a few days before we chilled again, but when we did it went great. One of the coolest nights I had with her in a grip. Had a long conversation ab everything (I stg this chick would be HARD GF material but it’s more of a plutonic friends thing ig). Then, the very next day, as soon as we met up again she hits me with a kinda shitty attitude. I figured something had happened with her mom or something so I said fuck it, we’ll go to the beach and chill and it’ll make her ease up a little. Instead, a guy cuts me off while I was driving and I gave him the finger, to which she says i think I can do anything I want and nobody’s gonna say anything to me. More “i think I’m a hardass” bs. For the record, I do not think I’m a badass. If you’re a dick on the highway to me I will flip you off. She says to take her back home so I turn around and randomly she wants to go to a separate part of the island to drive around and such. It really seemed like this whole trip was one condescending comment after another. I’d do something and she’d call me an idiot. I’d ask about something and she’d tell me like it was something I was already supposed to know. Shit like that that I just didn’t appreciate. I made up an excuse to go home earlier cause I was tryna get out of there. When I pull up to drop her off she asked if I could sneak in again....literally like a week after she called me an idiot and how I think I’m a badass and told me I shouldn’t ever do that again. I kinda sweet talked my way out of there and went home. Now I’m left here tryna understand what to think about all this. What’s her problem, what I should do, and am I a simp?",22Nov2020,1

Quite to the contrary, I'm very blessed in life, which makes me feel even worse about feeling so melancholy. My family is middle class, we live in a nice neighborhood, and I have parents and a brother that care a lot about me. I graduated high school at the end of last year, and now I'm doing college online because my Dad doesn't like the idea of me doing college in person and I'm not the one paying for it so I don't have much say in the matter.

I have one guy friend that I'm pretty close with, but I only see him around once a week because he is pretty busy. Other than that, my only relationships are from my young adult group at church, and most of those people are older than me and we aren't super close.

I wouldn't be surprised if no one feels sorry for me at this point - I'm well aware that it is quite common at this age to feel lonely and lacking purpose and meaning.

344,"A few months back, I let my best friend move in with me. So far, he's been a free loader. We got a job at the same place, but he constantly complains that other people are doing their job correctly. However, he doesn't do his job and the others do for the most part. Part of his job is the dishes, which he just sprays off and hangs up. He also doesn't clean his station or floors, and sits on his phone a lot. 

The other night, we were super busy. I was still taking orders when he came to take my dishes. We had over an hour before close, but he insisted on taking them. I told him repetitively that I still needed them, and he snapped that,""I have no idea what I did to make you so angry at me!"" 

This wasn't the first comment like this he had made, but it's the first time he's said something like this to me in years. He's also been really rude to another friend of mine who also work at the same place. 

I got angry when he made this statement, and avoided interacting with him until time to go home. He refused to speak or apologize and stormed off to his room when we got home. Within an hour he texted me to ask if his boyfriend could come over. It pissed me off more, so I ignored it and tried going to sleep. The following morning, he wouldn't come down. Then, his boyfriend messaged me asking if I was angry at him. He didn't bother with me. 

I got angry again; I was finally calming down after what he had said and he did that. I explained that my ""friend"" had been rude so yes I was angry, and I apologised that he had been dragged into this. 

Well, my friend got angry I had said that he had drug his boyfriend into this and then said ""I don't see what's wrong with what I said.""

He didn't message again, removed himself from our group chat, and refused to come down from his room l day.

351,"Howdy! 
My bf since 7 years back is the number one teddy bear when he is awake. But sometimes when he's asleep he turns into a killer bear.
No- not that serious but his feet and fists sometimes unconsciously goes flying, because he dreams that I am a threat. (He's never caught me, don't worry)

So, I've tried being annoying like yelling his name while jumping on the bed. It does wake him up in about 20minutes. But he's not a happy boi about it. (And might awaken the bear).

I've tried the uncomfortable poking of places you're not supposed to touch. Like armpits and in the nostril/ear. It does work eventually but has a 99,98% chance of awakening the bear.

I've tried bringing coffee. And with the coffee I've also tried the guilt-trip-technique where I'll be sad and say ""I've made this coffee for you and you won't drink it 😢?"" Works about 3% of the times.

Annnnnd. The process of screaming ""wake up"" periodically for 3 hours. Which does work, but it's time consuming and I got things to do.

So, my teddy bear really has problem with his sleep and do not want me to stop waking him up. But I am getting tired. I have no clue of what to do. Not even the vacuum cleaner gets him up. 
And the twat wakes up too late and goes to sleep to late because because of that.
And he's a real child when I talk to him about going to bed earlier.
Also, I'm not perfect either- sometimes I sleep for 0- or 16 hours. He's got dirt on me.

AND- do not tell me to spritz water on him because that is DANGER.

353,"I (25F) started university in 2013, studying electrical engineering. I completed all of my gen eds and about a third of the engineering courses when I changed majors, and graduated in 2018 with two B.A.'s in unrelated fields (an art and a language). I have always been someone with a lot of interests.

Now, I am considering going back to my original university and completing the engineering degree... but what would that look like? Would I have to retake the gen eds? The general engineering requirements (i.e. calculus and physics)? How do I go about getting financial aid? Who do I contact at my alma mater to ask these questions?

Finally... I'm currently in a social working field (mostly by accident, my second language is tangentially related) and don't make a lot as it is (actually, almost minimum wage for my state). I would need to work full time, minimum, so I would need to take one or two classes at a time. However, engineering is very fast paced. Am I crazy to think this would be possible?

I considered trying for an electrical engineering technician degree instead. I did two years as an EE tech intern and loved it, but my alma doesn't offer it, and the closest school that does is an hour away from where I work and live.

I guess any general advice would be great. I'm embarrassed to talk to my parents about it because I spent so much time and money on changing my degree.

i’m being stalked by my toxic ex, we were together for a year from 2018 to 2019, i broke up with him because of lying and possessiveness, he can’t get over it, he won’t leave me alone.

i tried everything, from reasoning with him for several months that there’s no hope for “us” in the future to blocking him everywhere but he always stays away for a few months then comes back with a fake account to harass me again.

the problem is, he knows where i live, and he told all of his friends my address, he stays for hours outside my windows/balcony to just watch me and check if i’m awake and ignoring his messages.

today i woke up to a text from him, he sent it at 4am saying that i owe him a convo since he hasn’t tried to get back in my life for three months now, and that he knows i’m ignoring him because he was outside my balcony.

the town we live in is small, so we have mutual friends, they also pass my house and stalk me for him, or stalk my social media accounts for him.

i feel so unsafe, i don’t know what to do, note it’s a family house i live in, i own it so i can’t move out, not in the meantime. 

also my family is kinda strict, my mum knew we were together but she didn’t want me to see him (or any boy in general) but we met in his car every few months, and he has pics of us sitting together or him kissing me on the cheek, he also has my mother’s number, i’m in constant fear of angering him because i can’t handle the disappointment my family would be in if he sent them any pics of us.

i can’t help but fear him hurting me or my family, he hasn’t showed any intentions of violence towards my family but he once told me that if i get with someone else after we break up he would kill my partner.

i’m having really bad anxiety attacks because of this, i can’t get up and continue with my day or do my college work, i’m in constant fear of what will he do next, i really just want to live in peace.

what do you think i should do?",22Nov2020,1

However, recently I’ve been speaking with my first ever girlfriend when I was 13. We were together for 3 and a half years until we broke up in year 11 (England and I was 16) we had a bad break up and didn’t speak for years. 

Last summer an old friend of mine made a group chat which included my ex and this was with my old school group. We have been doing weekly group calls. Me and her have got on so well it’s actually weird to the point she keeps bringing up sexual references from when we were together. Now it doesn’t bother me at all because I still find her incredibly attractive and my cup of tea in a girlfriend sense, she is someone I’d go for as personality wise. However what I am weirded out by is she has a boyfriend... 
Now it’s not my place to tell her to stop but I feel as we speak there’s more and more attraction and chemistry coming through. I don’t bring anything up from my past with her but she is asking a lot of questions about me as if we are getting to know each other. Now again we’re in a group chat so all our other pals can hear and chat about it as well and two of them have said she still likes me or she wants you and I’m like really unsure...now I’m starting to wonder could there be something if I stuck around a little longer?

357,"Apologies, this one's going to be a bit long. I'd like to give you the best overview of the situation I possibly can.

I currently live with my mother that **smokes indoors**. I have some obvious problems with that since passive smoking damages my health and makes living at home quite hard.

My cat suffers the damage as well. He licks cigarette particles resting on his fur which can lead to oral cavity tumors.

I'm actively looking for a job in my expertise (I live in Europe) so I can move out. Unfortunately it takes some time, most probably due to pandemic. Therefore I'm trying to minimize the damage done to me and my cat as much as I can. It's irreversible, as far as I know, so I'm quite worried.

Me and my mother live two rooms apart. Between our rooms there is hall and a kitchen (connected). Inside my mother's room the smell is unbearable so I'm avoiding this room for vast majority of the day.

In time, smoke usually moves from her room to the hall/kitchen, even when the doors are closed. The air in hall/kitchen goes noticeably worse making it hard to prepare meals etc. The air in my room seems okay-ish most of the time, but even there I can ocassionally smell a cigarette.

I try to get rid of the smoke by opening windows everywhere, but sometimes I feel like it actually makes things worse by moving all the particles around. I can't figure this out really.

I researched some air purifiers and from what I know I'd have to spend almost half of my savings for an effective one. It's risky. Especially since it would be almost useless by the time I move out.

I spend some time outside the house to minimize my contact with a smoke, but I can't do this for long. I need access to my PC to keep working on portfolio and applying for jobs.

Of course, I tried to talk to my mother about smoking outside (she has access to balcony from her room). She can't be bothered to wear a coat, boots etc. specifically for going on the balcony (it's almost winter here). 

She also thinks I'm exaggerating. One day she tried to smell my room and said that she can't smell anything wrong. Yes, obviously she can't - she's a smoker! She's used to the smell. I'm not.

As far as my cat goes - I simply make sure he stays outside my mother's room most of the time. When I notice he stayed there for a bit (I can't keep track of him and my mother all the time) I use moistened paper towel to clean the fur. It doesn't seem very effective, but certainly helps.

What else can be done? Do you have any ideas, fellow Redditors?

Of course the situation is not particularly good for the relationship with my mom either. Everyday I'm angry at her not caring about my health. We're not on a good terms. I'll appreciate any advice regarding this as well.

So, I quickly went to take out the trash, but both our grey bin (for glass) and yellow bag (for paper) were missing.  Stolen, probably.  The thought of him screaming at me again, or worse, led me to taking the neighbours’ grey bin and bag, and filling them with our trash instead.  

It worked: he was still mad, but he fell for it. But I have no idea what to do now.  I’ve gotta return what I’ve stolen eventually, but I can’t do it now, as I don’t know where our trash would go.  The garbage truck comes in about 5 days, so I can’t return the bin until then.   I’ve checked online: the process to getting new recycling equipment involves contacting the local government and takes longer than a week.

366,"I currently work under a temp agency using my bachelors degree. Recently some very upsetting  personal things come up and I need to move out of my parents house asap. My girlfriend and I found an apartment for a good price however the landlord will not rent to us because I work for a temp agency and my girlfriend does not make enough alone to meet the total monthly income requirement. We both have enough in our savings that we can cover rent no matter what happens and could probably even pay for the entire 12 months upfront. They told me the only way they will rent to me is if I get a note from my current boss saying that he will hire me after my several month term ends with the temp agency. I have been told by multiple people not to ask my boss to do this, as it could come across pushy and looks bad/reflects poorly on me. I don’t honestly know what the best course of action is anymore.

367,"Doing anything i don't consider worth my time or is ""fun"" has been very tough. Its my junior year in highschool, I am failing all my classes. And all I can seem to do is just bury my anxiety and depressing/suicidal thoughts and just pray that it all just one day blows over. Today was a midterm deadline for my English class, I had 7 assignments that take roughly half an hour each for your average student, I did 2 of those assignments and it took me 8 hours to do both of them. And they were very low effort too. At about 10:30 today I stopped trying to do homework, and started to play some games, and my dad walks in and asks me in a very disappointed voice ""did you get the assignments done"" I reply ""most of them"" fearing that if I told him the truth the punishment would end me. Still, he was furious, but all of his attempts at discipline and how I wouldn't touch another videogame until I was caught up in school. I just kept thinking, why am I like this... what events led to me not caring enough about school to give a damn, why didn't my dad's threats not motivate me to do my school work? I love playing games, its one of the only things I feel like I have control over. So why not just do the school work so I can play again? Because I just don't want to I guess?

Why am I like this. It makes me super angry at myself, that I can't be responsible for the simplest of things

So I turn to reddit for help. I'm desperate.

He is food obsessed. Every kind of food has to be shut away behind child locked - yes, CHILD LOCKED - cupboards to keep him from it. If you leave ANYTHING unguarded he will be into it and tear the packet apart before eating to the point of vomiting. Including eggs, chips, frozen meat (if its out to defrost for example).

He is bin-obsessed. We have been through 4 kinds of bins trying to stop him knocking them over, pulling the bags out, or getting physically into them. He will eat anything he thinks is food from the bin - including egg shells and plastic.

He also beats up Ami (my cat), bails her up in a corner and attacks her, and forces her to run around the house.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have talked to C numerous times about his problems. We have tried baby gates and temporary doors (kitchen does not have a door). We have tried numerous kinds of bins. We have tried spraying him with water. C refuses to take him to a behaviourist.

X placed a picture of my face along with the many screenshots of our convo, the caption is roughly in Vietnamese, behold such contents like her insulting my appearance. My friends commented, enraged at her hostility and it dragged til there was 310 comments. X still refused to take down the post despite clear evidence of her harassing me and violation of privacy (she deleted my picture but you could see it if you click on history).

379,"Throwaway account. Probably won’t ever use again.

I’m 19. 

My teeth have not been in the greatest condition. When I was 2, my two front teeth were shoved into my gums by me falling into my grandma’s coffee table, ruining nerves in my gums. I was sickly as a child too. Then, when I was 7, my mother decided to put me in braces. The place was run by student interns and they didn’t clean my braces as they should. My parents never got on to me about brushing my teeth as a kid. And I was a kid, I hated hygiene. My fault honestly. My teeth were ruined. I had holes in my teeth at 11 and they didn’t get filled until I was 14 because my parents were neglectful with it. Those fillings fell out and I got them filled again when I was 16 again. They’re bad again at 19. I can’t afford to get them fixed and I’m looking at insurance now. I obviously hate my teeth to the point I don’t smile. Whenever I do smile, I just think about how people can see how bad my teeth are. 

I brush them twice/three times daily. I have a permanent retainer that prevents me from flossing on my bottom teeth. And my teeth are stained yellow and brown in some places, yet my gums and everything seem to be in great condition. I use mouthwash. 

I’m starting to have trouble enjoying eating anything without thinking about the sugar intake. I have to look at the sugar contents before eating or buying anything. If it has too much, even if I enjoy the food, I don’t drink or eat it. If I do drink or eat it, I’m always thinking about how the sugar is sticking to my teeth and I have to immediately brush them afterwards. If I can’t brush my teeth, I’m in a constant state of panicking about it. I’ve even went as far to just not eat anything to help with my teeth, or even just eating foods that contain no sugar whatsoever.

382,"I work in a small department at a factory on day shift.

The way the department I work in is structured is their is a manager, let's call him M, two supervisors A and L and me, J as one of two assistant supervisors, all on night shift.

2 years ago I asked to move from night shift to day shift due to personal reasons. There used to be someone who ran the day shift function, but because it's a smaller operation, they didn't replace him when they left, my boss M and his boss N saw this as a way to put my skills on days and help improve the department. They moved me onto days as assistant supervisor, in charge of days.

Fast forward two years, M is constantly criticising me.

Whenever I do something without his approval, or, because he works nights and it's something that needs solving asap, I ask N, obvious things that need doing, it's ""You should've got my approval, I'm your boss, not N."", if I send an email out to other managers on the day shift, I get a comment like ""Why did X, X or X need that email?, it should've just come to me.""

This week has took the cake.

I have a worker on the afternoon shift who needed to get some documents done for HR for her right to work in the UK next year, HR are super busy this time of year, especially because of COVID on top, after I clocked out for the day, I spent an hour of my own time with her going through everything and getting it in the right place. HR were thrilled. M, ""Why did you do that? That's not your job. You should've left it for HR."" I tried explaining that it was off the clock, but nothing.

I order agency workers for all of our department, nights included. I send a weekly email to M and N the day before to make sure I got the amount right before sending it out, this week ""Nights is 12 at Christmas production, not 10."" I tried telling him that the Christmas production has been on for about 6 weeks, and this is the first time he's responded to an email that I send about it, so I thought it was 10 as per the rest of the year as no one made any comments previously. ""It's always been 12."" It hasn't.

He likes throwing around the words ""I'm your manager, not N, not A, not L, not someone upstairs..."" alot.

M has had two incidents before about bullying/intimidation.

383,"All of my immediate family are Trump supporters. I’m a libertarian. I don’t “hate” Trump, like some people do, but I’m no fan. My family are also big Christians. Or, at least pretend/try to be. I’m borderline atheist. So, as you can imagine, I’m already the “black sheep” of the family. We had a family group chat and it was going really well. Until, politics began with this whole vote mess and the alleged “fraud”. One of my brothers shared some fake news from some random blog and I showed genuine sources on how that was fake. My mom went on about how Trump is for the church and how without Trump Christians won’t be supported and partial term abortions will become status quo under Biden and blah blah blah. I shared an interesting YouTube link that was from a pastor who shared how he believed Trump was the anti-Christ. I shared it half jokingly. Of course, it didn’t go well. Needless to say, we all agreed to not discuss politics anymore. The next day, I wake up to my mom sharing some screenshot’d TikTok video showing how corona equals 666 and then some other bogus math and how it lines up with Biden’s campaign text number. She then said looks like I’m wrong. So I reply “wtf mom...” as I’m flabbergasted she’s trying to gaslight me after we JUST agreed no more politics, especially with stuff that trigger each other. She must not know the context behind “wtf mom” and must have thought I said “fuck you” or something. So, she tattles on me to my dad, who then goes full berserk mode on me... saying never to say “wtf” to “his wife” (he’s my biological dad, so wtf?) and then if I did I’d have hell to pay and it wasn’t a threat, but a promise. (Jesus dude, settle down) I’m totally taken back by his psychotic episode and reply that he could have just called me instead of unloading micro aggression in a family group chat for everyone to see. He calls me screaming and telling me to never do this again blah blah blah I try to defend myself and then I just say ok and he hangs up on me. I was hoping the next day he might message me saying he was sorry he blew up like that and to kindly not to talk to my mother that way. Again, I think he totally misunderstood the context of what “wtf” means. I felt like I was a total stranger being berated for no reason. Not like a son. I’m pretty hurt by it and really have zero intention to speak to them ever again after such a traumatic experience. My brothers didn’t even try to defend me... as they know “wtf” was in a question form and in no way was I telling my mom to fuck off. So, I feel betrayed by them too. No one has messaged me since. Just wondering what some of you might do if you were in my shoes? Try to make amends or just say fuck it and move on with my life without them? Thanks",22Nov2020,1

I'm getting an XR for about 45000 INR with an adapter and earpods and an 11 for about 52000 INR without an adapter and earpods.

So XR= 45000 and 11= 56000 (4000 extra for adapter and earpods).
I wanna be sure that the extra 11000 INR (150 USD) will be worth it.

385,"Married 29M here, have been curious for a fairly extended period of time, had a few near misses with the odd man here and there. One time even arranged meet with a gay couple. 

Have an overpowering desire to suck dick, I’m not attracted to men on the slightest just cock, I know that makes me Bi of some sort but it’s the cock I want to explore and not the male person attached or any relationship at all.

Life seems to always be moving at a faster and faster rate and for some reason these feelings won’t budge. I don’t want to ruin my marriage over it, however I feel like the regret of not trying just one may eventually push me further away from my wife. 

My wife would not be interested in the slightest, shuts me down any time I suggest others or open relationship in anyway and on fairness I don’t want to either, I just want to experiment just once with a man, I would be more than happy if she wanted to the same with a women. I actually more open to most things. She’s not into strap in play but it’s more of the submissive behaviour of sucking along with the taste of cock and cum that I like.

If I like it then great I can bury these feelings like I’ve done with feelings towards over women, if I get it then I see the reality of it and stop obsessing over it and get on with my life. 

My only issue is that I wouldn’t want to lie or cheat to my wife. In the past we have had a Don’t Ask Don’t Tell sort of  agreement but just need advice from men or women in same situation.

390,"Hello, friends, 

I really need some good advice. I have never asked anybody for help before, but now I feel that I can't figure it out on my own.

First, I will say few words about the situation I found myself in. Now I'm 32 years old, live in Moscow (Russia) and I work as a sales director in a small Russian company (4 people in my team), dealing with digitization and archival storage of documents. All the employees (me too) used to work for the same global company - Iron Mountain. That means my experience in this field is 8 years and I have achieved a lot for this time. I earn good money, I've become an expert in this field and not bad manager.

My higher education is a little bit related to the work area - I graduated from the university with a degree in History (scientist and teacher both). But instead of historical archives I deal with commercial archives and document management.

So, the problem is that I have dreams:

1) Living in the United States because I love this great country very much and I want my children to have a better future (I have 3 children). The owner of the company (my manager) does not want to develop business in the US, considering that we will not stand up to the competition and will spend money in vain. This is a make sense reason, because I am disappointed too with the development team that makes our products. But the product development manager is a co-owner of the company, so nothing will change. In other words, the option of moving with the opening of a representative office does not work. And it is almost impossible to find a job in the USA with my specialty and without a Green Card.

2) Create and research, not only sell. What I do has never really inspired me. Perhaps if I had any influence on product development, the work would inspire me at least a little more, but until one of the company founders leaves, I don't believe in the possibility of it. I would like to research and create something, for example, I was fond of creating websites at university, and now I'm taking iOS development online course, and it gives me pleasure. I'm also very inspired by biotechnology topics, and ideally I would like to be involved in something really meaningful for humanity. Colonization of Mars, solution of global problems of humanity, something that really changes the world.

So, I think I have about 30 years to realize my dreams. I would like to make a plan and stick to it (taking into account that I have 3 children and not many savings). In order to make the plan as realistic as possible, I ask for your help on the following questions:

1) What plan would you make for yourself, being in my situation, to achieve your goals and why?

2) What should I do at once, which goals are better to set for 2021 and why?

3) Which areas of business do you think will be most promising in the next 15 years, and why?

4) What questions do I have to ask myself?",22Nov2020,1

396,"Hi redditors,
I’m going through a really tough time in deciding to continue the path I’m on or start a new one. I am currently going to a 2 year radiology program (xrays) it took me 4 years to get here mainly because of my prerequisites that I had to take. I just started the program currently almost done with my first quarter, I’m concerned about the state of the pandemic. When I first got in they said that they had safety precautions for the students but my clinical site has a floor full of covid patients and it’s against the school policy to go to this unit, but yet the RTs ask us to go. I say no because it’s against the policy and now am facing retaliation from some of the techs for refusing to do this. The techs don’t want to teach me anymore and as it’s my First quarter it’s important for me to learn things. I contacted the coordinator of the program and she was no help at all I asked for a transfer and she is making it very difficult for me to transfer. I knew that covid was around and real when I got in I just didn’t think I was going to face something like this. As the job is to take X-rays I am having to take chest X-rays of patients that could have Covid but I wouldn’t even know about it. I’m considering leaving because I have an immunocompromised family member and I feel that the school doesn’t care about the health of the students. I voice my valid concerns and it is being ignored. I felt pressured to go into the program this year because I was waiting for 2 years just to get into any program but now that I’m in it’s just not how I pictured it would be. We don’t have lab time because everything is online and our only time to learn is at the hospital. It’s supposed to be a “great school” but they don’t seem to care about their students voicing their concerns. I’m worried about catching covid since I’m constantly in contact with patients. I’m irritated that I didn’t listen to my gut of not going this year, but moving it back to 2021. I don’t know what to do. Should I keep going and pursuing my career, go to a different program, take a leave of absence of a year or start a new one.

398,This issue does not seem as serious as compared to some other ones i  have seen but i really did not know what to do as i am a fairly  closed person and do not like to share so much with my friends and such. Today i knocked over my father's camera and broke it (it is worth about 2700 usd).Now i in no way come from a rich upper class family and my father isnt one to spend much money on himself.He has a passion for photography which i too got for him and photography is one thing we do together(again i am not very social and find socialising even with my family hard).After i came clean he got angry and frustrated obviously due to the severity of the damage and cost. However he forgave me very calmly about an hour later.I still have this overwhelming guilt and cannot deal wtih it.I feel like i  damaged our entire mutual like for photography and really destroyed my father 's passion for it.(our family has had financial problems over the years which we had just overcome).So any advice for how to deal with such guilt or how i can make it up to him.,22Nov2020,1

400,"Basically, yeah. The first time he came was in February because there was smoke coming out of the back and it was short circuiting the house. He figured because it’s in the bathroom steam gets in the wall outlet.

The second time he came back was in May for the same reason. He said he had to replace the pump and came back a week later. 

Fast fwd to last week, it just doesn’t drain. I’ve seen it happen before because I used to always get safety pins stuck in the machine at my old house from my work aprons. I haven’t washed work aprons at my new house so I was a bit freaking out about why it would be blocked, it was just replaced.

The guy arrives and he is lit up to see me again. My mum was there at the time and asked him if he came back to do his job properly -_-‘  he scoffed and said it was likely that there were hair clips stuck in the pump. I was honestly taken aback because I swear to god I don’t own clips, I hate them. Did he just assume there would be clips because I’m a girl? Like is it common because girls wear clips and don’t empty their pockets? Wtf? 

He went in, had a look, went to his van, came back, did his thang, ran a test and everything is fixed. Calls me in...and hands me wet hair clips and a safety pin covered in lint. What is going on? I laid them out then collected them up to show mum and he quickly told me they’re not worth keeping lmao like sure, I’m going to try keep them to put in my hair??

I am convinced he planted them. My stepdad was a drainlayer and he would purposely leave drains partially blocked because that’s how you get returning customers once a year, and he worked for the damn city council. So I don’t trust this washing machine man, I didn’t like how excited he was to see me, I didn’t like his assumption that I wore hair clips when I literally do not own a single one since they bother my scalp. 

So today I get an email from my landlord for the invoice and the dude’s statement, she’s telling me to empty my pockets better. I don’t know what to say to her? 

TL;DR I’m convinced the maintenance man planted evidence to keep getting work from this property and my landlord is telling me to empty my pockets for it. What do I tell her?",22Nov2020,1

It’s two Saturday’s from now. I told my mom now and she said no. 

her reasons for saying no were that it’s too far (the place is like 50 minutes away) and that she’s not comfortable with me being out that late (to be on the road at 10pm) and that the “insecurity of the road at that hour”

anyways, i told her i could get a ride from on of my friends to come back so that she wouldn’t have to stress herself and she said no. 
i told her that there is insecurity everywhere and that she can’t live in fear of everything or else she will never move forward in life. she still said no.

404,"There was this girl I went out with very casually for about 3 months. She was beautiful and probably the best looking girl I have ever been with. She is only the second girl that I have slept with more than once out of the 5 girls I have been with. We hungout quite a bit and it was clear that she did not want a relationship. We communicated very well about it. She was a pretty intimidating girl and was not very warm or reassuring so it was sometimes hard to be around her. She had lots of experience in every thing (sex, drugs, travel, general life) and I sometimes felt envious of it because it seemed like what I want. Anyways, I moved away to college (3rd year student) about 3 hours away from my hometown where she lives. She came to visit me a couple times and really it was more like she was using me as a place to crash while she did some other stuff but she brought me a long a decent amount of the time. The relationship started to fizzle out, I mean she was talking to this guy in London the whole time we were hanging out so I assume that she got more invested with that, but I kept trying to talk to her everyday. I would try and bring up interesting topics and send her instagram posts and nothing was really working. I had an open conversation about it with her, I asked something like ""look, I know you're sometimes hard to read but I cannot tell if you want to keep talking."" She basically said that she would tell me if she did not want to talk anymore and about 2 weeks later she texted me saying we should go back to being friends. Anyways, I cannot help but shake the feeling that I did something wrong to her or hurt her. I keep going through every tiny little interaction we had to try and remember something, anything, that I may have done wrong and I have even thought myself into a hole so much that I sometimes think I sexually assaulted her or something. I mean I'm fairly certain I did not (I can expand on why in the comments if you ask) but I think that is some type of coping mechanism to give me an excuse as to why she did not want to be with me anymore. 

I just want to know people opinions on wether it seems like there may have been something bad that I did or maybe I did not do anything wrong and need to just let it go.",22Nov2020,1

406,"Hello everyone,  
i've been having a pretty hard time last month. So there is this girlfriend of my friend. I've known this girl for 4 years and they are 4 years together. They were 16 or 17 years old when they got together.  I have never had any feelings for her. I have bunch of friends, who are pretty much my second family. We go very often outside, having drinks and all that. There is really strong bond between us and this girl and my friend are big part of this group. But lately their relationship just doesn't seem right.  


Last 3 months this girl was always next to me on some parties and just whenever we were together with our friend group, we were talking and having fun together. We understand each other very well and she is my great great friend. A month ago I was with my friends and her at my friend's cabin, drinking alcohol. That night, we held our hands for the first time and i immediately fell in love. Next day we confessed our feelings for ourselves. It's been a month, we text each other literally 24/7 from morning to night. But she still hasn't broken up with her boyfriend. She says, that she can't decide, but she wants to spend her time always with me. To be honest, this friday 27th we will take a molly with friends. Her ""boyfriend"" won't be there. Do you think we can bond there?  I know I can't do this to myself, becuase she treats me like an option, but I have this feeling deep deep down, that we are supposed to be together (I know, what a cliché). She is a really good person and she doesn't want to hurt anyone and i feel like that's the main problem, why she is taking so long.   


To be honest, I'm not looking for an advice. It's just i need to get it out of me and share it. I would like to see what is your perspective on this.

410,"I’m a 21 year old currently studying in the UK. I’ve been pretty ‘happy’ up until possibly the last year. 

Basically, I am pretty androgynous, and am read as female by most in society even though I am male. I never really finished puberty. I feel like I may have some undiagnosed disorder. I’m pretty comfortable with this however, and it’s not the source of my unhappiness I just thought I’d give context. 

Before lockdown, I did have my ‘bad days’ but overall kept upbeat as I had a lot of friends at uni, a best friend that I lived with, a job and a sense of purpose. My grades were good etc... 

After lockdown this has all been seriously taken from me. I have lost basically all my friends (just drifted) and have become super co-dependant on my one friend who I live with. I also have had a change of heart when it comes to my career so I have no idea what I’m doing next year. I just feel so insanely lost.

I’m single so I tried dating apps... but I much prefer meeting people normally in person. Which is basically impossible with Covid.
Yesterday, me and my friend were walking back from meeting with another friend, when we bumped into a party. She didn’t want to go (she has a bf) which meant I had to go home with her (I wouldnt feel safe alone)- I really resent her for this. Can’t she see how upset and desparate for human interaction I am? My life is so mundane and islolated I literally can’t take it. 

I feel like I am pinning all my hopes on my long town dream to run away to Berlin. I have saved up enough money I just want to go...
But I still have college, family, responsibilities etc... yet I’m so unhappy. 
I don’t know what to do. I just feel so suffocated. I’m a super sociable person but I’m being isolated. 
It’s also not like I don’t try. I go to the gym, get up early everyday, keep up to date on school work, try to relax sometimes and try to be positive. I still feel so void inside. 


I think the fact I’ve never been in a serious relationship even though I’m 21 is also affecting me now. I never really cared... but now I just feel worthless. There is no place for people like me in society. Even if I become super attractive- there’s still no point.

413,"Since i was 14 (16 now) ive been sure i want to move out as soon as i can but ive realised its not as easy as that.

My older sister moved away quite abruptyly and left a hole no one could fill. Our family felt quite broken for a while and we (my parents definitely) were more stressed because there was one less person helping out around the house, with finances, and other stuff in general.
Seeing how it impacted my family makes me feel guilty for even considering moving out - like im abandoning my family for my own selfish reasons. Ive brought up that i want to move out and my mum wasnt to pleased so the guilt is one of the main things stopping me (that and the fact im not quite sure how yet)

But the main reason i want to move out if for independence of my choices and for my wellbeing. Being here slowly eats at me and my energy and my drive. My mental health hasnt been the best but i have learnt how to deal with myself and i want to grow now. I cant be stuck in the same place, I want to see that ive progressed somewhere other than here and that my life isnt stationary.

He has already charted out his career path, where and what position he wants to work, at what age does he want to do his PhD etc. He is always looking on how to improve and how to increase his networking. He networks and meets with people, meets with his guidance counsellors, goes to career fairs (now online) etc.

Life before the pandemic was pretty bleak for me I'm not gonna lie. I had no social life whatsoever and spent my days holed up in my room binge watching and reading fanfiction(this was for like 3 years btw)
When things calmed down(the cases in my area were less and lockdown was basically lifted) I somehow made myself a life. I had some very dysfunctional and almost toxic friends but it was still better than being alone. As was expected, the group dismantled in a month but I got my bf out of the whole ordeal so it wasn't a bad experience as such.

417,"There's this new chick I kinda digged at work and I gave her my number (which she wanted) and later she gave me her Discord. Thinking, alright cool. We like a bunch of the same stuff so this should go smoothly. I lightly flirt with her (to test the waters, nothing extreme) and the reactions were mixed (not every mark lands I already know this.) I am also the only one who engages first (she's pretty shy and others would view her as awkward when she's at work) which kinda irks me cause then it makes me look like I'm being pushy or needy.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago, a coworker told me that she had claimed I asked her out over Discord (I didn't) and she just shrugged it off (weird flex but okay), which was around 4-5 coworkers. Now I don't really care what other people think in a negative regard but it's the fact she claimed I asked her out. I already asked some friends and they think she's just doing it for attention and to make herself feel better. One friend says she's doing it to make herself more desirable. Idk to who (unless she's bi/lesbian) unless in general. Another thinks that a lie like this would just snowball out of control if I continue to pursue any interest. Which I do not and will not.

When we work together she has no problems teasing me or getting close. Yet if I need to grab something near her, her reaction is like she whiffed a 5 y/o streak of bo, I mean she's not gagging or anything but you know what I mean. Tries to distance herself as far as she can in the limited space she has. She also has noticed my attitude when we work together, as it has soured and I've been kinda prissy in general. Her interaction has been more... I don't wanna say openly but kinda like more friendly, as if she's trying to get me to lower my guard or something. I don't know what to do, friends say to cut contact asap but I can't since we work together. Since I'm the only one who starts convos on Discord that wouldn't be a problem.",22Nov2020,1
418," 

First, I want to say that I know that I am overthinking this. I know this is a long story, and I know that I act very immaturely in parts of this. My immaturity might be part of the issue to begin with.

I am in general, a people person, good at reading people’s emotions etc. But for the life of my I don’t get this guy.

I (f/twenties) started a new job in August. My coworker (m/twenties) is physically out of my league. We didn’t speak much for the first week. But when I went to be friendly and introduce myself more personably to him and another female coworker who just started we spoke about a few personal things and while we were on the subject of significant others he asked me if I had a type, if I was his type and if I was easy. I was really thrown off by this and said that I just met him and so I had no idea if he was my type.

A few weeks later the other female coworker told me to ask him if he was interested in her. She’s a bit younger and for some unknown reason I agreed to this. When I asked to speak with him alone he got very nervous. Then he brought her with him for ‘backup’ even though she knew what I was doing. Eventually I got him alone and asked him for her. He was shocked, said he would never get with a coworker and we moved on.

He Dm’d me a few times on insta during this.

Over the next few weeks he and I struggled as coworkers. I texted him a few times about missing deadlines and working with my students. He asked a bunch of people what I wanted from him. At this point a lot of my coworkers started to ask if we were dating since we acted so awkwardly around one another. I felt like this was due to our work struggles.

Then he bought me raid. I thought the company had bought it, however when I went to return it, he told me he had bought it for my office.

All during this I felt as if I were neutral to him, but he believed that I thought he was bad at his job. (he is)

One day he came to talk to me after work ended and asked me a bunch of personal questions and opened up a bunch to me, I thought it was really nice. The next day he told a coworker that he was super stressed after he left because he thought I didn’t like him due to his views (not true). I told him later that I enjoyed our talk and it made me view him more positively.

The female coworker who had a crush on him was upset that he and I were bonding and convinced me that he said something bad about me. In a VERY VERY immature moment I said something rude to him, we worked it out and moved on. The next day he texted me to travel safely to an event that I was going to.

Move forward a few weeks and he and I once again have some differences at work. He texts me a long apology. I don’t respond because it felt unnecessary. Three days later he tells me he thinks I’m mad at him and that he has never met anyone in his life that gives him anxiety. We continue on.

I decided to olive branch him and ask him to help me with something at work. He agrees. During this time the female coworker asks him to hang outside of work. He says no, then comes over to me and says that he wouldn’t hang out with a coworker outside of work because it can get messy. I agree with him, but think it’s a weird thing for him to say to me since I didn’t ask.

He helps me after work and its fine. He is very nice and walks me out at the end and doesn’t leave until I leave. While he was helping me we talk about our personal lives a little and I mention a man I’ve been seeing and he gets really excited and starts calling him a bunch of pet names. Ex: Spencer (Yeah, my man SPENCE BOY)

We have a work group text. All my coworkers said happy birthday in the group text. He texts me separately. Then after work he texts me (first personal, non work related texts) asking me about my day and encouraging me to drink. It felt like it could be flirty, but was probably just nice.

During the down times he and I have a very neutral personal relationship and semi-stressful work one. Like I said earlier I tend to get along with most people and understand my relationships with them. However, this guy drives me crazy because I don’t know what he’s doing or why our coworker relationship is not easy. I feel like he doesn’t like me and it drives me crazy",22Nov2020,1

It wasn’t until about 2 weeks ago where I caught myself starting to have feelings for her, at the time I didn’t know if she had a boyfriend or not so I just continued talking to her figuring that I’d find out in due time (as of right now I’m still not 100% sure but what I’m about to get to gives me the idea that she doesn’t) but about a week ago she started being a bit more touchy than usual, not anything major but like when I go to the kitchen to ask her about her day she’ll come around to tell me and lean her head on my shoulder/chest, she also tends to get really close to me when we stand side by side to one another and I’ve been getting really good vibes from her that she’s at least the slightest bit interested in me. 2 days ago me and her were closing up the bar and she said to me “hey i noticed we don’t ever close together... like we don’t see eachother as much as we should” (she normally works until 6pm and I normally go into work at 3/4pm) she said this to me right next to our GM and he chimed in and said “Ah the two star-crossed lovers” her and I just kind of laughed it off, but from the corner of my eye I could see her looking at me (couldn’t tell if she was smiling because she had a mask on) but I have a really good feeling about her and the situation as a whole, i live in a small town down in Texas and nobody here has really ever caught my eye the way she has, I find myself thinking about her so much that when I’m out with friends or at work I’ll tune things out (a bit weird but hey simp city central amirite) I guess I just need to find the guts to ask her out, I work with her in a few hours and I’m planning on doing it today if everything goes well, I guess this post is less about advice and more to see what you guy’s take is on it, any words of encouragement will be greatly appreciated, as well as any words of advice.

424,Anyone else going through this right now? It all started to be this bad at the start of October. I was about to fall asleep one night when I lost my breath and my heart rate was beating over 200 according to my watch. It has done that every night for a week so far. It has calmed down a ton right now but I’m still anxious and super stressed out all the time. I went to the doctors for it recently and he said to eat healthier and walk around more but I’ve been doing that more and it’s still the same. I can’t even take showers or else I will have a major panic attack. I’m afraid to take medicine cause I’m afraid to get suicidal thoughts more and also more panic attacks from it. I did have two heart surgery’s which makes it even worse but again my doctor said everything was ok.,22Nov2020,1
425,"I originally posted about this issue in r/AmITheAsshole and a few people suggested posting in any of the advice subreddits. So here I am.

Context: 

When hubs was 17, his mom decided to adopt a child. The adoption worked out and they got a 5-month old girl who had been abused by her birth parents. This adopted child (K) is dearly loved by everyone in the family. 

Unfortunately, a few years later, his mom filed for divorce and left the family. 6 months after the divorce, she remarried and together with her new husband (Mr L), they are raising little K. The family’s theory is that she adopted K to somehow save herself from doubting her happiness in marriage with his dad. The adoption bliss did not save their marriage. It’s been 3/4 years since the divorce.

About K who’s almost 8: 

• Though smart and intelligent, she has difficulties with studying. We were informed recently that she’ll be held back a year at school because she’s not achieving the requirements of her grade. Teachers, FIL, and I (I have ADD) see ADHD symptoms. She used to take meds for symptoms of that sort but they weren’t slow release and it affected her so she stopped. But it’s up to MIL and Mr L to get it checked out. 

• She’s been moved around a lot. Schools, states, etc. So she’s had little stability. 

• doesn’t like Mr L that much, in fact we believe she’s scared of him.

About MIL and Mr L: 

• MIL has never really been good at managing finances. When she was still married to FIL, he made sure that they didn’t screw up financially. 

• Mr L is not great at finances either. 

• MIL recently racked up a huge debt. 

• Mr L hasn’t kept a job for at least a year in a long while. 

• MIL is a pre-school teacher and is the sole stable financier of the family.

(Eg: MIL got half of FIL’s pension from the divorce. In 1-2 years, all that money was used up. K didn’t get a lot of good clothes and toys. So my FIL gave MIL and Mr L more money for K. MIL ended up only getting one new set of clothes for her and the rest was used for their personal expenses.)

(Eg2: MIL and Mr L didn’t make it to our wedding a few months ago because they used up their savings to move from another state after Mr L resigned from his job. MIL only informed us the day before travels. The rest of the family was pissed about their poor planning. MIL is back to being a pre-school teacher, while Mr L is claiming to be starting a new business...but we’re pretty sure he’s bumming as well.)

So basically, getting an ADHD diagnosis (or any diagnosis) might not happen any time soon. 

My husband and I are heartbroken to hear about all of this, and we feel kinda powerless in this situation even though we have the knowledge and training to prove that it’s just dysfunctional.

How should we go about addressing this?

TL;DR: MIL and new husband’s way of raising adopted child is concerning and we need advice on how to address this.

When i was a senior in high school, i decided that i wanted to become either a Preschool or Kindergarten teacher for a career. I've always adored children and i really want to teach them and help them grow to be good people. But there's sort of something that's stopping me: Most people i know. Over the years i've really loved children and adored their company and being around them. People and most friends i know have noticed this and flat out tell me that i'm a Pedo and a child molester, and that really hurts and puts me down. I've never put my hands on a child even once. Sure, iv'e wiped food from their mouths with a cloth with the cloth covering my hand, but that's it. People always call the children i'm around and help ''Jailbait'', and ''Pedo vibes'' right to me and it makes my heart sink every single time.

Whenever i tell my friends and people i know i want to become a Preschool/Kindegarten teacher, they tell me ''Oh don't, that's weird'' or ''That's creepy''. I've heard my own brother talking behind my back calling me a pedo and that crosses the line. I'M NOT A FUCKING CHILD MOLESTER. I'M NOT A PREDATOR. I've always wanted to teach because honestly, i feel as if i'ts been in my blood for a long time. Men get treated so harshly when it comes to this sort of thing. What do you guys think? Should i get my degree and become a teacher? Or are they right? I honestly don't know what to think anymore.",22Nov2020,1

This situation is killing me and it’s terrible all around for everyone else too. 

Very long story that I’ll try to keep short, my parents have been relying financially on me and my sister for at least a decade. We’ve always been their safety net as their money roller coaster crashed frequently. My parents are unstable to say the least. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on moving trucks, bail outs, storage units, and getting them out of trouble when there massive house was foreclosed on last year (this is not their first foreclosure, this is a chronic problem). Now we pay their rent, their bills (including 1000s of dollars on payment plans because of what they owe), their groceries, the list goes on. I know we sound like the world’s biggest enablers but we do not have it in our DNA to Iet our 60+ parents become homeless and/or hungry. 

My parents have no concept of money. They never seek help- we can’t get to the bottom of it but we think they’re ashamed to get government assistance but it really is hurtful that they rather take from their daughters who are both starting families of their own. 

Both I’m sure are eligible for disability. Both have heart problems and are truly in the middle of mental health crises. My mom has horrible knees that she’s had surgeries on. My mom is employable in the restaurant industry and retail but she is also high risk for COVID-19 complications. My dad is not employable, a once successful business man, he is now a barely functioning shell of himself. It is devastating.

We think my dad intentionally botched the SNAP benefits application/interview. My sister helped with the application but then it was up to him to see it through with their landlord and the interview. That was out of our hands and he has been vague about it ever since. We were left with a complete lack of understanding about how two people with $0 to their names could be rejected. 

How do we get our parents assistance when they don’t want it? Can I apply for them and take the process from A-Z? I know it should be their choice but when they’re hurting me and my sister so badly financially I feel like we should have some say in them getting government assistance. 

We are so desperate for help. I’m so tired. Stressed. Pregnant. And BROKE. I would so appreciate hearing advice if anyone has any.

So pretty much my new boyfriend (male 21) and I started sleeping together last week. We have a lot of sex, multiple times per day.

He was a virgin before we met but he’s pretty good in bed now so I love sleeping with him

Anyway he said that his dick hurts and that he needs a break, but he keeps on initiating. He sucks my boobs, feels all down there and goes down on me. Then of course we end up sleeping together. He’s even woken me up in the middle of the night so we can do it. But then complains after saying that we’re doing it too much. 

It just feels unfair what should I do? I can’t just cut him off sexually and I still enjoy sleeping with him but he makes me feel guilty",22Nov2020,1

430,"Hello everyone,
First of all I am not doing this for upvotes. I have never posted on this sub but some people may think J am making this up for karma. I’m not. Don’t even bother upvoting this, I just need some advice.

My friend has been really depressed recently. We are both 13 years old, and no matter what I do to try and cheer him up, nothing works. I have assured him many times that if he ever needs somebody to talk to, he can talk to me, and he does talk to me about his feelings regularly, but I just can’t seem to make him feel better. 

I am no psychologist (obviously) so I don’t know exactly how I can help him. I, along with many of our mutual friends, have tried to persuade him into going to a therapist, but the problem is that he has done just that. He has been to a therapist before, and according do one of our mutual friends, his therapist argued with him and did not help him one bit. He dislikes therapists and psychologists now.

I have searched on the internet for ways to help depressed and unhappy people, but, as expected, it was filled with websites of online therapists. I have already mentioned that he does not like therapists. He even nicknamed himself to ‘I need a friend not a therepist’ on Discord. 

We have a group chat sort of setup on our Discord where we can talk about our feelings and try to help one another, but in reality none of us are experts. We don’t know what we’re doing. Today we were all trying to cheer him up, but he continuously brought up the fact that he thought his life was meaningless and that he would kill himself if he did not have friends like us. 

From what I gathered from talking to him, at his old school he was bullied over stupid things (taking another kid’s chair, for example) and did not have many friends. I did not have many friends at my old school either, so I tried to relate and tell him that his new friends care dearly about him (they do), but he didn’t really listen. His past makes him unhappy I think, but what I’m doing to encourage him to move on doesn’t seem to be working.

Today I decided that what I was doing to try and help him was not working. I tried to cheer him up in the group chat, but another member told me that it wasn’t that simple. She’s right. It isn’t that simple. I realised that I what I was doing was not helping, and so now I am looking for advice from Reddit.

So, in short, how can I cheer up a depressed friend over Discord without a therapist?",22Nov2020,1
431,"So I met this guy a few months ago, we are in the same cohort, same classes in everything. We used to talk about everything, shared a lot of secrets, time flies when we talk we used to talk until 4 or 5 am despite the amount of uni workload we have to do. We help each other a lot. We are so much compatible and shares almost the same values in everything except he's agnostic and I'm Catholic. I like how he's really smart, kind, humble, I do find him cute but I guess I'm not sure if I'm sexually/physically attracted just yet. He's really popular in our year because he's the most generous person and likes sharing his beautiful and amazingly organised notes. He makes the lecturers' complicated workings and scribbles make so much easily understandable. He's the reason why we all understand the concepts. If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be able to grasp the lessons faster and easier. 

Anyway, he seems really great. However, I did not think of him of anything in a romantic way. We did talk about our cohort and who we find attractive. I mentioned I found his friend cute because of his smile bla bla. Also, when I talk about other guys in our group chat he doesn't respond or he asks 'so why are we talking about him again?' so yeah he becomes distant then we would change the topic. He started to reply coldly ever since. 

Now I'm thinking despite the amount of deadlines we had, we managed to talk all day and all night about almost everything and played games as well. 

But now, our exams have finished I thought we would talk more but we don't. Now that we don't have much to worry about, no things to do it's when the convo died. I guess I don't know if I miss talking him or if maybe I like him?

We mostly spend time together online because I rarely go to uni and when I go, I don't hang out with him. It does seems like I was avoiding him because of one thing we talked about which made me uncomfortable. He saw me in uni and greeted me and I greeted him back but I was stupid and sat quite far away from him even when there was a seat beside him. I saw him pulled the seat out next to him for me to sit but my friend told me 'let's sit there' and I followed her. He was talking to his friends and I can see him looking at my way and then we both avoid eye contact. We used to be like super close both online and in person but ever since that conversation about our secrets, we kinda drifted apart. I know it's my fault because it did seem like I was avoiding him in person. His texts are now just all about academics related or workshop related. He doesn't initiate conversations about personal life or what's up or asks questions or whatever. 

We talked about meeting up for his birthday but he doesn't seem to bring it up again. It feels like he doesn't want to celebrate it anymore? He's used to just having family dinners but I'm not sure if I should bring it up again? 

Tomorrow, we are meeting up for workshop but I'm kinda anxious to see him again because he seemed distant now. I don't want to make him feel like I was avoiding him because of what we talked about. He has like self-esteem issues and so am I. He never had a gf before and never asked anyone out. I wish I acted more natural after we spilled secrets 'cause he probably thought I was judging him which made him more distant now. He doesn't seem to have a lot of female friends as well and I'm scared I pushed him away. 

I acted the same online as if nothing happened. But since then, he stopped initiating conversations about personal life, games, memes, etc. 

I don't want things to change between us, I want our closeness back. I think about him sometimes but not all the time. I like how we think the same and very compatible. I enjoy talking to him but I guess I don't get butterflies or stuff like that. I'm kinda sad he doesn't message as much as he used to.

434,"Hi guys, I'm writing this frustrated at myself because I just cannot make myself wake up unless it's life or death. I'll wake up to get to work but only at the very latest I possibly can to not be late.

Friday night I stayed up until 4am to spend time with my Fiance in NYC over video chat. Went to sleep. Woke up without an alarm at 12.

Last night (Saturday) I went to sleep at 11, wanting to get up early to do some household jobs that needed doing. Set alarm for 8 &amp; 8.30. The alarm for 8 went off and I went back to sleep and missed the second alarm, woke up at 11.30. Now I'm sat here thinking I might as well have just stayed up until 4 if all it was going to be was an extra half hour because I missed out on seeing my partner.

Advice like ""go to sleep at 11 every night"" won't work because then I will never see my partner at all because of time difference and sleep schedule.

438,"I got my first job at staples a few months ago and I love it. I’m only in high school and had no prior work experience but they took a chance on me. I don’t have the best relationship with everyone there but it’s especially bad with my manager, which I consider the most important one. He’s very nice to me and is always smiling, but there are a lot of incidents where I feel like he was very disappointed.

The other day a customer went up to me asking about a sale, and my manager was right there. I didn’t know about the sale. I stuttered and just froze. He had to step in and help the customer out.

Another incident was when my friends surprised me by showing up at my workplace. I didn’t really stay professional because the store was closing soon so I was relaxing a bit. I lost track of a cart I was pushing around, it was headed towards the end of an aisle and almost knocked things over. I got to it before that happened but when I turned around I saw him shaking his head.

They’ve been giving me less shifts, and the tasks aren’t too difficult (I still mess up). I’m pretty good at my job and my mistakes aren’t major, but I’m still replaceable at this point.

439,"I feel a deep, inert disconnection between my body, my reputation, and my desires. Everything about who I am and how people perceive me feels totally detached from who I'd like to be. It feels soul-crushing.

I am a 14-year-old, intellectually gifted, Sephardic Jewish-Czech boy with Asperger's Syndrome. Every adult and teacher I've ever known since elementary school loves me. ""Brilliant,"" ""genius,"" ""talented,"" etc. It can be flattering, yes, but sometimes it feels alienating.

A couple months ago, I was sick, and didn't attend school for a few days. My science teacher told me that his class was basically collapsing while I wasn't there, because no one else would give the same long, detailed, articulate answers I give. No one would raise their hand or answer questions, so the class was hardly functioning.

I guess people also seem to think I look handsome or beautiful, although I don't see it. Every girl I know fixates on my brown, curly hair, every boy I know seems possed that I tower over them, and apparently I have really good facial hair and an idyllic jawline. But god, I fucking loathe just about every aspect of my body.

I hate how large my skull is, yet small my face is. I feel like my skull looks like a lemon, and I hate how big my hands are. I want to be clean shaven and wish I didn't have facial hair. I really want a vagina and breast, and a plump butt.

I despise my skintone. I wish I has southeast Asian skin. I wish my hair was long, flowing, and black, as opposed to puffy, brown, and curly. I wish I could dye my hair partially pink and wear girly clothes like skinny jeans, overalls, Converse shoes, Vans, boots, heels, leggings, denim shorts, tutus, dresses, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, jewelry, etc.

Every adult in my life, from teachers to my father, expect Einsteinian levels of intellect out of me. Since a relatively young age I've held an interest in world history and later philosophy, geopolitics, and economics, so now I'm expected to be a Nietzsche-esque thinker. At fucking 14. And I've had these standards imposed on me for years. I just want to have fun and feel normal.

At 14, I still possess an attachment to toys, cotton candy, sweets, carnivals, plushies, and video games, although I push it down and pretend to be mature. All I want is to ride a big, inflated hoppity hop ball or play with Pokemon cards while watching Adventure Time, all while being a pretty southeast Asian girl.

I have a plan to manifest these desires. I plan on going to college after graduating high school in June 2025, and studying education, atomic physics, world history, philosophy, and possibly microbiology and nutrition studies at my local community college. Then I plan on getting a job as a history teacher at my local schools district.

Before graduating from high school, however, I plan to start working at AMC Theatres or some other local company hiring and start saving money to move to a more Liberal area when I'm 24 or so.

I recently started working in the video game industry as a project coordinator (basically producer but really really junior). I have an engineering degree in aerospace in one of the best European school and I decided after three 6-months internships and a first job in consulting in the aerospace industry, I decided to quit my job (in February) and apply to jobs in the video games industry. I landed a job in a big studio in Europe, I like the job but it just feels like the video game industry is becoming more about business and making money than creativity and entertaining. I know I was naive.

So I am asking advices because I am constantly stressed and worried about my career and my future. I don’t know what I want to do after.

I thought I would continue on my job for at least a year and a half so I would have 2 years of experience and then speak with my managers about future evolutions.
Moreover, the best jobs and studios are not in the country I live, in general it’s Canada or the US and my gf of 7 years is clearly not willing to go live in Canada, which I would like to.. I think this is adding stress to my situation.

447,"I recently just  got out of a relationship that I really didn’t need to be in. I tend to jump in and situations with people without taking the proper time I need to heal. I’ve been self medicating through sex and relationships. I’m at the point now where I’m realizing that it’s doing more harm than good. Basing all of this off the trauma I’ve endured growing up, looking and searching for love in all the wrong places my actions have led me to being at my lowest that I’ve ever been. The next couple of months are going to be hard for me, but I want turn my life around. I don’t want to continue to be this broken girl. I’m really going to try and be alone, no sex, just trying to work on myself. I thought long and hard last night and I realize that I feel trapped, doing the same things everyday, going through the same routine. How can I heal when I’m surrounded by the same people and the same temptations. I want new beginnings, I want to start fresh, I want to move to a new area. 
 

I’m seeking the advice on where to move and which states are a good place to live and potentially raise a family. Also the next few months are going to be hard for me any advice on how I can make it less miserable?",22Nov2020,1
448,"I was a really happy guy until this year, one awful thing keeps happening right after another

The first thing that really messed me up, was my ex who was with me for 3 years, left me for someone else she met. This MESSED me up because I loved her more than anything else in the world. To say I was depressed and insane would be an understatement. It doesn't help that I checked her social media (i know you should never do that) but I saw she is still with that guy, they have a house together and shes pregnant. 

Since she broke up with me, I couldn't afford to live on my own so i had to move back in with my mom. A month after i moved back in with my mom, she found out she has cancer all over her body. Shes been on chemo this whole time, but the cancer is still slowly spreading and the thought of losing her rips me apart. She probably doesn't have too much time left. This has been hard on everyone in my family. 

Yet another problem. I have been applying to jobs for months so I can get my own apartment and try to restart my life. I can't get a job to hire me that will pay enough to get me a 1 bedroom apartment no matter how hard I try. I'm so desperate for a decent job.

To add onto all of that. I dont have 1 single friend. The only people that ive gotten text from since March is family. 

Everything is falling apart and i can't fix any of it. I cant dig myself out of this hole no matter how hard i try. Ive been giving it my all for months. I really really want to give up and end myself. NOTHING is working out for me. I thought that the idea of suicide would go away by now, but it's staying. I hate my life. I'm so miserable, lonely, and hopeless. Everything is falling apart and i can't seem to fix any of it. 

Please, I need someone to share words with me. I really need it. I dont think I can stand all of this much longer. I'm trying.",22Nov2020,1
449,"so I am a 16 year old girl and I work at a local family business. my boss who is an engaged 37 year old man very often makes distinct comments about me that I don't whether I should just brush off or actually be concerned about. my boss has always made comments about me being a pretty young woman and such which never really bothered me, but recently I've heard him say things that are a little weird...I'm just going to list some things below:

my boss to a coworker: ""now don't go saying inappropriate things around charlotte (me), I don't want you corrupting my minors, if anyone is corrupting charlotte it's going to be ME""

my boss also often looks at me from a distance a lot and will whisper things to his friends that also work there, sometimes I hear my name vaguely in his conversation and then he and whoever he's talking to (which is always a male) giggle or nudge each other. the other day i wore shorts into work for the first time because the weather is heating up and the first thing he said to me was ""fuck I feel like every time I see you you just look more and more like an 18 year old young woman"" and someone yelled out ""well she's not so don't go looking at her"" and he just laughed and brushed it off. Later on that day he said ""nice work charlotte"" and a female co worker as a joke said ""nice ass charlotte"" and my boss replied ""well I wasn't going to say anything but..."" and laughed and looked at me. Again that day he was talking to one of my male co workers (geoff) who mentioned that I should wear longer pants as a joke and my boss said right in front of me "" nah charlotte looks fucking HOT"" (the way he said was as if he was being really genuine like his tone of voice was really serious as if he was talking to a close friend - rather than just making a joke), then directed at me ""she's a little hottie!"" and smiled which made me really uncomfortable. A bit after that geoff was like (as a joke) ""well imma wear my little shorts tomorrow then since SHES getting all this attention"" and my boss in response yelled across the shop ""no geoff you can't compare to charlotte, NO ONE can compare to charlotte"" and was laughing. 

the next day I came into work he raises his eyebrows at me from the car and when i come out he says "" what's cooking good looking"" ""look she's got the new hairstyle and everthing! (talking to his friend yelling out)"" 

aside from this he's just incredibly protective of me like whenever someone jokes about me having a boyfreind he goes ""what? WHAT?"" (in a joking tone mind you) ""who is this guy?"" ""do I need to beat anyone up?"" and one time I was getting harrassed by this boy online and he wouldnt stop calling me so my boss kept asking (genuinely) if I wanted him to go over to the boys house and beat him up or 'fix the situation"" and etc etc y'all get the idea. and he always just says really subtle comments about protecting me or my appearance and stuff all the time and I don't know what he means by it as he is a really playful person and jokes around a lot... but he never says these types of things to the other girls that work there only me. Do you think I should be concerned or is it nothing? If anyone could please respond as soon as possible that would be greatly appreciated",22Nov2020,1
450,"So long story short my bf and I got a place and we’ve been living together for 2 years. I’m 24 and he’s 27, so he’s a lot more mature. 

5 months ago during Covid my boyfriend’s friend from college asked if he could move in.

We live in Hawaii and he was coming from Maryland. 

He’s a 26 y/o medical lab technician and they used to know each other in the fraternity they were in so I was like hell yeah he seems cool. Since he’s my bf’s age maybe he’ll be super chill. 

So within a month, all that started changing. After he finished his 2 week quarantine, he started going on tinder and talking to girls.

He eventually got banned from tinder because a lot of girls were reporting him for harassment.

He had no luck so ended up using Hinge. While on hinge he pissed this girl off so she ended up posting OUR address on Instagram, telling her followers to come and beat him up.

After all this failure, he finally found a hinge girl that apparently was a prostitute.

He begged us for him to bring her over. And of course we were not okay with a prostitute coming over at 1am. 

We set the ground rules straight. That were not okay with random girls he met 15 minutes okay to show up inside our house at 1am. 


We begged him to stop sending our address out to random strangers he’s never met online . But he felt like we were being unreasonable.

Last week, my friend wanted to sleep with him, so she ended up staying over.
He ended up not stopping when she said no, and she had to grab her stuff and run out of the house. 
I talked to her about how we can file a police report if she wants. And she just didn’t want anyone to get in trouble.

So naturally. I’m already pissed at this guy, I hate him. 
We got into a fight about it, and he just said “it’s not my fault, I was drunk, it’s YOUR fault that happened to your friend because you didn’t tell me to stop drinking”. 

I sincerely wanted to murder him. 
Because I realized what a shitty person he is.


I tried to reason with him that it’s not okay to bring random girls over because so much drama has happened and the police were involved. 

And his reasoning was. Why? You bring your friends over why can’t I bring random girls over?
I told him, because those are people I trust. I could leave a 100 dollars out and I know they would let me know. You want me to trust a girl you have never met while you’re sneaking her in at 3:30 in the morning? 

We had a fight. He ending up saying “this is my house too”. He’s not on the lease and has been staying with us for 5 months. 
But it’s not. We bought this house. 
He has never bought a plate or a spoon for the house. The only thing he bought was a computer desk for his room that I furnished.

I went outside late at night last night to use the restroom, and he’s up lighting candles. And I was like, what are you doing it’s 1am? 
So he goes, a girl is coming over. And I was like who?
He told me, you don’t know her.

I told my boyfriend about it, and that morning he comes into our room and goes 

“Btw your gaming station in the living room? I took it and put it in my room”

We didn’t understand why he kept taking our stuff and putting it in his room without asking. He really treats it like it’s his house and it’s his stuff so he doesn’t have to respect us.

When he was 19, he had room mates for 10 months. Then he moved back to his parents house. He’s always talking about how he wishes we were cooler, his room mates when he was 19 always had “bitches over”.

But we’re 26/27 now. Not frat boys. 

Talking to him hasn’t worked.

So we talked to our friends to see if they’ll let him rent out a room. And since they know him and how he is, they all instantly refused because they don’t want to deal with this.

I talked to my bf about kicking him out, but he just says “he’ll learn someday, I’ll kick him out when he’s back on his feet give it another half a year”.

But I can’t give it half a year, nobody will take him because nobody wants to deal with his shit, we can’t kick him out because he’s broke, and he just keeps getting drunk and sneaking random strangers home at night when we’re asleep. 
And when I bring up, what if my stuff gets stolen. He just says. Then I’ll just give you money for it, what’s the problem. 

I honestly. Don’t know what the fuck to do.

My friends hate him and avoid him, my bf’s friends refuse to even let him stay with them.

I feel like it’s a burden we can’t get rid off. 
I’m sorry if this is sooooo long. But I’m so exhausted from this.",22Nov2020,1
451," For context, She wants to move house (I'm fine with that, but I'd prefer to stay)

So me and my mum have this ongoing argument because she doesn't listen properly to what I say and it feels like she always says she's there for me but never has time to talk.

For example, a week or so ago I was talking to her about how I'm having a problem with authority recently (mostly with teachers) and I think it's because when we were homeschooled I taught everything to myself and pretty much had all control over my learning and she never got involved or told me to do anything. I emphasised that I was fine with this because I now knew that I could be independent and do things for myself but it's created this issue at school. 
A few days later, I don't remember the context, she said something about how I said I wanted her to tell me what to do more when that's basically the opposite of what I said.

Some examples of the manipulation:
Everytime we argue she says that she's just going to have to move out and leave me and my sister with my dad then storms off upstairs so that she ultimately wins the argument
I said that when I came downstairs to make lunch a few days ago she was on the phone and I wanted to talk to her. She starts insisting that that was closer/further away than I was saying it was (she went back and forth between the two) and basically implying that I was either being over dramatic or making it up,  pretty sure that's gaslighting

But the thing is, sometimes we get along really well, so I don't want to completely cut her off or anything. Also, I'm underage so I can't move out I have at least another 2 or 3 years until I can leave

Any advice?",22Nov2020,1
452,"I feel a deep, inert disconnection between my body, my reputation, and my desires. Everything about who I am and how people perceive me feels totally detached from who I'd like to be. It feels soul-crushing.

I am a 14-year-old, intellectually gifted, Sephardic Jewish-Czech boy with Asperger's Syndrome. Every adult and teacher I've ever known since elementary school loves me. ""Brilliant,"" ""genius,"" ""talented,"" etc. It can be flattering, yes, but sometimes it feels alienating.

A couple months ago, I was sick, and didn't attend school for a few days. My science teacher told me that his class was basically collapsing while I wasn't there, because no one else would give the same long, detailed, articulate answers I give. No one would raise their hand or answer questions, so the class was hardly functioning.

I guess people also seem to think I look handsome or beautiful, although I don't see it. Every girl I know fixates on my brown, curly hair, every boy I know seems pissed that I tower over them, and apparently I have really good facial hair and an idyllic jawline. But god, I fucking loathe just about every aspect of my body.

I hate how large my skull is, yet small my face is. I feel like my skull looks like a lemon, and I hate how big my hands are. I want to be clean shaven and wish I didn't have facial hair. I really want a vagina and breasts, and a plump butt.

I despise my skintone. I wish I had southeast Asian skin. I wish my hair was long, flowing, and black, as opposed to puffy, brown, and curly. I wish I could dye my hair partially pink and wear girly clothes like skinny jeans, overalls, Converse shoes, Vans, boots, heels, leggings, denim shorts, tutus, dresses, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, jewelry, etc.

Every adult in my life, from teachers to my father, expect Einsteinian levels of intellect out of me. Since a relatively young age I've held an interest in world history and later philosophy, geopolitics, and economics, so now I'm expected to be a Nietzsche-esque thinker. At fucking 14. And I've had these standards imposed on me for years. I just want to have fun and feel normal.

At 14, I still possess an attachment to toys, cotton candy, sweets, carnivals, plushies, and video games, although I push it down and pretend to be mature. All I want is to ride a big, inflated hoppity hop ball or play with Pokemon cards while watching Adventure Time, all while being a pretty southeast Asian girl.

I have a plan to manifest these desires. I plan on going to college after graduating high school in June 2025, and studying education, atomic physics, world history, philosophy, and possibly microbiology and nutrition studies at my local community college. Then I plan on getting a job as a history teacher at my local schools district.

Before graduating from high school, however, I plan to start working at AMC Theatres or some other local company hiring and start saving money to move to a more Liberal area when I'm 24 or so. But how can I feel better about this psychological disconnect I'm experiencing presently, until then?",22Nov2020,1

456,"So, I'm just gonna be real with everyone. I don't even know how to start this post, but I feel like I'm in over my head and need help. 

So, during the pandemic I've (21M) set up a OnlyFans site for myself and made a modest amount of money from it. It pays for WiFi and my gas money I need and that's about it. I don't do anything crazy, mostly just working out nude and some personalized videos for people if they request them.

Recently, I was contacted by a guy who claims to work ""in the porn industry."" He had seen some of my material and wanted to see if I was interested in doing like actual porn. I was not very comfortable with it at first. But after a few messages back and forth, we actually chatted over Zoom and he identified who he was pretty clearly. 

This all eventually ends with me saying yes and agreeing to the terms and signing a contract and whatnot. I read the contract thoroughly and it was basically just regular ""I won't sue you if I get hurt on the job"" type stuff. It wasn't legally binding me to do anything.

So we set a date for the thing and my contact transfers $1,200 to cover travel expenses. This is when I start to have second thoughts about it and start to talk about giving the money back/calling it even. This guy then tells me that the contract I signed was binding me to do this scene and I need to travel to NYC to shoot it. He says ""my bosses, not me"" could pursue legal action if I didn't. 

At this point I just want to be done with it all and not go through with this, but I'm also afraid I misread the contract I signed and I unintentionally signed up for this whole thing. I'm supposed to be in NYC by Tuesday. I can't take this to my parents because they'll judge me to no end and none of my friends know about the OnlyFans stuff so this is my only outlet. Please help me.",22Nov2020,1
457,"i’ve questioned my gender for years now, and finally felt comfortable just being non-binary. i was born female, have always had a feminine name that made me uncomfortable so i always went by different names online both for comfort and privacy reasons.

i started a new account on twitter back in may, going by a new name. i made a lot of friends on there and i became used to being called by that name, and it didn’t make me feel dysphoric. my irl (i’ll call her katie for the sake of the post) found my twitter through another irls insta acc and got on call with me, making fun of this name. it wasn’t even just like, teasing, it was fr serious. katie has always made like very subtle transphobic/homophobic remarks/jokes but always passed them off as jokes. 

the “jokes” about my name were brought up almost every call we were in for the next week before i just started leaving every time she started making them and she stopped for the time being. i became quickly uncomfortable with the name and started figuring out a new name i wanted to go by. changed my online profile so she couldn’t find it, and came out to the online twitter community i was in. i was accepted and it felt different because i wasn’t used to that at all. 

i suddenly got courage about a month ago to come out to a few closer irls as non-binary, and was mostly accepted except for the friend this post is about. i brought it up to katie in call while my mom was out, asking her if she could use they/them on me and was pretty much ignored. like she just stopped talking in the middle of the call and it was extremely awkward lmao. 

today, i announced causally to those closer irls i came out to that i was going by a new name. was accepted. got on a call with katie, and was greeted with more remarks and shit about the name i chose. i can imagine this will go on for a while. i just want to be accepted. i just want her to be accepting. how hard is it to go “oh cool. hey *new name*” and not make a huge deal out of it. am i asking for too much? 

katie is my closest friend. i talk to her for hours and hours everyday and she is the only one i have in my life currently.i genuinely enjoy our friendship. she makes me happy but the downside is well, all of this. we have a good friendship but she hates to talk about anything, serious. she avoid topics like that (which is fine but also bad for situations like these) and we mainly just fuck around on voice call on games. we’re both immature but we are close. i feel like i need to bring this up to her because i really hate dealing with this but i don’t know how. 

i hate confrontation and i hate trying to be bossy/bitchy and don’t want to seem like i’m trying to force her to call me a new name. but i don’t want to end up hating this new name and i don’t want to be misgendered and made fun of all the time. i don’t want to loose her. i’m sorry if this just sounds like dumb teen drama (which is definitely is) i just need advice on what to do. how do i bring it up? would kind of prefer to do it over text because i’m not out to my mom (homophobic and transphobic) and don’t want her to overhear.",22Nov2020,1
458,"A guy friend and I (F) were texting on messenger and I reacted with a raised brow emoji to something that he said because I was a bit confused as to what he meant and didn't know how to respond. 

He later clarified what he meant and said that he found the emoji kinda weird/funny-looking. Then, in the spur of the moment, I said ""no it looks better on apple HAHAHA, the android/fb emoji version looks sus af"". (emojis show up differently on apple and android phones btw and he uses an android phone). He then said ""wym it looks pre legit"" with a screenshot of the chat so I could see. And I said ""wait you're right, thought it looked different for some reason"" (In reality though, when I said better I meant it did a better job of conveying what I meant and when I said sus I was referring to the facial expression on the emoji, not android emojis in general, though I didn't clarify this). He didn't open my text after this and has left me on delivered for three days (he always used to open texts and respond within a few hours). 

For a bit of context, we met each other online and have only known each other for 8 months but have been texting pretty much every day up until recently. He's a nice guy from what I know and leaving a friend on delivered for a lengthy period of time doesn't seem like something he'll do.

An hour or so ago, I got a message on a social media platform I use. I only use this app for sexual stuff so I expected nothing else when replying to this message. They asked me if I was interested in money and I asked how much and what they want for it like I usually do. 

Excpet for the fact that they know me in real life. I blurred my profile picture enough that I thought I wasn't too recognizable but apparently I was because they asked me if my parents knew I let others pay for my body. They then proceeded to text me about how they knew me, texted me some key words (name, where i live etc) to show me that they're being serious. 

I don't know if they were trying to blackmail me or just wanted to tell my parents but I panicked, changed my profile picture, blocked them and deleted the entire app. 

They refused to tell me who they are so it could be anyone and I'm afraid of going to school tomorrow because what if they see me and they'll tell my parents? I don't want to get into trouble.

464," 

m from Singapore, which is a multi-racial country, so I have been introduced to many races and religions in my environment and it never has been a problem for me. chinese is a majority while indians are a minority.

And the problem is that -I really don't like how indian people, mainly men, act and how they are perceived by everyone else, which in turn makes me insecure of how other people perceive me. Many of the stereotypes I know of for indian men are- rapists, creepy, smelly, oily, tech support, only become engineers/doctors because of parents. And the shittiest part is that they are actually true. The news I see about India and the rapes going on. The way I see indian men eyeing hot girls on the train and staring at them, with no social decency, the coconut oil on their hair. and almost every indian i know is going to do computer science in uni.

and the shittiest part is that i am going to do computer science as well, despite me spending my life trying so hard to steer away from these stereotypes/conventions and try to be as 'non-indian' as possible. I'm not good at taking spices, and I have relatively light brown skin, so many of my friends say that Im a 'fake indian', and I honestly feel good when they don't associate me with other indians.

But I feel such shame or embarassment when someone asks me what Im doing for uni, and I have to say computer science, and they go 'of course'. I'm only doing it for the money and the skills it provides, not because my indian parents say so/ it's part of the culture.

I'm agnostic so it has led me to be against Indian traditions/culture as well, so indian women wearing saris or dressing up in cultural outfits is sort of a turn-off for me, and I'm unsure whether it's just not my type or it stems from my dislike/racism for indians as a whole. I know I shouldn't be this way and I know it has been the cause of some of my insecurity for what I do with my life, but I don't know what I can do to fix this mindset.

It feels like how other indians act are an extension of me, since I'm being forced or inadvertently placed in the same category as them. I've noticed that a lot of racial groups stick together here, malays stick with malay friends. chinese with chinese, tamil with tamil. but i always stay away from the indians and keep close to other races because quite frankly, i don't want to be grouped with them.

i know this is an unhealthy state of mind. please help.",22Nov2020,1

Since high school, I’ve been friends with this guy for about 6 years. We’ve always played video games, spend the night, eat at the same lunch, and often talked on the phone. The friendship to this day was awesome and i would do it all over again but now that we’re out of high school, things got worse.
Since I’m too poor to afford college, I started to work and save up money so I can get some education soon. I went from working at a grocery store, retail, and currently construction. I managed to buy a car and still live with family so it’s going well so far. As for my friend, he refuses to work and live his life as a homebody. Still lives with his parents as well but they don’t push him to get a job or an education, he just does what he wants. 
So as I worked, he often calls me to hop on and play online games with him even though he’s aware that im currently working. Sometimes when I get home I’m so tired and need some rest but he spams my phone to hop on and play video games. My friend will spam calls and texts until I answer which gets annoying. I do say “No, I’ll let you know soon” which temporarily works for a small amount of time then he gets back into spamming my phone. He expects me to be on Xbox with him even tho I’m at work, in a date, with family, running errands. It’s not only video games. He expects me to be on the phone, expects me to just drive at his parents house (he currently lives in another state), and expects me to always be there no matter what even though I say no. 
What makes matters worse is that we game share. Now that I work he begs for me to buy a video game so “we” can play it even though he will never spend a dime. Some games I do buy since admittedly I wanted them too, but my friend would later tell me “it sucks”. So i spent money on a multiplayer game that I thought both of us would enjoy and now I play it by myself. Every time I see a text “I know what game we can play” i roll my eyes and start an argument over him always begging for me to buy video games he won’t spend a dime on.
This went on for 3 years (i know stupid of me) and Lately I’ve been keeping my distance due to the fact I’m tired of dealing with my friend constantly wanting attention, give him what he wants, and overall begging. I get that this sounds like he is using he but I honestly think he lacks self awareness and doesn’t understand how annoying he is. When I do say no, he gets the hint but will act like an hour or 2 is appropriate to ask again. I’m not sure if I should cut him off or what. He is toxic in this regard but I wouldn’t say he’s a horrible person, just spoiled.

I'm so sorry this is basically just late night ramblings to get shit out of my brain. 

⚠️⚠️ Content Warning ⚠️⚠️ Su*c*de

So earlier this year my (22f, 21 at the time) cousin (21m) committed suicide. My brother and I live in a different city from the rest of our family (a 6hr drive) so we both found out when our dad called us that morning, like I literally woke up to my dad calling me to tell me. We flew home the next day to be with family and attend the funeral (New Zealand was in alert level 1 at that point and the funeral was allowed, although some family in Aussie couldn't make it). My cousin and I are only 7 months apart in age so we were really close growing up, best friends in primary, at each other's houses almost every afternoon after school etc, but in the past 4-5 years we grew apart a wee bit. You know, the usual suspects, different high schools, growing up, taking shit for granted. So I took the news quite badly. I have a multitude of different mental health issues, adhd, depression, anxiety etc. and it got in my head that if only I'd been around more I could've picked up on it (I couldn't) and maybe even stopped it (I wouldn't have been able to). My aunty is only a 2nd generation pakeha so she's very much in touch with more of the Māori traditions and so after he was embalmed he was in their 2nd lounge for about 3 days before the funeral, which meant that I was able to see him and say my goodbyes and sit with him and cry with my family. Which definitely helped. But now it's been 5 months (to the day, seeing as I'm writing this at 2:30am) and for the past 2 weeks or so I've been having dreams almost every night with him in them. Not even anything super profound. Just mundane stuff like wondering through a mall or taking the dogs for a walk. Yesterday was my 22nd birthday and it hit me real hard that with each day, our age gap is widening and he's gonna stay my baby cousin forever..

478,"When I moved countries at 14 I lost my friends and was never able to make new ones. I never went out and at school no guy ever stroke a conversation with me, I’ve also never been asked out or received a compliment from a guy. I got tired of it and got tinder, I met a guy and we were together for a month but he was too pushy about sex he wanted us to do it like in the woods or in a dark alley, when I said I wasn’t ready to do it so fast (I’m a virgin) he broke up.

I feel very distant to men, I feel like wherever I go there’s no guy who finds me pretty or attractive like to want to date me. I’m not remarkably attractive but I’m not ugly either, I have long hair, average face, I’m thin and have medium sized boobs. Now, since I was younger I did feel some attraction towards girls and I feel it is getting stronger now. Meanwhile my attraction to men... well I can see a guy and think he’s cute but I feel like he would never like me.

I’m confused I don’t know what to do. I have tinder but even if guys match with me, most don’t show much interest like when we’re chatting. I’m in college but everything is online. I would like trying my luck with girls but I don’t want to deal with having to come out to my family if someone saw my tinder profile and told them. So that’s what holding me back.

479,"Okay so, me and my ex broke up about 7 months ago, we had been dating for just shy of 2 years. We went through spells of talking and not talking through out this. For multiple reasons, one being he had a serious death in the family I helped him with. Because of that death he’s had to move and I also helped him with this. We’ve gone out to dinner a couple times and mostly whenever we talk it’s just like old friends. And I truly miss having him as a friend/confidant.

One of the dinners we had we were talking about us and what happened and everything. I told him I mostly missed him as a friend than a romantic partner and he seemed a little sad about this but said something like thanks for letting me know where I stand. And he said it was gonna take a long time to get over me. The last time I saw him to help him move he was making kind of pointed sexual jokes. “Don’t bring me a bottle (of liquor) unless you want it to turn into sex” and other things I won’t say here. I just kinda laughed along with them but they seemed dry and serious. I’m not gonna lie we had amazing sexual chemistry together, and I’ve missed it. At the end of the night I was leaving but stopped and asked if I could give him a hug, he said yeah and then we stood there and hugged for like 10 minutes just holding each other. It felt like my heart was gonna explode I was so nervous. When we pulled apart it was kinda seemed like we were both thinking the same, should we or shouldn’t we. He gave me a kiss on the cheek and said maybe I should leave. 

I messaged him when I got home, we lightly talked about it, just both kinda going “uh that was weird haha” but also he said he was trying to ‘leave the ball in my court’ cause he didn’t want to be pushy. It ended with us both kind of thinking we should think about this decision more. And that’s where I’m at. 

Basically I just want some advice on how to proceed from here? I’ve never been in this situation and I probably haven’t given enough detail. But I’m unsure what this all means and if I should or shouldn’t “hook up” with him? I want to but I don’t know if that’s actually the best decision, for either of us. 

Also I’ve neglected to say so far but there is a boy I’m casually seeing. I like him! Not sure how compatible we are to actually seriously date but I really enjoy his company and cuddling. I can tell he likes me. I’m also thinking about how hooking up with me ex could negatively impact that. I’m just confused, and don’t want to hurt anybody, or myself for that matter.",22Nov2020,1

484,"Hi guys. I desperately need advice. I am a 19 year old fresh graduate. I got my Bachelors way early (Class of 20). No commencement, nothing to commemorate it by at all because of course, COVID. I have felt depressed since my last semester of uni, peaking when I realized I had to spend my graduation alone. Both of my parents live in Asia (I live in the US with my brother). 

All my life, I have always always been working/studying. something. This is how I end up graduating at 19 anyway. So I got a job right off Uni. Arguably a good one. I’m an Operations Manager for a Non Profit. I make good money, I am 100% financially independent. But it is the most debilitating job. I don’t know if I’m just being a little bitch but I work from 6 am to 5 pm. Every. Single. Day. I get home exhausted as fuck. It’s definitely not a desk job, I run around a lot too during work so its both physically and mentally taxing. On top of that, I have been waking up at 3 am since I started my job to study for the GMAT since I plan to start graduate school in 2021. 

I am burnt out. I have come close to suicide way too many times. I have started seeing a therapist, something I am always been vehemently against for whatever reason. But I will literally die at my own hands without one. 

Maybe I wouldn’t have been this burnt out if things weren’t so lonely but it is. My supervisor takes advantage of me (won’t get into it too much because it’ll take too long), I only have a singular friend left, my boyfriend (all of my friends are in Seattle - where I am from, have graduated and moved on to different cities, or in Asia), which will soon move back to his hometown 3 hours away due to COVID not improving. My brother is also moving back to Asia in a few weeks so I will effectively and literally be alone.

My boyfriend, my pride and my own pursuit to independence have kept me going thus far. But I have no idea how much longer I can take it. Just a week ago, I purposely made myself sick. I ingested something I shouldn’t so I’d get sick but not exactly die, just so I can skip some days of work. The prospect of having to do this for some more months (until I start graduate school, makes me want to jump off my apartment building). 

My parents have given me a way out; move back to Asia to figure out my life. I won’t have to work or do anything. It’ll literally be a gap year until I move back to the US to start graduate school. Asia specifically because that’s where they are, where their house is, where they work. They won’t just let me stay here because there’s no way for me to keep paying for my apartment with no job. They can take care of me there. My only conflict is, I’ve lived in the US my whole life. I have a life here, my boyfriend is here, my friends are here (albeit in different cities) and most importantly, I have a job. Doesn’t matter that it’s a bad one, its a job that I can say I have. The job that is a tangible pay off of everything I’ve worked for thus far; being financially independent at 19. 

Should I move back anyway? Should I leave it all behind for the sake of my sanity?",22Nov2020,1

489,"Hello...! o/ Uhm. This is my first time on Reddit... I've never really posted about myself online as I value privacy... o-o But there came a moment in life where it seems as though no one is on my side. See, I sort of feel trapped...? I really wanted to seek some advice before I make a move. But the thing is, I want to know if I can chat to anyone or even find a group of people who are having similar issues to myself. Argh... D:&lt;

In short, I don't believe in anything as of this moment. I do believe in a God, but that's about it. Thing is, the family I grew up in... They very much adore religion and believe that it is a peaceful way to live. I respect that, was even a devout follower myself. Until a day came where I realised how lost I felt. :') Now, this isn't about religion per say, but that does tie into one of my problems.  xP I don't want to be too specific but then again... How will I find others who could potentially provide me with some good advice? \^\^""\*sigh...\*

Let me try to explain... I want to leave. I would like to leave the religion as well as the family. Well, I have already left the religion, but I have not really mentioned it to anyone. I want to live a happy cosy life with a couple of people I have grown to love and trust---We call ourselves a family. A family isn't about those who share the same blood as you, its about who loves you and who you love... Right? \^\^ So, I would ever so dearly love to make it one day, to move away from this place and live with them. But my blood family would never accept such a thing. Again, I don't want to explain this in too much detail, as I truly fear of being caught...! \^\^"" In their eyes, it is wrong to have close friends of the opposite gender. There, I said it. .\_. But! We view ourselves as a family, and we have a very loving relationship despite what others may think. In my blood family, hugs and physical contact are a foreign concept. It is seen as awkward. Some nights I lay awake, desperately clinging to the blankets, telling myself over and over that I hate being touched... Because I only crave it so much.

My goodness, this is turning into a rant...! Uhm. I just need to know if there are other people living under the roof of their parents, who sort of... Pretend to follow the religion that they were raised up with? \^\^"" I know this sounds incredibly terrible, but... It is safer than even trying to explain to them what my true thoughts are. I ask that people respect if I choose not to disclose some information which I may perceive as personal, everyone has a right to keep some things to themselves. And uhm... Please no hate...! &gt;\_&lt; I understand that some people may have different opinions which are totally okay! But... I really dislike arguments, whether it be in real life or over the internet... I just want to be able to read some advice, maybe even comforting words...? I'm not too sure what will happen to this post... I do hope that no one sort of, shares it around if possible but... What can I say? Once something is on the internet, its there until the end of time. :"")

Uhm. I don't know how to end this post. .\_. I don't even know how people will respond, or if anyone would see at all...! The situation is... Rather big. And heavy. There is no other way of putting it. So err... Apologies if I seem a tad bit awkward... I hope that... Everyone is having a good day? If not...! Have a cookie or some tasty gummies! :) And uhm. Maybe go and create something! Uh. I dunno, do something good for yourself! \\o/

490,"So basically, I'm a 14 year old male. I live with my family in a secluded town, am home schooled and only have my sister and 2 cats to keep me company. My whole family, as well as extended family are religious. Ever since 2 years ago my beliefs have no longer lined up with my family's. They force me to do all of the optional stuff in ""my religion"" and don't let me have any privacy as well as not letting me have online friends, which is especially bad because I have no access to the outside world. 

It was all fine and dandy pretending and all, until a few nights back. My family are VERY superstitious about every symbol, they're homophobic AS WELL AS transphobic (i'm not, don't worry). A few nights back, I was simply making 3 tacos and crisping them on a pan (a hell of an opening, I know) and then my sister walks up to me. The tacos are arranged in a triangle. I say that it looks like the Triforce from Zelda, and then she starts going on about how the Triforce represents the illuminati and evil spirits (keep in mind, they also think that eyes represent evil spirits even though they're part of the human body).

From physical abuse, emotionally and mentally, because of that, I feel extremely detached from my parents, especially my dad, I'm also quite young (14) and that could be a reason too.

I used to be this shy kid and now I'm quite rude to my parents, like the time I accidentally broke my dad's headphones and he kinda got mad about it, it reminded me of what happened back in the day, but I was just stoic when he gets mad, like nothing happened.

Early this year I was depressed (though I'm not sure because I'd rather not diagnose myself). I literally didn't give a damn if you accidentally stabbed your toe with a knife or anything, then one day my dad asked ""why are you locking yourself in your room? Why are you not communicating with the family?,"" .I said nothing. ""Then my dad compared me to a drug dealer. I had no expression. Then my mom told the story about one of my uncle's who was overdosed on drugs. I said nothing, I continue to eat my dinner. Then two days after my dad asked the same question, he got mad and then slapped me right across the face like he usually does nowadays when he's really mad. (He used to hit my head, sometimes kick, uses a rattan (basically a long stick you hit people with (used as a corporal punishment during british colonization back in the day) , punched me , pinched my legs till I get bruises on it (I didn't get any help during those times). Then I started crying and he held my hands really tightly till it hurted, I suddenly started to cry, I was trying to get away from my dad. Then he realized he made a big mistake and said sorry and hugged me and such. My mom was watching K-drama right beside us, basically doing nothing as per usual. 

I still couldn't accept my dad's apology. It feels out of place. Now when he gets mad he tries to stop himself from hitting me or go overboard. But I still feel the same feelings of weakness back in the days during my childhood. Now i still feel feelings of course. Just that I go stoic or treat things lightly.

This is something I really need to get out of my chest, so please bear with me (TL;DR at the end of this post if you don’t want to read the whole thing). 


I (F) am in my mid-thirties. In my early twenties I made a bad decision: I decided to take a gap year from uni. 
Then, the economic recession hit my country, both my parents got retired and suddenly I couldn’t afford going back to university to finish my studies. 

After a few months of uncertainty, I decided to move in with my partner (now ex) and try to find a job in his town or in a city nearby. Because of the crisis, alongside my lack of experience and qualifications, it was just impossible for me to find anything.

As a consequence, I ended up spending 6 years of my life being a housewife; nothing wrong with that, but I’m not the kind of person who loves being home all the time, and I consider my career an important part of my life. The problem was, I couldn’t even find a low-paid job. I wasn’t even entitled to benefits because I didn’t have enough experience working. My parents had to send me money every month so I could afford food, something I wasn’t comfortable with knowing they were retired and didn’t have much money themselves ; and luckily my then-boyfriend didn’t charge me any rent (the house was his). 


I did all the Government-funded courses I could find that were relevant, studied two foreign languages, looked into business ideas and attended some therapy... but after more than two years trying my hardest to get out of that situation, both my confidence and my hope started to drop . I witnessed on social media my friends from uni getting graduated. Every single one them ended up finding work, getting their own house. I was the only long-term unemployed person I knew. 
I looked into volunteering, but the options are narrow in my country where volunteering isn’t that common. 


In the meantime, I was also struggling to make new friends in that town, where everyone knew everyone else and groups of friends were already formed and quite closed to the idea of inviting new people to join them. 

I just felt isolated from everything and everyone.

I have always been an adventurous, extroverted person who loves meeting new people and visiting new places. I can’t even describe how trapped I felt and how frustrated and bored I was. I felt like a misfit while seeing everyone getting on with their lives, affording meals out, having a group of friends, living like adults. I was in my mid-20s and was still relying on my parents. 
I asked my partner if we could move to a different town, but it wouldn’t have been a good decision for him as he already had his whole life sorted out: a job, a house, his family.
He couldn’t really understand why I was so miserable, and this was the cause of a lot of arguments; he constantly criticised me for being bored at home and said I was always winging. He would yell at me sometimes, saying I was ungrateful for what I had, that both my parents and him were supporting me so much. I told him I was actually very grateful, but that didn’t mean I wanted that kind of life for myself and my future. 
I ended up too resentful and finally lost my feelings for him and decided to split up after 6 years of relationship. 


Then I moved country. I decided it was the perfect time to follow my dreams and start a new life. After all, I had always wanted to visit this country. I had nothing to lose, I could always go back if things didn’t work out.

For the first year living here everything was amazing and I felt renewed, finally free. I was able to find a job for the first time (it was a cleaning job, but it made me so happy as it was just the beginning and I was hopeful I could find better things in the future). 
I also made new friends, finally , nice people who were open to meet other new people. 


But after that first year, unexpectedly, things started to go wrong again: the town I was living in started to feel less and less safe since problems with drugs and crime increased; I struggled with the lack of light in winter (I come from a southern country) and this gave me severe Seasonal Affective Disorder; most of the friends I had made moved to a different country or city; I could only find low-paid and temporary jobs due to lack of experience; the side business I had set up wasn’t giving me enough income....but I kept telling myself “you’re just starting, it’s been one year, be patient; things are not easy when you move to a different country” . I said the same after two years. And after three years. I kept working on my resilience every time I had to do something I hated, lost a job, felt treated unfairly in a workplace or felt unsafe in the town I live in. I kept telling myself things would improve and it was just a matter of time.

One day, because of the experience I had gained in my own business, I finally was offered an amazing job. I was so happy I couldn’t believe it! Finally my efforts had paid off. But guess what?: The very first day I started, the company changed their mind as they didn’t have as many clients as they had expected, and therefore my position was no longer needed. I was left again with only my failing business to rely on.



Two years after that job loss, and 6 years after moving country, I’m now feeling stuck all over again in a place I utterly hate, with no close friends, feeling isolated and with a partner who can’t move away because he has a stable job. I’m hardly ever offered any job interviews and, when I do, they always decide to go for someone else with more experience. I don’t blame them as my CV is a bit sad for someone in their 30s. 

On top of that, as embarrassing as it sounds, my parents still have to help me financially because otherwise I can’t make ends meet.

The only positive thing I can tell about this is the fact I’m now studying to become a counsellor and I’m hopeful I might find a job in a few years. 
But it’s not only the lack of employment... it’s the place I live in and how lonely and unsafe I feel sometimes. At least I never felt unsafe living with my ex, I felt bored and isolated, but not unsafe. 

 I feel I’m wasting my life. I’m no longer 'young' and have been dealing with this problem for more than a decade. I’m just exhausted, tired of fighting my ass off and not seeing any improvement. 

I don’t want to move away and leave my partner here, as our relationship is going well and we want a future together. 
Unlike my ex, my current partner also wants to move away one day with me, but only when he can find a new job and we can save up for moving house. 
He is being extremely supportive and understanding, I love him and don’t want to lose him. That’s why I’m holding on as much as I can.


We have even discussed the idea of travelling the world and do odd jobs here and there, volunteer, meet new people and other cultures and just forget about this stability that maybe we will never achieve; but it’s a risky decision, we are no longer in our 20s...what will we do once we really need to settle down? 



A recent major loss in my life has made me realise how short life is. I can’t help but thinking there *must* be something I can do about this, I refuse to be stuck forever. I just don’t know what the best move could be: to leave this country and risk my relationship? Travelling the world with my partner, even though that would lead us to lack of stability? To just wait and wait and wait until the situation improved? 
I have come to the point I no longer know what I really want, as I’m so fed up with pondering everything and not reaching any conclusions. I just know getting a ******* job would give me more choice and help me get out of here. 


I’m not sure if anyone has any advice or has gone through a similar experience. I guess I just needed to vent, so thank you if you’ve read this far. Any input will be appreciated, though :) 




TL;DR : I spent over 6 years stuck in a town without being able to find a job or any friends and just being a housewife all the time. I decided to move to another country to start a new life, but 6 years later I’m finding myself stuck again in a town I utterly hate, I haven’t been able to find a stable job or long-lasting friendships.
I just want to leave this place but my partner (who I’m in love with) can’t move for work reasons.",22Nov2020,1
499,"Alright so, this isn’t anything serious but just sort of looking for tips lol. This question isn’t really a question either sooo even I don’t really know what I want from this post. 

Some background...

I just turned 20, and am in my third year of college. Throughout my life I’ve had numerous friends but never anyone I was super “close” to at least in comparison to others. To emphasize, basically every summer all the way from middle school to senior year high school I spent those 2 months in the basement of my house lol just gaming/youtube etc, legit never leaving unless I had sports practice. Never been to any of those hs dance/rallies, never dated/talked to girls, never was that interested TBH, still not. Now, here’s the thing, looking back I Def had some sort of social anxiety, there were a lot of jokes made about my appearance during this time which I “laughed along with”but def fkd w my confidence like overall but it’s ok tbh lol now.

I didn’t have a friend group I belonged to and spent those brunches/lunches finding a way to not look like a loner lol. I remember graduation in HS I received my diploma by myself, took no pictures and just walked home straight away lol, which was kinda sad for me cause I felt like a loser but alas. 

Then, I went to a college in a diff state(mainly cause I didn’t want to associate myself w HS at all) I kinda gained some social skills, realized I just need to be myself/have confidence and had the opportunity to make close friends and did my first two years...

HOWEVER, idk what it is, maybe I’m a legit introvert, or maybe I’m still a lil petty over the past, but I realize I create distance with literally everyone in my life(family/friends).

When corona started, I started staying/stayed w my parents and started to smoke more weed(like all day every day smh) during this time.  It made me super zen and I had this mindset “why NOT connect/get close w others...you only live once” and overall just crazy happy I guess idk lol.  I connected w some High school ppl and spent a lot more time w them, as well as my family. 

After realizing I can’t stay high 24/7, I quit and the past month I didn’t want to spend time w them as much. I just wanted to be alone for the most part...

I don’t have any social media, prob text someone like once every couple of days max... I feel like if I had a job and my own place I wouldn’t spend time w others like at all...

What’s crazy is that I REALLY do enjoy company at times and I know others enjoy mine as well...but I choose to keep those conversations light hearted and avoid spending a ton of time with one person.

Idk what to do rn...ik life is short and it’s better experienced w others...but because life is short why not spend it doing what I want to do and be independent...? I have plenty of hobbies/passions and am confident I can live a fulfilling life w just myself. 

But on the flip side, now much more than high school I am confident I can create meaningful connections and be more social, but I feel like cause I’ve always been alone I don’t want to change to sort of prove to myself I don’t need anybody(maybe I’m over analyzing my psyche?) idek lol. So just looking for some thoughts I guess. 

TLDR - for some reason I keep a distance and don’t get too close w anyone(family/friends). Am not sure why(I THINK because I feel a little pettiness from  being alone, but I am definitely somewhat of a natural introvert) but regardless don’t know if I should continue being a recluse(have plenty of hobbies/interests) or start being more social and making legit connections?",22Nov2020,1
500,"I have been struggling for a while with one particular fear. Not just the fear itself, but this crime in general has been plaguing my mind and infesting my thoughts with horrible visual scenarios. I (m) am petrified of a partner/future wife being sexually assaulted or raped.

This terrifies me to no end. I cannot stop picturing and imagining what it would be like from her point of view. I can’t turn my mind off from it. It causes such immense anxiety it feels like I can’t cope. I get scared when I see, or even hear about girls walking home alone. I hate watching crime shows for fear that rape may be involved.

Some random person came across it, somehow found my information and my parents information (I went through the exif data on the photos myself and no location came up so i dont know how) and sent my parents my photos. He doesn't know me or my family but just came across my photos and decided to contact them, sending a link to my pictures and my account which i deleted. In his email, he stated it was to ""protect"" me from blackmail and rape, so no bad intentions on his part i guess. But why my parents and not me. He apparently messaged me on my account first telling me to take the photos down but i dont check my notifications so i didnt see it. So send them to my parents??? Im so confused. Im not underage, im in college. I literally dont know even know this man and he decided to do all this digging on me. He said in his email to my parents that he only wishes the best for my family and i,  but i feel like it's so weird to see a random stranger on the internet, insert yourself into their lives, and expose them to their family. My relationship with my parents has been destroyed. I'm obviously furious at this man for meddling at all. Those were MY pictures of my body.. What i choose to do with them is MY choosing. If i face repercussions, i would much rather have gone through them myself and have left my parents out of it. I want to reach out to this guy and go off on him or just ask him why. But i figured it's probably no use because he obviously thinks himself in the right. Am i in the wrong here?

503,"Relationship advice

I’m a 23 yr old female. I’ve been dating this guy for 3 months now, almost 4. When we first started dating of course everything was spectacular! We’re growing out of that honey moon phase now which is to be expected. I worked with him for 2 years and we rarely spoke to each other. I admired from across the room , I thought he was so handsome! I had a bf at that time so I never made any moves on him. Once me and my ex broke up, Colten (24m) messaged me on fb and told me he always thought I was cute and that we should hangout and catch up. Now we’ve been together for a few months and the other day I noticed that he still has a dating app on his phone. This is where I have to own up to my mistakes and admit I crossed a boundary. I opened the app and started reading messages which was wrong of me. Just to find that the same day he messaged me on Facebook, he was messaging 30+ girls in the same way. But I was the only one to bite. Granted, he hasn’t been on the dating app since. Or at least it doesn’t seem like he has. But now it almost feels like he was just desperate, looking for love in just anyone. I felt special at first but now I just feel like I’m being used for his own selfish desires. I want to believe this is right for me because we have a ton of fun and we just connect. But I have also saw on his safari he googles things about “what if I like another friend more than my gf” which hurt me to see. That one I wasn’t seeking out, he opened his google safari in front of me and it was the last thing he was researching. I was in a very toxic relationship for 6 years prior to this one. This is his first real relationship in 5 years. We are on two totally different levels and I can’t tell if he’s really in this for the long haul or if he’s just kind of using me to pass time until he finds someone better. Does that make sense? Maybe it’s the insecurities from my last relationship speaking for me but something about this doesn’t feel right anymore. I feel like a victim of my own self sabotage because I read those messages. I need advice. 😭",22Nov2020,1
504,"My friend and I are 17 and 16, my mom is 39. I believe she is sleeping my friend. I have a few reasons to think so.

Firstly, when ever he is over she wears more makeup and flattering clothes than usually, and always asking when he is coming over. 

For the last 2 years she had also driven him and I to and from soccer, as his mom works late on those nights and his dad works fly in fly out. For the last few months she has started dropping me home first and then taking him home, even though she used to take him home first then me (it is about equal effort so its not cause out of efficiency or anything). She says it is so I have more time for my homework because she got an email from a teacher but wont say which one. She used to be back quickly from taking him home but she has been taking longer and longer. It used to take 40mins there and back but the longest has been 1 and a half hours. 

Last weekend he came over with some other friends. We were meant to sleep in the basement but mom said ‘because we are at that age’ and that we should sleep separately, she insisted on him sleeping in the guest room next to her room. I got up in the middle of the night and went up stairs and I think i heard then going at it. 

Finally i saw moms phone and he had text her. It was an attachment and I couldn’t see it as the phone was locked and she didn’t let me open her phone which she often does.

Id love any advice also open to questions and pms",22Nov2020,1

506,"(Throwaway account)
Me (F22) and my brother (27) were really close growing up and had no issues. We’ve grown apart from each other the last couple years just because we live in different towns and don’t have as much chance to see each other especially with covid this year but I’d say we were still closer than most people are with their adult siblings. We still call every so often and talk regularly in our family group chat and I’ve never realised if there’s been issues. 

However a couple days ago his wife (who is literally like a biological sister to me) posted their pregnancy announcement on social media. I was confused as to why they wouldn’t tell close family first so I called my youngest sister (F17) and she says they told the rest of the family when they visited my parents not long ago (a gathering I couldn’t make because of work). I was so hurt that they didn’t at least call me to let me know or even just say “actually you should really be here”. 

The worst thing is, I missed their proposal a few years ago (again because of work) and I explained to my brother that if he told me that was the weekend it was happening I would’ve called in sick. 

So I’ve had to take a few days to myself and not interact with my family for a bit just because I know if I speak to them I’m going to kick off and I don’t want to ruin what’s supposed to be a happy moment. I feel like this might have ruined our relationship and I’m not sure how to repair it when it’s so clear that they don’t want me involved. How can I go about this? Do I call them out or just leave it?

TLDR: my brother and his wife told our family they were pregnant. Didn’t tell me and I had to find out on social media",22Nov2020,1
507,Okay so most of my friends that are my age are really distant from me so I don’t get to talk to them much and when we hang out I’m really bad at talking with them. With my younger friends I normally take my brother out to see them but my mom makes me stay with them to make sure my brother is okay and that lead me to forming some friendships with them they are mostly 11 or 12 anyways my friends that are my age think I’m a pedophile because I hang out with younger kids. I’ve never had anything more than a friendship with them I know some have romantically liked me but I normally let them down easy anyways I just want my friends to stop thinking I’m a predator and I just have good friendships with them.

508,"It sounds silly based off the title but let me explain. I just moved to a new state with my fiance, and we're renting from his childhood friends. We all live in a house. They charge us $700 a month for rent and utilities so all is included. My issue is that they do not want us to use the washer and dryer that they have in the house and use the laundromat instead. On average, we spend about $40 at the laundromat per month. They do the same as they believe it's cheaper than using their own... so I guess I need to know if they have a point? Or should I try to ask about not using the laundromat anymore? How much is the difference in prices doing it here vs at the laundromat? I am willing to pay a little extra if needed, but when they say all utilities are included in the rent, doesn't that mean I have a free range of those utilities?

512,"Hello, so to start off I currently work in home care, which is exactly like working at a retirement home but I go to people house and take care of them instead. I currently have two clients, one I visit 8am-12pm everyday, and the other only a couple hours during the week. The everyday client recently had a fall, and the past week has suffered from noticable confusion (she has mild dementia) and her two 50+ daughters live with her. 

The client whom I see only a couple of hours, I am very close with and we get along like old friends. Her son happens to own a successful dispensary in Maine. I've always loved cannabis and found the industry extremely interesting. It's been a goal of mine to work in a dispensary since I was 16 (I'm 21 now). Her son recently offered me a job a couple of days ago. And after thinking about the work and the pay increase, I couldn't pass on the opportunity. He has asked his mom prior if it was okay to offer me the job, and she gave him the okay. 

My dilemma is with my 8am-12pm client. Her 50 year old daughters own a company, work full time, and are having people over for the holidays. I feel this is the absolute worst time to put in my two weeks. Yesterday, they were asking me about a Christmas schedule, and deciding extra hours. I didn't know what to do..so I just agreed to them, fully knowing my last day is December 9th. Prior to that convo I called a coworker for advice, and she told me to go along with it until I gave notice to my boss. I'm so stressed out because they are going to HATE me after I give my two week notice. And I can't escape it because I wi be working with them everyday until my last shift. I guess the thing I need most help with is how to deal with them for the next two weeks. I feel so mucg guilt for leaving, during a really busy, hectic month for them, and also with their mothers newly declining mental state.

516,"I was at a bar last night with some of my friends and this guy (we'll call him Nick) who came into town to visit; he's my roommate's high-school friend and I've known him and gotten along with him very well for three years. 

So anyway, while I was blacked out (I have no recollection of this whatsoever) I told my friends that I wanted to hook-up with Nick and kissed him at the bar. I was apparently all over him after this. I don't remember this at all. I don't even remember leaving the bar or how I got home or anything. I put my big winter jacket on upside-down and was confused at why it wasn't staying on (there's a video of this, that's how I know, I do not even remember this) to give an idea of how drunk I was. 

When I got home I started throwing up and I remember throwing up but then I don't remember anything until a bit later when I suddenly blacked back in (if this makes sense? like started to become aware again?) and he was giving me oral sex and fingering me (which hurt because I was dry as a desert). Because it hurt and I wanted him to stop, I pushed him away and he asked for a blowjob and I gave him one (I remember this in bits and pieces like a fuzzy movie; it doesn't feel like myself), but I had to stop because I had to throw up again and did so for around an hour and that's where my memory fully starts up again. I remember everything after that. He tried to have sex with me but I told him no because the world was spinning and I was nauseous as fuck and I felt so disgusted that I would let this happen. I was super upset for a few reasons. 

For one, I feel like a slut because I've known Nick for super long and I've never seen him that way. I have no idea why my stupid drunk self would lead him on and let him think it was okay to do this. I'm so, so upset with myself. I am disgusted by myself. 

The second reason is because I've been seeing this guy (we'll call him Sam) for two months now and I *really* like him. We are NOT DATING. He is not my boyfriend and I am not his girlfriend and we've both made this very clear to each other. We're going to be apart for a month because of Christmas break and we thought it would be best to not start dating each other officially before a long break like that. So, I know that I didn't cheat on him, but it *feels* like I cheated on him. I feel so, so guilty and I don't know how to stop these feelings. I feel like a whore and like I don't deserve Sam anymore. I've been only talking to him and going on dates with him and being physical with him for around a month now and he's also told me that he's only been talking to me, which makes things even worse. I feel like not telling Sam that this happened is lying to him but I know that he'll be super upset that I hooked-up with someone else. Again, we're not dating and he knows that we're not dating. But I still feel like I went behind his back by doing this and I don't know why. He's coming over later today (this is the day after this happened) and I am so sad and guilty about it. 

So, advice: should I tell Sam what happened? And how do I make these feelings of regret and guilt and feeling like I'm a slut go away? Are these valid feelings?",22Nov2020,1
517,"My voice is really high pitched. It is very unique and can be easily distinguished in a noisy room. I have had friends tell me that they can alway hear me, so if they can’t see me they can follow my voice because it really carries, even when I’m trying to be quiet. It’s a kind of high pitch that just cuts through noise and seems loud all the time, even when I try to be quiet. When I shout or yell it rises in pitch even more, so much so that sometimes it’s hard to make out what I’m saying. 

Today I was playing sport and was yelling (because that’s what you do to communicate) and someone turned to me and said “no offence but your voice is very annoying. Please stop talking.” He then told me that he would do anything for me to just shut up because my voice was “making his head hurt”. When I told me teammates they all laughed and agreed. 

This incident has made me really upset. Ive always struggled with liking my voice because I have been told by so many people, both friends and strangers, that it’s irritating, annoying and hard to listen to because it’s so high pitched. I would say that my voice is my biggest insecurities.

But how can I fix it? Like if you don’t like your body you can work to change that, if your personality comes off bad you can also work to fix that. 

But a voice?? How can you fix or change that?? Like what do you want me to do, never speak again?? I now never really want to speak and I’ve started to try and force my voice deeper when I talk.

Hey 

First of all, It's not me who is depressed. I will explain shortly.

So  I met a girl online, who is apparently suffering from depression and  anxiety. We spent a lot of time together, watched movies online, played  video games, talked on discord. For severals months. She told me about  her issues and I really felt sorry for her.  I never really had  experiences with depressed people, I was sure I could handle it with  being open for that and giving it a chance, being honestly nice to her,  not faking anything. We planned to meet in spring of 2020. I even got  her phone number. She lives in eastern europe, I live in western europe,  \~ 1000km of distance inbetween us.

So  in march I did something completely stupid while  I was not in full  control of my senses: I deleted her and told her to get lost. Since that  day, I regret what I did. I tried to add her on discord and on steam  again, I got blocked. I messaged her on Facebook, I got blocked. Same on  Whatsapp. I added some of her friends on steam, but she told them that  she does not want contact to me. I called her on phone, she didn't  answer.

I fell like complete crap  ever since. I feel so guilty about what I done. All I wanted, is to meet  with her, to see what kind of person she is IRL. I am afraid that she  will never ever talk to me again. My heart hurts when I imagine that she  feels worse because of me. I do not know what to do.

Is  there any advice someone can give me? Friends and family members to  whom I talked about it, they all told me to forget her. They told me  shes only gonna be bad for me. But I miss her so much. I  am 27 years  old and I haven't cried for 10 years. No break up with a girl in my real  life ever felt so destructive.

520,"Hi I need advice on how I should cope with this I want to stop liking him but from the situation I seriously am so confused like does he “LiKe” me? At all? Definitely not if were to it’d be as an supporting teacher if anyone reads this I want to thank you so much for your effort :) Started 2019 November 12 some 6’2 dude walked down looked like he was high but the one thing i noticed was “dude gotta get a hair cut asap” (he once got a hair cut looked so bad) see I wasn’t interested well i admired him but I didn’t liked him cuz I was in a relationship and he was being an ass too :) ight December got dumped dude just touched ny shoulder rightttt before the mid term test saying “good luck on your test (mn)!” *touches my shoulder *smiles *strokes his hair and there I go falling for my teacher AgAiN. I knew shit like this ain’t ever gon’ happen and it’s just suffering and torture but hey! I did it anyway! 

So then SOMETHING happened I had a rough time dude confronted me had a deep talk and all I’m gonna say about that situation I was in was *dark room *lights barely coming in *empty classroom *him cornering me *we were so fucking close I could feel his breath I COULDVE DIED but ye EVEN I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE. 

During quarantine i developed a relationship with a 19 yr which ended in hell in September 2020 Just so I could get over the dude gonna call him L. But then

School opens 
THE. GUY. PICKED. ON. MY. FLAWS. SO. OFTEN. my friend takes about it. I was not thinking about him (but probably my “getting over him” collapsed the moment I saw him wearing a fucking tux on first day of school) anywayyyy guy basically treats me special af gave me candies calls me out so often for some reason always makes me answer a friend of mine accused him of liking me that time he HUGGED ME (the guy never hugged any student before) and then he hugged me again (and stepped on my feet) he gave me his phone number (technically I asked for it but just for me to send him my poetries cuz he asked to read it and for him to send me an example of his cuz he’s the only English teacher I know that (still) writes poetry so uhhh TeChniCaLLy hE initiated iT ) we chatted I was the only student who had his numbers there were always good mornings and good afternoons for me he always asks me how I am 

This is where it really went down around 8 people were convinced that he likes me cuz he likes to ask for me whenever I’m gone or absent they said he’d ask for me all the time where I am that time there was a choir rehearsal three people were gone he only asked me why I was gone and people pointed that out too when he says stuff like “ (mn) can I have your attention?” People would say stuff like see he only wants her attention and shit then he backed down prob cuz the rumors 

THEN CAME BACK TO NORMAL but seemed a bit off 

There’s this guy I’ll refer to him as James the whole class ships us and for that there’s “(mn) and James should partner together!” “You should let them do work together they’re a couple!” “They like each other!” And his respond to these was “shut up!” But playfully of course tho he never said “shut up” before and whenever we’re together he would try to split us up by like talking to me or giving me jobs and shit 

Last I checked the week before the school close he completely ignored me didn’t said anything to each other he said hi to me that time my friends yelled for him to come over he touched my shoulder a lil chit chat but that was it oh for fucks sake he walked by me and my friends like 10 times some for walking by some JUST to talk to them but I didn’t said anything oh and then there’s James in love with me as people says I spent weeks daydreaming bout how L would be the one asking “hey how was the test? What are you gonna do this weekend?” Maybe a little “aw im gonna miss you” maybe a *hug but no the guy did not said a damn thing to me left with another women too but aw fuck it 

Ending questions 
Does he even fucking like me? 
What should I do bout this 

(don’t say “I think you should pay attention to this James guy” cause hell I’ve heard that a million times and yes I like him but he deserves someone better I don’t deserve him) 
 Thank you so so much for reading my paragraphs :)",22Nov2020,1
521,"I have ADHD, which I am on medication for. But I don’t know if there is something else wrong with me, or if this is something everyone goes through.

3 years ago, I met a girl at my lab who, till this day, remains as the most beautiful girl I’ve ever known. Everything about her was perfect. I immediately tried bonding with her. We had a pretty good time together, but we were just friends. Eventually I asked her out, and she said yes, but then cancelled on me a few days later without giving a follow-up date. I said ok, no problem.

At the time, I was in high school and did research over the summers, so that was the only time I really talked to her. We fell out of touch after that summer, but every waking moment I spent thinking about her, thinking about what she was up to, what she would do if she was in this situation or that situation. I knew I was obsessing over her but I couldn’t stop. Every 5th thought was about her. I even began stalking her online, and it became a daily obsession. She was the first thing I thought of in the morning when I woke up, and she was the last thing I thought about before drifting off to sleep.

As I entered college, I began to do research over the summers and during the semesters, so I got to spend more time with her. But I became dumb and impulsive around her, and I’d often tease her and keep asking her out. In my alone time, I’d often fantasize about being with her or having sex with her. The daydreaming and fantasizing took over my life, and my grades tanked. One time I even asked if she wanted to make out (In all fairness, I was trialing ADHD medications at the time, and some made me extra hyper and impulsive for some reason). I knew I was making her feel uncomfortable, but I just couldn’t stop myself. Sometimes she’d tell me she was seeing someone, which made me really mad because I knew she wasn’t seeing someone, but also because it made me mad to imagine another guy being lucky enough to be with her. I couldn’t stop looking at her and thinking about her, and even though I can focus now on the right medications, I can’t focus because she pops in my head all the time.

After a year, we finished our project and published our paper. I then wrote a letter to her and told her I was sorry for how I had made her feel over the past years. I told her that I know a relationship with her was not possible, but she will continue to be special to me. And I wished her all the best. For some reason, this helped me move forward a little and think of her less, but even now, she still pops up in my head.

For example, we are both pre-med, so we have to take the same classes, but she was a few years above me. So I keep wondering, “I wonder how she felt when she was taking this class,” or, “I wonder what grades she got.” It’s complete nonsense and it makes me mad that I can’t stop thinking about her. I don’t want to be tied to her anymore and I just wanna move forward.

I’ve never dated anyone before, and while I had the same obsessive tendencies with other girls in high school, she was the first person through which this became really severe. Even as a kid (4th-5th grade), I’d often fantasize about dating a girl that I’d like at school, and it would even keep me up at night. I don’t know if this is like an OCD thing or if every guy does this, but it’s really derailed my life and my mental stability.

Some mental health counselors I’ve talked to think this is normal and nothing to worry about and that I should try dating other people. I have tried dating other people, and while I temporarily forget about her, I become obsessed with them and it often leads to rejection. And then my thoughts wander back to her.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",22Nov2020,1
523,"I've had a dry, hacking cough for about a week with no fever or any other symptoms. None of my family members are experiencing symptoms as far as I know. There have been 8 cases at my school within the last couple weeks, but we are in cohorts and no one in my cohort or class had it. We start a new unit tomorrow and I don't want to miss it, and my parents are apprehensive about me getting a test because it will take all day. What do I do?",22Nov2020,1
524,"This is something I have considered writing for a few days now, I have not told anyone about it, because I wasn't sure if I have a right to feel how I do, or if there is cause to make a big deal out of it, but know that I am not the most confident person and I tend to pass things off as being OK even if they are not.

I (28, F) ended a 7 year relationship just over 2 years ago with my ex-boyfriend (now 32) . It was not a happy relationship, it really took up a lot of years of my life and I have very few good memories from it. When I left, I literally ended things with him, quit my job, and left my family and moved to another country, blocking my ex and his whole family from ever contacting me, because it was so toxic.

There are alot of things I didn't deal with internally that happened throughout. He was a very volatile, angry, jealous and manipulative man. He put me down, made me feel worthless, he didn't want me to have any independence, and towards the end he didn't even like me leaving the house if I had a day off work. There were nights when he was physically aggressive towards me, night's I had to lock myself into the bathroom, and nights when I didn't quite make it into the bathroom. I remember them all.

However lately I have been remembering something that I really have tried not to remember. It makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed, I want to talk to my Mum about it but I can't find the courage, I want to talk to my current partner about it but I don't want to make him feel like I don't love him or that I am thinking about my ex-boyfriend, or that I am damaged or anything. But maybe I am.

Anwyays I am remembering nights when I would be asleep in bed with my ex, and I would wake up to him touching me, or trying to have sex with me from behind. Any time I woke up in the middle of this happening, I froze. He thought I was asleep, and he wasn't trying to wake me up while he was doing this, it was all very quiet and very careful. After it happening a few times I decided to ""test"" the situation and see if he was actually trying to have sex with me while I was asleep, in case I was wrong or had gotten it mixed up in my sleepiness or something. So one night when I woke up he was trying to ""put it in"", I deliberately lay there pretending to sleep and he kept going, he was trying to angle himself to get inside me, and was trying to open my legs a bit with his fingers, so I moved and made him think I was going to wake up. He moved back over to his side of the bed and didn't move, he pretended to be asleep until I stopped moving and he thought I was asleep again and a few minutes later he gave himself a tug to get hard again and came back behind me again to try again. But I had moved in a way that he just couldn't do it so he went to sleep. 

I didn't say anything because I was a weak person and I was afraid of what he would say to me or do. I was just afraid. I don't even know how I managed to move that time, because I was so frozen. But I really didn't want him to do that and he was almost where he wanted to be, I guess it was just a reaction. He did this too many nights to count, and a couple of times I said to him the next day if he woke up that night or I'd say my underwear was twisted that morning or something, he never said anything about it. And neither do I.

Now I am here 2 years later, feeling quite disgusted and disappointed in myself for not being stronger and standing up for myself and my body. The advice I am asking for is how do I move forward and stop thinking about this? How do I just make it go away?
I don't want to feel like this anymore. I don't want to think about it ever again. It makes me feel ill.
How do I deal with this? Is this sexual assault? Is it rape? Attempted rape? Is it anything at all? 
Please any advice at all is welcome.",22Nov2020,1
525,"I'm a regular at this convenience store near my house. They barricaded the store so you can't go in to get what you'll buy so you'd have to ask the clerk. Anyway, I go there today and find out there's a new clerk. Previous one was fine and did their job well, the new one had an attitude. So I go there and this new clerk is on the phone. That's no problem for me and I greet the clerk with the usual ""hi! good morning, I'm getting some chips"" (something like that) with normal cheery intonation. They didn't seem to hear me so repeat what I said but they pretended not to hear. It felt like calling a kid and them looking at you and then going the other way. 

When the clerk finally looks at me they seem to be grinning beneath their mask. I ask my request (chips) and clerk goes to find while loudly saying in a sing song voice ""where did I put the chips"" repeatedly while they were in front of the chips. They really took their time with it. Then they walked slowly to the counter on purpose. I payed and got my stuff after that because I was so angry.

I'm not confrontational when it comes to this type of things and it did ruin my day. I kept wondering if I did something wrong with this person to treat me in a condescending manner on our first meeting. Yes this is trivial but this convenience store is the nearest to me. I need some advice on dealing with rude clerks. This is my first time dealing with a rude clerk and it's really bothering me for some reason. 

My first idea was to go back and be condescending/rude towards them when they do it again but that seems nasty.",22Nov2020,1
526,"To start off a little background. Recently my gf and I moved into our first home, everything is going well, been together for 2 years and I think she might be “the one.” 


Now I noticed before that she is a bit of a loud eater but wasn’t anything too unbearable. Since moving in together and sharing the majority of our meals I’ve noticed how much of an unbearably loud eater she is and I don’t mean with just typically noisy foods, I mean any type of food. She constantly chews with her mouth open, slurps everything and is just unbearable to be around when she’s eating or drinking. 


I have tried the usual tricks of making sure there’s some kind of background noise whether it’s music or tv but she has the ability to be heard over most things. I’ve mentioned off the cuff about how loud she is when she eats and it usually just ends in her being upset and deliberately chewing louder to annoy me. 



Some of you may be thinking that it’s not that big of a deal or that if this girl is “the one” that I’d be able to get over it but whenever I hear someone eating or drinking loudly it fills me with rage. Genuine, mood altering, rage. So as you all can imagine, I’m at my wits end with this and I’m struggling to think of a way to address this issue without upsetting my significant other whilst actually dealing with this issue. 




So my question is, how do I tell my gf that she needs to change the way she eats food without being overbearing or coming across as mean? TIA",22Nov2020,1

I am a Masters student intending to apply for a scholarship to intensively study a language abroad upon graduating. It is a very competitive thing as hundreds of people apply each year and only a handful get chosen, so I want my application to be the best it can be.

The only issue is that they want me to ask three lecturers to submit reference letters. The university I am currently studying at is a different one than where I studied for my undergraduate degree, and so most of these professors I have known for about two months. And 'known' is probably an exaggeration: With online classes, we have larger group sizes and I have barely spoken in the majority of my lectures due to this, and in most classes we haven't used our cameras. I think maybe only one lecturer would actually know who I am if I emailed them, whereas the majority don't even know what I look like. 

Can I still ask for a reference from somebody who barely knows me? And if so, should I be concerned that they won't be able to write anything specific about me?",22Nov2020,1

538,"Hey,

So I will start hitting the gym this week. I have been doing 100 pushups, sit-ups and body squats everyday (except from Sundays) and eating 3 meals a day only. I'll start hitting the gym because I want to make a physical significant change which people can really notice and as a personal challenge. 

Since I do not have any experience, I'm hoping somebody who does answers and gives a wise advice. So, what I will be doing is:

DIET

I'll start eating 4-5 heavy meals a day for 2 weeks or so to gain weight. I am considered a skinny-normal guy. I weight 62 kg now, and I hope to get to 70.

WORKOUT

I'll be going 4 days a week following this plan:

MONDAY, THURSDAY AND SUNDAY - Rest.

TUESDAY AND FRIDAY - Military press, barbell curls and squats.

WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY - Bench press, deadlifts and chinups.

Every exercise will be done by 5 sets of 5 reps adding weight until I reach my max (the point where I feel I cannot lift heavier) and then stick to it and perform 5 singles with a rest period of 45 seconds to 1 minute, BUT NO LONGER. Chinups go apart: I'll be doing 5 sets for failure.

I will also be throwing some pushups and sit-ups here and there as well as getting good sleep, but this is the general idea.

If you have experience in body building or weight training, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK and whether or not YOU BELIEVE I'LL GET RESULTS as well as WHEN.

Hi to anyone that's reading this,

A lot has happened this year. We are all going through so much in all of our lives.

This year for me has been filled with individual things that happened in my personal life that Is hard to handle when I think about it.

It's just it all happened right beside each other, literally as soon as we hear news about one thing, another bad thing happens. Got me feeling a little paranoid at one point

I don't want to specify just because I feel that it's not mine to tell. But my grandma passed, a sibling almost died due to some messed up stuff, and uncle went through two seizures, I just found out some news about my parents that broke my heart (this is where I brokedown internally again), and I stopped having friends just when I finally was building connections. A few other stuff happened, but I can't seem to remember for some reason at the moment. I thought I was tough and strong, but maaaan it's getting to me. I also thought after you go through this sorta stuff you become stronger. But I feel like a statue, and if someone blew at me, I will break into a million pieces. I often felt numb before, but this year after my grandma passed and all this other stuff started happening, I'm more emotional and sensitive than ever lol. I'm 19, and I expected myself to handle all this better like the rest of my siblings. Also, even with the stuff around the world happening (Palestinian occupation, Nigerian conflict, Yemen starvation, and more), people are going through so much, and I wish we could help more. 

I always rely on family with venting about this stuff, but for once I don't want to cry to them about my feelings, and I want them to rely on me more. (So that's why instead of breaking down to them, I'm coming here for advice)

Any tips for not letting this stuff get to me. I'm usually optimistic, but I'm losing it at times. Religion definitely helps a lot. So I have that thankfully.

Because i've changed city for studies purposes i couldn't go back to my club and in big cities all was closed due to covid-19, so i sent a mail of which they answer me i was not eligible for a refund.

I ask a family member to go see the manager again and same thing happened. You'll be refund at this date. This date come and nothing, sent mail, not eligible for refund.

All gym are closed, should i wait to go back to talk to someone ?

I've thought about contacting a free avocate as i can't afford one so i can get advice...

I didn't unsubscribe yet because i'm scared that i would never see the money again. Maybe i won't be able to get the payment back and keeping subscribed will cost me more, but 280€ still... 

Have someone been in this situation before ? What would you do if you were in this situation as i am ?

That said, i hope it's the good place to post that, thank you.",22Nov2020,1
546,"Quick backstory: I met her many years ago, we were very close but never admitted our feelings for each other. We ended up losing touch for a while, in that time I had some mental health issues which I have mostly recovered from, though the anxiety still lingers at times. We recently reconnected and opened up about our feelings, it has been great to get everything out in the open and start thinking about the future together. 

It has been amazing, she is such a wonderful person, I have always loved being with her and dreamed about being together one day. Now that could be finally happening and my anxious thoughts are filling my head. When we talk, it feels amazing, I could talk to her every second of every day. But when I am alone, I start to doubt everything. I start wondering if I really want to be with her or if it is really going to work out in the future. I feel like I am incapable of a relationship, even though this was the year I wanted to get back into the dating world after a couple years off for my mental health. 

It is just so frustrating, I should feel nothing but happiness right now. This is such an exciting time and she makes me feel so loved and appreciated, yet my brain seems to choose to feel differently. I already opened up about my struggles with mental health the very first time we talked after reconnecting, I didn't want to keep anything from her. I just wish I could shake these thoughts in my head and focus on what really matters.",22Nov2020,1

548,"I met my SO online 3 years ago. During our first few conversations, he said that once he has met the right woman he wants to be married within 2 years. A lot of our wants and desires matched up perfectly. Funny enough 90% of his profile was just words.

He hasnt even proposed yet, and it has been 3 years. Does this mean he doesnt think I am the right woman for him?

First he didnt want to propose on a cliche date, then when we concieved our beautiful son, he didnt want the stigma of ""shes kboxked up so we are getting married"", then he didnt know when my younger sisters bf was going to propose, and now that they are engaged (July) he doesnt want to take the limelight away from her.

So now I dont even know what he likes/loves about me. We have a beautiful son together and he says I am a good mother. But now I think that is all I have.",22Nov2020,1
549,"Hi guys I’m very frantic right now and almost burst out into tears before. I recently submitted an engineering assignment at university, I was very proud of my assignment and eager for my mark. About a month after I submitted the lecturer said everyone should now be able to see their grades online. I went to my computer checked and saw that my mark was still pending, I thought that is odd an emailed the lecturer. The lecturer got back to me and said, your assignment displayed a degree of similarity to another students and has been sent to an academic integrity office to review potential collusion. I was very frightened and unsure as to how this happened, only to realise the night before it was due my best friend ‘for 4 years’ was in a panic and wanted advice on how to do the assignment. I sent him my work and explained how to code the problem thinking he understood and would solve it himself. It turns out he almost identically copy pasted my entire code and changed very minor things like variable names. I’m at the stage now where I’m not sure what to do, I love my degree and couldn’t bare to get kicked out for this, I also spent so much time on that assignment hoping to get a good grade. I’m very concerned because I know you shouldn’t send your work but they were a really close friend and I trusted them. Sorry for the really long post I just don’t know what to do right now. I haven’t told my parents yet either because I don’t know how.",22Nov2020,1
550,"19 and my last year at home. My parents have been heavy drinkers since i was 12. Has lead to some horrible fights with me involved too. I don't need any pity, but i just need some advice on how to talk to my mom about her drinking. My dad has calmed down after some ugly altercations between us last year, but mom won't quit. Its just sipping her wine every single fucking day, from morning to night. It makes me so angry and sad, i find it too painful to talk to her or look her in the eyes when she's drunk. How do i talk to her about it? i've tried many times but it just won't work. Me, my older brother and my dad knows about it, but she denies it every time. 

I feel really hopeless, but i just try to focus on myself and my own goals.

551,"So as all of us who celebrate it know, Thanksgiving is coming up and it’s really weird this year. I live in another state with my boyfriend and we haven’t gone to see my family that much this year because of the pandemic. So Thanksgiving was going to be the first time in a while my 3 sisters, my mom, and my two grandparents were going to be together and I was really excited. My boyfriend and I had planned to go up and stay for just a few days and spend some time with everyone since we haven’t been able to do so. Everyone has had their covid tests and we’re all in the clear. 

The only issue now is that my bf’s mom is very controlling and likes to have things her way or she will not hesitate to let you know she’s unhappy about it. So naturally, she was not happy with the idea that her baby boy was going to be home for Thanksgiving but she “understood” that we don’t get to see my family that often and basically gave the ok. That was until yesterday when my bf received a text from his mother saying that by some miracle, his brother was now going to be able to come down for Thanksgiving and she would be really upset if “the whole family wasn’t together”. This prompted my bf to tell me that he will no longer be coming up with me to see my family, after we had these plans set in stone for weeks now. 

I have a few issues with this. Not only was he so quick to not even consider keeping our holiday plans, but he told me that he “doesn’t have a choice” in whether he stays or goes. Now that his brother will be here, he says that means that the whole family will be together aside from him and that just wouldn’t be okay. I tried to explain to him that we see my family maybe 3-4 times a year and we see his all the time because they live only 20 minutes away. I also think that if said brother was going to come down for the holidays, he would’ve made the plans to do so a while ago instead of the weekend before... It makes me think that his mom somehow talked him into coming because she is very, very good at manipulating them. The plans we had made a very long time ago seem to mean nothing to my bf, and we didn’t even talk about whether he was still going with me because his family would be upset and that’s all it took to keep him. I got really sad and had to actually leave the room because I couldn’t understand how he doesn’t see why this is a problem. His family has so much influence over him, and he tried to make me out to be the bad guy by saying that I just didn’t want him to have Thanksgiving with his family when that doesn’t even make any sense. 

I don’t really know what to do, because this isn’t the first time this has happened. I want to be able to spend holidays with my boyfriend and that just doesn’t seem possible because his mother has so much control over what he does. My sister doesn’t even know why I’m still with him because his family has always treated me like I am a second choice and won’t ever measure up to them in terms of importance to my bf. Idk how to go about this further because it’s really not okay.",22Nov2020,1
552,"So for 6 months or longer I was working with this person let’s call her Amy. During our time working together I was gravitated towards her because of her energy and uniqueness. Then I stopped seeing her around and I managed to get her number through her sister who also happens to work there.

We begin to text for a day and confess things like we have a crush on each other. We didn’t text for like 5 hours and during that time I decided that I wanted to end things because I don’t believe a word she says and I have many insecurities. Anyway she agreed to my wishes and we haven’t texted since.

Now I want to change my mind. Idk what to do.",22Nov2020,1
553,"(This is a long story sorry)

My older sister bought a kitten for £30 for my dad and picked her up in July. She spent a month and a half with my dad and my sister, who was caring for our terminally ill dad, before he died. The afternoon he died I was asked to have the kitten for a single night because my sister didn't want to have to deal with her and the dogs in my sister's home which was with her mother. I agreed and took the kitten home with me where she settled pretty quickly (she was nearly three months old). A single night turned into a weekend which turned into a longer time since she is still with me three months on. I wasn't asked to have her for this long my sister just said she couldn't have the kitten with her because of her dogs (both large breeds and one over enthusiastic with a dislike for other animals). 

At first I asked my sister to pick things up for the kitten's up keep but she took so long to pick up the stuff like litter, the rooms began to smell. Since then I have bought them. My sister has also put of having her vaccinated and she is six months old in a week and still hasn't been vaccinated (current pandemic hasn't helped but vets have been open for vaccines for a while). My sister also neglected to work and get proper flea treatment for the kitten and I had to get it.

My sister recently came to visit us and said that she may possibly be moving into a vacated relative's home with her boyfriend since she is pregnant with her first child, and she said she couldn't wait to have the kitten in her home with her. 

I really don't think I will manage to cope if she does take the kitten because the kitten is part of the reason I am coping with my dad's death, I suffer from depression. She is also settled here and has bonded with our younger sister and I. 

I want what is best for the kitten and she would have more room with my sister but I can barely get through a college day without seeing evidence she is okay. I don't earn any money but use my monthly allowance from my grandparents to buy food, litter and toys for her.

I don't know what to do.",22Nov2020,1
554,"I've always wondered this on professional sports; take the NBA for example... 

The Lakers just one the championship last month, and it's an absolute no
brainer to want to stay on that team again to defend the title...

Yet I'm seeing players opt into free agency to seek out a higher contract, or
superstars like Anthony Davis opt out simply so he could sign a new contract that's higher than ever for him...

Is it just me or does it seem ridiculous that a player should desire MOST to win a championship? This was the opposite of a toxic team, and you think everyone INCLUDING Anthony Davis would take less money on their contract, if it means the betterment of the team.

Has nobody thought of this? Imagine if players chose to make less money, and signed all these good players on a team.

It's been said that once you reach a certain level of money, it all feels the same... these guys are set for life even if they quit the NBA right now, it's strange how everyone is prioritizes money over the betterment of the team especially when you have the perfect team and camaraderie right before you.",22Nov2020,1

556,My wife got into an argument with her dad last night over the phone who lives in another state. He kind of has anger issues so he’s known to pop off from time to time. He’a a good guy and successful but he’s been known to say things he don’t mean. I don’t know what was said but my wife could not stop sobbing last night. I keep asking her what he said or what happened and she doesn’t want to talk about it. Which is kind of weird because we usually share everything. I think it just hurt her so bad that maybe she’s not ready to talk about it without feeling hurt. She’s never been like this though. I’m just wondering if y’all could shoot me some ideas on how to cheer her up when she gets home from work. Any advice would help. Thanks !,22Nov2020,1
558,"This is going to be long. English is a second language, so bear with me. I F39 / husband «Alex» 45.  Married 17 y. 3 kids: Twin boys 16/ girl 12.  I work full time. 

Alex is down to earth, kind, understanding, easy go lucky kind of guy. I have almost never seen him get angry. It takes a lot to get him upset. 

Late last year Alex was in a accident at work. He was hit in the head with a brick. This has given him server, chronic neck pain and he has not been able to work much since.  
He has tried several times to get back to work, but the pain is to much. A few months ago we contacted a lawyer to get help in getting insurance.  Alex thought this would be simple and had hopes of money coming in quickly. 

Since the accident he has been to the doctor continually and taken all kinds of pictures of his head and neck. He can’t take an MRI because of metal in his body from childhood surgery. This makes a clear diagnosis problematic. He has a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test coming up in january, that we hope will help or give us something to work with. 

The doctor has told him he may never work a full time job again. Alex has always been a work horse, first on the job and last to leave. Work is a major part of who he is, so to say this does not compute, is putting it mildly. 

Money has become a serious problem, he has about 4 more months before his benifits are going to be cut in half. At which point we will be forced to sell our house.  
I do not want to do this, but I will if I have to. We live in a small community, and finding something in this school district isnt easy. I do not want my youngest to lose her friends, we live right next to her school and she loves it here. 

During the summer Alex has been doing what he can in the garden/garage and house while I’m at work. But since late august hes become more and more depressed and does next to nothing. In october I arranged for us to borrow a dog from a friend(they needed some help for a while and we all love dogs) Alex had some company during the day and would walk the dog all the time. I thought this would help and it did for a little while. 

3-4 weeks ago Alex started complaining that he had not gotten his benefits. I told him to contact the office and find out why. As the weeks passed I asked him about it many times and he claimed it was a mistake and he did not know why. About this time Alex stoppes replying to my calls/texts from work.
Finally I called the office and they would not tell me anything but they would call Alex and explain it to him. When I got home and asked him he said he would get money in 5 days. I got an advance from my job to cover our expenses. 

He was also supposed to go to physiotherapy but kept saying it had been moved to a different date. 
 
I contacted some of his friends and asked them to call him and get him out of the house. 

In retrospect I know I should have seen the red flags before. 

The last 6 months have been hell at my work place, due to Covid 19. I have had an extreme work load, I am one of very few workers who is not temporarily laid off. Most of my coworkers are at home. So in this regard I am very lucky. 
When I have gotten home from work, I drive the kids to practice, help with homework, make dinner and clean the house. 

The only thing Alex still does is our finances. I have always hated having anything to do with this and left it to Alex. 

This week Alex has become increasingly apathetic. 
When I got home from work he started talking incoherently. He said there is a fire on the roof and then said the man on the TV was responsible. 
I called the emergency number and drove him to the doctor. On the highway Alex starts screaming at me to stop the car. This scared the shit out of me. He could not explain why and I was able to drive very slowly to the emergency room. 

Once there we had to wait for an hour, during that time he was himself for short periods and he would acknowledge that he needed help and then he would flip to very aggressiv body language and look at me like I’ve never seen him look at anyone. Like he wanted to attack me or worse. It was shocking to have the person that I’ve loved and trusted for my entire adult life lookin at me like that. I didn’t know what to do. 

Finaly we get to see the doctor and he starts asking questions. Alex answers are sometimes normal and then turn very strange. He did not know the date or month nor which city we were in. He was extremely angry about mony and the benefits that he had not recieved. 
The doctor says he is borderline psychotic and Alex agrees to check-in to the psychiatric hospital voluntarily. Since getting an ambulance will take 3 hours I decide I will drive him myself. It’s midnight and I have kids to get up in the morning. Kids know nothing, they think it’s neckpain. 

The drive takes over an hour and Alex becomes more and more strange. Talks about war and just crazy stuff. I drive carefully crying the entire way and not once does he notice. At the hospital I speak to the doctor who says he won’t get medication untill the next day. 

I get home at 4:30 inn the morning. 06:30 I’m getting the kids up and out. I tell them Dad is trying out new treatment at hospital and this will be good for him. 

09:00 the hospital calls and says Alex wants to go home and feels fine. He has not taken any medication and they can not hold him. 

I drive back to the hospital and ask to speak to the psychiatrist. She says I have to take him to his doctor to get him forcibly admitted, she can’t do anything. She asks me if hes an aggressive guy and I say absolutely not. 

I call his doctor and he wants him started on zyprexa right now. (Antipsychotic)

When Alex comes out he does not greet me or hug me, only looks at me with that horrific look. 
I get him to take the medication and we drive to his doctor. Once there he is somewhat himself.

The doctor gives him several prescriptions and also notes the way Alex looks at me. He wants me to try to take him home and if he is not better by morning he’ll have to be committed. We go home and I give him Oksazepam  and he goes to sleep before the kids get home. I still haven’t slept and I’ve contacted his brother to help me when he wakes up. I’m afraid to sleep, so I spend the day waiting for him to wake up. He sleeps for 14 hours. He gets up in the middle of the night and I’m so tired I give him Imovane and he falls asleep. I finally get to sleep for 3 hours before the kids get up. Alex wakes again shortly after the kids leave. He walks outside in the freezing cold in his boxers. I get him inside and give him the antipsychotic medication. I ask him to show me the account where he receives his benefits and he opens it for me and says there is nothing. But I can see he has received it this whole time. But the money is gone now. 

Hours pass and he isn’t getting better and I start to dread the kids seeing their father like this. 
I call a friend who is a nurse, she tells me to get him committed right now. Once it’s the weekend It will be more difficult to do. I call his brother and we get him to the doctor and his brother drives him to the hospital. 

This was Friday. 
The kids do not know. I’ve told them he is trying out new treatments and medication at the hospital for his neck and they have accepted that. 
I should tell them the truth? I want to wait and see if he gets better quickly and then they wont be scared like I am. 

Alex started calling me yesterday. He was angry at me. He wasn’t sick. I tried to tell him he would not say that if he was himself. He would not speak to me like that if he was himself. He hung up. Then he called later and told me how horrible it was at the hospital, and he sounded very sad and he sounded almost normal. He asked me to help him come home. I don’t want to ask them to take away his phone, there isn’t much to do but take medication and look at the phone.  But I wish he wouldn’t call me. I need to breath and think. 
The doctors will evaluate him Monday, that’s the soonest he can come home. Is it possible for him to be okay so soon? Does anyone have experience with this? 

I’ve kept it together in front of the kids, but I fall apart when they are out. I’ve spoken with my parents and some friends and make sure to do that in the garage or laundry room. Saturday I had trouble calming down, my heart rate goes crazy. And I’m afraid of having a heart attack. I’m in good health so it’s unlikely, but I’m flipping out. I’ve already lost weight, I have to force myself to eat. 

I am terrified to go over our accounts. I’ve found several credit cards I didn’t know we had, I know I have to, but I want someone out there to tell me it’s okay to wait one more day. I can’t take much more right now, I don’t want to know what he’s done, I just know it’s not going to be good. 

I don’t know what advice it is I’m looking for, I’ll take anything right now.",22Nov2020,1
559,"I'm M24 my roommate/friend is f23 and her gf is 23 as well. I was sleeping on the couch last night and my roommate/friend is a big paintballer or whatever and has a few paintball guns. They came back kinda drunk last night and I was asleep on the couch, my friends GF took the paintball gun that was in the living room and shot like 5 paint balls at my dick/balls. I was in my boxer briefs so I'm guessing she just aimed at the bulge. I immediately like rolled onto the floor and couldnt even breathe, just was convulsing while my roommate and her gf were fucking laughing their heads off. I couldn't even move and was just shaking/crying on the ground coughing. After like 10 minutes of that they were concerned because my balls clearly ballooned up and I could barely breathe still. I uber'd it to the hospital barely being able to walk and I'm told I could potentially lose my left testicle because of this. 

I am so fucking mad, I texted my friend/roommate about this and how I'm going to call the police etc and her and her GF are begging me not to because it will ruin her life since she wants to be a teacher and cant with a record.

560,"So I‘m 20M and I don‘t really have a reason to take drugs other than that it‘s fun (no fkd-up childhood or traumatic experiences). I started drinking when I was 16, but back then I only did it when I was at parties or on weekends with the homies, when I was 17 I smoked my first joint - I‘m still smoking weed to this day and I don‘t want to quit bc I like being high. 

2017 was also the year I started working as an apprentice in a small construction company, by this time my drinking habits got a little out of control, I started drinking during the week in a bar where you can smoke hookahs, I drank there almost everyday until I barely got home at 2am when I had to wake up at 4am, I somehow survived that for like 6 months without anything bad happening (getting fired for not showing up to work or being late). I somehow got out of bed everyday bc one day I didn‘t want to get up and my mom woke me up and told me „If you can get drunk the night before you can also go to work the next day“.

Sometime during 2017/18 I stopped getting drunk during the week because I got in a fight with the dude I used to get drunk everyday (he was 31 and a really funny dude and also he paid for the most alcohol we consumed so yeah I guess we were homies haha) but eventhough my drinking stopped completely I got really into weed and so I did that until today with a few months sober in between due to the military, while I couldn‘t smoke because of my duty I didn‘t fully quit the chemical drugs I tried out before (around 2019). I loved them even more because it‘s like 15bucks for ecstasy and they keep you high and happy for a whole night while you would need 200bucks for the same amount of fun in a club for a night.

So yeah I had my chemical drug phase (cocaine, ecstasy, mdma, oxycodon, codeine, xanax) but I don‘t think this was a phase, the last months I had a little down, financially, so I couldn‘t really purchase any drugs but I somehow, eventhough I struggled with money, still got drunk everyday, I think I haven‘t been completly sober for like a year and a half (during military I also tried to get a little high with painkillers, didn‘t work tho).

So now as I‘m writing this I still get drunk everyday &amp; smoke weed everyday until I black out in my bed and the next morning I wake up with like 4hours of sleep and 10 hours of work I have to do &amp; I don‘t want to stop taking drugs because they make me feel good when I feel like I have lost all my fun in life. Everyday is just another day in this hamsterwheel we call life, everyday I get up to do the same shit for the same people at the same construction site, I go there, I work, I start drinking, I get drunk, I drive home, I drink even more and smoke weed, I can‘t go out right now because my country is on lockdown, I haven‘t seen my friends in a month or so, I don‘t even remember the last time I‘ve seen any of my friends bc I‘m drunk/high like everyday but I don‘t really feel bad for that, I feel bad that I can‘t find anything else that gives me such joy like drugs? I started MMA Training 2 days before the lockdown came, I loved it but now I can‘t even do this anymore.

That was basically a lil backstory of my life before I recall my question from earlier: Why is it so much fun taking drugs? Why do I only have fun taking drugs? Why do I hate being sober? Why do I not care that my body is basically 99% beer by that point? (because I drink more beer than any other liquid) Why do I not care that I don‘t remember things I said yesterday? Why do I not care that I don‘t see a future for myself? Why do I not care about work, love or friends and just about getting high/drunk?

To clarify: I‘m still somehow a functioning human being, eventhough I don‘t like socializing I do it once in a while (not while lockdown tho).
I still have my job, I still go to work everyday, I pay my bills, I shower, I keep in touch with my family, I somehow didn‘t end up in jail nor did  I anything bad other than fucking up my own health.",22Nov2020,1

So it’s almost Christmas my mother wants to do more arts and crafts type stuff to entertain us or whatever because of lockdown.

Anyway she found these salt dough things (tree decoration) I had to make all the doughs for everyone we added scents we did one vanilla and two mints.

It was me and my two younger sisters who where mostly making it, the littlest called the vanilla my other called one mint so I said well then this ones mine.

And my littlest sister screamed you can’t take the mint I want it.

To which my dad said don’t listen to (my name) she’s not the boss she always lies.

I freaked out and left they called me down and told me I couldn’t call the mint flavour everyone could’ve it when I was talking about the dough.

I freaked out again and walked upstairs my dad said I needed to own up to my mistake when they where the ones who weren’t listening to me they where the ones reacting before they even saw everything.

Idk is that me like they are saying?

Am I the one freaking out for nothing? 

I know this is a stupid reason to fight but I just don’t wanna be down graded like that specially because of something so stupid.

If it’s my fault how should I apologize or make it up to them instead of sitting in my room crying well they are having fun not nothing to try and understand better.

Am I over reacting?

I help him with the yard work, chores, grocery shopping, cooking, etc.. meanwhile my selfish, lazy, narcissistic brother doesn’t lift a damn finger. He doesn’t even clean his room.. ive recently been in a car accident &amp; have a messed up back &amp; neck from it.. not to mention I’ve been diagnosed with varicose veins recently as well. But doing all these things on my own when theres a person who is able bodied but not pulling their own weight is very annoying. If I moved out I would get an apartment anyway &amp; the chores wouldn’t be half as bad.. no yardwork .. my own laundry &amp; shit you know? Plus.. I would get to know what it feels like to have a place to myself. &amp; maybe start being able to work on some positive mental health because my living environment is the most negative place you can imagine. No ones ever happy here. But even if I moved out i would feel sad as hell knowing I left pops with virtually no one.. my brother makes good money &amp; doesn’t even buy his own groceries .. he asks pops to buy him shit when pops has little to no money. It’s sick. The guy trims his ball hair and leaves it all over the sink, shower &amp; toilet (which he doesn’t even know how to flush apparently) I’m always cleaning up after him. He cooks .. uses my food.. and makes a mess of the tables and counter tops.. and asks me to wash his dishes like wtf dude you’re 27 lol. Just imagine that all the time every instance I gotta clean up after the man. It’s ridiculous. But enough of that I guess anyone reading will understand. I just don’t know what to do .. I’m so tired of this bullshit but I don’t want to leave pops alone.",22Nov2020,1

571,"First time posting, please forgive me if I don't format things correctly. Someone recommended me this subreddit through another post I made, so I thought I would put this here and try to gather some advice :)

Okay so, brief background, I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, I have been living with him for the last 2. Things have been good up until recently, a few days ago, I found out that he purposefully broke a bag of my expensive makeup, he originally said it was an accident, but after another long conversation, decided to be truthful and told me he was upset and did it on purpose. He did eventually apologies the day after, as he knew I called my mum and told her what happened.

I'm struggling because I love him, he's my first boyfriend, my first true love, he's never hurt me, never hit me, and I'm scared of being alone. A part of me knows this isn't right (what he did) but also another part of me thinks I may have somehow caused him to have to break that makeup (for example, sometimes I take too long to put it on, he doesn't like me in makeup that much unless it's natural) I feel as though I made my bed and I should lie in it, if that makes sense? 

I don't have many friends, my parents live overseas, when I spoke to my mum, she told me I'm always welcome back home, but with the current situation happening, I don't see myself going back (I also go to school and work here.)

I'm not sure what advice I'm even looking for at this moment, I don't feel unsafe with my boyfriend, but I don't feel 100% comfortable either. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation before? What would the best path be for me to take? I just need some reassurance and to get my head straight I think.

TL;DR: my boyfriend came clean and told me he broke my makeup collection because he was upset, I know what he did isn't good, but I'm struggling to find myself and leave him due to circumstances and the fact that I love him very much.

I have a boyfriend and we've been together for years now. I love him a lot and we almost never have issues with our relationship. We have an online best friend that we spend most of our time with every time we play videogames. But we don't know him in real life, not even pictures. But we all care about each other a lot.

My problem here is that I don't know why I fell in love with our best friend. I have never seen him and all I know about him is his voice, but something made me fall in love with him and I think a lot about him all the time.

I have always been loyal and can't see myself cheating at all. But this feeling is breaking me inside. I know I would not be able to be with the other guy (best friend) in a relationship, I can't see it possible and I feel like he doesn't like me at all in a romantic way. I also don't want to break my boyfriend's heart.

But I think about him a lot more than I think of my boyfriend. What's wrong with me? Why do I have such impossible fantasies? What should I do? ):

577,"Hey,

So I will start hitting the gym this week. I have been doing 100 pushups, sit-ups and body squats everyday (except from Sundays) and eating 3 meals a day only. I'll start hitting the gym because I want to make a physical significant change which people can really notice and as a personal challenge. 

Since I do not have any experience, I'm hoping somebody who does answers and gives a wise advice. So, what I will be doing is:

DIET

I'll start eating 4-5 heavy meals a day for 2 weeks or so to gain weight. I am considered a skinny-normal guy. I weight 62 kg now, and I hope to get to 70. After those 2 weeks I'll get back to 3 meals per day with no snacking.

WORKOUT

I'll be going 4 days a week following this plan:

MONDAY, THURSDAY AND SUNDAY - Rest.

TUESDAY AND FRIDAY - Military press, barbell curls and squats.

WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY - Bench press, deadlifts and chinups.

Every exercise will be done by 5 sets of 5 reps adding weight until I reach my max (the point where I feel I cannot lift heavier) and then stick to it and perform 5 singles with a rest period of 45 seconds to 1 minute, BUT NO LONGER.

I will also be throwing some pushups and sit-ups here and there as well as getting good sleep, but this is the general idea.

If you have experience in body building or weight training, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK and whether or not YOU BELIEVE I'LL GET RESULTS as well as WHEN.

Thanks.",22Nov2020,1

She got real quiet and was saying much I was doing most of the talking and really wasn’t responding. She then said she had to go and would call me back and to my surprise again she called me back but it was more of the same talking in the beginning then silence for like 30 with just background noise. I started getting upset but I tried to not to come off like needy she then had to go again and she did call me back again and this it was more of same but this time I hung up the phone because it sound like she wasn’t in the run she then messaged me back saying “my bad” I texted you left without texting me back she said “I had to wash my face” and then wrote back “you don’t want to be on the phone” cause I had called back after I hung up then replied back “I don’t wanna be on the phone” I replied “Is it me just tell me”  she then says “I have my moments for it n U talk to much” now to be fair I do talk a lot.

Question:
         Okay please don’t judge me lol. I’m currently 3 months pregnant. I’m a little skeptical about everything. My bf and I have been together 10 years and this is our third child together. Just this past weekend, he went out of town with his brother and friends to Atlanta. His brother planned this trip for him for his bday. While he was out there I spoke to him every morning when I woke up and every night before I went to bed. (I didn’t bother him too much durning the day because I wanted him to have a good time and didn’t want to have him on the phone the whole time). So when he came back I noticed he added a girl who i later found out was in Atlanta at the time he went out there (saw videos) she was at a party he attended but was dancing and touching on one of his friends. I have his ig password. So I just simply unfollowed the girl. Wel he went and added her again. Weird. So I unfollowed her again. I didn’t see any messages on his fb or ig, nor did I find anything inappropriate. But what I found strange last night was his phone went off (a notification) about 3 times last night/ early morning. And the notification could be anything an email, an app, text. Anything. And he didn’t go to sleep until 4 am (he stays up late all the time latest is usually 3 am). My question is am I trippin??? Or should I ask him what’s going on? And how do I approach him about it if so?

Answer:
           This reminds me of the cat that sat on the hot stove top. For the rest of that cats life it never sat on another hot stove top again. But it never stood on a cold one either. That's how are brains work if we let it. You get cheated on. You get hurt. Then from then on, your mind won't let you forget it. It's always look for a stove top that might be hot. Any action you see, you'll see evidence of cheating.
          It's funny how people get cheated on when they don't see the evidence of cheating. It could happen over and over, and they never see those signs. But when they're wrongfully accusing someone of cheating they see what they think are signs clear as day. But in reality, all you're doing is slowly killing your relationship. Think about how it feels to be called a liar or a cheater. And no matter what you do or say they keep calling you a cheater or a liar. It would drive you insane! Same with your boyfriend. I'm not saying he didn't cheat. I'm saying invading his privacy by just going into his inbox and deleting what you want is a level of control that drives people to cheat or just leave.
          What I suggest is to talk to him. Tell him you're feeling jealous and insecure. Then ask him who the girl is, but make sure to watch the tone. You don't want him to feel interagated. If he doesn't feel like you'll freak out and start going through his inbox if he tells you something he'll be more trusting and more open. Less boundaries for you because he wont need to hide anything. Believe it or not, even if he's not cheating, people do hide things from an over controlling partner. Just because they don't want to go through the emotional hurricane of emotion that is you trying to put your partners life the way you prefer it.",22Nov2020,1

Hello I'm an 18 f and recently single. Yesterday was my first time having casual sex with my coworker, 26 m. I've only had sex with one boy whom I dated for 2 years, and he treated me like a princess, and yesterday I had sex in a car with a so much older guy and it was like ""okay, bye"" and I know all he wanted was sex and me too but I just feel dirty!!! Like I feel the world is judging me for being dirty idk. What do you guys think of this? Am I considered a slut? Is what I'm doing truly bad?

Answer

We all have this self image in our mind. That self image tells us who we are from looks, to personality, even your morals. When you do stuff that goes against your self image, when you do something that, in your opinion, a person wouldn't do, you have kind of a self crisis. Your mind starts falling apart because you're literally losing the image of yourself. Casual sex isn't bad. It depends on the person and their beliefs. You're clearly beating yourself up about this. It sounds like, as of right now, you're not ready for casual sex. Whether you'll ever be ready for it or not all depends on the person you become. But right now if you keep having casual sex youre just going to develop a self hatred. Try friends with benefits. The friends part being the important part. Find someone who you can have a connection with. Doesn't have to be a bf. But it sounds like you're more the bf type. ",22Nov2020,1
597,"For context Im turning 16 soon... never been in a relationship, not because I can’t talk to girls just because I’m that type of person who doesn’t rush things and I want to find the right one.

I met this girl about 4 months ago, she is stunning and her personality is amazing and she’s the type of person I just clicked with instantly, none of that really awkward small talk. I would talk to her all day everyday doing that typical teenage thing of staying up really late and I’d just be talking to her. I genuinely like her and I think she ‘liked’ me too. She is very ‘emotionally unstable’ but I don’t blame her, from what she’s told me her ex was a right piece of work, manipulative, cheated on her etc etc. he’d sometimes message her and she’d always tell me and be like ‘Do you want me to block him’ however personally I don’t think I should be the one to tell her who to block and what not so I just said it was up to her. 

Fast forward to around 3 weeks ago, she was ‘off’ she would take hours to reply and say she was fine etc for the whole week, I was in the car on my way back from a football match and she messaged me and we talk all day and she eventually says a lot has gone on this week and I’m sorry I really want to tell you but I just can’t.

Anyhow we talk like normal until last saturday. I woke up, we spoke for an hour and she ignored me. Eventually I ask her friends if she’s okay because I knew something was wrong and then she messaged me to tell me to stop messaging them so I do and eventually she talks later. Then on sunday she does the same, I ask her friends etc and I eventually tell her I like her. So that happens and I get a response a couple hours later and she just shrugs it off. I sent her a voice message and she says she’s on face time so she can’t listen... i thought it was weird because she always uses her laptop to facetime mates. I asked her why she was using her laptop and she says ‘HIS calls don’t come through’ and who was it... her ex, she was facetiming her ex.

I’ve never been jealous of her having guy mates I have girl mates so I like to think she wouldn’t be jealous either but I told her and I said ‘look It’s heartbreaking for me considering I told you I liked you and it’s like a big F you’ type of thing. Anyways we argued and she said ‘you don’t get to control wether or not I can be friends with my ex’ etc

I hadn’t heard from her all of this week until friday She messaged me. We talked like nothing happened and then last night around 2 (we were sending voice notes on snapchat) I can’t listen i’m on facetime. Yeah I suspected it was with her ex. She says she’ll text me today and I’ve been on delivered for 8 hours with not a single word from her.

I missed her when we didn’t talk and I genuinely like her but I just don’t want to go through a heartbreak if she chooses her ‘toxic’ ex and just forgets about me.

599,"Alright so I'll start straight with the point, I'm 14 years old and have had a femdom kink ever since I was very young. The weird thing is that a lot of people claim that these kinks are a result of a root cause, but personally I thought a lot about it but didn't find anything to be honest.

600,"I sell roofs direct to consumers via in home sales demos. Last Friday I met a man in his late 60s who needed a roof, and I sold him one. 
During the course of the presentation, I discovered his wife died last year in tragic circumstances, but he currently has a girlfriend. In my industry, it is important to have all decision makers present, so dug a little bit into who she was and if she needed to be there.

Turns out after his wife died he got on eHarmony and started going on some dates locally. He went on a few but then all of a sudden Sandra(fake name) popped up by messaging him directly. Nothing to funky so far, until I found out that Sandra lives in South Carolina (we are in the Pacific North West) and is 43 with a 7 year old. And just happened to message a 67 year old guy from across the country out of the blue. First alarm bell.

 So I threw him a bone and said ""Well you guys must zoom or video chat a lot then?"", Praying that he would say of course! But alas, this 43 year old isn't too good with technology and doesn't know how to work zoom. ""Ok then, well you must talk on the phone a lot?"" Nope, he only tried once or twice and it's really scratchy sounding and her London accent makes it hard to understand her, so they mainly communicate via texting. 

He proceeded to show me pictures of her, pretty generic pictures of a woman who had no business texting a 67 year old across the country. The man is in love, is convinced she is going to move across the country and they are going to buy a house together. He has a look of pure happiness when he talks about her.

They have a partner, (both them and their partner are my friends) and I’m happy for them, I really am, but it makes me so sad for some reason. I feel like they’ll leave me for them and seeing them gush about each other makes me so upset, I assume from jealousy.

I‘m not an abuser, if I fall in love with a girl I would do anything for her and I wouldn‘t ever do anything that would hurt these girls, I just found them more appeling to me, it‘s still harder dating those girls because they are going through some shit I can‘t personally relate but I don‘t know something about being emotionally damaged just makes them more interesting to me? Am I just an asshole? I don‘t think that I am because if i talk to a girl/see a girl i like than i mostly don‘t know they‘re emotionally damaged, I only get to know about their baggage after we start dating but I haven‘t had a single girl who was balanced with her life, every one of them had some sort of baggage that they have to deal with that left them scarred for life.

We have an online best friend that we spend most of our time with every time we play videogames. But we don't know him in real life, not even pictures. But we all care about each other a lot.

My problem here is that I don't know why I fell in love with our best friend. I have never seen him and all I know about him is his voice, but something made me fall in love with him and I think a lot about him all the time.

I have always been loyal and can't see myself cheating at all. But this feeling is breaking me inside. I know I would not be able to be with the other guy (best friend) in a relationship, I can't see it possible and I feel like he doesn't like me at all in a romantic way.

617,"I (F23) usually think my roommate (F25) is a very compassionate person, but this pandemic is revealing a really ugly side to her. She doesn't care how many people have died, because, in her words, ""people die all the time."" When I found out my boss had symptoms of Covid and I told people at my church and internship about it, she said I shouldn't have because now they're gonna make me wait for his results to come back. Which, yeah, that's the entire point. She also said that if I have it then she probably has it, but she's still going to church and all her usual things. She didn't even think I should get tested. I said that if he tests positive, then I'm getting tested, and if I'm positive, we both need to quarantine. She just replied ""Well that's not gonna to happen.""

Honestly, by her own admission, if one of us gets it then we'll both have it, so I already thought she should be quarantining, but she wasn't budging. Now, my boss's results came back positive. For the past couple of days I've also been sick with symptoms, which she thinks is in my head even though I'm clearly sick by the sound of my voice, sinuses, cough, all that. I'm getting tested on Tuesday. Currently, she's out with her friends somewhere. 

I think that even if my results come back positive, she'll keep on doing what she's doing and refuse to get tested. Even our church has gone back online and our state is reinstating restrictions. She works in a hospital (rad tech) and sees how the hospital is overflowing right now. She told me that they're having to ""room"" patients in the hallways, and that cases are spiking like crazy. I said that, considering all that she's seeing, I just don't understand how she doesn't care. Literally, she just looks at me and says ""I don't know."" 

Genuinely, I don't know how to get this through her head enough to at least make sure she's not a risk to other people. She sees her grandma on the regular and is visiting her extended family for a big Thanksgiving get together, but won't take precautions to lessen the chance of giving them Covid?

&amp;#x200B;

That basically describes my life. Simply put, people make me really fucking sick, in every sense of the word.

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously want to understand why people are the way they are because allegedly its supposed to ""help me live a happier life"" but I don't see it. I can't see it. Think about it: greed, war, discrimination, bullying, murder, rape, child exploitation. It all happens and humans are all responsible for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone has a past, sure, but that doesn't and will NEVER give you license to be an asshole. Unfortunately people either don't know this or outright disregard it. I can name so many people who've been hurt in their past but think its okay to go around hurting other people. I can name others that DEFEND that kind of bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No political ideology is correct, and every last country on this planet is corrupt in some way shape or form, ESPECIALLY AMERICA. I despise countries born from hate and discrimination. 300+ years of slavery. Slavery of my ancestors. Yet we don't get shit out of it even when the slaves are free and when Jim Crow laws end. We still get the short end of the stick. All we have to our name is a month dedicated to it, most of it either being lies or hidden information. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. Hell, this entire country was stolen from the Native Americans but we're still taught in school to act like Columbus was some hero.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There's so much greed in the world too. You see so many people talk about giving back to the community yet either the community their giving back to is corrupt bullshit, or they're giving back to the wrong community. Like it or not, there are still countless starving children in third world countries. You don't see people donating to them or setting up charity funds for them. Instead let's donate to help Beyonce get out of the fucking hospital (yes I know that was never a thing but that's the extent of how stupid people can be).

&amp;#x200B;

Of course we can't stop without talking about the wars. WWI had an estimated 40 million deaths. WWII had an estimated 85 million deaths. ""humans are good at heart"" my ass. The Vietnam War (which had innocent American males that were forced to enlist in once they turned 18 and if you didn't you could face jail time, basically meaning death or death) had an estimated 1 million deaths. All of these wars in total had 126,300,000 deaths. And that's not even counting the side effects of these wars, or even the other wars. ALL OF THIS was caused by humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

COVID-19. We have an incompetent president that's about to be succeeded by another incompetent president, and as a result we have over 200K deaths here. Other countries are practicing social distancing and masking and even the country that started all of this only has about 4,000 and not many cases as of recent. but I guess HUMAN AMERICAN civilians are too fucking braindead to do that at all. I don't give a fuck about your ideology or ""freedoms"", people are dying really slow and painful deaths because you don't want to follow guidelines. Children are losing their parents because of this. WHAT IS WRONG WITH HUMANS!?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm talking mostly about America but other countries suck too. With a literal push of a button, North Korea and Russia can annihilate us. They WANT to annihilate us. Including but not limited to the innocent children that have done nothing wrong. And again, that's barely scratching the surface.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sensitive topics, you have been warned: &gt;!Child molesters, serial killers, rapists, all of them rarely get the punishment they deserve. They're either being defended by braindead idiots, or pardoned by the justice system. Hell, pedophilia is LEGAL in some countries. No one dares to try to help the victims. No one dares to gather the evidence required to give the assholes in question their divine punishment. Instead, lets give the psychopath who just killed a whole innocent family parole. Lets give the bus driver that hit-and-run and killed 3 kids and smiled about it only a few years (not making this up, that happened). Let's only give the white police officer that broke into an innocent black man's house and killed him for NO REASON, a few years (again, not making this shit up). Let's completely free the psychotic maniac that killed multiple innocent people at a protest (you get the idea). I'm 100% sure Kyle Rittenhouse would have been thrown under the jail if he was black.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Every last thing I discussed on this post was a fault to HUMANITY. The only people I don't count as part of the problem are innocent children. However, what scares me is that those kids will grow up to become... god knows what.

627,"Hi, I am a 22M and my girlfriend recently broke up with me. The reason for this was due to the lockdown (UK) and other reasons I began to feel depressed and paranoid and when she was trying to help and offer advice I was very cold to her. We didn't live together, as we are from different cities, and we hadn't seen each other since early September.

I sent something and realised it was too much, and called her to apologise, but she was very upset and said she wanted time to think. A few days later, we call and she says she has decided that she can't see us being together after this (I have upset her before due to the paranoia), as she can't keep going through this every year. We have been together nearly two years.

I did the worst thing possible, messaged and called begging her to give me another chance, and she said I'm making it harder than it has to be, and she decided to block me. We haven't spoken since then, it has been about 3 days since then.

This time has made me realise how much she means to me, and I really can't see myself being with anyone else. I know it hasn't been long but we were really good together 99% of the time, never argued etc. and she is the only person I've met in 5+ years that I would ever be interested in.

I am hoping that she will unblock me at some point, and we can have a chance to talk, but she can be stubborn and I worry she may never unblock me. But either way, I have come up with an idea to help both myself and the relationship.

I think I am going to write her a letter (a real one), whether she unblocks me or not, pretty much saying:

* I'm sorry for the way I treated you
* I'm sorry for being selfish and not considering how you were feeling during this time, and how my reactions to you felt
* You deserve better than that
* I am sorting myself out, with therapy and lifestyle changes, so that I will never reach that point in my mental state again
* I still love you
* Although I am making these changes for myself to be a better person, and a person I am happy to be, I also hope that I can do it for us, so I can make you happy too
* But this is completely up to you, if you do not love me anymore that is completely your choice

I will not send this until at least 3 weeks have passed, as I want a headstart on sorting myself out, and for her to have some time to herself without me. Everything I am saying is true, I have booked therapy and have begun going for walks twice a day. I also intend to rejoin the gym once the lockdown is finished.

All I want to ask to any ladies out there, would you give someone a second chance if they did this? I am not expecting everything to go back to normal, and I am fine with starting again with dating etc. before getting serious again. But I really love this girl, and I am terrified to lose her forever.

I'm an overly sensitive person, so I tend to cry over every emotion. Stressed? Tears. Sentimental? Tears. Frustrated? Tears. Pissed? Tears. 

I don't think it's just the hormones tbh, I've been like this most of my life. When I get frustrated or stressed I start crying, annoying my family - and when they point it out, it urges me to cry even more. We've even sparked large arguments solely because I got too emotional during a conflict. 

It just feels so out of my control, and it's so hard for me to calm down and get out of my crying mood, especially when there's people around me. I also overly worry and stress over things I probably shouldn't stress about. People also take me less seriously if I talk or make points in between sobs.

630,"There’s this new girl in my grade who gives off a ton of red flags. She’s dmed me a bunch and it’s nothing but bad vibes. Superficially nice and chatty, self-righteous “nihilist”/ self-described bad person, and overall just seems pretty toxic for a lot of specific reasons. In the first actual conversation I had with her, she randomly sent some obviously personal/weird videos a few of her friends had sent her, screen-capped from a WhatsApp dm, for instance. After talking to some of my friends about her, it’s not surprising that she appears to dm literally anyone who shows up in her feed on instagram and tries to “befriend” them and/or seduce them (deadass told my friend, who she had never spoken to or even met, that he was her type and asked to smash completely out of nowhere, lmao. Not necessarily a bad thing but just really weird). She constantly posts albums of revealing selfies, feeds off of validation etc. I’m not one to judge a person for how they express themselves and their sexuality, but everything about this person screams toxic and attention-seeking, and I’ve talked with her enough in dms that I’m not just making a book-cover judgement.

Obviously I choose personally to steer away from this person, but now one of my friends (F) has been getting chatted up by her and seems pretty wooed. I’ve known this person for a while and we’re very close friends, and I care about her a lot. The friend in question has had a few toxic friendships in the past and is still a bit messed up by it, and seems to have a slightly skewed perception of friendship and relationships. I want to warn her about this person, who I’m afraid could be dangerous to her, but at the same time I’ve made mistakes in the past when trying to control my friends and lead them down what I think is the best path. Would a gentle warning about this person - not a vilification, just a warning/ some observations - be out of line? People can make their own decisions and I can’t possibly know what is best for them, nor can I correctly assume the real nature of a person without knowing them very closely. It seems better not to ever meddle in people’s friendships, but at the same time I feel like I could give my friend my own honest perspective and she could use it to make the best decision for herself. Or she could just be insulted and lose respect for me as I’ve technically insulted her friend, although they’ve only been talking for like a few weeks max.

No matter what I feel like sort of an asshole for even thinking about any of this like it’s my problem to keep my friend “safe” or it’s my place to judge the behavior of someone I’ve only had a few conversations with. Any advice is appreciated.",22Nov2020,1

However, im currently very busy because i am in grade 12 and currently applying to universities. Along with covid and other school responsibilities, im quite busy, so i feel like i cant do this for free in my own time.

She's generally a person who carries a lot of self-doubt, so is struggling with could she have done any more, is she grieving too hard/too long,  is she a burden to the rest of the family being sad all the time.... we want her to understand she can take all the time in the world to be sad. 

Would you have appreciated lots of reaching out, phone calls, or is that a reminder which she might not want if she's having a good day and we should just let her know she can call us any time if she's upset? As she and my husband didn't used to speak that often in between visits so if we call now I feel like they automatically feel that it's a sad checking-up-on-eachother call.

637,"On Fridays, we are emailed a set of questions that we must be prepared to answer every Monday. We get randomly called on. The thing is, I feel anxiety the minute I receive that email because I dread being called on randomly. Sometimes I can't even enjoy the weekend because this is ALL I think about. Even though I fully prepare myself, I still get extreme anxiety leading up to Monday, and it peaks when I'm actually in class. I hear my heart pounding, my pulse rises like crazy, I feel a knot in my throat, my hands get shaky, I get nauseous, I loose all concentration. 

Should I give my instructor a heads up about this? My main concern is that I cannot focus on the lecture because I'm so anxious about having my answer ready. So if I notify her, and at least ask when I'll be called on, or if I can be called on first and get it out of the way, I think that would ease some weight. I guess I don't want the professfors to think I'm ""exaggerating"" and just deal with it... For reference, this is a nursing program.",22Nov2020,1

639,"I will turn 20 in about 3 months and im terrified. At 18 I was really excited to be an adult but now that I'm close to being one im scared. I feel like once I leave my teenage years behind I'm expected to be a lot more mature and act like an 'adult' . I look 15 and sound 13 and act like im 18 so most people still mistake me for a 15-18 year old so I feel like I wouldnt fit into the adult world.

I also have depression and always thought that I wouldnt live to see 20.

I had a great childhood ( except for a few things) and Really enjoyed living as a teenager so maybe this has something to do with my 'phobia' of growing older.

Here is another problem. Ive been preparing for my pre med exams for the last 1 year (started right after high school) which means I still havent started college. All my friends that havent opted for the medical route are now in their 3rd year of college which makes me feel like a loser.

640,"I’m not the best at grammar and formatting, so please pardon the following mistakes. 

I’ve known my friend for about 3 years. She was my only friend for a while as I have a habit of finding people who treat me better than my previous friends. I cut a lot of people of when I grow a close bond with someone because I feel I’m too critical of people’s actions. I feel like I have an ‘awkward radar’ that no one else has. I do have black and white thinking, so there have been several times I’ve needed a break from her or else I would lash out. I’ve gone through cycles of friends, each one helping me cut out the toxic in my life, then they eventually act the same way. I have a new male friend who is strictly platonic and he is a mirror of me. We are so sensitive to each other’s needs and validate each other. We can communicate without arguing, and apologise for our faults. He will be my unborn child’s godfather. However, this instance happened long before him. I started feeling some type of way since she told me “ugh, I knew you were gonna say that. Social anxiety isn’t real. If you had it, you wouldn’t even leave the house.” I don’t leave the house, but I’d take a half hour bus ride to her house. She says she loves me, and I’m the best friend anyone could have. She introduced me to her friends and they claim me their “angel sent from heaven”. I don’t really do anything spectacular, their friendship group is just toxic. I got annoyed when she explained “sorry I talk over you sometimes, I just wanna finish before the topic finishes”. I just nod and smile. I am now uncomfortable around her and feel like her company is a chore. I also do her chores and favours because everyone knows I’ll say yes. She tries her best to reach out, but I can’t talk to her without making plans that I know I’ll never attend. I know some of you will tell me to talk to her about how I feel but I absolutely can not! I know how she will behave and I’m just not ready for that, my body reacts to her like she’s an abuser for unrelated issues already. I’m stuck in a cycle of just acting like I’m offline indefinitely or blocking all her and her friends, some of them I love. I know how she’d feel, I stayed with her for 1 month straight when my parents and I were fighting, I’m scared she’ll use that against me. We were 16 back then, now it’s different. I feel like we’ve run out of things to talk about since we talked a lot before. I feel like I’m rambling but in the end, I think no matter what I do, it’ll be ghosting her without confrontation. I’m already in the midst of staying offline and lowkey ghosting her.. but I’m trapped. I’ve decided to not reply to any comments or I might sound defensive, this is just a defence mechanism.

I know this is a strange topic but I need some advice.

For background, All through this year I've been struggling with stress, and while it's nothing new for me, added 2020 stress didn't help... I've also found myself at loggerheads all year with my boss, who I found to be really unsupportive, even though she knows i was struggling, so I had raised a grievance with HR about it to try intervene. Recently I had a bit of a meltdown and I've been off work for four weeks on medical leave. I've one more week off before I return but I've already begun applying for other jobs as the thought of returning now triggers anxiety.

I have a review meeting with HR before I'm due back where they want to discuss the grievance and my fitness to return to work, but every time I think about returning I get upset, and if I'm talking about it to someone (my BF, mam, doctor, best friend, HR Dept) I just start crying, which is embarrassing (I'm 30F)

My doctor says I just need to leave the job, simple, but I don't have something to fall back on.

Before my meltdown they offered me the option to negotiate a settlement sum and leave the job amicably. I'd hoped to find a new job and take whatever they offered but since I've not had any new offers I think I'll have to negotiate a sum, but I have 0 ideas where to start, or even a ballpark what to ask for.

I'm also not sure how far to trust my HR person to look out for me; I know they'll open it up to me to give the starting figure so I don't know if I should ask a few months salary, a few weeks etc?

Its not redundancy so I don't know if there's precedent?? Any advice?",22Nov2020,1

Although I have been working from home throughout, he has been out of work and the financial burden has fallen to me. Unfortunately my salary won’t realistically sustain our life here for very long and the odds of him getting a job any time soon seem to be getting slimmer.

We are mid-30s based in London.

I’ve suffered with depression on and off and anxiety for years, he’s developed it more recently but it’s now gotten worryingly bad. I fear he may be having a breakdown, but he is unwilling to get help. 

The flat we are living in is horrible. There’s a LOT of noise throughout the day. It’s impossible to relax and we’re both incredibly stressed and on edge. His mental state is declining quickly, and I’m barely holding on while trying to take care of both of us.. 

Our lease is due to end in March, and we’ve been trying to make a clear plan for what’s next (mainly leaving London is looking likely) but I now don’t think we can hold on that long.

We’ve been going round and around in circles trying to make a decision but we’re exhausted, and now are considering packing up and going to stay with my family for a little while, to try and take a mental break and see where we go from there ... it may not be the most practical of plans, or the best in terms of our finances but for our mental health I’m feeling like we don’t really have any other choice. 

I’m aware there will be cost implications if we leave the flat before the lease ends, but aside from that, is it OK that we just pack up and leave and face the consequences later or are we taking too huge of a risk?

648," I (22F) am visiting Mom for Thanksgiving. She (strongly) hinted that she knew about the fact I use pot, asked me if I use a vape-pen. I kinda panic-deflected by saying I don't vape without actually lying. (the subject was brought up bc she found a weed-patterned mask on ground while walking that she brought home, disinfected, and gifted to me, so not pointedly out of the blue, but...)

I know the whole lying to parents conundrum sounds very juvenile, but she and I have a good relationship that I don’t want to hurt. more importantly, my family has a history of alcoholism, and she just had to put sibling into rehab, a decision whose predecessor was month of sibling being awful and blatantly lying about her drinking habits. Like she would be falling down drunk, mean as a snake and claim she hadn't had a drop. I'm trying really hard to be supportive to Mom right now, cause she's been taking that really hard. My dad was a deadbeat alcoholic for a number of years who while less verbally and physically confrontation than sibling would frequently claim heatstroke (vs booze) so lying about substance habits is a very sore point to her. 

Mom is fine with me drinking bc I'm of age and only really drink socially, and in moderation. However, weed is still illegal in our state except for medical issues, and Mom is fairly moderate and can be a stickler for rules. I pay for everything for myself except healthcare/insurance, so it's not like I'm using her money &amp; am also very careful about not having an unhealthy dependence, but it's the middle of a pandemic, so I never leave my apt and a nice brownie a few hours before bed is a great way to have fun and compensate for only seeing people when I go to the grocery. 

I desperately don't want to lie to her bc she's had enough of that, and I want to be a trustworthy support system for her. But also I want to have a good visit to her, and don't want her to be upset/worried about me for using 'illegal gateway drugs'. Sibling's ex who had been staying with us to work before the whole downward-spiral-rehab clusterfuck said she was pretty sure Mom knew and didn't care bc I'm the golden child by virtue of the super-low bar of not being awful and wasn't abusing pot. I have the emotional intelligence and people skills of a brick, so no idea if she's right or not. if she is right, then Mom will know I'm lying if I say no, which is lose-lose.

ideally, mom will drop subject. not ideally, it'll come up again. I desperately do not want to give her a reason not to trust my word. Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.",22Nov2020,1

651,"So, my girlfriend is begging to get a puppy. This is no surpise to me as she grew up with 2 caucasian shepherds and 3 manchester terriers, but here's the problem; I absolutely don't want to get a dog right now or in near future.

All of this started when my girlfriend's mom's friend (I'll call her ""F"" for short) announced that her dog is going to have puppies soon. F is breeding manchester terriers, so my gf is familiar with this breed already. However, those dogs are ***so*** energetic. I've literally never seen such energetic dogs before. They're rather small dogs, but they're not exactly easy. They also require **a lot** of attention.

I have no doubts that my gf would take very good care of a dog, but the timing is so bad. The puppies are already born and they'll be up for adoption in only a couple weeks. My gf is 14 weeks pregnant though and a puppy is going to cause so much stress. I know that she wants a puppy really bad, she spends almost all of her time at F's house and plays with the dogs, but as I said: the timing is horrible.

My gf is really upset about me not wanting a dog and especially now that she's pregnant she gets emotional really fast. The last thing I want to do is make her cry, but a puppy would bascially be a second baby for us.

How can I convince her not to get a puppy? Maybe someone even has a different opinion on this situation. If so, please let me know.

(In case I made a major grammar mistake; english is not my first language.)

653,"I've been so unreasonably sad and lonely after an online friend seems to have cut off contact with me, and I just want some advice on what to do, or to hear someone else's take on this. I didn't think I would feel this heartbroken over someone I've never met irl, but I feel like my mental state is tanking so hard right now. (TL;DR at bottom)

Basically, I started messaging someone online at the start of the year after seeing that we had the virtually the same taste in fandoms, tropes/ships, and writing. This is a side of myself I've never revealed to anyone else in my life, and not my irl friends, because there's definitely a stigma to being a ""fangirl"" that I've just sensed in growing up in my community. The content we both enjoyed didn't have the biggest following, so I found myself pouring a lot of giddy happiness to this person and sending late night messages for hours like I'd never really experienced in a friendship.

After a bit, I got the sense that my online friend was struggling with some mental health demons + difficult events in their life (esp w/ 2020), even if they only hinted at it in their conversations with me and didn't address it directly. I tried my best to be supportive and tell them I'd always be open to talk, but I didn't really know how to approach the situation beyond that. They started taking longer absences between our rounds of messages, and I could only hope that they were doing alright, but every month or so they would reply with full enthusiasm again, and those days were always the ones I can remember being so excited and happy over.

Recently they told me that they no longer enjoyed the content they saw on their account's timeline, and I tried to ask more about it. Then they posted publicly that they would be closing the account and left. I haven't heard from them since, and over the past few days I've just been breaking into tears periodically at the thought that I might never be able to talk to them again. That there was no follow up on their end, that I didn't get the chance to say goodbye, or even ask if this was really going to be goodbye.

I know my feelings shouldn't take precedence over their mental health, and of course I know how people move on from things in life. But I really saw them as a friend who I shared so much of my emotional capacity with, more than just a fandom buddy, and it devastates me that they might not have thought the same. Or even that they no longer want me to be a part of their life, when our threads of conversation had still been carrying all the enthusiasm as before. For context, I've always felt like that ""unwanted"" extra in friend groups, where it's either because I joined the social circle later or that everyone was inseparable from each other except for with me. I'm used to being left behind, and being the last choice. Here, I really thought I wouldn't be.

I've tried reaching out to them and saying I really hoped we could continue talk, even if it wasn't on that specific account or those specific topics, just as friends who can share projects with each other. They haven't responded, and every second of it just makes me want to wither away. I'm hurt, but I'm also worried, and I just want to know what else I could do. I don't want to spam them or seem childish, but I miss my friend.

TL;DR: online fandom friend indicated all of a sudden that they would probably cut off contact with me without much explanation, and I'm just so hurt and sad and confused because I thought our connection as friends deserved more. I don't want to be discarded again. I want to follow up more but I don't know how.",22Nov2020,1

656,"I (25F) have been best friends with my friend, let’s call her “Sara” (26F) for years. We grew up together and I consider her like a second sister to me. Bit of background, she is of a German and Irish decent and I am Indian.

I never considered for a moment that she might have any ignorant views. She grew up partly in Hong Kong and received a fair bit of racism for being one of the few white kids at her local school. Whenever we’d talked about issues of race before, I felt that she was pretty on the same page as me. I’ve talked to her in lengths about the racism I’ve received growing up being one of the few non white kids at our school and we bonded on our experiences and how similar they were. 

The conversation all started because I was talking about an article about Oli London. Oli London is a white man who has had surgery to look Korean. I started saying how awful this was and how there were so many things wrong with this. I also mentioned  about black fishing, and that some influencers deliberately try to look black or mixed race to get attention on Instagram. She asked me what was wrong with that and started arguing that it was no different than non white people dying their hair blonde.

I was a little taken aback; I explained about there’s a difference in colouring your hair and literally changing your skin tone and altering your face to appear like a different race. We got into a very heated debate. She told me she didn’t see anything wrong with it, and that if POC can dye their hair “ white people” colours, then what’s wrong with white people trying to look like black or asian people. She argued that they might be doing it because they think it looks pretty. I was shocked and said that in noway does that make it ok. 
She then said I was gatekeeping and that I was being racist towards white people, because maybe those white people are naturally tanned. 

I then went onto talk about how it’s wrong to fetishise a race of people, and dressing up as a black or asian person is hugely offensive. I explained how movies where white people played black and asian people are looked at as wrong. That’s peoples lived experiences, they’re not a trend to market and live off. 

She argued that it doesn’t happen here in the U.K. , and it is only a US problem. I reiterated by showing her articles from the BBC of U.K. influencers that have been caught for black fishing. 

I also explained to her so many times my experiences with online dating, and how people would fetishise you for your race.  I told her I would get messages from people wanting to “ try” it with a brown girl, or people rejecting me because they don’t find Indian girls pretty, because they might be too “ hairy”. She argued that people are allowed pretences. I explained that “ preferences” sounds pretty racist, because it assumes that people from a particular race all look the same, or like that comment where I got rejected because someone assumed I might be hairy.

I said that , preferences arise with systematic racism, and that it’s not ok to write off an entire race of people based on your perception of what features they may or may not have. She said it was just a natural part of humanity and that it’s ridiculous that we pretend that we don’t have racial preferences. She said, how come a black guy can say he wants to date black women but if a white girl says it , it’s suddenly problematic. 

She told me she was pretty annoyed at me, and said I was being pretty racist towards white people. I was just shocked and said that I think we’ll have to agree to disagree, and said that I’d think about her points, but I didn’t want to continue the discussion further. 

I’m just shocked right now. Here is someone I considered my best friend and who I talked extensively growing up about difficulties with racism, and who also experienced racism. Now it seems it’s been revealed she has her own biases. I’m just shocked and I feel disappointed that as her friend, telling her that stuff like fetishisation and experiences of racism she still believes that somehow racism doesn’t exist and that I was somehow being racist towards white people. 

I’m not really sure how to feel, or what to go from
here. I don’t feel particularly happy with the idea of “race” being off the talking cards. I know there’s noway you can just change someone’s mind over it, but it’s pretty upsetting to see someone you are close with have those views. I spoke to my sister about it and she said that it’s not my friends fault, because she has white privilege and it’s not her fault that she doesn’t understand what it’s like for POC. She told me not to be too frustrated at her and that, I should just concentrate my energy elsewhere.  Any support or anyone else that has been through the same thing, would be helpful.",22Nov2020,1

My other issue is the hours, which I knew when I was hired. It’s really early in the morning, 4x a week and it’s COLD out now and a lot of my time is spent outside. I’ve been bitten, kicked, body slammed you name it by the horses. It’s a LOT of work for one person which I didn’t realize how much it was. I’m also regularly texted by horse owners asking me to do additional tasks for them while I’m there. I asked to drop a day a week which wasn’t ever honored. 

Long story short, this just doesn’t feel like it’s for me. I’m in almost tears the nights before I have to go in. My issue is, the horse world is very small and we know a lot of the same people. I don’t want to be bad mouthed or anything of the sort. I’ve been there about 3 months. I don’t know how to quit without it “looking bad” I have to go in tomorrow and Im basically borderline panic attack thinking about it. I’ll also have to work thanksgiving but that’s besides the point. 

My main issue is the pay and now the cold. I don’t know how to word it so I don’t come off in a way that I seen unappreciative fkr the opportunity. To make matters worse everyone there added me on social media and what not, so I feel like I can’t just “disappear” I’ll always be on their radar. Does anyone know how I can do this in a manner that won’t “black list” me in this small world? I’m at a loss at this point and every day I have to go in I feel my soul being sucked out. My other issue is I’m worried if I quit she won’t pay me for what I’m owed. And I need to make sure I get that or I don’t want to return. I’m not the type of person who will keep hounding her for it, and if I finish my last day without pay im going to be very uncomfortable continuing to text her asking for what she owes me! I also really don’t want to give 2 weeks, and I feel like since it’s not a “job job” I don’t know that I have to.",22Nov2020,1

Everything below is just extra info and you can prolly give advice based on what’s above^


Girl 1 and I just had an incredible date yesterday and I have not shown a single hint that I’m becoming disinterested so I kinda have to wind things down slowly so they don’t come out of no where. I know I’m doing a shitty thing so please don’t hate. At least I don’t plan on cheating. Girl 1 and I haven’t given each other titles yet and no agreement to commit yet. I had sex with girl 2 while meeting girl 1 but again, there was no commitment yet. 

I have been meeting up with girl 1 for about less than a month and had about 2 dates with her in that time span (we see each other in classes and text each other so it’s not like we don’t talk often). I have been awooga-ing girl 2 for the past 5 years. She’s one of my best friends. 

Also, I want to lead girl 1 down un-harshly because she suffers from depression, Holiday season sucks because she doesn’t like her family, and finals weeks are coming up for the both of us.",22Nov2020,1
669,"Hello all, need guidance on how to help my daughter.

She is very young and has a way of helping other kids through tough times or whatever issues they are dealing with, she has positively impacted and changed the life direction of many kids over the past two years. 

Now, my friends are pushing me to take the next steps and start allowing my daughter to impact more kids by making a website or web presence so that other people can assist my daughter in realizing her passion.

My problem is considering how young she is, protecting her privacy and keeping her safe is my priority but I cannot deny the positive impact she has made on all the kids these past two years.

What should I do?

670,"A bit of a rant here. My sister and I both love to play MMORPGs (on mobile). The games we play have daily/weekly dungeons to clear with guild members so you have to be online every evening.

I stopped playing the game a couple months back but my sister is still playing and she's online everyday from 8pm to 10pm+. She has complained to me before that she doesn't have time to relax after work because she has to rush to eat and shower and then get online. I just tell her that that's the exact reason why I stopped, because it was affecting my life. It's up to her when to quit the game.

For some context, I moved to the US for my job and now we're 14 hours apart. (I had to wake up at 630am so I could play with them on the Asia server. It was getting ridiculous so I stopped playing.) 

I like to call and chat with my sister, but now that we aren't chatting everyday with the in-game voice chat, I need to book her schedule. I would love to chat in my mornings (7am) and her evenings (9pm), but she would be online then and by the time she finishes her dailies (11pm), our calls don't last very long before she's falling asleep. She usually asks for my evening (9pm) and her late mornings (11am), but I like to sleep early too... and asking her to wake up earlier like maybe 9am seems to be asking for too much.. We usually go for the latter though, because at least then I can chat longer at my own expense.

It's hard and sad that our daily calls (in-game voice chat) have turned into a once a week or even two weeks call. And then she complains that every time I call, I chat for 3 hours (fyi, we were chatting/playing for 3 hours in the game every day before I stopped)... But I just can't help it because we share so many things in common, and I can't talk to anyone else about it and over the week, all the things I wanted to tell her just piled up. I do text some of the smaller things, but some things you just want to call and talk about y'know? I have been trying to shorten our calls though.. but I just feel depressed sometimes when the one person that I can talk to doesn't want to listen because she's tired after gaming..

Recently, we've been trying to plan for something happening in 3 weeks. We started 2 months ago, but it was really slow progress with the short calls. We still have quite a bit to plan and bookings to be made. 3 weeks isn't alot of time for advance bookings really.. I asked her to skip her dailies for a night or two, and let's get this done, but then she tells me about the in-game events and she has to keep up with it every day if not she won't get the full reward, things like that. I've been there before so I understand, and at this point I've gotten used to it so I just answer with an ""okay"". I'm already upset now at the planning stage but it'll probably get done in time. I'm worried about when our plans happen 3 weeks later, is she still going to be so MIA with the game always on her mind? I'm worried about her lifestyle too and how she's tired but doesn't seem to want/be able to stop. Need some advice on how to talk to her about it. 

Just to clarify, I'm not shitting on gaming being a hobby, it's my hobby too, but it should just be something to fill your free time and not something that you plan your whole schedule around everyday..",22Nov2020,1
671,"So I'm 18f living with my mom and two brothers, 20m and 16m. My mom constantly is gossipping with her friends and always using us as a source. I have no issue with this because they usually don't attack anyone or are talking bad about others, just more so talking about what's going on. A lot of the time when she uses us as a source but changes what we tell her, usually a large part of a story. Ex: Someone is in a car accident and we see someones post on social media about how they were intoxicated. And she changes it to that person was asleep and it was multiple people hurt. This angers me a lot more because of how often it happens and she gets annoyed when we mention that she's telling it wrong. I'm not quite sure why it angers me so much but I don't know how to approach it. How do I tell her to stop using me as a source and telling stories that aren't true? How do I stop being annoyed at her doing this?",22Nov2020,1

I tried explaining to her how I'm taking a lot of hard classes this year and combined with the whole covid situation it's hard for me to maintain a good average, but she won't really listen and still uses it as a reason to not teach me. And now she says she won't teach me until my *college admisison results* come in, which isn't for another few weeks and if they're all rejections then she's not going to teach me at all. I just think it's unfair for her to refuse me an important skill over something that's completely irrelevant to it. It's not like I'm getting bad grades on purpose, after all. I thought she'd be happy to help me become more independent, but instead she treats driving like some exotic thing that I'm not worthy of?",22Nov2020,1

678,"TDLR: I promised my employer to work 20+ hours, but i underestimated my school workload, and now i want to quit, but dont know if it is the right decision and how to bring it up.

So, last year i had the upportunity to already make some final exams of some subjects, and that way, this year, i only had 5 subjects left. During summer holiday this year i was mapping out my next school year. I calculated i would only have 20-25 hours of school a week. And so, i could get a new job with more hours to work. I applied for a 20+ hour job at a supermarket. I explained my situation, and that i would want to work a lot, if my school schedule allowed it. So the school year started, and my school schedule sucked. I now am going to school 30 hours or more and mostly later in the afternoon, not right in the morning. I went in quarantaine twice this school year already, one time during the test week. So i still have some test i need to make and some catching up to do. This is why i mostly go to school in the morning, to make homework, and then go to some lessons. My work schedule is 5 days a week 3-5 hours a day. Some days i wake up at 7 am and get home at 9:30 pm. All my good friends where a year above me and already left school. I feel lonely a lot of the times. I can only see them in the weekend. But lucky enough i got a girlfriend, but she lives far away and comes over every weekend. Which means i have no time for myself basically. It is school work, weekend (gf and school). And then again. 

Last week one of my bosses got mad at me that i was slower than usual and i did some things not exactly right. It really brought me down, because it proved to me i am not strong enough to handle everything. A few days later i got a mental breakdown at school and started crying. While i have never cryed at school. I felt ashamed that i couldnt handle it on my own. 

I know i at least need to negotiate to work less, or maybe its already too late for that and i need to quit altogether. But i am really stressed out about making a decision on it. For me the best situation is to quit and have some more time for exercising and eating healthy etc. Because that has also gone completely down the drain. Mostly i liked going to work and doing different stuff. But now i have no motivation and i look up to going to work. 

The thing is, it doesnt feel right to quit. I promised to work a lot to my employer. And maybe i cant handle it, but it is my responsibility if i made a promise. I am also really nervous about bringing it up, mostly because i am unsure if i should quit or not. I have only worked there for a couple months. So it would also be pretty quick to give up. But on the other hand it is making me really uhappy and i dont need the money. 

So my question is. Should i quit my job? or should i negotiate for something else? And how should i bring it up?",22Nov2020,1

Yes I undoubtably want to get back with my ex. I messed up and I left. My mental health, I needed a break with life and sit in my room and think alone. I’m better. In a better place. We were together for 4 years. 

Since my ex’s birthday, I said happy birthday to her and now it seems like she wants to carry on the conversation with me. It was her birthday at the start of November. We spoke for a few days. We stopped talking until now. She messaged me out of random this evening.  We had a bit of a rough break up. I struggled a lot. This was back in the summer. 

What is going on? What’s going on in her mind (as a girl) what could she want? I keep hinting I’m going to her Glasgow (where she lives, I live in Cambridge England) I’m going up for a weekend away, see some pals, look at a flat. I’m in a way, hoping she would ask to meet up.

681,"Throwaway because I’m worried someone I know will come across this. I broke up with my ex about a year and a half ago. It was mutual because both of us were not doing well and needed space. Almost 2 months later she gets into another relationship which really hurt me but I was happy that she was happy.

About 6 months into their relationship my ex blocked me on everything because her new girlfriend didn’t want us to be in contact. We were friends up until that point. 

About 3 months ago she unblocked me on everything and told me that she wants to be friends and profusely apologized for blocking me and everything. I forgave her and agreed to be friends. Since then she has blocked me when she’s around her girlfriend and talks to me when they are not together. At times I’ll be blocked for weeks. Most recently we hung out. Nothing serious happened but the next day I was blocked again. I’ve been blocked for a week now.

The thing is I’m a very forgiving person and she knows that. I like having her in my life but it hurts when she blocks me and I never know when or if she’s coming back. I’ve told her that I don’t like this and it hurts me and every time she comes back she apologizes and is great to me for a few days before I’m blocked again.

I really don’t know what to do. I want her in my life because she’s one of the only people who truly understands me. She’s an amazing person when we are together and friends but it hurts so bad every time she leaves. I know I seem really stupid for letting this go on. Any advice?",22Nov2020,1
682,"Hi Reddit, the question is in the title. I've always thought that I'd end up with someone who is super self-confident and active/into fitness. The person I've been seeing is neither of these things, but she has other qualities I adore. Although she has things I love about her, I sometimes think about these things. Especially her lack of self-confidence in asserting herself and in her body. I find that very unattractive and it creates other concerns and a sort of imbalance for me in the relationship. How can you tell what things are a must for you versus a preference? How can I parse this?

Another question might also be, is this sort of thing addressable? If she isn't confident, is there a way to address that in the relationship?

683,"This morning along with the past few days I've woke up with a throbbing headache. Today is Sunday, and every Sunday my parents force me to go to church. I've tried probably everything under the sun to get them to let me stay home and rest. Every time I ask my mom she just grounds me and threatens to pull me out of school.

Last year when I was a sophomore I had told them I'm done going and there's nothing they can do about it. They took away everything from me for months for refusing to go twice. I mean they took my phone, my ability to leave my yard, my tv, they took everything. I had been doing online schooling at the time too. This meant I was completely isolated for months. I had no one to talk to. I had no way of communicating to anyone but my siblings or my parents. 

You're probably thinking that I'm just dramatic and dumb for not just going. But I have reasons. I've explained these reasons to my parents very, very well countless amounts of times. I am not mormon, I have been at one point and I've done my research and prayed for months at time before. My only results that came from this was finding that I felt as if I was trying to receive answers from a chunk of plastic. I hate going to church because I can recognize that what the members are trying to claim is real and amazing only seems like a delusion or a placebo. I don't fit in with these people, and I get a headache just listening to them try and explain how they absolutely KNOW how something they have never seen, felt, or physically actually experienced is so real and so life changing.

The main reason I quit believing in god, was when I was about 11 I had prayed my dad wouldn't beat me for accidently taking out the wrong bag of trash. I was very reasonable and didn't ask for much. I was just sick of being beat for these stupid reasons. I was ignored. I was hit with a stick multiple times. After this I even still tried for a good amount of time to just try and find a hint that god exists and knows I do. I never found any signs. In fact I found way more signs of his non-existence in this process.

My parents force me to go mainly because they want the image of these perfect mormon parents that make their kids obey god. And the people who attend our same church are the people they want to impress. They tell me that they make me go because ""maybe I'll hear something important"" and literally reconstruct my entire religious foundation (which is not going to happen).

I know I probably sound like a punk ass teenager, but I have reasons why I don't want to attend church anymore. I feel happier when I have the freedom to choose and form my own beliefs, instead of being spoon-fed bullshit like I don't have a brain to think for myself. I'm not sure if anything will get to them at this point. But I don't want the 2 last years of living with my parents be an all out battle. Any tips at this point will help. (sorry if I offended anyone with this btw. I have nothing against being religious as long as you don't try and shove it down anyone's throat.)",22Nov2020,1

688,"I don't what is wrong. Is it me or my family? No one respects me. I have to do everything and I at fault at other's mistakes.

My mother is rude to me. Not every time but most of the time. Whenever I call my mother, she is either irritated or does not respond at all and this makes me sad. She never said I love you or hugged me or shown any kind of physical affection. She showers love only in the rarest of occasions and always tell others that her children are good for nothing. She is short-tempered and blames us for other's mistakes. Due to this, I start shouting at my mother and we fight. I mean we fight a lot. Even though she is very nice, she is always rude and angry. In general, she is a nice woman but her behaviour towards me is very bad sometimes.

Then comes my sister. She is very good but sometimes I am irritated when I a look at her face or hear her voice when she is angry. I don't have any idea of what the hell is happening with me. She needs everything and she thinks she is always right. Even though we love each other, we fight a lot. Like physical fight. Mind you, both of us are above the age of 20 and we still fight. For example, we share a common room some times. She sleeps a lot so she wanted to sleep at 6 pm and I was studying at that time. So she asks me to leave the room so without any hesitation, I left. 

But at 12 pm I was gaming and I wanted the light to be turned on. My sister refused and I told her about the nice thing I did at 6 pm. She was very arrogant and we got into a huge fight. I know men aren't supposed to hit women so I pushed her. This is where it went wrong. She came with full force and punched me. I, without any hesitation, started punching her and this resulted in an ugly fight. I was concerned about the noise levels and I backed out. But my charger was on the bed and she threw it on the ground. Like WTF!!! 

I am fed up of this lifestyle. Fighting all the time is making me sick. I don't like to fight. I tried to distance from them by talking only when it is needed and not staying in the same room with them. But they keep asking what is wrong with me. Why am I not talking to them and stuff like that? After a few days, I will mingle with them and after that, the fighting begins. This cycle continues forever and this made me depressed as fuck.

Everything was great between us until today. I asked if we could meet up later cuz I had been wanting to talk to him. Immediately got unfriended on Snapchat. I tried messaging him on Insta clarifying that I wasn’t trying to break it off, cuz I realized that’s how it sounded but he never saw it cuz he blocked me.

Will he ever add me back on Snapchat? After unfriending me I was upset so I just wrote out what I was going to tell him if he gave me the chance to explain as a way for me to put all my feelings out there so I wasn’t bottling them up. I did it not for him cuz I’m not even sure if he’ll ever read it but for myself.",22Nov2020,1
694,"So we're financially stable.

If this pandemic didn't happen, my parents would spend their money on gambling. My dad was an alcoholic, not until he almost went blind because of diabetes.

I'm 8 months unemployed, there are prolly 200+ job openings on sites but companies are mostly unresponsive making my chances slim.

My mom, all my life wants me to go to schools near us. Companies near us. Never exceeding for like, 10km? Because what if it floods? It will be hard to go home.

That makes it more unlikable to go to far locations from our house.

My Ndad is passive aggressive towards me when I don't have a job. He pressures my brother so much especially he works at his business and he'll have a son soon.

My sister has her kid and I'm the only one who also helps to take care of my nephew.

Should I finally find a corporate job? Or should I try real hard find clients for my art commissions?

696,"So recently I (24M) was having a talk with friends over a campfire about the time we lost our virginity, and I told them my story about how I, when I was 12, had sex with 67 year old female neighbor. It happened over a while, with her inviting me more and more into the house to help out with stuff, and one day, I got pretty burned out and tired while helping her out and I asked to use the pool to swim, and we both swam for a bit. Then we went out to sunbathe and she took off her bikini, which shocked 12 year old me. She said, ""Relax, growing up, I did this all the time. Kids these days don't know the joy of sunbathing naked."", so I decided to listen to her as I looked up to her and I started talking about school when I noticed a funny feeling in my groin and noticed that she was jerking me off. ""Continue"" she said and I continued on  and then I ejaculated. She then said ""Let me clean that up"" and licked all of the semen off my dick and proceeded to suck me off before I ejaculated again. We spent the rest of the day and the rest of my middle school days having this kind of sex before she moved to another state. When I told this story, every went morbidly silent, before my friend Jack said that was rape and that I was raped. I told him that I agreed to have sex with her, and that therefore it wasn't rape. Then my friend Will joined in and said that I was underaged and that she was 50 years older than me, and that I didn't know what I was doing. I told Will that he lost his at 17 to another student of the same age, but then he told me that it was within his age range and that he was way more sexually mature at 17 than I was at 12.

I’ve had my cast on for 5 weeks and get it off December 7th. I have only very little pain from my leg now but my armpits are really sore and getting blisters from the crutches. So lately I’ve started walking on my cast just around my apartment. With the way my knee and ankle are bent,the bottom of my cast doesn’t touch the floor that much, my toes do mostly. So I’m kind of limping on my toes that stick out of the cast if that makes sense.

So far I’ve been doing this for a couple weeks. The bottom of my cast is getting a little worn, but I haven’t had really any additional pain from doing it. Could it really hurt anything?

703,"Hi, newish step parent here of a 15 year old boy. We'll call him Alex.

Alex is doing virtual learning. He has really been struggling with his math. I have had to walk him through nearly every assignment. I try to teach and explain how to do certain problems, and I check to make sure he's following me. He says he understands, but when I tell him to try a few on his own, it's like nothing i said stuck. I ask if the teacher gave him reading materials to learn the lessons, and he always says no. We do this every. Single. Week.

So I told Alex to contact his teacher about his struggles. He said he did but she wouldn't respond. I got a chance to look at his emails today with his permission. She HAS been responding, but he hasn't been exactly asking for help with certain concepts or asking for tutoring sessions. He just asks for clarification about the assignments themselves, not requesting meetings.

Additionally, he only just told me that he hasn't been able to access the text book at all, which is where most of the coursework is... So his math education has only consisted of a single zoom class per week for the past 3 months! 

Today we finally managed to get the text book up and I told him to go through the current chapter, read it, and take notes. Then I would help him on his assignment (which is past due, that's a whole other issue) if he needed it.

I'm upset because he's not speaking up about these problems, and this is the first I've heard of them. I don't think it's right for me to hold his hand through every single assignment and his confusion when these issues could have been solved on his own if he would have directly spoken up to his teachers. There has been a history of coddling here (that's a post for another time) and I feel like it's starting to cause issues here. I get the sense he'd rather have me or his parents do the talking to the teachers.

We are also getting to the point where the math is too difficult for me to understand. I am happy to help when necessary, but this is me spending hours every night doing pretty much everything short of completing the lessons for him. He even texts me from his mom's and grandpa's house (he watches him and his little brother while we are at work) asking for help. But he still won't request a meeting with his teachers, despite us all encouraging him to. I have other responsibilities that require my attention. 

I have tried to explain the importance of taking responsibility for his grades, especially now that he is in high school, but it seems like he doesn't care, or would rather have someone walk him through every question.

How do I address this? Obviously a parent needs to have a meeting with the teacher and Alex (which we will be figuring out today) but how do I continue to help him without holding his hand so much? I feel like it is almost better for him to get a bad grade or two so the teacher can see where he is struggling than for me to walk him through every assignment. But at the same time we don't want him to fail. Throw in the fact that I am more of a hands off step mom (an agreement his father and I came to when we married), and it's a mess.

Thanks in advance if you read this far.",22Nov2020,1
704,"  TL/DR: I (28) have two female roommates, J(23) and A(19). J seems to have a personal issue with me, wherein she makes passive aggressive / boarder-line offhand bullying comments, gets uncontrollably mad when I do something that mildly inconveniences her (like dirtying the kitchen.. which I always clean up soon after) and gets passive aggressive revenge. I’ve put up with this for months patiently and calmly, but I blew my fuse when she took my stuff out of the dryer wet to do more of A’s laundry, and threw a bunch of laundry and tide pods (belonging to A). Next to the washer. J told A about this and A tried to physically fight me over laundry detergent ‘getting dirty’ on the floor. I told A she has until Dec 1 to get out. 

Some backstory. I and my boyfriend are renting a 3 bedroom house. Since we are only using one bedroom and are pretty broke, we decided to rent out the other two to some people offline, off the lease. The first one we found was J. She’s sweet, a kind person, and we all got along from the start. I have two bigger dogs, while she has a small unneutered male (one of the white crusty-eyed dogs). We had another roommate that moved out in October, so we got another person to replace her, A. Everything has been going well since Feb with J, except that her unneutered male dog is food aggressive (he's bitten me at least 3 times), and pees on literally everything in the house. I came to J several times and asked if she could control him peeing in the house, and even bought diapers for him when she couldn’t control him. She puts the diapers on him randomly, leaving him free to pee all over everything I own most of the time; couches, shoes, backpacks, our laundry basket is a daily target. I have brought this to her attention, but she brushes it off or would make comments about how me telling her her dog peed on my stuff annoys her. So I stopped telling her and started cleaning all the pee up myself. This has been going on for months, and not once did I lose my shit. Everything smells like pee no matter how much I clean it. 

I am a fairly calm person and it takes a lot to make me truly mad. I try to be as understanding as possible, and can understand why his peeing is hard to control. J suffers with depression, PTSD, and extreme self esteem issues (she is overweight and literally hates herself because of this). I try to take that into account for why she’s acting the way she is.   

In the last month or so, J has started doing passive aggressive things to ‘get back’ at me for doing benign things that annoy her, for example she was sweeping one day and the dogs were outside, barking and harassing the neighbor’s cats. I let the dogs in which obviously they ran across the floor she was sweeping, but I put them immediately in their crates. She threw the broom down on the floor where she stood and started loudly doing the dishes. I bathed her dog once because they all went outside and got filthy, but apparently you’re supposed to brush him afterwards and I didn't, so she threw flour into the sink of the kitchen I just deep cleaned, leaving it to become a glue there. I went into the dryer and half pulled some of her stuff out to get one of her dog’s diapers since his was dirty and forgot to push them back into the dryer, so she slammed every door in the kitchen. I hate passive aggressive stuff like this and think it is very toxic and detrimental to my mental health.

We talked about this and agreed we needed to be more understanding of each other. She hasn’t done any of the revenge things she did before, but now it seems like she just dislikes me as a person. She does small, passive aggressive things to me that if I pointed them out, she could easily say I’m just being crazy/overanalyzing things. Examples include: labeling all her stuff in the kitchen (we often use each other’s stuff and it’s never been a problem) I’m guessing because I ‘used’ her coffee (I made her coffee every morning for a week since I’m up earlier) and made myself separate decaf. But I guess she thinks I drank all her coffee so she needs to label everything. She was talking to her boyfriend on speaker and I said something to him, to which she immediately plugged her headphones in. Many sarcastic comments about how I’m ‘too hard’ on the dogs (my dogs have rules they follow unlike hers), that I’m a ‘know-it-all’, comments about me making more money than her, just about anything is a target. It seems like anytime I try to talk to her it leads to a disagreement (even if it’s about something silly like a video I’m watching), she flat out ignores me, or she acts like I’m annoying her for some reason.

A came here mid October and I haven’t really had a problem with her other than the fact that she is literally always high and leaves all her stuff just strewn about the house. That doesn’t really bother me but it is a bit annoying. 

So last Thursday, A had 5 giant baskets of laundry she wanted to do, she would put one in but then go to sleep or go to work, so I was moving them along and got 3 done. I wanted to clean up the house and wash the dog beds and some sheets, so I did just that. I come out later to find the dog bed that I was drying on top of the dryer still wet. J had taken it out to do yet another load of A’s laundry (because apparently she’s incapable of doing her own). This was the last straw. I took all of A’s clothes out of the washer and dryer still wet, put them in her basket, washed the other half of the dog bed, dried them all, and then put all of A’s wet laundry on top of the washer. A’s tide pods were on the dining room table, even though there is a space for them in the washing closet they are always for some reason on the table, so I threw them in between the washer and dryer. I know none of this is really A’s fault, but it was Julie who did it and had to clean it up.  So I gave her a tiny taste of her own medicine after dealing with this for months. 

J told A I ‘threw her tide pods all over the floor’ (not true as it was in between the washer and dryer but I digress) So last night A confronted me about that, very aggressively and confrontational.  I'm sure J has been talking trash about me to A since she obviously has a problem with me. I told her that it really wasn’t about her, she wasn’t having it, started DEMANDING that I replace the bag (none came out of the bag, they were fine and she wouldn’t have known if J hadn’t told her). I told her I was not going to do that. She started calling me a bitch, telling me that ‘an adult would own up and apologize’ and asked me ‘how old are you’. By this point she was screaming and getting in my face. I told her she needed to lower her voice with me, I think she probably screamed back that I wasn’t going to tell her what to do or something. The word bitch was used quite a bit. She threatened to fight me over this because I was ‘being a bitch’, to which I replied she needs to be out of my house by Dec 1st. She started saying that I can’t evict her because of corona, I said she has no lease so that doesn’t apply to her. She doesn’t have any lease or written agreement whatsoever and according to my lawyer, she has no rights to the place. She said her mom went to law school, she’ll get lawyers and call the cops. My bf got in between us during this since she was literally trying to fight me. She kept screaming in my face, so I raised my finger to point at her and tell her to get the fuck out of my house right now, and she launched into attack, luckily my boyfriend backed her into a corner. She punched him a bunch, scratched his back, and tore his shirt. All the while screaming that I ‘put my hand up to punch her first’ (mind you, she had literally put her fist up in punching position at least 3 times before this and I did nothing) I took pictures as evidence. 

I would’ve called the cops, but my boyfriend is black and I cannot risk him getting hurt because of this psycho. I told her she is to be out by noon Dec 1, I will change the locks and throw her stuff out if she doesn’t remove it herself by then. If she tries to start another fight with me, I’ll probably let her get a few good swings, call the cops, and press charges to get her out sooner.

My bf, A, and J all talked after wards and A and J told my bf that I am a completely different person when my bf isn’t around, that I’m a huge bitch when he’s not around and nice when he is. If anything, I probably am more reserved when he’s not around because I feel so uncomfortable with how J has been treating me, but I haven’t done anything to her and my only problems with her are her dog peeing everywhere and her now apparent dislike of me. I could hear J telling A not to feel bad for all the shit that just happened, and they were talking and laughing so it’s apparent she’s choses A’s side in this. 

So yeah. I’m pretty sure I’m not the asshole here but.. yeah.",22Nov2020,1
705,SO UM I BROKE MY ONE KEY BY RAGING WELL PLAYING A  GAME WITH MY BOYFRIEND AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,22Nov2020,1
706,"Title explains it. I have no idea what I should do. I guess I can give you all a little bit more background (sorry for the formatting and if the writing is bad, I don’t post on reddit very often).

So I (22M) live in a 3 bedroom apartment with two other guys (22M) and (21M). I’ll call the guy who was in my bed Creep and my other roommate Friend. So Friend and I have known each other many years and we decided to get this apartment together, long story short we didn’t have a 3rd roommates that we needed but met Creep before we moved in and he’s now our 3rd roommate. 

We’ve only known Creep for about 3 months and in those 3 months has made the majority of our friend group feel pretty uncomfortable. He is gay (which is fine I have many other gay friends who don’t sniff my laundry and don’t think they ever would), and a very touchy and handsy guy. We’ve all told him (girls and guys) we don’t like to be touched like that when we’re out and he always gets very defensive and plays the victim saying we’re homophobic and all this shit.

I’m the only one in the group who has tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe he really doesn’t mean any harm and trying to advocate for him. So then, a couple of nights ago he confesses to me that he likes me a lot and has been trying to get with me for a while. I tell him I am not gay and don’t like him like that and that he should try to not see me as a viable relationship option. We talk for a bit and seem to work things out, yadda yadda we chill in for the night (cause nobody else in our friend group wants to hang out with him and I feel bad) and I go to sleep. Everything feels at least kinda normal.

Next day I plan on leaving to go out of town. I get in my car and start driving, realize I forgot my glasses and turn back around to the house. When I walk in Creep is wrapped up in all my blankets and has multiple articles of my dirty clothes (stuff I wore the day before) as well as my dirty towel all around him. I ask him what the fuck he’s doing and he just keeps apologizing profusely and I tell him to stay the fuck out of my room and that he needs to work on himself because that is some creepy ass shit.

I text Friend to tell him what happened and then I just leave to go out of town. I ordered a security camera and padlock for my door but I’m just wondering if I should call the landlord and let her know we can’t live with this guy anymore. I really don’t know what to do, if any of y’all have any advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.",22Nov2020,1

715,"So I recently started working as an ophthalmologist assistant. I have no background knowledge I never went to school for this. I was hired and j was told Id have three months of training before being left alone to help take care of patients. Within two weeks they had already started making me take patients on my own. There were things I didn’t know how to use like the system and where to input some information. The doctor would see that I would make mistakes and he would immediately yell at me infront of the patient and belittle me. It was so humiliating I tried to hold back tears. My coworkers saw this and they told me not to worry that I’ll get used to it and to not take it personal. So that’s what I did I started to not take it personally because apparently all my coworkers have gone through the same thing. All I could think was how could no one stand up to this behavior. Anyways. I kept making little mistakes and I like to blame that on me not being properly trained and not knowing what I was doing because it hadn’t even been a full month since I was working there and I would constantly get yelled at. The doctor would tell me that every time I messed up a few seconds of his time would accumulate to 5 minutes in the whole day and that was 5 minutes of his precious time that he would never get back because of me. I’ve been working there now for 4 months. And I’m still constantly learning. During those 4 months he has made me be in charge of the operating room, he expects me to scribe and to also translate to patients. And he expects absolute perfection or else I get yelled at infront of the patients or my coworkers. The other day he almost called me stupid because I didn’t remember how many times a certain medication was applied and then on Friday he told me that I don’t meet his standards and that I’m going to end up killing myself because I wasn’t going to be good enough at any work place. This completely broke me. And I know common sense is quitting because it affecting my mental health but for some reason I’m terrified to quit.

Also I’m only getting paid 13 dollars for all of the responsibilities that he has given me. I don’t know if it’s because he has gaslighted me so bad or something but am I just being super whiny?

I think it's because I can't remember unless I explicitly try to do so. so I end up thinking, what year did I get this game? when did I first play it? where did I go on holiday in 2017?

I seem to struggle to remember my past, which makes me panic and try to force myself to remember it more. I don't know if it's normal to forget or if I have a disease. but I do think that obsessing and living in the past  is stopping me forming new memories now and enjoying life.

yet, I fear if I stop thinking about the past, I'll forget it all. then my only memories will be the past four months. without my past memories, I'm a shell of a person. then any new memories I make will soon vanish and I'll carry on with no memories and no personal growth or development.

718,"Now I don’t feel lonely in the sense that I desperately need a romantic partner. Weirdly I rather have a group of friends. But I don’t. I don’t have a single person in life I can call a friend. Making friends is harder than finding a date in my opinion. Especially during Covid pandemic. My college is closed and I do not know how to talk to others since there is no face to face interaction. I will lose my sanity if I go on a couple more semesters like this. I don’t even know what people my age like to do for fun. 

Anyways back to my question. Will dating give me the illusion that I’m not lonely. I know I’m not ready to date both literally and mentally but who is ever ready lol. Will it be a turn off for a girl when she realizes the person in her relationship has no friends? Now I know it will be if he always seems desperate to see her but that’s not what I’m asking. Hopefully I’m willing to give people their space. I know relationships need time to develop and it never goes from 0 to 100 automatically but I guess having someone who is there often would be cool since I have no friends in real life. I don’t know what to do honestly. I think I might have already lost my sanity, this pandemic especially. I might be 100 percent mentally ill at this point. Should I admit myself to a mental hospital. I get thoughts of suicide but I’m a coward to do so because i believe in God and it is claimed in the Bible all those who commit suicide go to hell. So that’s not an option for me. Why is making friends so difficult in life? Why do people already seem to have their group and I have absolutely nothing. I will sell my soul to have a best friend. The devil never gave me the offer though because why make a deal with someone who is already headed to hell. Idk why I want a friend or to be apart of a friend group but honestly that’s one of the things I want most in life. I guess it’s because it’s something I always lacked.

723,"turned 23 last month and am starting to feel like something has got to change. I think ive been having kind of an on and on existensial crisis ever since my last year of highschool.

And right now I am not even sure if I will make it till 30 or if I even want too",22Nov2020,1
724,is it wrong for me to be upset with my mom because she always puts her mother first before her kids ?,22Nov2020,1
726,"First, some background:

* I am 25M and, except for a few years in college, had always lived with my family.
* When I was 18, I went away to college, but going away wasn't the best experience for me. My parents gave me the benefit of the doubt, but my grades were slipping, and I wasn't making any friends. At one time, I considered suicide. I spent the last 2 years commuting, and it was a better experience.
* Since then, I occasionally traveled alone from family, and they have been successes.
* Part of the problem was with my college experience was that I had ADHD, but no one believed me at the time. With medication and counseling, I have a better handle with it now than before.
*  Outside my family, my social life is close to 0, and outside of forced interactions (like communicating with co-workers), I don't really talk to others. In other words, I have pretty bad social anxiety, but it doesn't affect my day-to-day life.
* I was trying to work on my social anxiety pre-pandemic (like going to events and other MeetUps), but social distancing just makes it harder to make new friends. This is what scares my family the most. They think I'll be too depressed alone, and I'll consider suicide again. I don't think that will happen since (1) it's harder for everyone to make new friends now (2) the expectations for me to make new friends are lower and (3) when the pandemic is over, it will be easier to attend events and other MeetUps so I can try to find some friends.
* One other part of my social anxiety is that I have problems trusting people, even my family. I'm the kind of guy that wants to please everyone, and I don't want anyone to be upset because of me. As I stated before, I have no friends outside of family, and if they are upset with me, I feel like I have no one else to talk to as a friend. In the long term, I know they will always support me, but I always fear that I'll go too far with them.


So a couple of weeks ago, my job offered me an opportunity to work in a different city for 6 months. I decided to take the offer, since I am kind of in a rut with my life for the past few years (nothing bad, but nothing spectacular either), and I thought a change of scenery would help me. Plus, I live in a cold weather city, and I'll be relocating to a warmer weather city (which is a personal plus in my book). However, I haven't told my family yet (who I still live with). I don't want to change my mind last minute (flights and other accommodations has already been booked, and my employer will be very unhappy if I pull out last minute) but I don't want to disappoint my family either. 


I still want to be in good terms with my family when I am away. When I told them about the opportunity, they were against it. We left off with me saying ""I'll think about it."" Since then, I haven't brought it up, but I told my employer that I wanted to take the opportunity. I'm looking forward to the opportunity, but I'm leaving in a couple of weeks, and I have to let my family know soon. How should I approach my family to say that I'm leaving?",22Nov2020,2

A while back I told a female friend of mine that I liked her and I asked her what she thought of me she responded that I was an”interesting guy” but she saw me as a friend. Does that mean she found me attractive but didn’t want to pursue anything? Or was she replacing the word interesting with “nice” because it’s been overused. Is it possible that she finds me interesting as a friend but doesn’t find me attractive?

Also I personally also struggle with self esteem issues, but I generally just find myself god awful and ugly. I think I’m horrible at everything I do, and I can’t stand how I look.

733,"I barely see my dad because he works all week and he is only at home the weekends, but it is still a pain in the ass.
He is a homophobe and a fascist and he mocks me all the time because we don't share those morals. He also makes very weird comments about my brother's and my sentiment life: he is always asking when he is going to meet my brother's girlfriend (even when he has not one), how many girls is he probably with, etc. I know it is a joke, but it is still very uncomfortable. He is trying to get macho-points with the flings of his son (?). He usually doesn't talk a lot about my personal life, because I am a woman, and women have to get a stable companion or they are whores, so he will not understand that I have friends that are men and that they are not interested in a romantic relationship with me. He thinks they are all suckers trying to get my attention and my parents will not let me invite them at home: in the rare occasion I told him I was meeting with a male friend he will make comments about him during a week at least. I am just horrified to let him know any future partner.

I just don't like my father, neither I love him. As time past he is becoming more and more extreme in all his opinions, to a point it is impossible to talk to him about anything, because he will start to shout about how great was our country when we were in a dictatorship! Jokes on him, he only lived under the dictatorship during his first five years of life. I think he is kind of a narcissist, his behaviour is just not normal.

Today, he was talking about my ""brother's girls"" and I told him it is strange that a father thinks about their sons' sexual life (not exactly with this words, I tried to be respectful). He, as a joke, smacked my butt as I passed by his side. Like I was a little kid. He does it sometimes and I have always told him that I hate it and to stop.
After that I felt disgusted. He spanked me after he was talking about his son sexual behaviour, WTF.

I just want him to be out my life. I want to stop to talk to him when I move out, but he is still married to my mother, that is a fantastical human being, so I will probably have to tolerate his presence during the rest of his life. I don't want him to know my partners, I don't want him to meet my future children. He is not a bad father, he is financially maintaining me. I JUST CAN'T STAND HIM.",22Nov2020,1
734,"I am a university student and  I have this course mate. The problem is in me being jealous of who she is and me feeling degraded and unimportant. It is not her fault of course, and that´s why I am asking for advice.

I am basically jealous that she grew up in a nice family, lived a comfortable life, with resources to develop her creative aspirations. 

We are both international students and we don´t get maintenance loan( loan for living expenses). Therefore in some capacity I do get supported by my family, but it covers just my accommodation expenses.  I have to work for my food. I come from a middle class family and we did have financial struggles in the past. Our family is very much broken and doesn´t get along, so there is not a sense of happiness coming from that.

I just feel extremely jealous when I see her, her family and talent. She lives in a very nice apartment, which must be paid by her family.I get jealous of the nice clothes she has or her camera and editing software. My laptop is 9 or 10 years old and cannot even run a free software for editing. Every step of the way I have to prioritise and think about how I´ll survive and when can I buy a new thing. I feel stressed out. Then I go to instagram and see a post how she´s sparkling from the inside(that was what she wrote) and I feel completely opposite. Decaying. It´s not a problem I have with her as I recognise that what I hate is what she represents and in no way is responsible for, which is privilege.

I would like to address it head on with myself, but I don´t know how to do it. Sometimes I just feel too tired and seeing someone happy with a better life just makes me feel more miserable.

Does anyone know how to get through this type of thinking?

Thank you for any answers.",22Nov2020,1

So the friend in context of the story and I used to be very close I met him at college here in the UK and we were super close in our friend group that we had in the way that we would talk everyday in person or through messenger etc. After we left college he went onto university and we still remained close even though i took the decision not to go because I never felt like it was a right fit for me at the time i would still make monthly trips to visit because he moved to another city and whenever I had free time we would see each other.

Since our schedules are so different with him being a student/working in the nights and myself working in a hospital we havent really been able to chat a whole lot and ive felt like a large distance has grown especially with everything going on this year the last time we spoke was March of this year and it just felt like he had grown appart from me and i guess I haven't helped either but with his birthday coming up this week id just thought I'd message him to see how things are. I just dont know what to say to get us back to talking like we used to because we were so close and with our friend group disbanding due to life commitments etc 

I just feel like ive lost him he was the person I came out to he himself is gay so we were the best of friends and i felt like hes moved on and im not really a person who fits into his new life and friends.

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated and if this is the right place to post this or not im not sure but thanks for sticking with it and reading to the end.",22Nov2020,1

742,"My little sister (20 years) has been going through a very hard time mentally lately. Some info on her:

I believe she has depression, though she hasn’t shared if that is professionally diagnosed or self-diagnosed. Either way, she is very unhappy most of the time. She is also highly sensitive, especially to criticism of any sort. She’s always on edge and on the offense it feels. It’s very hard to be around her, no matter how much you love her, because she’s so argumentative and always has to be right. 

She is a junior in college (senior in credits), and since high school has always had a boyfriend. She gets into serious relationships very quickly and makes all of her big life decisions based around the guy that she’s dating at the time. Currently, she’s doing her online schooling down the coast because her older boyfriend moved there for his job. In short, they’ve been attached at the hip since quarantine and now it seems he wants some space. They’re living with family down there until he gets an apartment, that she wants to permanently move into. (Again, she’s 20). She’s supposed to come back home in a few days and he told her that he doesn’t want her moving in with him until she finishes this semester out. To her, that seems devastating because it means being apart for about 5 months when they’ve been together nonstop since March. To him, it may seem like a necessary break. 

She’s super depressed lately, and I think this is why. It seems like he’s trying to give them space, and she knows it but doesn’t want to admit it. 

She has also been in habits of not being able to hold a job because of her boyfriends. Each boyfriend she’s had, she’s gotten a job with while dating, then left the job within a week. She says it’s too stressful working and takes too much time away from school, but knowing the personality she has, I think it takes her away from her boyfriend and that’s why. So, she takes money from my dad and guilts him into it when that’s not fair. If she wants to be an adult and move in with her boyfriend, she needs to get a job. 

Her being the super sensitive and argumentative person she is, I need to address this lightly. But I need to get it across to her that she is revolving huge life decisions around her boyfriend at the time and she needs to take a deep look into the realities of her life. Because we’re sisters, she can easily shut out what I’m saying and it could just turn into a blowout fight. 

Any advice on how to address this? I’m worried for her overall well being and feel as though her mental state is severely impacted by her own life decisions. 

TDLR: very young, but sensitive sister needs huge life advice but doesn’t take advice well if it comes off too sharp, so need to word it best how I’m feeling. I’m 24 years old, have lived outside the home since completing college, and have worked since 16 part time jobs until accepting my full time career out of college.",22Nov2020,1

744,"Stuck in a loop at 25! Help me focus back plz!
Hi I am 25 boy. I love drawing, anime, manga, music, writing, tech, soccer, volley. I started drawing at age 20, and it got serious, since i was drawing 4h, 365day a year. I was passionate, energized, and I had level up to a point ppl started to ask me commissions, and pay me really well. With 2/3 commissions per month, I could equal my actual average salary as an office employee. At age 23, i started to read books about p. finance and business. I started to get hyped, and for some reason I took my pencil on the table. From year 2018, I struggled drawing occasionally, and I never drawn anymore with that diligence I had previously. I stopped then. Year 2019 I was reading more and more books about business, and I dont know why, but Ive completely lost interest in Drawing as a ""producer"", but My interest for Art, Manga and Anime in general, was there still! I never lost it. At the start of 2020, I started to read fantasy novels and felt in love with writing. I tried to write something and I liked it, even If I have no skill on writing, compared to drawing. Mid 2020 I discovered I like the piano so much! I always loved music, but the piano captivated me! Now I have problems to ""choose"" the right thing for me! I drawn a list of 20 things i like the most, then shrinked to 10, and then to 5. This is the result

10 Drawing, Animation, Manga, Music, Writing, Read, Biking, Travel, Soccer, VideoGames,

5 Drawing, Animation, Manga, Writing, Music

I would like to make my living with one of thoose topic. I dont like to work on the office, or at the restaurant, but now I keep working, because I have to mantain myself and pay the expenses. I am not able to choose. I am really doubting what I could do, and what I should do. Should I do Drawings, and make tutorials, and make this product, and make this and this... I think about the monetary part, because I need to do it for my living. When you go for a job, you dont think about the money. They come every month, but If I want to do what I love, and Love what I do, I need to find ways. And there are plenty today, thanks also to the internet. I would like to stop myself and think about my true passion, but the more I do this, the more I cannot find an answer. I am really in doubt if I should go 110% on Drawing or Music or Writing. I like them all! And the best would be music, because your struggle is converted in ""real time"" feedback because you produce a sound and you get hyped, maybe. Drawing and Writing have a more muted approach, since you struggle in silence, and get the satisfaction at the end of the work. It is a more longer process IMO.

Do you guys know any technique would help me choose? I tried ikigai also, and it helped a bit to shrink my view. But still need to choose

I am so unsure, that I cannot make up my mind about an insanely important decision, which has consequences in mere hours.

Up to this point I just procrastinated the decision on the line of 'I will have more info later on'. And of course by getting the 'vibe' from others who wished me well on my path they think I should take.

757,"To make this short I have never modeled professionally I did attempt an only fans for a couple of months and it didn't work out due to so much competition.

Fast forward now covid took my job and I've had a total of 3 interviews since March. I decided to try modeling, so I contacted this company that I follow on Insta. They are in my area and were looking. The store is mostly lingerie type stuff but I don't mind that very much especially if the pay turns out good.

Talking more with the person running turns out the company also participates/ hosts orgy events/ parties privately where they encourage cleanliness and all that. 

I only applied to be a regular vanilla clothing/ lingerie model but they also offered to help me get into that for good pay if I wanted. I obviously don't. 

I have never done this before and I'm an anxious wreck whether this is something that could lead to something bad or something good like maybe a side modeling career. So I guess I could use advice from former people in the profession/ who have experience. Please tell me I'm just overreacting.",22Nov2020,1
758,"My Dad (51M) and I (17F) have never been very close. He likes to act like we're close but I'm not comfortable with him to the degree that I am with my Mum (53F). I have two older brothers (23M and 19M) and I just feel like he tried a lot harder with them then he did with me. 

My Dad is not absent by any means, he used to manage my football team for two years but as soon as I didn't want to play he kind of began to resent me and made snider comments about me not playing - I just got bored of the sport. Since then, we have had nothing in common. I feel like football was our last thread. I have played Netball since I was 7 and he's seen probably three of my games. He never asks how I'm doing at college and just depends on my Mum to tell him. If I was ever in trouble, he would not be the one I'd call.

I know I sound like a hormonal teen but I honestly feel really disconnected to my Dad and he makes really passive aggressive comments about me all the time. I have quite an athletic build but when I was younger (probably about 13) he used to pick at my weight, saying I had ""bingo wings"" - which still affects my confidence and I feel quite self conscious in short sleeved shirts. Thankfully, over the years I have helped my confidence a bit so his comments don't really affect me but now he says stuff more about me in general. This evening, he called me a ""burden"" on the family because I didn't know how to shuffle cards and I know it was a joke but it did hurt my feelings and he just kept saying it.

I am not a saint by any means and have definielty been rude and bratty in the past. But when he does get really angry at me, it really affects me when he calls me a ""bitch"" or a ""moody cow"" (really popular insult in the UK) while screaming at me.

I don't know, I honestly just don't seeing us being close at all when I get older. To be frank, I don't really view him as a parent, just someone who lives in my house. He knows nothing about me, nothing about my interests, only speaks to me to annoy me and is constantly passive aggressive or sometimes just aggressive.

I don't know if I even want to be closer with him or how I can be closer with him. Can any people in similar situations give me any advice of how I should continue?",22Nov2020,1

760,"okay, hi, i’m a 16 year old female (virgin, never kissed a guy 😭) with an extremely personal issue that has recently became unbearable to deal with mentally. let me preface, i am straight and have ONLY ever had crushes on guys and fantasised (sexually) about them. i have not once in my life genuinely been attracted to a woman... but. i only pleasure myself to girl-on-girl porn. never really gave it any thought whatsoever. on the odd occasion i’d do a quick online search to see if this was normal, the answer was always yes and that it’s extremely common in straight women. the sex therapist analyses was always congruent with how i felt, (sorry if this is tmi😳) you can relate to females more than you can males, and seeing as male porn is usually focused around males pleasure, it can be difficult for women, especially those who haven’t had sex, to get off. i have in the past, but it’s always been easier for me with women. i have also read that the fantasy sector of your brain is almost always completely segmented away from orientation - which is also congruent with me. but, now for the important part - i was reading before again about this. it was on a conversational website, similar to reddit where this conversation was taking place. some girls said that they had felt this way when they were younger and then as they aged realised they were bi or lesbian. this made my heart stop. as someone who is extremely prone to worrying and assuming that scenarios that are illogical or go against basic sense will occur, this made me feel almost nauseously ill. i’m not a lesbian... or bi?? what if i’m just denying this part of myself... deep down, i know i’m not - there has not been one point where i have looked at a female and felt any sexual or romantic attraction, that should speak for itself, surely. all of the scientific research points to women having a more fluid sexual pleasure - literal scientific research. but this comment made me worry to the point where i was walking around and felt like i needed to throw up. it didn’t leave my mind. what if i’m gay? i know i’m not, and the fact that i’m so nauseatingly anxious about should in some ways be self explanatory that being gay wouldn’t be a way that i’d want to live. this all connected quite intensely with this thought - i have never kissed a guy, i have wanted to but never, i had this thought that terrified me. what if i get into a scenario with a guy where we’re going to have kiss or have sex and i just don’t enjoy it? this made me feel even more nauseous than my previous thought. and it has basically stripped my happiness away from me in the past few days. i cant speak to anyone i know about this, but need pretty immediate advice. can someone offer any. thank you so much.",22Nov2020,1

763,"So long story short, I'm in a position in my life where I'm not sure what I should do, and what steps I should take. As it stands now, I'm currently a 28 year old in school for accounting, and well, I'm not the biggest fan. I have a lot of anxiety over seeing the tremendous workload that a lot of accountants put up with, because I have a hobby that's somewhat time demanding (weightlifting) that I absolutely refuse to give up - it matters to me more than any job. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I also understand that while in the field, there are jobs with less strenuous work hours, those jobs also have essentially zero upward growth whatsoever - and as someone with $50,000 in student loan debt who would eventually like to pay that off, it does matter to an extent. I don't have any desire to be rich, but I'd like to be comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, the biggest issue with accounting, is of course, that I just don't care about it. I don't find it the least bit interesting - I don't care about understanding how corporations work and I don't care to understand the games they play with their finances, it literally does not matter to me. I used to be in engineering school a decade ago, and absolutely loved engineering, but unfortunately, having failed Calc II literally 5 times, both engineering and computer science are lost for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

And not to mention, the idea of working in an office my entire life sounds like the most dreadful, boring thing imaginable. I wouldn't mind working a trade, or something else of that nature, if not for two issues - first of all, at 28, I know that my time in the field would be shorter than most due to the wear and tear the job places on the body. Secondly, my foot is kinda fucked up, making it so I can't stand on it for more than an hour or two at a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So realistically, I'm at an impasse, and don't really know the right step forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I can finish my accounting degree, and from their either go work at one of the public accounting firms - leads to fantastic pay, but would absolutely ruin any semblance of a good life I have for several years. 
* I can finish my accounting degree and go work government or industry immediately. This isn't a horrible choice, as the pay isn't \*bad\* per se, and it means I won't be grinded to the dust. But, it has the downside of basically zero upward mobility, and from my understanding can be difficult to get into without PA experience
* I could finish Calc II at some other school and then go back to the engineering program at my current school. Feasible, except it would add \*even more\* time onto my degree, plus more expenses (I'm going part time as my job pays for it, but they would not pay for class at any other school). 
* I could go into a trade or something along those lines - Pay is okay, but realistically less than the other three, and while I'd enjoy it more, my foot issue plus the physical demands of the job as a whole would make it basically unfeasible long term. 
* I could stay where I'm at. I currently earn $20/hr as a pharmacy technician - it isn't a bad job, but I know that the only reason I'm anything resembling comfortable is because I only have to pay $300 in rent. I know at some point, I'd like to eventually move into a nicer place on my own, and I'd be stretching to afford that right now.

767,"How do I go about confronting and ending a family member who I recently realized has been stealing cash from myself and my mom, stealing clothes and makeup from me and gaslighting me the few times I have suspected something suspicious? 

This has gone on for years, we only recently caught on to it. She is definitely old enough to know right from wrong, she’s 19 and I’m 23.

For example catching her in a photo where she’s wearing my clothes and asking her about it, she’ll tell me I let her borrow it or she accidentally picked it up with her stuff the last time she stayed over. This has happened repeatedly over the years but was never a big deal until I found out about everything else.

Another example, I lost my dab pen (lol) when we were together, while we were looking for it I checked her purse because I had reasonable suspicion.. I didn’t find it but instead found a wallet of mine I had just noticed was missing a week or so before and a perfume of mine. When asked about it she said I had left them at her place the last time I was there, which I know 110% I did not.

Yet another example.. Finding a gift card in the pocket of a jacket of mine and finding out later it was my mothers, meaning she was going through my moms purse as well. 

I have also caught her using my debit card to pay for her meal when we’ve gone out to lunch, when I asked her she downplayed it and just said she had no idea how that would happen and that she gave her card to pay, so they must’ve made a mistake.

Once I really sat down and realized what was going on, which was very hard for me to admit to myself that a person I have always treated so well and considered a sister has almost been plotting against me, I finally said something to her and told her she needed to make sure she didn’t leave with any of my things again because it was happening way too often, she muttered out a sorry and that it wasn’t intentional, left my house and has not contacted me for 5 months.

We were always close before, (we are both only children and the only cousins each other has) and I am insanely hurt and also angry that she has been taking advantage of me for so long, and that I was naive enough to let it happen. 

Am I justified in feeling betrayed? A lot of my family wants me to forgive and forget but I don’t plan on ever having anything to do with her. I don’t think she can be trusted and I think she has some very sociopathic traits.

Some validation on this matter would be really nice. Reactions, feedback, whateva.

I don’t know where I should begin with this but I guess I should just jump right into it. 

I am a 20 year old man with just about 0 self confidence in myself. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t go out or try new things. It feels like everything I do I am being judged for it. It gets down to the simple and little things too. 

Am I walking correctly?
Am I talking correctly?
Did I overshare?
Did I share too little?
Am I eating too fast or slow?

I used to be a kid that didn’t care about what anyone though of me. Back in high school I was nerdy as could be, I was bombastic, loud and even went to school in ‘lowkey’ cosplay. Of course if there was any severe bullying or harassment towards me I never hesitated to speak up about it. 

But now I can’t smile without covering up my mouth, because I hate my smile. I can’t look in the mirror for more than 5 minutes without crying. I cannot express the fashion style I want to without fearing that people are talking about me. I don’t take pictures of myself anymore, and its gotten to the point where my mom doesn’t have any pictures on her phone of me. If I am at the mall or just shopping in general, if I feel that people are judging me I will just forget everything and go home. 

I want to do so many cool things with my life. I’m so young, I shouldn’t be scared to send someone a picture of my face/outfit or scared of expressing myself. I want to be a content creator one day and I want to be a therapist for LGBT youth.... but how can I do that without feeling so small and useless almost...

Hell, I even want to make TikToks but I’m terrified of it. 

I can’t go online for funny stuff to watch without thinking: 
“Must be nice to have XYZ”

I get so jealous over little things now...
I don’t want to be like that. I want to find the confidence I used to have when I was younger. I never felt so insecure about just existing....",22Nov2020,1
770,"Hi. My husband (M47) and I (F44) have been married for 16 years now and we have a very happy marriage. We are also a very kinky couple and our sex life is great even after all this years.

About 5 years ago I realized that I'm a cuckquean and we started to explore this fetish together. I encouraged my husband to seek other women and even date them. Two years ago we finally found our ideal cuckcake (F29) and he's been dating her since then with my permission.

I'm not one of those cuckqueans that want to micromanage everything in the relationship and I let my husband and his girlfriend to make decisions. They can go on dates alone or have sex anytime they want without me. I occasionally join them too. Last year I even let them to go on a vacation together without me. I'm fairly open minded about their relationship.

I fully TRUST my husband.

For the past two years she's been using pills for birth control and I never had any worries about their sex life but three months ago because of a medical reason she stopped taking pills and they've been using condom until she can get back on pills again.

Three days ago, my husband was over at her place and whe he got back home he told me that while they were having sex the condom broke and they didn't realize that and when he came he came right in her. They quickly went out to find plan b and she took one BUT apparently she was very close to her ovulation day!

I'm really scared that she might get pregnant. My husband and I already have 2 teenage kids. How are we going to explain this other kid that he has with this other woman that nobody knows? How our kids gonna react? How our friends and families gonna react?

I really don't know what to do. I've been praying for the past three days that nothing happens but I'm utterly hopeless.

782,"I'm gonna apologize if some sentences don't make sense but english is not my first language and my mind has been all over the place today. 

About one month ago me and my friend got into a little argument. I wasn't anything really deep, she just asked me how much my dad (a mechanic) would charge to change the oil of her car, i told her the price and she was acting bratty about my dad literally only charging the materials and basically working for free. I told her I didn't like her attitude and she asked me what my problem with her was, to which I replied honestly and I told her what's bothering me about her recently. She didn't even bother to read my messages for 3 or 4 days and she hasn't replied ever since. I wasn't even being disrespectful, I genuinely wanted to talk about the problems we've had because there were some weird tensions between us lately. It's also her birthday and I didn't congratulate her because if she can't make the effort to talk to me I'm not gonna give her that kind of attention, even if I feel kinda bad. I know I can be stubborn too but still. 

I generally didn't care much to be honest because I've learned that if my ""friends"" don't value me, I don't need to value them either. And to be honest I don't even miss her too much. For context, she's actually a very toxic person. She's very narcissistic, has a huge ego and is generally very, very disrespectful and ungrateful. I know some people may ask  me ""why were you even friends with her?"". And I can only say that we just went through a lot together, I've known her for eight years now and it's extremely difficult to let go of people like that. If you've been in a similar situation you probably know the struggle. I know I should've ended it earlier but that's too late now. 

Anyways, I've been debating on ending the friendship quite a lot in the past year and I kinda see this as my escape. I just don't know how to feel, she's been draining my energy so much, she doesn't really care about how I feel, she uses me for her own well being and I don't wanna do it anymore. But it just feels so wrong to let go of someone that you shared so much with.

On the other hand I'm also extremely scared of what she will do now. She has a lot of information in me that I really don't want anyone besides my friends to know and I have a bad feeling that she will use this against me. Our friend group also overlaps a little and I just know that she will try to take them away from me. We actually used to hang out with multiple of our friends quite a lot but now that things have been going well with her boyfriend, she hasn't talked to any of them for a long time. Except for today, she asked a close friend of mine, that she always used shamelessly for her own good, to hang out because it's her birthday.

For context: She's 20, 1 year older than me, so it's not like she's a teenager that's going through puberty, no it's actually gotten real bad when puberty ended for her. I understand that she has her fair share of problems too but that's not an excuse to literally terrorize your friends

Ok so to finally come to an end, I just don't know how to move on from now. I don't know how to handle this situation at all and I am extremely anxious of how things will continue. I don't want to save the friendship, I just want peace for both sides and maybe I just need some assuring words since my mom has been giving me a hard time for this today. (not gonna start talking about my mom now though otherwise it'd be way too long)

TLDR: I haven't talked to a (toxic) friend in 1 months because of a small argument and now I dont know what to do",22Nov2020,1

I know that what these people think about me is irrelevant and I won't see them again in a few months, but it's the only thing I can ever think about.

I may be neurodivergent and have been known to hyperfixate in the past, but it has always been on media series, not people's opinions of me. Please help me bring this to an end.",22Nov2020,1

I’ve used drugs to phase out most things which bother me, death no longer bothers me anymore. After losing 7 friends and my brother I use opiates, synthetic cannabinoid’s frequently and I smoke PCP analogues a lot. I genuinely don’t think death bothers me anymore because of the excessive drug use has made it so I can’t feel sad. Also I’m using some of the older synthetic cannabinoid’s and I practice harm reduction so it’s not as dangerous as some may believe it to be. Opiates are more of a problem, most nights I’m sipping on fent juice because I can’t get real lean anymore, I also abuse Oxy most weeks.

I feel like my time is up though and that I lived my life to the fullest but now it’s time to play my final card, it’s hard to put into words but nothing makes me feel sad or angry anymore, it’s like I’ve won at life. But not in a good way I’ve beaten the game to soon.

People believe I’m on cocaine when I’m not and apparently my decision making is irrational.

I used to prioritise earning money but I literally don’t care anymore, I can burn thousands on drugs and partying in a single night and I’ve burnt a lot of money on rolling dice. I’m not even that bothered by it but I want to be bothered by it and shocked like everyone else is.

I need help and want to be grounded again. I used to make 5 figures a week and now I’m just a failure living of my past successes. All I want is an alternate life where I’m just a regular person, with a family and a safe home. I just want to have a life that centres around boring shit like school grades.

I turned a scar from where I was stabbed into “ ” (it hurt a lot and took me 7 hours) it’s a quote which is important to me, I used to work with a lot of Chinese people, I speak a bit of mandarin and China in general has played a large part in my life. It was one of the last things a friend said to me, so it has some personal value to it but once again everyone overlooks my reasons for doing it and calls me unstable.

I just want to have a normal life, has drug abuse put me in this mindset ? And is it irreversible ?",22Nov2020,1

We have tried everything possible to make it happen but with me, I just never feel that sense of euphoria that everyone talks about when describing orgasms. I feel good momentarily then I just get extremely uncomfortable and the brief feeling of pleasure disappears and I just wait for it to be over. Obviously penetration isn’t usually the main cause of female orgasm but even clitoral stimulation makes me feel good for a few seconds before I just hate the feeling and ask him to stop. I wondered for a while if it was a problem with my boyfriend but even when I try to get myself off, I feel nothing. It’s really annoying because I want to feel as brilliant as people say orgasms are but I find them to be such an jarring experience. What can I do? Is there something wrong with me? Why don’t I enjoy sex? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Tia!",22Nov2020,1

She just passed and I want to take the day tomorrow to be with my mother but I feel guilty asking for it. Anyone give me any advice.

790,"I’ve only been working at my current job for about 5 months, so I don’t know many of my coworkers that well yet. I enjoy mostly independent work, with group work being a small portion of my obligations. It’s not that I don’t like people, I’ve just been extremely disappointment in group work in previous jobs, and value being measured on my own work ethic, not others.

A new employee was hired about a month ago and 2 weeks in they moved her desk next to mine. Naturally, we small talked about where we previously worked. She used to work for a community college in the Special Needs department. Her role was to supervise students who needed extra time on exams. She is not a licensed psychologist nor does she have any formal education in the matter. She was paid scarcely above minimum wage and from the sound of it, didn’t interact much with the students at all.

On Thursday, after the other employees had left for the day, I was finishing up some work when out of the blue she turned around and said, “Can I ask - are you on the spectrum?” In the moment, I didn’t know how to respond, so I laughed and said, “what makes you think that?” To which she replied, “You have a lot of attributes of someone who is very autistic.”

My tone changed as I very intensely said, “No, I am not autistic.” Obviously she realized that I was offended as she scrambled to apologize profusely for asking me. 

I left work feeling very indifferent about it. I wanted to believe that her intent was not to be insulting, but the weekend has passed and the more I think about it the angrier I am. If I was autistic, it’s none of her business and the fact that I’m not implies that there is something wrong with my brain. I ran it by my boyfriend and he said it was extremely inappropriate, especially in a work place setting. He urged me to go to HR and report her. I’m not sure if that’s the right thing to do as I am still “new” and don’t want to create tension; but I also feel like I don’t want to work near her anymore either.

What do you think would be the appropriate next step in dealing with this? Do you think her question is offensive?",22Nov2020,1

And this isn’t the first time.. I ALWAYS get ulcers / canker sores. I don’t even drink or eat anything that could cause it, so I don’t have any idea why it’s happening. I get them on a daily basis all around my mouth, tongue or lips and sometimes I even get 4 at once.",22Nov2020,1

My life is meaningless.

If it helps for me to provide some information, then I’ll do that. Like I said, I’m a 17 year old girl. I have a few hobbies like writing, blogging, and I paint sometimes and play instruments, and while I love those things, I also tend to avoid doing them. I don’t know why. I wish I knew why. I have a complicated relationship with my family, and while we tend to have our troubles, I’m hoping for the best.

I don’t know what to do. I’m at that point in life where everyone expects me to know what I want to do and who I want to be although I’m only so young. It’s unfair and it’s too much pressure. 
My life feels empty. It feels like something is missing but I don’t know what it is. I don’t know how to find that missing piece that will create my happiness.
Constantly trying to find my purpose in life is exhausting, but even more so, I’m tired of waking up everyday and being of no use to myself, anyone else, or society as a whole. That’s even more exhausting.

I’ve been fighting for my life to finally make sense since I was ten years old, and to be honest, all I really want is to just be happy.

797,"Hello there. I’m not sure if this is just all one big coincidence or not.

This started around August of last year. I kept getting phone calls from a guy asking for someone who wasn’t me. The first time I said,” sorry,you have the wrong number” he didn’t say anything at all and just hung up the phone.
He then called me again the following morning,and actually woke me up,it was around 6am. I told him again. “Why are you still calling me? I told you yesterday you have the wrong number” he replied “oh sorry” this time and hung up.
He called me a third time!! the following morning and by this point,I’d had enough and just sort of went off on him because he woke me up yet again! I said “listen buddy,stop fucking calling me!!’” and just put the phone down on him” I blocked the number after this and didn’t hear anything again. 

About a month later I received another call. I picked it up and it was just silence. I kept saying “hello” over and over but no one answered,so I hung up. I later realised all of my phone credit had been taken. So I blocked this number too. 

I hadn’t heard anything again for a while after this until around January time. Someone called about a debt or something(which I’m certainly not in debt)like the first guy he wouldn’t stop calling me until I blocked the number. At this point I had started to wonder if all these calls were linked. 

Fast forward a month or two later got a voicemail from a guy claiming to be from an interior design company. He was calling about me picking up a table and chairs,and to call him back to arrange a time to do so. he left a couple voicemails. This could of been legit I thought as the company was a real interior design company and was a local number. after googling the name it was actually in my area.  
I called the company and said I keep getting voicemails from a guy called “Steve” about picking up some tables and chairs and to just let him know he’s calling the wrong number. but they said a Steve doesn’t work there and thought it was strange too. 

I remember also receiving a call from a guy about a debt(which I’m certainly not in debt)I don’t recall exactly what he said. but I just put the phone down. Like the first guy he called me a few times until I blocked the number. 

A month ago I received a text message from something called “Clubhouse”. This is the exact message: Your driver Helen will deliver your parcel today between 09:43-10:43, you do have options if you're not going to be in www.dpd.co.uk/b/6dPux6VdmCJ3. DONT CLICK THAT LINK!

after this message I received a text message from PayPal saying I had been locked out of my PayPal account due to a login from a suspicious location. Luckily I don’t keep money In My PayPal Account as I don’t really use it anymore. 

I’ve been getting these strange messages throughout the year about debt,parcel collection/delivery. 

I received the same message from this clubhouse yesterday. With the exact same message just with a different delivery time for said package,followed by the link. I’m curious what the link is but don’t wanna click on it. 

As I said this could all be a coincidence and maybe just looking into it too much,and the text messages I’m receiving are just standard spam. But I’ve never had them before until this year, and getting them along with the somewhat strange calls maybe it’s all linked,I don’t know. 
If my paypal has been compromised(which that could also of  been a some sort of scam messages)makes me worry what else they could potentially have gotten into. I have been checking get online banking on regular basis and checking for suspicious transaction but haven’t found anything. 
My mum had money taken out of her bank account a few months ago and had it shutdown and had to get a new bank card. She got the money back that was taken after filling out a few forms and She did contract the police, but there wasn’t anything they could really do. 

I wish I’d not deleted all the messages I’ve received over this past year because there was a lot of strange ones. The only ones I have are from this clubhouse on my phone. I’m gonna start keeping a record of any more calls,voicemails and messages I receive just incase something comes up.",22Nov2020,1

802,"Unsure about my position at AmeriCorps

Hi everyone. I recently signed up for AmeriCorps with the Child Abuse and Prevention Center in North Highlands, CA (Sacramento). However I’m not enjoying it and hate it. I’m a home visitor and  supposed to provide one on one case management to families who has experienced domestic violence, are in a crisis, and educate parents about nurturing parenting techniques. The whole point of AmeriCorps was to fix my resume up since I quit 2 jobs within the past 5 months (April-July 2020 and July-Sept 2020). I have my bachelor and master in public health but really lost on what I want to do now. I’ve accumulated 60K from my master program but now not really liking the field that I’m in. I’m hating my Americorps position too and don’t know if public health is for me. When I graduated in Jan 2020 I was so excited to start my career but then COVID happened and really ruined the experience for me. I’m not sure what I should do now. If I terminate my AmeriCorps contract then I’ll have to start paying back my student loans but I don’t have a full time job lined up. I’ve been depressed since May 2020 and not myself anymore.

I vaguely remember several weeks back that they would be offering bonuses for employees that went ""above and beyond""  the normal scope of their jobs, at the recommendation of team leadership and upper management. While I am happy to have received this bonus, I am puzzled by the fact that no one from management approached me to let me know that I would be receiving this award.

804,"My boyfriend lives on the other side of the world. When I met him, I knew I wanted to grow old with him. He's kind and sweet, but he can't  be honest with me. He had to leave my country in March during the first throws of COVID, and I've only seen him once since. It's been difficult as i have been trying to move to his country, but because of all the layers of uncertainty with the pandemic, it's not currently possible. 

It all started when we first got together. He had never been with anyone before whereas I had, and I told him that the most important thing to me is honesty and integrity. I want someone to be direct with me, as I do. I was hurt when I found out he had hung out with another girl (I'm not sure if she thought it was a date) who had feelings for him, and he hadn't told me and I found out through his friends later. I told him the problem wasn't that he had spent time with her, but that he hadnt told me. But I was willing to let it slide as it was the first time.

Since then there have been several instances where he has lied/hasn't told me the truth. I won't go into them all, but the most notable is first when I found out he had been speaking to my ex best friend. This girl had hurt me so badly, emotionally and financially, and he knew this. When I moved out from the house I lived with her, I said I cut all contact with her. I understood he still considered  a friend though, and I asked him to tell me if she messaged him. He didn't tell me and it broke my heart. I couldn't understand why it was more important to him to be friends with everyone than just be honest with me. I felt betrayed that he had seen me cry my heart out over this girl and he still chose to be friends with her, and couldn't even have the balls to tell me about it.

Most recently, we were on the phone and he said his close friend (who is a girl) said she wanted to have a meal with him but he wasn't going to go. I knew her as a good friend to him, so I asked why he didn't want to go, and he said he was busy. Later he messaged me and told me he lied, and it was actually because before we got together he actually had a crush on this girl, and he felt guilty hanging out with her one on one (which he hadnt done since we got together). I thanked him for telling me the truth, but I felt terrible because I didn't want him to restrict his friendships for me but mostly because I was hurt that he didn't tell me how he had felt about her. I tell him everything regarding that kind of stuff, and I've made it so clear it was important that he tells me about that so I can know. I even asked him in the past if there was any history between him and this girl. Now he is pushing her away because he's guilty about me, and I feel bad for her.

The problem is that since this incident, I've realised that he probably will never be honest with me. I know it is important to him to avoid conflict with everyone, so even when his friends were mean to me he didn't confront them. It is in his nature to hide the truth when he thinks it would cause pain. Is it too big of an ask for him to change this aspect of himself for our relationship? 

I've been feeling so insecure, and almost every day this week when we have spoken on the phone I've cried and said I really hope he can be honest with me. I think my behaviour is starting to get frustrating and I worry I may be being manipulative and horrible by making him feel so guilty by crying and saying how much it has hurt me. 

Is our relationship over?

TL;DR My boyfriend constantly lies and hides the truth from me to avoid conflict despite me saying it's important to me that he's honest. Should I break up with him?",22Nov2020,1

809,"First, I want to say that I know that I am overthinking this. I know this is a long story, and I know that I act very immaturely in parts of this. My immaturity might be part of the issue to begin with.

I am in general, a people person, good at reading people’s emotions etc. But for the life of my I don’t get this guy.

I (f/twenties) started a new job in August. My coworker (m/twenties) is physically out of my league. We didn’t speak much for the first week. But when I went to be friendly and introduce myself more personably to him and another female coworker who just started we spoke about a few personal things and while we were on the subject of significant others he asked me if I had a type, if I was his type and if I was easy. I was really thrown off by this and said that I just met him and so I had no idea if he was my type.

A few weeks later the other female coworker told me to ask him if he was interested in her. She’s a bit younger and for some unknown reason I agreed to this. When I asked to speak with him alone he got very nervous. Then he brought her with him for ‘backup’ even though she knew what I was doing. Eventually I got him alone and asked him for her. He was shocked, said he would never get with a coworker and we moved on.

He Dm’d me a few times on insta during this.

Over the next few weeks he and I struggled as coworkers. I texted him a few times about missing deadlines and working with my students. He asked a bunch of people what I wanted from him. At this point a lot of my coworkers started to ask if we were dating since we acted so awkwardly around one another. I felt like this was due to our work struggles.

Then he bought me raid. I thought the company had bought it, however when I went to return it, he told me he had bought it for my office.

All during this I felt as if I were neutral to him, but he believed that I thought he was bad at his job. (he is)

One day he came to talk to me after work ended and asked me a bunch of personal questions and opened up a bunch to me, I thought it was really nice. The next day he told a coworker that he was super stressed after he left because he thought I didn’t like him due to his views (not true). I told him later that I enjoyed our talk and it made me view him more positively.

The female coworker who had a crush on him was upset that he and I were bonding and convinced me that he said something bad about me. In a VERY VERY immature moment I said something rude to him, we worked it out and moved on. The next day he texted me to travel safely to an event that I was going to.

Move forward a few weeks and he and I once again have some differences at work. He texts me a long apology. I don’t respond because it felt unnecessary. Three days later he tells me he thinks I’m mad at him and that he has never met anyone in his life that gives him anxiety. We continue on.

I decided to olive branch him and ask him to help me with something at work. He agrees. During this time the female coworker asks him to hang outside of work. He says no, then comes over to me and says that he wouldn’t hang out with a coworker outside of work because it can get messy. I agree with him, but think it’s a weird thing for him to say to me since I didn’t ask.

He helps me after work and its fine. He is very nice and walks me out at the end and doesn’t leave until I leave. While he was helping me we talk about our personal lives a little and I mention a man I’ve been seeing and he gets really excited and starts calling him a bunch of pet names. Ex: Spencer (Yeah, my man SPENCE BOY)

We have a work group text. All my coworkers said happy birthday in the group text. He texts me separately. Then after work he texts me (first personal, non work related texts) asking me about my day and encouraging me to drink. It felt like it could be flirty, but was probably just nice.

During the down times he and I have a very neutral personal relationship and semi-stressful work one. Like I said earlier I tend to get along with most people and understand my relationships with them. However, this guy drives me crazy because I don’t know what he’s doing or why our coworker relationship is not easy. I feel like he doesn’t like me and it drives me crazy",22Nov2020,1

811,"Hi I need some advice.

So here's the situation. I want to get a rhinoplasty (nose job). I've wanted to get one for a long time. In fact, I was bullied as a child called ""Witch"" and what not because of the bump on my nose. Now obviously that has caused my self esteem to dwindle. I am completely aware that I hate my nose because society has deemed a straight nose to be beautiful and pretty and a bump on a nose has been depicted ugly and has been in many movies with witches. I have sat with these thoughts and realized that the only reason i don't like my nose is because I have been trained to like a certain type of nose. However despite me being aware of that I still want a nose job. It would take away that problem. The thing is, I want to change my nose for MYSELF, not my husband not anybody else. I want to be able to look in the mirror and not hate my nose every time. 

Now the only thing stopping me is my husband. He is not supportive and he thinks that I'm beautiful the way I am which I totally understand that this man married me for me. He thinks that I'm trying to put a bandaid on other deep rooted issues. He also thinks that I'm going to want to change other stuff about myself after i change my nose. Money isn't the issue. I have my own separate finances that I have saved. 

My husband thinks that I would benefit from therapy where they can break these issues I have about myself rather than go do something drastic. I do think therapy would help me with my self esteem. But even when i've been my happiest i've hated my nose. He said he will be there for me and take me but that he does not agree with me or  support it. I just can't imagine getting surgery that he isn't supportive of. 

If i was single i would have already done this and it makes me so sad that his absence of support is stopping me from doing something that is going to make me happy. I've stayed with this man after he's cheated on me multiple times and been a good wife to him. He smokes weed multiple times a day and that bothers me but i have learned to let it go for the sake of saving an argument. I just feel like damn dude I've been so good to you even when you haven't been perfect or deserved it and you can't even support me when I want to do something that will make me happy. 

What should i do?",22Nov2020,1
812,"I don't have many friends and I made a group of about 4 friends online. Specifically on Twitch. 

It was amazing to finally have people to talk to and hang out with and I looked forward to playing games and talking with them almost every day both on and off stream.

Recently in the past month and a half I introduced one of my friends from outside of Twitch to them and this friend started to hang out with them. He started donating hundreds of dollars to them and avidly supporting them. Now the group doesn't really talk to me or hang out with me any more. It's like I've been replaced. I haven't gotten invited to a single thing or gotten a DM from them in a month. All they do is talk about how awesome my friend is now and it's like they're all best buds.

I guess one part of me is happy that everyone made a new friend, but I can't help but have these feelings of jealousy and resentment. I get so upset and so angry every day. It's really hard because I can't be mad at anyone about it. I don't want to be mad at the group and I can't be mad at my friend because I know logically he is not intentionally trying to hurt me.. I just feel like a selfish brat for feeling the way I do and it just really sucks.

I guess mainly I am not sure what to do with my emotions. I want to stop being so hurt and angry every day. It would be nice to make some more friends, but I feel like making friends isn't something simple you just go out and do.. at least not for me.",22Nov2020,1

It has been 10 days since my symptoms arose so I see no need to get re tested at this moment, but I’m scared I’m not going to get my sense of taste and smell back.

I’m feeling scared and sad right now because I’m 19 and I can’t smell anything right now. If I never get my sense of smell back I’m never going to be able to smell rain or coffee again. How am I going to be able to tell if my milks gone bad and how am I ever going to be able to smell if I have a gas leak. 

I can kinda taste right now so I’m not as worried in that aspect, but I’m still scared.  The statistics I read are not helping my anxiety right now. I guess only one in ten people get it back.

But we’re all going to die one day. Being dead doesn’t mean she was now magically this great person with no faults. 

When my parents and grandparents cleaned out her apartment they found literally years worth of journals she’s kept since maybe her childhood. Among the journals they found a letter she wrote to me. It specifies it’s only for me to read. I have it sitting in my room and I’m not sure if I’m ready to read it. They’ve even given me some of her journals. The whole family are planning on reading all of them. I wonder if she wrote about molesting me at all. If she did and I don’t say something first that’s how everyone is gonna find out.

826,"So, I have a friend, let's call him Pink, who runs a roleplay server on Discord. Pink a nice person, though he could be a bit... *troublesome* at times. I won't say exactly what he does, since I don't want anyone to figure out who he is, but Pink does stuff that some people on his server don't like that much. We try to get Pink to change, and he tries to, but this kind of stuff still happens every now and then. Despite this, I've become pretty good friends with Pink. My other friend, let's call him Green, has been part of his server for some time, helping out with it quite a bit. He later left, mainly because he was tired of dealing with Pink. Green tried quite a bit to get Pink to change, even to the point of getting Pink's first account disabled over something serious that happened months ago and using alts and other people to see what's happening in the server while his main is not in it.

Earlier today, Green sent me a DM saying he has a plan to get Pink to change. He proceeds to tell me I, along with another friend, should say in Pink's server that I'm ""fed-up"" over Pink's actions and leave the server saying I'll ""return when Pink is ready to actually act mature"", staying out for at least a day. Green says if Pink really cares about us, he'll change.

I think the plan is unreasonable, because like I said earlier, Pink and I are good friends, and I don't want to leave him like this. Green justifies this by saying ""Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind"". I don't know what to do. Yes, Pink is a bit troublesome, but he only does it because he wants to be happy. I feel like the plan is an actual emotional attack on Pink. What should I do?",22Nov2020,1

832,"So my boyfriend of 5 years and I moved into an apartment with 3 strangers (including one couple) at the beginning of September. They were super cool at first and we hung out a lot. 

The roommate in question “Jay” always talked to me and my bf. From the beginning, he liked my bf more presumably because they’re both guys. Even though Jay would mainly talk about interests *I* have that my bf doesn’t have (such as the stock market) he only talked to my bf about it and acted like I could never possibly know anything about it bc I’m female. If we were both there, he’d primarily look at my bf like I wasn’t even there. 

They bonded over video games and computers, and Jay started asking my bf to do stuff with him like fixing his car and putting together things. He never bothered to ask me even when I showed interest, he acted like I wasn’t really there. 

Now Jay never talks to me at all and talks to my bf less too, but still asks him to do things like build things. It honestly really hurts me that he does this and leaves me out.

835,"So to give you some context I've been going through a really bad time in my life, I've been depressed for almost 2 years now. It all started when I got into uni. after finishing high school i went directly to study something I didn't even like cuz i couldn't afford the major i wanted (languages and culture) cuz it was only available in two expensive unis and my financial situation is not good at all. So I remember having constant anxiety before starting classes and feeling sad every single day cuz i was about to do something that was gonna define my life and that something I hated it. 

After i started classes I realized it wasn't so bad, it was just like school you know, you just study, do hw, exams just because you have to basically, but after some time I started getting more frustrated and feeling like I didn't fit there, i didn't like my professors, i didn't like the environment, i didn't like any classes and i didn't like anybody, I'd meet someone and i just couldn't feel comfortable with anyone, i just hated being there and that made me hate my life, i would always feel like I had no escape (i still do) . 
So anyways, the end of the that year was really bad, i would barely go to class and barely pay attention and i didnt tell my mom anything about how I was feeling cuz i didn't want her to worry. So then year was over, i was feeling better cuz i finished classes and everything was kinda fine till classes started again... I swear, i stopped going to class and i was thinking about dropping uni and then see what the hell to do with my life but I didn't wanna go through that, i wanted to do what I loved and find a way to do it but it would always look fucking impossible and that would make me feel more trapped. 
And now here comes the worst part.... Covid :). Classes were online, i didn't have to see anybody or go anywhere but I felt even worse, every single day I would cry and feel like a waste in this world, this anxiety of not knowing what i would do if I dropped uni and stopped studying was killing me and i was always worried of being kicked out cuz i would barely attend classes :/ It didn't happen, i managed to pass everything but then the cycle again, vacations, feeling better, classes again. 
This leaves us with the present, i started classes again but was feeling so bad and like everything was so pointless i just never attended classes. My semester is still on and i haven't been in a single class but the thing is that this affected my relationship with my mom. At first she was understanding when I told her how I was feeling and why I stopped attending but then she told her sister what was happening with me and she told my mom many things and ever since that happened my mom won't stop telling me that I can't drop uni and that i have to keep studying and this is killing me. I got so depressed that i don't do anything anymore, I'm every day watching Friends, watching YouTube not doing anything, I'm not doing anything for me and my life, i feel like a total failure and idk how to fix my emotions, idk what to fucking do, i feel like I'm broken and i don't have goals anymore. I mean, if I don't study then what are my other options? Getting a shitty job and then do what? Here in my country opportunities of having a good life are shit (I'm from latin america) 

Anyways, I know uni is not the only reason, I'm scared of what's gonna happen with me, I'm scared studying something I hate was actually my only way of not being a total waste and i blew it, I'm scared I'll never be able to do something that makes me feel fulfill and living just because, I'm scared cuz I've changed so much and I'm not the same girl I used to be who was sure of what she wanted from life and was so motivated she'd think she could be successful, I'm scared of not being able to be myself again :) I feel so freaking lost in the world and like my life is completely pointless and instead of trying to do better I'm so sunk into these feelings i don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. I used to study languages by myself online i used to learn choreographies in my free time, excersice, and now I don't even feel like i want to do anything and I'm just so agghhhhhhhh

i know no one can fix my life and tell me the answers to happiness but I guess I just wanna feel again, i just wanna feel like i have a purpose again and maybe someone can tell me how and what your experience is like...

Some people get discouraged and demotivated after a devastating event, while others manage to stand up and react positively thanks to their attitude and to the fact that they are in peace with their body and their mind (obviously genetic factors also play a role, but the attitude is still more important)

Also, if you can't feel good alone, don't be afraid of letting yourself be helped by someone that is specialized in this area and can lend you a hand, don't be afraid to ask for help when you're in trouble. Because feel good with themselves is someone that everyone should try.

My instagram account got disabled - and I read that a good way of actually getting it back other than appealing was through the Facebook business account - the thing is, I don't own any business, so I would have to make ""fake"" new one - not exactly sure how to set it up tho, to make it look legit so it doesn't get removed immediately.

Did I handle this correctly?

I have a profile on a dating site and I received messages from a man that I was not interested in. I always try to be polite but I was unable to get this man to leave me alone but today he was saying that he caught a racoon in a trap and he wanted to know if I would like it so I can cook and eat it. Of course I reminded him that I was a vegan and that I loved animals ( since that information is already in my profile) so I said I would like for him to release the racoon and I was NOT interested in eating the racoon. He said he would only release the racoon if I gave him my phone number and kissed him...which I dont see how I can do that over the phone or the internet...anyway, I started fearing that he may have really had a racoon trapped so he said he would take a video of himself releasing the racoon but I needed to give him my phone number....he said he wont release the racoon until tomorrow. Out of desperation for the racoon I told him I would give him my phone number when he is ready to release the racoon. He started demanding that I give him my phone number now or else he would be wearing a racoon hat. At that point I became disgusted by the entire situation since I was NOT interesting in anything to do with him to begin with and only responded in the first place to be polite. I was also exhausted from working all night and was not really in the right mindset to deal with this manipulative conversation and it disgusted me to think that he was so pathetic to try and trap me to give him my phone number so I just told him how I really felt about him and the things I said were very very unkind and blocked him. 

Now I am worried about the racoon...but of course he might have just been lying to me anyway! This was the most pathetic thing I ever seen someone do to be honest! I just hope if there is a racoon I did not jeapordize the animals life! I just did NOT want this man having my phone number. I feel very disturbed by the conversation and I fear that I did not handle that correctly...especially if there was an animals life at stake!

Did I handle that right in your opinion? Thanks",22Nov2020,1
844,"(It’s hypothetical at this point and a tad more nuanced than it sounds)

So, I work at a small ecommerce warehouse. I process orders and ship 30-60 packages out a day. Day-to-day I am the only person there, besides my boss popping in once every week or so to make sure I haven’t burned the place down. The only other people I see are delivering inventory and return boxes (USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc.) who I can easily distance from, or the occasional customer coming to pick up something in person (usually they phone ahead). So, little if any contact with others.

I have talked with my boss before about sick leave and COVID specifically, and while it doesn’t seem like he’s going to fire me if I catch it and refuse to come into work for 14 days, he has encouraged me to keep coming into work if that happens. I’ve been upfront about my discomfort with that idea, because I worry that it would still be too much of a risk in spreading it to others through the mail.

I can’t find any guidance on a situation like mine from an actual epidemiologist, just that workers shouldn’t come in while sick. I realize the risks are probably really low (especially from the data I’ve seen on surface spread), but I would never forgive myself if I passed it onto someone else while knowing I was sick. Would I be overreacting if I stopped coming into work if I was asymptomatic/had mild symptoms but was still positive?",22Nov2020,1
845,"never go out of my way to try in make him feel bad about himself, but he just does things that piss me off. Like, he decided to get a cat when he doesn't make enough money to take care of one. A little over a year ago he said that his cat was acting nauseous, and not eating, so he took her to the vet. They suggested x rays to find out exactly what was wrong, or he could try medication, and hope it helps. He told me the x rays woild have costed $600, so he decided to try the medication. This is litteraly what he said ""im hoping the medication will work, because the. X rays are too expensive, and I'd rather have her put to sleep then pay that money"". The medication thankfully ended up curing whatever it was. 

Also, a couple months ago he wanted to buy a $60 dollar anime box set, so he asked if I thought it would irresponsible for him to buy that. I told him that he should make sure he has money saved up for his cat. He said he's only able to put aside $100 aside for the cat at all times. Im sorry, but you never know what could happen to a cat, especially since his cat is an outside cat. I payed 900 for surgery to remove mast cell tumors from my dog, and had already payed 2k for tests, and I was willing to spend thousands more. $100 for an emergency fund is measly, and you shouldn't have an animal if thats all you have for an emergency fund. Anyway, I told him it wouldn't be a good idea to spend his money on something he's doesn't need, and not on his cat. He went, and bought it anyways. So what was the point of asking for my advice if you weren't gonna take it? It's because I didn't tell him what he wanted to hear. Also, he's ran into someone's car with his twice, and decided to drive off without leaving a not both times, and then the other day he comes out to discover someone else ran into his car, and he is absolutely pissed. 

Just a couple weeks ago, he texts me saying something like ""oh man I was gonna buy a ps5 off of wallmarts site, but the site crashed when I tied to buy it"". I didnt even respond. His next text was ""I was buying  the ps5, and I put my pin # in wrong lol"". I know what he's trying to do. He knows I'd think he's stupid, for spending $400-$500 on soemething when he cant even afford to properly take care of his cat. I dont know were he got the money, but come on. He just needs to get his priorities straight.

Here is something he does that really makes me question if I actually want to be friends with him. He says his cat often catches mice, and brings them inside. He said that one time he caught a mouse, and out it im a bowl of water, and watched it drown. Another time there was a rat chewing wires in his car. He said if he caught it, he was gonna chuck it at the ground, and watch it suffer. 

Also, here's soemething else he does that I find terrible. He doesn't wash his hands after he takes a shit, and HE WORKS IN A GROCERY STORE. He doesn't touch the food, or anything, but he stocks magazines, which all sorts of people touch, and we live in am elderly community. I sent him a CDC link about hand washing, and made him promise to wash his hands for now on. Idk, its juts exhausting trying to make sure he's being responsible. Ive been ignoring him for like a week. Am I a toxic person for that?",22Nov2020,1

So, before that I was very confused, I liked girls but I also found boys attractive, and I was very insecure in that regard because I didn't know what to do, so I never had a romantic experience in my teens, and now that I'm way more confident, I've started to get lowkey attractive and people are starting to notice me, especially the boys.

 BUT one thing I've noticed is, the boys I usually attract are teenagers (or creepy old men), rarely people my age, and that makes me feel bad because I see all these openly LGBTQ+ kids having so much fun, being who they wanna be while being young, and I'm still lowkey not entirely myself even if I'm more confident than ever before, — and my entire year went by flying, still single but almost 21, in a blink of an eye I will be freaking 40, everything is going on so fast,

859," I am  living with my partner in  a small flat. Most of my stuff is in my room, because there is very little storage space.   


I used to be be a bit messy, but also managed to have a system in place to organise things. The things that I was using were visible in their places- eg keys on nails. Books were sorted by category and in a way that had those that I was about to read on the top. Things that I did not use, were put away in boxes, and I had a box or two for current papers. Within this system things were frequently messy, but that did not upset things so much, because the mess was only limited to the things that I was currently working on, and I could always return it to it's place at the end of the day, or week, or however long I was involved with it.   
  However it became a problem since I've moved into this place, because I did not have time to transfer things during the move in the order they were kept, and a lot of papers were completely disorganised as a result. In the last year, a lot o things were also added on top.   
As an example, I kept one category of official letters in a rough order in a box, by the  time they arrived. This got completely messed up in the move, and now I  have a box full of loose pages that are difficult to match, and all look fairly similar. This applies to about 5 boxes, but two are the worst, because they have a lot of very similar papers.   
Normally I'd bin them, but I feel that I might need them when I choose to apply for citizenship in the country I am in now, to prove my stay.   


I am not even touching the issue now- my mind halted at the problem of clothes and stuff that I don't need but also want to sell, rather than throw out. I keep trying to sort them out to recycle, and sell, but I get overwhelmed by the amount of decision making, the inability to store them, to get them out of the place.   
I've decluttered  twice, giving a lot of books and clothes away to charity, but the stuff keeps getting more annoying by the day. 

All the time I am still kind of messy. Eg. after I get dressed, the clothes I did try on, but ended up not wearing,  end up lying around on the floor, together with laundry that should be on the shelves, but isn't, because the wardrobe has shelves that get disorganised quickly. I do try to put them away in the evening,  but it accumulates again in the next day.   
Did I mention the hammer and craft work materials lying around, the jewellery, the books, and hair pins, the clothes pegs, and the books that I am currently reading? And the things that I am not using after the move, but don't know what to do with - such as a bike mount for the wall?  


I don't really know how to approach this anymore. I am really overwhelmed- it feels like all this unsorted clutter and mess, is preventing me from living efficiently in the moment, and the inefficiencies add to the mountain of clutter, sapping all the energy to do anything else. 

In the previous place, I'd just put everything I don't need in a storage space, and deal with it one a  time, but here that's not an option.   
   
I just don't know where to start - I've lost my ability to prioritise in this context. 

  
I need help with managing this-   


\- Is there a simple system I could use to get a grip on my situation and move out of this block? I know that once I stop feeling overwhelmed, things will be ok.  
\- what kind of help is available and appropriate to get over being messy?   
\- is there potentially a mental health condition that I could look into getting diagnosed and help with? Regardless if I function well or not, I am always messy, and struggle to continue things that I start - which I feel might be the real root of the problem.",22Nov2020,1

At the beginning I didn’t notice too much, but then I slightly sense something very competitive over literally every single thing, and she aims on me among other girls in our house somehow. 

1. Everything started with she imitated one of my drawing and posted it on her Instagram, it was exactly mine. Then tell my laptop password to others (she knows it because she borrows my laptop to play game) 
2. Thing is only getting weird when once i was so sad of my parent‘s divorce and i shared my feelings with other housemates, she cut my conversation and said her parent also got problem that it’s even worse, do they want to lister to her story instead (?!) 
3.  she told to her girlfriend that she wanted soft toys and the cutlery set like me for Christmas gifts. Everything starts with a drawing, and now the list is getting longer skincare routine, food, dolls, backpack, dishes, pot, clothes, socks, even hobbies like clay modelling. if i have something (even if it’s a gift from friends) she will have exact ones tomorrow (!!!) but the funny thing is she barely touch them, just show me then put them aside
4. we have a deal that if she cooks dinner, i’ll clean washroom and dishes since i don’t enjoy cooking. Then we have different diet and she‘s no longer cook for us anymore, however, every time i ask her to do dishes and clean washroom, she quietly go to her girlfriend’s house to chill. Ended up i‘ve done all of them
5. There was a time when i got sick and absence from school, when i was back, friends came to ask me if i fell better, she answer all of them for me, told them that she live in the same house so she knows everything about me.... i didn’t have a chance to tell to those friends at the end  


so why i’m confused? I’m a quite one among friends, not even pretty or talented, young and dumb too.

I’ve been an artist for maybe a year and a half now (professionally at least) I’ve done small digital/graphic design work and sell prints, t shirts and original canvas work. 
Recently my dad has been really getting on me, wanting to give a bunch of my artwork away to family for literally no reason. Which, up until recently I’ve been fine with because I don’t charge relatives, and I sometimes give my artwork as Christmas gifts to MY close friends. But my dad is now trying to force me to give artwork to his friends, and some of his cousins that I haven’t even met and who still don’t know how to properly spell my name. He is also suggesting that I should give people who come over to our house (after the pandemic is over) free artwork as a way of “spreading my art” and “getting my art out there” and shit. But it really annoys me because I put a lot of money into creating my work, and just like anyone else in any other industry I deserve to get paid for my work. My dad keeps trying to imply that I should be doing art because I love it not because of the money. 
But just like anyone else in any other job, since he is literally trying to stop me from getting paid (he has actually told me not to charge people in the past which has kept me from making money before), it’s making me not want to work anymore. I really want to continue to do art, but I’m actually worried that he’s going to stop me from getting paid for it in the future. He’s also told me that I need to be giving people discounts more, like parents and stuff because “they have kids to support”, but I don’t see stores giving discounts to random customers based on their potential customers so I don’t see why I should either. For me personally, if I can’t buy something that I want, I save up for it.

A few years ago I met this guy. I believed I fell in love with him. I also was in a horrible car accident due to him that left me in a hospital, unable to walk for over a month, lost my job, my few friends and well my sense of self. Thinking back, I’ve not felt like myself since I met him. 

I had a horrible drug problem, but unlike the typical addict I was trying to escape my mind not necessarily chase the dragon. I escaped that lifestyle and moved away, got a job where shortly I met him. I shared with him my past because I’m too honest to a fault. I did not realize how deep he was in his own addiction until too late. Yet, I was convinced I was in love with him. (I still battle with that notion today despite it all) 

Long story short, I relied on him for a lot especially after the accident which he admitted he was responsible for. He .. was and is extremely emotionally unavailable. He is a homebody except when looking to score. He can be physically, verbally, emotionally, intellectually and at times spiritually abusive. He has stolen from me, lied about me and talked shit about me. I still convinced myself that things will get better. I had a child with him. I moved in with him when I found out I was pregnant. He only got worse. His family was no help. They were aware of the abuse and would tell me he’s no good but would blame me for his actions and lack of ambition. His mother eventually went the legal route to have me evicted. 

At the time I was working even late into my pregnancy and then about 7 months after my beautiful girl was born. He started stealing my money for his habit. I found a place, a tiny one bedroom apt in a rubbish neighborhood for my  child and I. That’s when I started to notice these weird..patterns. I thought it was related to him. I thought he was doing it to me, him and his family. I know his family resented me. I allowed him to move with us because I was hoping if we got away from his family that maybe we’d stand a chance. Needless to say it got worse. I was the only one paying the bills and trying to maintain the household. 

Eventually I had to get away. I threw out all my appliances and furniture. Only took some clothes and my books. I moved over 150 miles to get away from that evil energy. First it started with intermittent involuntary muscle spasms and twitches. Then the feeling like I was always being followed. Then the feeling (this is where it really gets weird) it appeared there were certain individuals who seemed capable of knowing what was going on in my head. An analogy would be like an online forum that is not exactly public yet numerous individuals had access to and could like wiki was back in the day edit the content. I had to try very hard to keep my mind light. 

At one point I went to a behavioral clinic to get help because it was driving my crazy and they sent me to a psych ward. I know I can’t get help outwardly. I know what it sounds like. It feels like my life and mind has been compromised. Even though I moved it is still happening. There is also the random sounds in the house that appears sentient to my thought process depending on the content. And the forever ringing in my left ear at a random pitch, closely related to something like tinnitus but sentient. 

It seems focused on eating from me? Like making things very difficult and when I become emotionally overwhelmed it feasts. Its most difficult at night. As I write this I can feel it in different parts of my body. I’ve seen other types of doctors and people in the metaphysical. I’ve done a lot of research. I’m trying to purge myself of this entity because I want to be the best for my child. Her father is no actual support and I need to be there for her. If I didn’t have her I wouldn’t focus so hard on getting rid of this and would have checked out ages ago. 

People of the internet, the ones who actually read this and want to help. Please give me advice. This is like my last stop to turn to help. I don’t know what else to do or what I’m dealing with necessarily.",22Nov2020,1
879,"For reference, I’m 17F and she’s also a 17F. We’ve been dating for about 10 months now and still going strong. We both have abusive parents. Mine are emotionally manipulative and gaslight me. Her mother is mentally ill and both emotionally and physically abuses her. Bad. She’s been homeless before, but then, there wasn’t a pandemic so she was able to stay at friend’s houses and shelters. But right now, she just recently got kicked out and  she’s got a horrible cough from the cold and it’s starting to get colder everyday. No one will let her in because they’re scared she has covid. I wish more than anything that she could stay with me, but my parents hate her because she’s gay and they don’t believe either of us when we try to tell them about her abuse. I know you all are all gonna say that we should call cps, but if we do that, they’ll arrest her parents and move her to a foster home. And she’ll move schools since the one we both go to now is a private Catholic one. I’m so lost and worried sick. I’ve only been able to give her some things like a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, food, and clothes. And the clothes don’t even fit her. If I tell my teachers or the cops, she’ll never forgive me for getting her parents in jail, but if I leave her like this, I’m scared something bad will happen to her.

Trying not to right a whole book but from a guys perspective what would make you keep messaging someone who is not returning a message? Should I just be even more blunt and say hey stop messaging me.

881,"Very long / complex but if you get to the end, please drop your thoughts!

I applied for a job over a year ago now. A passion project helping a disabled man with some typing. His disability is purely physical btw. The pay was menial which I was aware of, and this wasn’t my only job.
[One thing I found weird was that he especially hired me based on my heritage... i elaborate below.]

However he soon became very unfocused and prepared in our sessions and tried to rope me into doing some of the actual writing for him (thinking). Please note he’s a very smart man - college educated with a degree and runs his own business. He began to call me to chat in the evenings (not about work, and would basically be me listening to him go on and on and not get a word in) and wanted me to accompany him to extra curricular things, sending invites thick and fast, which my partner wasn’t comfortable with.
I mentioned my partner off the bat to try and combat this but he simply seemed very excited to hear about him and would even ask to speak to him on the phone in our sessions - first boundary transgression in hindsight.

He’s very active on social media and likes to SM network. I noticed some months in that he had gone through my follow list and followed my friends who he’d never met and been interacting with them on stories etc which made me feel uncomfortable. Especially as I’m a black woman and he’s gone specifically for my black friends and friends who live in a popular African country that he wants to visit - He’s a south asian man. He even used some of our sessions to get me to help him make a gofundme to get to my country of heritage - remember he’s not from there, just mildly obsessed... he even captions his posts (which sometimes have nothing to do with the culture in my native language which he doesn’t speak).

He loves to name drop and even accidentally tried to put me on to one of MY friends that he stalk-followed and clearly forgot where he “knew” them from.
He reacts to every single one of my stories, comments all over my stuff and basically pisses on my page.
I felt single white femaled and it basically all got too much when I moved country hoping he would see the natural break and find someone else but he insisted on keeping our weekly calls, despite me being in a new time zone and trying to find my feat and better paying less boundary crossing work!

I quit after about a month of dreading the calls and I could tell it freaked him. His first reaction was to ask/beg me to stay friends with him, probably sensing my withdrawal from months of intense friendly interest from what was originally a work relationship.

He has said multiple times, and I quote, “you’re never getting rid of me” in a jokey way but you can see how I wouldn’t find this funny... Sensing his panic/sadness, I said yes we can still be friends even though I planned to withdraw anyway and he took to going behind my back and speaking to my partner on the phone (my partner is far too polite to decline and he obviously got his number from sneaked SM conversations and not through me) and trying to be friends with a lot of my friends so that I’m effectively trapped! When I was staying with a friend of mine during lockdown, this guy even went as far as to not feel a way requesting they come to the phone for our chats!

I’m in therapy now and have learned that I gave way too much to this guy for a multitude of reasons but mainly a misplaced sense of pity/duty. Ultimately It’s a lot to handle and has resulted in me straight up wanting to drop him - as I do when I get overwhelmed. 
I feel like I’m being used somehow and my instinct is on high alert. Not sure how to proceed as when I try and stay silent, he pops up *telling me* we’re going to talk on the phone in *specified timeframe* and comments all over my SM @ing my friends. Even though I declined the call, he’s sent multiple voicenotes (basically like a one sided call, no?) that I’m yet to listen to.

Ultimately, he thinks we are great friends and is clearly giving off the external view that we are too (on SM) so I feel crazy when I try and tell people it’s all too much and I feel used. I was only just about able to tell my partner about my discomfort and he realised how inappropriate it all is.

No one should be forced into friendship, and I’m not sure how to proceed... any thoughts?",22Nov2020,1
882,"I’ve had such a hard time in high school. I was bullied by everyone to the point of dropping for a year, thus led to me having to take another year to graduate because I’m so behind. I have severe anxiety and depression because of that, on top of ADHD and some other childhood traumas that I won’t talk about here. Basically, I know that I will not do well in university.

I’m also the youngest of 4, and all of my older siblings have gone to university. They always make jokes saying that I’m dumb and try to ridicule me because of my school experience. That just adds to the fact that not only will I not succeed if I don’t go to uni, but my family will also be so disappointed in me and see me as the “failure of the family”. Hell, I see myself as the failure.

I’m in my final year of high school. I’m stressing more everyday, I don’t know what I’m gonna end up doing after this year is over. I don’t even have my drivers license now, there are just so many things I’m stressed and scared about. If I go to university, I have no idea what I’d study. I’m definitely not gonna study something like math or science, I’m much better in the arts (I do love to write and act), but I don’t know if I’d thrive in a uni type environment.

I don’t know what to do. I always tell myself that, in this day and age, you don’t need a degree to really succeed. But I really don’t know.",22Nov2020,1
883,"Hi!


I am a third year resident neurosurgeon from Turkey. And i need to find a way to earn money by othet means (working remotely) VERY FAST.


In Turkey, Neurosurgery training program is 5 years after medical school. We work insane hours, I have 7 36 hour shifts, 3 24 hour shifts and around 12 8 hour shifts. I work around 110 hours weekly. This has been my schedule for the last 3 years and i am kind of accostumed to it now. But i have a new problem that i urgently need to focus on; my father spent 2 months in an ICU, alone due to a covid infection and now has some serious psychiatric problems. 

I really need to spend some time with my father  to improve his mental and physical wrll being, my rough estimation is around 6 months.

So with my current work schedule, i only have time for some sleep, and that is all. So in order for me to look after my father, i will ask for a 6 month leave. But i have no sources of income to get through this 6 months without consuming our savings. 

I need around 1500 usd a month and thought i might sell my knowledge; i am a doctor, 2 years away from a neurosurgery licence and have a modest experience in computer programming (i created a simple AR app for studying neuroanatomy with unity), artificial intelligence (coded my own brain haemorrage CT scan classifier) and have some basic knowledge about software project management. 


I am not a US citizen and i have no medical licence in US, therefore i cannot perform tele-medicine, but where can i find a remote job related to my skills? Any ideas?",22Nov2020,1

This is pretty much how it's been for years, and at first it was refreshing since I didn't have to do anything, but now I'm starting to realize how unhealthy and negative it is and I'm really starting to panic. I really just want to jump back in to high school even though I have no middle school education, and just try to manage, Every one I talk to says I'll hate it, but I'd rather be forced to learn then lay around all day.

888,"I’ve had around 3? Friendgroups that played out almost the exact same. Where in the 1st friendship , had some problems and had to take a break for 2 months, came back and  friendship broke apart. 2nd one was where I had to take a break since account troubles and came back in 3 months and a friend quit, and once I came back everything really just broke apart. The 3rd one  was where I just became disinterested so I wanted to focus on plans only to where my friend unfriended everyone else and it broke apart. 

The thing is is that in all of these friendships, it revolves around me taking a break since account problems (example:hacking), and then when I come back it Isn’t the same.

891,"For reference, I’ve been doing wrestling as a sport for four years now. The first three years were somewhat enjoyable but I’ve grown to dislike it more and more. I spend a very large portion of my afternoon basically dedicated to the practices, with a constant dread of going to them. Sometimes I find the actual meets and wrestling matches fun but there’s still a longing feeling of dread. The idea of having to cut weight, go to the practices every afternoon, then spend an entire day dedicated to actual matches when I’m not even that skilled is exhausting. I think the only reason I push on is because of the very limited times I do enjoy it, it’s really fun (it’s mainly when I’m spending time with the team &amp; winning but the winning part doesn’t happen often), as well as I wish to be stronger and a lot of the other people on my team constantly tell me to stay. Another issue that arises is that I wish to go to college but my family has no savings. I figured replacing wrestling with getting a job and going to the gym would be a good idea but for some reason I don’t. I feel like the people on my team would be disappointed, as well as the fact it would look bad on a resume quitting a sport when it’s just getting going. 

Really hope that some of you have been in a related situation and can tell me what you think would be better given the problem. Thank you.",22Nov2020,1
