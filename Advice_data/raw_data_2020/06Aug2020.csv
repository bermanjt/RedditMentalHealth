0,"So i’ve had this group of friends who were supposedly my closest friends before quarantine, but they haven’t reach out to me at all (just a reminder that our online school was literally no work at all and non of them work) And it made me feel so worthless and i was on the verge of suicide, but some old friends, that don’t even go to my current school, had reached out and we’ve talked/played games together almost everyday since. But one day i was just so angry and just decided to tell them how i felt and tell them i’m cutting them off, i guess it was just an impulse and i’m still currently pushing them away, but they keep saying they will change for me. I just don’t know what to do.",06Aug2020,1
1,"To get to the point and give examples of what I mean , I (16m)  have always felt like I don't get angry enough over things, every time some guy in school tries to anger me and have a fight then I'd remain as cool and calm as a cucumber. Every time my gf of 1.5 years tells me she did something obviously wrong and should make my blood boil then I'd still remain calm and slightly careless. At times I have to fake my anger so that people actually know that they did something wrong. But in every situation for the first minute or 2 I can feel my heart beat getting faster and my breath becomes more shallow and I feel energetic and angry, but after around 2 minutes then all that fades and goes away no matter how big the situation is. All of this happens with most negative emotions not just anger. Why? Is there something wrong with me?",06Aug2020,1
2,"I've (21F) noticed recently that my boyfriend (M20)  and I act somewhat childish together at times. We don't put on baby voices like ""wood you wike waddur"" or call each other babe/baby. However, we often tickle fight and when it comes to getting fast food/ a delivery, I'll just look at him and he smirks and says ""right you want a Chinese then"" and sometimes i act almost childishly keen to get food if Im really hungry or if it's good food. I'll say to my BF ""ah just want my burger"" impatiently and maybe that's a little childish? Also, whenever we see cute animals (we feed the ducks a lot where he lives) we'll say things like ""isn't he the goodest boy?"" and maybe that's childish too?

He enjoys when I'm cheeky/mischievous and maybe that's weird? I asked him to elaborate and he said ""like when you stole my fidget spinner after you called me a dork for having them 3 years after the fad died and then sent me videos of the fidget spinner from your house"". We are also a very cuddly couple, we love spooning each other. Is this weird? I'm scared this makes him a creep or something, like maybe he doesn't see me as a 21 year old woman sometimes ? Is it weird if he enjoys my playful side?",06Aug2020,1

I have contacted Questrade  more than 4 times this week for an issue. I first called at 12.30 pm Monday , I was told waiting time 45mins, but actually I had waited for almost 2 hours. Then an Indian accent guy  answered my phone. After he asked many  security questions, he said he had to transfer me to other person, and I don’t need to wait ,but he transferee me to an answer marching.
Second time I called  mandarin line yesterday after 4:00 pm, after long waiting time, a female attendant answered my phone, I told her my problem, she promised me To solve my problem right way, and I can see the result,but this morning nothing changed .
Today I called 2 times and i even try the on line chat Around 4:00pm, English and manderin line , always be cut off.
As a long time customer I was so shocked by the terrible service ,and totally couldn’t accept it, I demand the service I should get , someone can contact me ASAP.  Frustrated, Any advice will be appreciated.",06Aug2020,1

6,My father grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. We were watching a LA dodgers game recently and a segment came on about Jackie Robinson. He told me he went to a game with his father when he was young and his father bought him a Jackie Robinson pin. He said it would probably be worth a fortune now. I asked him what it looked like and he said it was a picture of Jackie with a red white and blue ribbon underneath it. I ended up finding one similar on e-bay and I got it framed and I want to present it to him. I want advice on what would be the most meaningful way to surprise him with it. Should I have the framed pin just hanging on the wall and have him discover it? Should I gift wrap the frame and give it to him during a game with a note? I lost my mom (his wife of 45 years) last month from dementia - and I just want to give him this gift in a loving way. Would love your advice if you have any creative ideas that I might not be thinking of that would be cool. Thanks in advance.,06Aug2020,1

8,"Hi, i start with saying that i’m 16 years old, I’m 
perfectly aware that all my “problems” could be  caused by hormones and i’m sure that i don’t have any kind of mental illness (also sorry if my english is not that good). When i was a toddler i was pretty damn smart, my grandpa used to teach me about musical stuff (he’s a music teacher) and i have a few VHS where they filmed me, i could say almost every classical musician that lived in the 1800, where he lived, what music he composed and where he died. I started talking when i was like 1 and i was also into science and history a lot. So i was treated like the “smart one” by my family and the people around me used to give me a lot of attentions while i was growing up. I became a person with an avarage iq (nothing special I’m not that brilliant now), that was very extroverted and with a desperate need of attentions by the kids around me. In 4th grade i used to come back home crying if kids in class didn’t notice me. That is where (i suppose) all my attention problems started, because now i unintentionally need to be seen, is not something i have control on. I’m often more extroverted than I’d like to be, ending to be the “annoying one” instead of the “funny one”. I talk about my problems with people way too much, and im tired.  I’m trying to minimize the whole situation, when I’m alone i repeat to myself that I’m creating this whole thing up, that I’m completely fine and I’m unconsciously making this up just to be noticed a little more. Im tired to come back home, hearing this little fucking voice in my head, saying to me how hopeless i am, and how much people dont care about me, and how much my problems aren’t real. Im tired to expose my cringey feelings to other people, even when is an intimate or emotional moment. Im tired of people not taking me seriously anymore. The only thing I’m sure about is that I’m not happy, im not sure if im sad or anxious, but im not happy. And I’d like to hear what you guys think, because I don’t wanna ask my friends about it, i want to resolve this thing up by my own, i dont think i need any help by others. Thanks to everyone who will answer.",06Aug2020,1

Then on Tuesday, which was yesterday in my time zone, I had this overwhelming smell of bleach.  I asked my mother, who lives with me, if she had used any bleach that day, and she hadn’t.

20,"I was raised catholic, went to catholic elementary and high school, and while I always felt unsatisfied and questioned, only in the last 3 years or so have I taken extreme interest in what I actually believe. Raised by a mother whose entire existence is based around a) alcoholic Catholicism, and b) forced unhappiness - and a father whose converted to Catholicism for the sake of marrying my mother, and whose entire existence revolves around trying (and failing) to keep her happy. They're fairly great parents in intent. They truly do their best, and they're good people at heart. On top of that, I have three younger siblings who still live at home, who I love dearly (I moved out almost a year ago, woohoo).   
I want to maintain relationships (healthy ones) with all of them, but the gap keeps increasing as my parents push me further away, and my disgust with the catholic church intensifies. Not the least of my problems is that my partner, who I moved out to live with, is atheist and rather outspoken (gotta love the fiery ones), and is therefore an easy person to both blame and dislike from my parents' perspective. There is SO much more to the picture but this is the skeleton. Please advise, hope you all have a wonderful day!",06Aug2020,1

We both said if I were to get pregnant I'd have to get an abortion but I was like what are the odds? Well after that visit he became distant and busy with work, he owns a successful mechanic shop he get busy and we didn't really talk to much. Well in February I missed my period, took a test and came up positive I texted and was just like ""hey what are you up to"" getting ready to tell him the situation. And he didn't text back for 4 or 5 days. I was hormonal as Hell and insanely scared so I didn't tell him. I was afraid it would cause him too much stress and drama so I just didn't reply when he did text back. Set up my appointment for March and didn't tell a soul and when I went through with it, it was painful and scary and not as ""not a big deal"" as I thought it was gonna be. I went home and I broke down and I was sobbing and I texted him and just laid it on him. I had not even told him I was pregnant. I know now that was wrong. And it was wrong for me to wait til after the fact to throw it on him. He never replied to that message. He has kept me on social media but has never interacted with me. I want to apologize because every piece of the situation has tortured me and I can't move on with my life. Should I text him and clear the air and apologize or just keep quiet?

25,"We’ve had conversations about marriage for a long time and he always says he sees himself marrying me but he wants us both to be more established. We are pretty broke at the moment- we live in a big/ expensive city and have several roommates. 

I always understood where he was coming from, but recently he said he thinks marriage is pointless, but he’ll do it to make me happy. He said that most guys get married so there girlfriends shut up about it. Obviously I know that’s not true. 

He’s a very logical guy. Atheist and very into science. I’m an artist and more emotional. He’s very emotionally supportive when I need someone to talk to, but to be honest, since he’s so logical, I always feel like I’m being rushed to finish my point. I feel like I’m the one who always starts conversations and he doesn’t. And when I do try to converse, I really do feel like it’s a drag for him to listen and talk. It’s weird.

He rights it off whenever I bring it up as “that’s just who I am.” I just feel really fed up by it. It feels like he’s dragging ass to do anything together. 

Part of me is just deeply afraid that I’m focusing on the negative traits too much right now. But sometimes I just feel drained by it, and resentful of him. The whole marriage thing was the icing on the cake. I just feel like it’d be stupid to get married to a man who is basically telling me he’s doing me a favor. Like he doesn’t want to, but since it’ll make me happy, he will.

That mentality is present in most of our dynamic. He doesn’t want to go for a walk, but he’ll reluctantly do it. He doesn’t want to talk, but he’ll reluctantly do it. He doesn’t want to go out with me, usually he won’t, but if he does, he does so reluctantly.

I own a small business and recently after seeing other businesses in my niche posting about bluue lives matter, I did some thinking and decided that I’d rather be poor and stand up for what I truly believe in, than be silent and have a racist’s money in my pockets. So I simply made a post in the Facebook groups (where businesses like mine advertise) asking for design ideas for a new B L M themed item. I did not say anything controversial, all I did was ask for some design ideas and showed pics of my products. 

People are loving it and I’m getting lots of love and great ideas. Then an old ‘friend’ (closer to an acquaintance) texted me and said this: 

“Hey Chick. It’s ——. I love you to pieces but you shouldn’t post that black l1ves matter stuff. Just going to cause political drama. Some will like you. Others will hate you. I’d edit that out.”

I've been working in IT for 20 years and am totally burned out - I really don't care about it anymore and my current job is so stressful that I suspect its actually going to give me a stroke very soon. I can't quit as I have nowhere else to go and I have no savings to get me through or to support my family while I re-train for a different career.

My wife is no help - she refuses to get a job or help out in any way with money. We've had a lot of arguments about this over the years but she's too stubborn and just won't get a job.

Our outgoings have been slightly bigger than my wages for the past few years and we now have thousands of pounds in a credit card that I can't pay off. My job has recently forced everyone to take a pay cut so that has really screwed things up.

My wife is also a bit of a hoarder and my house is full of junk that she won't let me get rid of. She shouts at me when I try.

I also don't like where we live but my wife won't let us move. I keep thinking about divorce but it would affect my kids badly and I can't afford all the lawyer fees and the child support payments would likely leave me worse off in the long run.

32,"Hi. My dad had a collection totaling 15-20k+ vinyl records. He also collected books (but not as many as records). He passed away and being his only child, it's up to me to sort through them, rid of them, or sell them, etc.

I find it easier to go through the books, as I know to look for first or special editions, signatures, rare copies, age, etc, and other symbols of possible value. Those without anything go straight to the donation bin.

With records, I have no idea where to start. He seemed like he collected every genre of music and records from every decade (minus the last two) it seems. I've tried going through stacks and looking up each individual record online, but it takes *forever* and the price varies. It's hard to tell which are potentially valuable and I want to be careful.

I am nervous about using an appraiser because I would think they'd be biased and try to downplay value so I'll sell it to them for cheaper. I am doing this all on my own (single female in mid 20s).

Is there a way to sort through them efficiently the way I do with books?

this is my first post on here and I need some advice ( thank you for bearing with my broken English in advance) 

Okay so I've had this friend for 2 years now from Junior year of high school till we got to the same uni together and finished our first year of University we got to spend alot of time over the years and created a very strong bond we both trusted each other with everything i could finally say i began to find my chosen family

it was all well till second semester of university when ive stumbled upon really toxic friends who ive known from a while back who ended up manipulateing me and using me in every single way possible for money emotionally and physically all of it!! my self esteem crumbled and I've been having a really hard time to process and to cope with whats been happening i knew it wasn't right but things were constantly overwhelming and i couldn't think at all i just acted i ended up distancing myself from all of them and needing time for myself to cope and function till my best friend started to act so mean and demanding of my time she started to always compare our friendship n what i do to what i did to those toxic friends

whenever im on campus she would call me to be present with her even if I was with other good friends of mine, she would discredit how i feel and say that i don't mean it and would force me to do things with/ for her right after. one time it was 8 pm and we were on the taxi on our way home and i was so overwhelmed and over-stimulated i was crying and i was a mess and i kept on saying that i want to go home but she insisted for us to go and look for jobs for her when i said i cant she started crying and she said tgat i domt care about her or about out friendship till we ended up going.

she's so possessive over my time and she knows that I was having a hard time dealing with all that trauma caused by all these new people that were introduced to my life late last year but she keeps on implying that i should deal with it on my own and for it to not be projected on our friendship and our old plans 

we once planned to start a business before all of this happening and we both got distracted and when i was starting to become better i was working on a personal project and it was going so well till i shared it with her and she got upset im busy with other things other than our business plan thing even tho she knows it was the first thing i did for myself in a very long while she keeps on manipulating me by saying that she waited for me so we can do it together and now im busy doing this! and apply this talk to literally everything the other day i went out alone to thrift she said the same thing, and again when i cant go out w her cause i need to go out w my family or even when i got a piercing the other day! 

When I confronted her about how she made me feel all this time and me telling her that I need my time alone her only respond was oh so  you're saying that youre going to ghost me for couple of months now and she keeps on talking about how what I said hurt her feelings I backed off and felt terrible for hurting my friend and after she got defensive and I backed off he sent me this long text saying that she only wants what's best for me and if she was as bad as my old friends I should go and cut her off even though I did not say any of that I only said that I would be closing my phone for a couple of weeks because I can't process and I need a break from the internet 

and to be honest i became a fucking robot i only say nice things and give complements and only listen i stopped journaling about my feelings and paying attention for them i became an absolute people pleaser and those traits what made me look back and realize what was happening all this time and getting to write about this right now really did make a lot of sense ive been ignoring her messages for 2 days now after she blew up on me for getting pierced without her

i don't know what to do now and how can i proceed to cut her off entirely? any advice on how to handle any of this? or how to be alone and have a good time since now i have 0 friends left? thank you so much!",06Aug2020,1

In that moment I just felt this deep sense of contentment. I haven't felt that way in probably over a decade. I want to figure out how can I capture that moment again. What about this day just clicked for me. Please help me capture that moment again. I want to feel that way all the time.",06Aug2020,1

41,"Ok so about 3 years back my boyfriend and I worked at the same place, that’s how we met. He made friends with these two women who disliked me. After he stopped working there They would be nasty to me every chance that got, they thought it was funny to make me uncomfortable. I hate confrontation so I would ignore and avoid them as often as possible. 

I don’t want to be the kind of person who tells my bf who he can and can’t be friends with, all I’ve ever told him about them is that they were bitches to me. He told me if I wanted to know why they didn’t like me, I told him no I couldn’t give two shits why. So time passes, I stopped working there. Earlier my bf and I were having a convo and he said the only friends he still talks to from that job are those two girls, and I got irritated, he knows I got irritated, but I decided just to end the convo, and I’m debating whether I should tell him I got irritated because I hate that he’s still close friends with two people who made working at my job uncomfortable, them and an overly flirtatious manager were part of the reason I ended up leaving that job. Idk if it’s worth bringing up and causing trouble between us.",06Aug2020,1

44,"So I'm in school for massage therapy, I'm about halfway done. Great thing about massage school is all the free massages. 
One of my class mates graduated last month. He gave me a massage and it was amazing so I got his number from another student. He messaged me yesterday saying he had an interview the next day and asked if he could give me a massage to practice. I said heck yeah, and he came over to my house to do it
While he was giving me a massage he said I had a lot of tension in my butt and asked if he could work on it. I said he could. Then he asked if he could pull my underwear down so he could actually help it. I felt a little weird about that, but I said he could because I figured he was a professional and that it was allowed. He did effleurage fully on my butt while he was kneeling so his face was like a few inches away from it. It seemed to help the knot I had so I figured it was ok just different. Then he said not to tell the teacher at school and a red flag went up for me. 
I asked another student and they said that was completely inappropriate because all you're supposed to do for the glutes is to use your fist over clothing/a sheet on the side of the butt, not actually on the middle. He said this student had gotten in trouble for doing that before to another student. I don't think he did it out of anything sexual I think he just doesnt understand boundaries.
I'm just so mad this guy knew what he was doing was wrong and I trusted him to do the right thing and he didn't. I don't know what to do because I don't want to ruin his life/ career over this, but I also don't want it to turn into something he does to others and have it get worse. Should I tell the teacher or just confront him about it?",06Aug2020,1
45,"TMI ahead. Well! Here comes the oversharing! Hi, I am a 20 year-old woman and I had my first sexual experience with a guy November last year. I went to his dorm room after talking for a while and we had a great meeting at a Uni party. He was extremely nice and worried about pleasing me and I don't hold virginity to such a standard. But before coming there I had a lot of anxiety about taking the wrong route and my parents called me so it really brought my mood down. We were supposed to game too but apparently that all went down the drain because my clothes were off so fast I didn't even have time to be insecure of my body (LMAO). Turns out I wasn't as attracted to him as I was when I was drunk and even after he tried to give me (bad) oral multiple times I was as dry as the desert. And I was like: 'Well, he is trying his best so I must be the problem' and from that moment it's gotten exponentially worse.

Then like a month ago this other guy who I went to highschool with tells me happy birthday and somehow we start talking and I'm like well I am not about to let this pass because I had crushed on him in the past and he is an amazing person. And unfortunately he knows me as the outspoken, confident class clown who jokes around about masturbation habits with her friends so I must be some sex guru. Yes, I am Jess from Until Dawn in all her glory. Thing is, after I realised I'm only confident in things I have control over and I can't control my inexperience. Back to the conversation, he's one of those meme guys and I tell him, Lord Behold, in a joking manner that I think he is really cute and I'd smash. Apparently he's down and he's coming over and I never expected it. We have a great time when he does but he was so platonic I thought he's not interested at all actually since I also have insecurities that guys will only see me as the bro girl. He apparently gets to action and God I have never been more anxious. 

There is a guy on me that I would date in a heartbeat and all I'm thinking is maybe he's doing all this because he just wants to do me a favor or something. I do ask him several times if he's sure he wants this and he tells me he wouldn't have been here if he didn't want to and I don't believe it. I get crazy into my head. I'm so genuinely scared that I am doing things wrong so much that I freeze. He wants to go down on me it's too soon and I'm not wet enough and from last time I'm like 'well, I am the problem' so I don't let him because what if I can't get wet again and he'll just waste his time on me. We did stuff in his car and it was late and at one point he said to take me home and I kid you not by that time my anxiety got so bad I legit asked him if he hates me. He talks to me from time to time but after those insecure girl diaries I don't think anyone ever would honestly and I don't blame them. The thing is, I want to have sex. I am not experiencing any social pressure. I want to be intimate. I don't care if I'm dating or not as long as the person makes me feel safe. I just get crazy in my head about doing the wrong thing and it genuinely feels like I'm never going to escape. The fact that I don't have experience makes it 900% worse so I did buy a toy to kind of ease me into things because I'd die at the thought of like... burdening people to do it. Is there anything I can do by myself to get better at this since my eastern parents don't have the funds and don't believe in therapy anyways? Thanks for reading!",06Aug2020,1

The teacher was calling out names so she simply wanted to know if he was here or not, so she wanted him to raise his hand if he was present, but my brain didn't process that until AFTER everyone started laughing.

About two years ago me and the wife had a huge fight about it and she stopped coming around for like a month, and then started coming back around every week again. I finally resided to the fact that this woman is going to be intruding in our lives and to make marriage work I stopped fighting with my wife about it.

About two months ago I even heard my wife tell someone in the phone that ""we havent fought about it in awhile, I think he finally accepted that this our life""

I knew exactly what she meant because it is the only thing we have ever fought about. Ever.

Flash forward to my wifes aunt, my mil's sister, who got out of prison and moved here, suddenly start coming over whenever my mil does. Now not only does my mil come over, which I feel is way too damn often, my mil's sister is over here too. They come every monday like clockwork. They stay until Thursday or Friday every week. 

I feel like I am about to lose my sanity. I hate it, I'm stuck in the bedroom because I'm not comfortable in my own house. Every time I brought it up to my wife she gets insanely defensive and then I end up dropping it. But I hate it. I hate feeling this way. I hate feeling like every day of my life I have these free loaders in the house I pay for.

I hate my wifes aunt. My mil I have somewhat of a cordial relationship with now, but I hate her aunt. I'll be honest if it was still just the mil I wouldnt care, I really have grown to accept that she was going to be at our house this much, but I hate her aunt. I dont give a shit that she doesnt have anywhere else to go either, to me she is the one who has spent thales last 55ish years being a fuckup, it isnt my job to provide her a place to stay when my mil is here.

55,"Okay to start it off i have 3 siblings, two are 2 years old and one is 10. At the beginning of the pandemic my parents and I had an agreement that I would mostly take care of my siblings, as both my parents work long hours, and me and my oldest sibling would split the majority of the chores in the house. I was okay with this because it would only be three months and I would be leaving for my freshman year of college, but the virus only got worse so now I'm doing online school. 

My parents and I hadn't talked about the kids or house work until my mom told me she and my dad decided that my siblings would not be going to school and they were happy I was there to watch the kids. I was shocked and didn't really say anything at the time, but I can't decide if I'm being unreasonable for not wanting to continue watching 3 kids + housework + college work. 

I'm not saying I shouldn't ever help out, but I do not think it is fair to expect me to balance 14 credit hours with all of my previous responsibilities. At the same time I think I am being unreasonable because my parents are helping me pay for college and I just need to suck it up.

now this is really killing me because i’m in a much much better place (thank goodness). however, i’m extremely isolated now. 
of course i’m not saying i want to go hang out with a ton of people and party, but everyone seems to have their little group of quarantine friends that they see everyday. and meanwhile i’m only seeing one friend every two weeks because of her strict stepmom.

i know it sounds like such a first world problem but it’s almost pushing my mental health back down the drain to be so so alone.

57,"I'm on a bad streak. And today I feel really depressed and frustrated. What should I do?

My mother and I used to argue a lot. Even if we love each other, our lifestyles and visions in life are different. 2 days ago, we were arguing and she said I am manipulative, arrogant, and hypocritical. I felt so bad about this all day.  
I tried to talk to her and apologize, but I couldn't. She didn't even want to see me.  
But, the next day I got the opportunity to have a conversation with her, we both apologized and promised each other that we will be better. Now we are in very good terms.

Then, yesterday, I got fired from my job (My first job). My ex-boss asked me why I was having so many problems with my time management recently. I told him I was doing some freelance work to get extra money.  
He got really mad at me. Called me an unethical person (Because I should not work with other people while I am in his company), a liar (Because I didn't tell him that I got more work. And I didn't do it because I thought he would get angry) and said that, in a certain way, I stole their money (Because he was paying me to have all my focus on the company and I started spending time in other things).

I told these things to my girlfriend. However, since some time ago she has been very cold and distant. Now she is just using short answers, doesn't give affection anymore and I feel like she does not want to be with me. I asked her if she was mad at me, but said no. I also asked her if she was okay and said yes.  
She said that my ex-boss was right (And yes, he was, I agree), then said ""Man, I don't know what to say to you"" and went to sleep. I told her that I really need her because I feel very bad but said: ""Okey, in the morning"". And this is okay, probably she was really tired, However, I don't know, I feel bad about the way she answers.  
Probably she doesn't love me anymore but feels like she already invested too much in our relationship. When I talk to her about this she usually says that she loves me. I'm so confused. On one hand, when I ask she says that she loves me, but then gives me very cold answers and doesn't want to talk.

Today I got the conclusion that I am not as good as I thought. If my environment thinks these things about me, then it might be true. If my girlfriend is so cold and distant, probably I did something bad (But I really don't know what) or she changed the way she sees me but doesn't want to tell me.

I swear to God I tried to be nice.  
I never screamed, I never used insults, I never criticized anyone in their face (And when I did, I always kept it private, just in my thoughts), I always tried to be proactive in my relationships, starting the conversations, giving affection, and trying (trying) to be supportive. I swear I always tried to treat everyone with respect.  
But I can't find peace in my soul.

Why is the person who I love the most so cold? Why does my environment think these things about me?

I am in a bad streak.  
I started doubting myself for the first time.  
I thought I had good moral values. But seems like I was lying to myself.

Usually I would think of that as nothing, but he randomly texted me in March with a  picture of a note I wrote him in November. He said how he believed we were going to have a life time friendship and he loved how we met and stuff.

61,"So, about 5 to 6 years ago I met this girl online - let's call her Hilda. We spoke for years, shared everything, visited each other, met each others friends. I spoke to her when I was going through a rough part in my life and she supported me, I supported her when she was going to uni etc. We grew super close.

Eventually I developed feelings for her which caused some friction, she didn't know how she felt etc. We stopped talking, and for the first time in my life I was heartbroken. This pattern repeated a few times. She always came back to find me, and I always agreed to talk again. At some point I realised I loved her more than anything, and any moment spent speaking to her I began to cherish.  

I tried to hide how I felt for a long time, I tried to be her friend but even after I got a gf and dated several girls I still didn't love them as much as I loved Hilda.  Eventually our relationship got complicated again, it gradually became sexual and I was the first guy she slept with. She instigated but I should of known better then to give in to my desires. Despite this we never entered into a relationship due to distance, despite me wanting to. I knew it was a massive mistake and I still regret it, shortly after that she started seeing a guy and despite trying my best to support her I fell into a bit of a depression. 

So I broke our friendship off. I knew that as hard as I I tried I would slowly become bitter and anxious and cause us to argue again so I told her I was depressed and needed to leave all social media but that it would be okay. Jerk move I know. But I decided the pain wasnt worth it, I evidently wanted more and it wasnt fair on her. 

It's been 2 years since that day and I still know I love her. I don't think about her day to day but when I see something that reminds me of her I feel it again. When I date new girls they never (as awful as this sounds) feel the same way to me as she did. Often feeling like pale imitations (which I feel bad for admitting). Sometimes I dream about her, and not a week goes by when I don't wonder how she is doing. 

A month ago I recieved an email from her out of the blue. She has a long term boyfriend now and part of me is happy for her, but another part of me knows I wouldn't feel comfortable seeing pics of them together. I apologised for disappearing and we talked back and forth for a bit. I knew I couldn't be her friend again no matter how much she hinted that she wanted to talk again, and I eventually made an excuse to end the emails on a friendly note. 

Shortly after this I realised I had no real desire to meet other girls. I have felt this way for over a year. I no longer feel pre first date nerves and even when physically and emotionally interested I feel very apathetic towards dating. My sex life has also suffered, I just can't be bothered with sex anymore. It doesnt feel special, and lately I've been feeling a depression about the whole situation. I should care, it meant a lot to me 2 plus years ago. I used to worry about getting older and not getting married etc. Now I don't care at all and I know its because I'm still not over this one girl. 

So my question is, how do I move on and get over her? It's almost subconscious in how I still have feelings..",06Aug2020,1
62,"this is a burner account and I want to remain anonymous so I apologize before and for my vague language.

Ever since I was a kid I wanted to join the military. During my freshman year in HS, I was a bit of a failure. After some self-reflection and going through some hard times I started to take more control over my life so that can get my dream job of becoming a commissioned officer in the USAF. I used that goal as motivation to get better grades, to exercise, and to improve my overall attitude. 

During my senior year, I applied to a couple of Senior Military Colleges and got accepted into one. And I started my applications for a couple ROTC scholarships. But, when I was time to submit my ROTC applications with parental consent(since at the time I was under 18) and accept my spot in the Senior Military College I got accepted into my parents refused to support either of those decisions. And, as a result, I'm now forced to be attending a regular college. 

Obviously I'm not happy with this and ever since this has happened I've gotten depressed and have a good amount of pent up rage. I feel as if I've been cheated out of my dream college and carrier that I've spent the last 4 yrs of my life trying to pursue and I was denied this not because I didn't meet the criteria or wasn't good enough for the job but because of my parents' decision for the life, they want 4 me.  what I should do now?",06Aug2020,1

Of course, I didn't frame the situation as assault, but I did say, ""this guy kept trying to kiss me snd when I said no he shoved his tongue down my throat. I felt uncomfortable and he wouldn't stop."" I feel that I explained it in a way that showed I wasn't into it. However, he broke up with me for ""cheating"" on him. Even though I was only 15, I really liked him and I think our relationship was pretty serious for our age honestly. 

The problem is that for YEARS I had believed that the break up was my fault, but now I have all these questions.

I've known my friend for a few years while I've only known his girlfriend since maybe February, because of the COVID stuff and with lockdown in New Zealand, I had only met her in person twice and in person, she's a pretty calm and generally courteous person. Our general communication is over discord while my friend and a few of our other friends are online as well (I try not to talk to her alone because I don't feel the need to), She only started playing Dota at the beginning of the year because she wanted to join in on the games with her boyfriend, she is still learning.

Overall our time talking is while our group is playing video games so sometimes things can get heated in-game, that isn't really a problem, it is usually when I try to ask her to do something in the game and she asks why or flat out refuses ( I don't have a problem with it because she doesn't have to listen to me, I'm not her boyfriend) so I explain why she should give it a try and she starts losing her mind. I try to ask her to calm down/relax (probably not the best decision on my part) and I say I'll stop but she begins yelling and trying to drown my voice out.

The specific moment was last night, we were playing a few games of Dota 2 at her request because her boyfriend, one of our friends and I had been playing Escape from Tarkov for most of the afternoon. During the last game of the night, she wasn't having a good game so I let her know that she doesn't have to buy all of the support items and that I can buy them as well. She says no, I tell her she's not the only support and she starts getting mad. My thought process was that I was watching her lane, I knew because she had died a few times that she'd be on the poorer side so I wanted to lessen the burden. If anyone has played Dota recently or at any point then you'd probably know the feeling, dirt poor and dead for most of the early game. I wanted to help. Maybe I came off a bit different than what I thought but I feel as though saying ""I just wanted to buy the support items"" so she wouldn't have too would feel like heaven for the other support, instead she starts losing her mind trying to drown my voice out and telling me to pay attention to my own hero and play my own game. I said fine and disconnected from the discord because I didn't want to deal with the attitude and continued to play the game. We lost and I ended that session for the night.

This or very similar things happened 3 times in the last few months and although I normally brush it off because I've been playing video games for a very long time and akin to toxic behavior, it doesn't bother me much, but now my friend is saying that I shouldn't be on when they are both on and it's pretty disheartening not going to lie.

I don't want my friendship ruined by something like this and I've already apologized even though I don't feel like I'm at fault but he told me to leave the discord.  

Is there any advice anyone can give?

Or similarly, could I have handled it differently/am I an asshole?",06Aug2020,1
68,"I’m a 22 year old guy and i feel like I don’t know anything anymore. I lost my job a few month ago because of budget cuts and have only gotten rejected since so i had to move back in with my parents. I’m trying to apply to medical school and it has been my life long goal and it’s been the only thing I’ve ever even considered doing. However now the more i think about it, I really don’t wanna do it. Even with good university grades and high entrance exam scores i feel dumb all the time, and i feel like I’m completely missing basic common sense and have had increasingly shortening attention span for the last 2 years (to the point that i often have to ask someone what they said 2-3 times before I finally hear it). When i talk to my friends/classmates that also want to go into med i realize how significantly dumber i am compared to them and realize I’ll never make it in a field that i no longer have passion for. In fact I really don’t know what i want anymore. I spend my morning and afternoon volunteering online and spend my evenings writing essays and application stuff and every day feels so unfulfilling and exhausting. I’ve lost interest in everything i liked before. I haven’t talked to my friends or parents or other humans in weeks. I’ve completely given up exercise (i used to love playing tennis but I can’t stand it anymore). I can’t even play video games or play guitar for more than 10 minutes before becoming bored/exhausted so i spend my free time and late nights just browsing reddit without really reading posts but rather just scrolling aimlessly until 5am then waking up at 8am and repeating the same day over again. I’ve tried sleeping pills and they don’t do anything for me, and after closing my eyes for 3 hours in bed I eventually give up and go back on reddit until I naturally fall asleep from exhaustion. The only thing i like doing is cooking but i suck at that too. I don’t know what to do anymore. The only advice I’ve gotten is to stop being a baby but I don’t know if I’m just being a baby or I’m just a pointless person in general or if this is all gonna go away after a while.",06Aug2020,1

70,"(So this happened before the whole pandemic just to be clear)

So my friend has never seen Star Wars, so we thought that it would be cool to binge watch all the movies. I came over to her house the next day and she brings a friend the next day who is flirting heavily. She started to feel me which made me uncomfortable because I just met her. Ever since then I’ve been having panic attacks and my friend has been supporting me. She told me that what her friend did was wrong and that she’d stick by me. Later on, she starts texting me but sounds really strange, which I then find out the girl had her phone and tried getting info. My friend used the excuse saying she “left her phone open”. I was very angry but thinking about it recently, I feel really attracted to that girl, but I’m still confused on why? Any suggestions on what I should do?",06Aug2020,1

73,"Hi!!  So I made a post in r/TooAfraidToAsk
and everyone said that it wasn’t weird that I am about a year and a half younger than my partner, but I’m not exactly sure how to tell them.  We met online and I never said my age.  I don’t think its a big deal but I’m horrified about them leaving me.  I love them so much, and since there will be a 6 month period where I’m 16 and they’re 18 i’m not sure how they’ll react, which is why i’m scared.  We want to meet in person when we’re no longer minors, and I know I can tell them that I want to wait until summer to meet them, but even then I’ll only be 17 and they’ll be 18.  Obviously I can’t just not tell them, that would be super wrong, so how can I tell them and not make it seem like a big thing?  Thanks in advanced :)",06Aug2020,1

75,"I’m self employed, I work remotely and my job is a mixture of creative and analytic. 

I originally got into this type of work because I thought I’d be working within teams collaboratively and be able to bounce around ideas. I’m genuinely a people person. In my current roles I don’t get to talk to colleagues often, few times a day over messages and once a week there’s a work call. 

I also feel like I need guidance in my work but I work in my area essentially alone. I have a mentor outside of work but I feel like I can’t talk to them or know what to ask. 

Once covid is ‘over’ I’ll still be remotely working. 

I’m going crazy with dread and anxiety. Is this work not right for me? I already switched careers once. Is it that these companies aren’t a right fit? 

Is it the remote working? Do I stay even though my performance is dying under the circumstances? Do I leave? Is it okay to be open about not liking my jobs? Will I ever like any job?

76,"Well, here goes. I've had this all bundled up inside of me for at least 8 years but it's time to see if I can get some advice on it all. There'll be a lot of info in this so please read all the way through to understand my situation as best as you can if you're interested.

I'm a 20 year old straight male who prides himself in his masculine features. I have a very masculine body shape with broad shoulders, a good metabolism for gaining muscle, and great natural pecs. And the thing is, I love that about me. I love all those features. I love my genitals. I love everything about being a male. Being one of the boys, going to the gym, talking about chicks. Everything. BUT at the same I absolutely wish I was the opposite sex.

For as long as I can remember, which I think was 8 years ago when I was 12, I have had a fascination with girl's clothes. I never had a cross-dressing experience, I never saw any guys in person acting feminine, and I was never been exposed to that sort of thing as a kid in general, I just remember that at some point I became extremely interested in female-wear. It started with dresses, and I mean the girliest and prettiest of dresses. Short ones that fan out at the skirt, long gorgeous formal gowns, tight form-fitting outfits. It all intrigued me, and I always wished I could wear them, so I did exactly that. I secretly tried some of my mum's dresses on and although they were too large and looked terrible on me, the feeling of the fabric against my body and legs was just amazing. I did stop this after a period of time though as I was always afraid I'd get caught by my parents coming home early.

Now this might sound all well and great, but here's the catch: the feeling and just general thought of wearing female clothes and being a girl *aroses* me. I would say sexually but I've never been interested in sex. The only thing that's brought me pleasure is the thought of being a girl. As soon as I discovered this, I exploited that feeling in the worst way possible. I began reading stories of cross-dressing fantasies which has now made its way to forced-feminization stories and videos. The thought of being completely dominated by a female and being forced to wear a cute dress, underwear, heels, make-up, the whole shebang is just one of my biggest fantasies with all of this now. Even just dressing as a female under my own will is still just as great of a thought. The worst part about all of this though, and this way sound gross, but it's the only content/thoughts that I've ever masturbated too. This admiration and interest in wearing female clothes has evolved into a sexual fantasy for me that I'm too far stuck into to get out of. It's the only thing I've ever got off to, the only thing I've found sexual pleasure from, and *this* is the part about my dilemma that I hate. I don't want to think this way, but I do. I would do anything to just be a normal dude who only thinks about normal guy things, but I've buried myself deep into this monstrosity of a mindset with no way of getting out.

Eventually after I read more and more and fantasized more and more about all this, I began being interested and I guess aroused by the rest of a female's outfit; hair, make-up, nails, shoes, and other accessories. I've always had slightly longer hair than most guys but for the last few years I've grown it out to half way down by back. Because of my long hair, there have been numerous occassions where my close female friends have asked if they can braid my hair and I can tell you that every time they do, I feel on top of the damn world. It boosts my confident having my hair braided. I feel beautiful, I feel like me. It's amazing. I love it. Similarly, some of my female friends have asked to give me a makeover before and make me look all fabulous, purely as a complete coincidence in relation to my fantasies as they have no clue about them. Of course I have said yes and while I was nervous the first time they did this, I LOVED it. It felt a bit strange but deep down it was a great experience. Because of this, I actually opened up to the friends that did my make-up and told them that I am interested in make-up (but nothing else feminine because I'm not ready to open up about everything here) and they were fully accepting, which was great. They've said they're happy to make me over more often and that has made me super happy. The only downside is that my parents are fairly old fashioned and wouldn't really approve. They're a bit sceptical about this sorta stuff, and I know I shouldn't care what they think but when they've brought you up knowing you as a manly son, it'd be hard for them to understand why I'd be interested in female stuff.

Anyways, all of this leads me to where I am now. I'm 20, loving life as a guy, but I equally wish I was a chick. I have no idea where to go from here, how to approach all this moving forward now that I've put it out in the open, and just how to feel. I *wish* I could live my life as a female, I *wish* my fantasies could come to life, but I guess that's just why they're called fantasies. At the same time, I don't wanna leave my masculine guy life. I live with my family so I can't order my own clothes and try see what it feels like to be completely made over as a women either. It's tough.

There is one other thing I should add though, and that is my attraction for females. I don't have a girlfriend, and I know for a fact that I don't like men, but every time I see a good looking girl with a good body, I don't really immediately feel attraction. I feel jealousy, as if I wish I could be her. When I see a chick wearing a cute/hot/fab outfit, I focus on that and envy her. The only way I actually feel attraction to a girl is when I actually get to know them and their personality, but even then I feel like I'm just attracted to them like how a straight girl would be; to be friends. I don't really know how to describe this but basically I don't see a chick and instantly think sexually or romantically. I just admire them. As a result, I've never been interested in sex and I have never watched porn, so I honestly don't know what my mentality is with all that. I guess that's something I'll discover down the line. I do still want to get married and have kids though, but all of this is holding me back from thinking that far ahead as I still need to figure out, just... everything.

That's basically all there is to this though. If anyone else feels exactly the same way then I'd love to know because I feel pretty alone with all this and as much as I trust my family and close friends to not judge me, this might be too much of a bombshell to drop on them so I'm happy to talk in the replies to people about this all. I'd just be happy with any tips moving forward in general though. Thank you in advance for any comments I receive! &lt;3

TL;DR: I've wanted to be female and I've had a fascination for dresses and everything girly for as long as I can remember but I've developed sexual fantasies from them that's kinda confused my sexual life and life in general. I equally wanna be a guy just as much though. I'm just super confused and venting here!",06Aug2020,1

I feel really bad because he had to go out of his way to help me out and he's helped alottttTT. Couldn't have done any of it without him. I'm so appreciative and I feel like saying thank you is not enough.

I was thinking of getting him like a gift card to thank him? Idk I feel like I have to repay him somehow he's teaching me so much and helping out a ton and saying thank you honestly isn't enough. Is getting a coworker a gift card more burdensome than it is nice? Its not like I can ever do the same for him bcs he's more experienced and has a different type of job so nothing I do would be of use to him lmfao but I just appreciate his help so much 😭

She has always been a bit chubby &amp; not fitting in at school. Now I discover that she has picked up an obsession with CUTTING HER SKIN for attention. Not enough proof, but she has always been more masculine. 

She has picked up an obsession for exercise to get muscular as well. Not very feminine. She has painted her nails black (???) and I am debating just to ask her where she is trying to go with this. I am going to ask her if she is trying to play transgender.

85,"Hello, all, I’m extremely new to Reddit. I’ve been seeing a lot of cool Reddit posts/fun questions and thought about making an account before, but I never really got around to it. Anyway, that’s my little tangent over.

So I am 65 years old. My wife, who I will refer to as Jane, is 40 and is now 5 months pregnant. I honestly have a lot of mixed feelings about this, considering our ages. 

I’m still working full time and have no intention of retiring, ever. I’m also pretty healthy considering my age. But the fact still remains that I’d be very lucky to live just another 30 years. And 30 seems pretty young to lose your dad, in my opinion. 

I’m not so much concerned about Jane, she could have another 50+ years to love our kid. Although purely from a biological standpoint, she is 40 years old and that makes me a little concerned for the baby. Especially considering. She wasn’t aware for the first 5 months and thus hasn’t been taking many precautions. She’s never been a heavy drinker, but up till now she’s usually had a glass of wine with dinner, and very occasionally smoked. (Maybe once every two weeks)

I’m also very concerned how the rest of my family is going to take this news. My daughter from my first marriage has never really liked my wife, because her and Jane are the same age. She’s also been an only child all her life and I don’t know how she’s going to feel about getting a new sibling at 40 years old.

We’re not going to abort the baby, and very much want to keep it. But I’m starting to feel extremely overwhelmed by this situation.",06Aug2020,1

88,"TLDR: 
I know this is a super long read but I feel like the whole back story is important. 
My mom is severely depressed &amp; we suspect she has borderline personality disorder. She is only getting worse &amp; no matter what we do she refuses to get professional help. I’m at a loss and just want my mom to take care of herself, this has been going on for years. 

My mom is an amazing person &amp; genuinely my best friend. She’s struggled with herself and her mental health for as long as I remember though, and it’s gotten very severe over the years. The last few months have been really consistently bad and she refuses to get professional help. 
I first remember noticing it when I was 11 or 12 years old. I was struggling a lot at the time too, anxiety and depression first started effecting me when I went into middle school. I really was a troubled child and put a lot of stress on my parents, but my struggles unfortunately made my relationship with my parents hard to say the least instead of building trust. (This is relevant, I promise.)

I started self harming around the same time, If I remember correctly my Mom found out by reading my journal. 
She came up to my bedroom with her wrists slit in many spots and looked at me and said, “Do you still cut yourself?” She was obviously not in her right mind and she was very scared. 
Over the years, I remember bits and pieces of her hitting/harming herself. Another distinct memory would be of her coming up to my bedroom in the middle of the night telling me that she took a bunch of pills. She was freaking out and regretful, I called position control and she was okay. I was probably 14 or 15 at this time. 
I remember many times coming home to her passed out on the stairs, I thought she was dead. I don’t know if she was drunk or what happened. Or I would find her lying between the wall and the bed in the guest bedroom. 
I’ve noticed she completely switches between people almost. When I think of my mom, I think of someone who is outgoing and happy and level headed. She loves to clean (yes, actually,) and take care of her family and do things for fun. Then she goes through these cycles, where she will be somewhat reckless and childish. Drinking a lot, goofy, just acts different. Hard to explain. Then sometimes she snaps out of it, other times she progresses to being very depressed. She won’t get out of bed for days, she sobs at everything. She will take everything personally, like if she’s babysitting my baby niece &amp; the baby cries, she cries. I think she feels guilty. She’s very influenced by everything around her and kind of delusional. For example, my SIL and I were talking about her wanting a new job. My mom interpreted that is “(my SIL) is quitting her job because she doesn’t trust me baby sitting and now I’m fired from babysitting.” (Mom babysits my niece full time.) I could go on forever with examples like this. 

She will pretend like everything is fine though, she will tell me nothing is wrong while she is crying. I’ve sat and tried kindly and rationally talking to her for hours, she usually won’t budge. And when she does, it’s about situational things (like my Dad or brothers,) and not the bigger picture of what’s going on with her if that makes sense. Those things undoubtedly do make her sad, but there’s more to what’s going on in her head than that. 
These mods swings don’t have much of a pattern, my therapist suggests borderline personality disorder by what I’ve told her. But we will never know until she gets help. 
These cycles used to only happen once or twice a month, now it’s rare to see her be herself over the last few months. I didn’t notice these cycles happening until I was about 14-15. Before that it was just her being very sad. 
Also remember lots of dieting pills and calling herself fat. I could go on about examples. 

My father during all of this has done what he can do to help, but he understandably (but not rightfully) gets very frustrated. He does so much for us and he hurts seeing her like this, he really does his all to support her and take care of her. But she doesn’t cooperate, depending on which mood she’s in. She pushes him away and says hurtful, untrue things. But I think when she gets delusional she can’t help it. I think she feels and thinks that everyone is out to hurt her. She also contradicts herself all of the time. For example, he does all that he can so she can stay at home and not work because she didn’t want to work anymore. (He was her boss.) And now she says he fired her. I remember for years she wanted to quit work and was so excited when she finally could quit to babysit. 
She digs at him, and blames him for her struggles. He has some sort of anger issues &amp; this has also been an ongoing issue for as long as I remember. It’s hard for him to understand that she is mentally ill and not just being an asshole for no reason. 

When I first noticed her reckless behavior, this comes out during her more childish stages, she would drink &amp; smoke with me as a teen, often. (15-16) 
then when she was feeling normal again, she would get angry at herself for condoning me and I wasn’t aloud to smoke/drink. She isn’t this reckless anymore. More so reckless with what she says instead of what she does. 

This really is just the tip of the iceberg, this has been so hard and confusing for me. When I needed my parents the most as a depressed, anxious teenager going through psychosis and trauma from a rapist/controlling/mentally/sexually abusive boyfriend, I was taking care of their struggles and putting my own to the side. My dad still doesn’t acknowledge what I’ve been through. 
It would break their hearts if they ever heard me say that. They did what they thought was best when my struggles first came about. Just to be clear, they would do anything for me in a heartbeat and have never failed to provide more than enough for me. I was spoiled as a baby and still am today. I’m thankful for my parents but I know that doesn’t make what I went though okay. This is about helping my Mom, I go to therapy and know how to handle my problems now. 

Recently my mom has been pretty stuck in either her childish or very depressed stages. It’s been rare to see her be herself recently. But no matter how my Dad or i approach her or what we offer, she refuses to get help. She says she doesn’t want to talk to a stranger about her problems. I offer to go with her, to find someone for her. I’m so patient and understand and careful about how I word myself. I tell her it’s ok to struggle, ect ect. I’ve been so fragile like that, I know to be cautious. But she just refuses. 

I just want her to get better, and my Dad too. This isn’t fair to either of them and their marriage is suffering so bad because of it. It breaks my heart. I know it’s easier said than done, but fuck it has to be done. 
I can no longer be the mediator and take care of her and their problems. But it’s hard not to. I just want them to be happy. I’m terrified of them dying before things change. They’re not that old yet lol so we have time at least. 
I have a pretty good idea of what she has going on, and why she does what she does. I just need advice on how to get her to help herself. I know I can’t fix it and as hard as it is, it’s out of my control at the end of the day. Everything is appreciated though. Thank you.",06Aug2020,1

1. It;s for a full time job. 4 out of the 6 people can only be chosen and I'm the 6th one. This project is a 3 day thing, so tomorrow will be the second day.
2. I joined in and they wanted us to face cam and video chat and I couldn't even do that. I just don't want people to see me and whenever I did speak, some of the members, I could tell, were holding back laughter.

Whenever I speak during my anxiety attacks, I tend to go really fast, shaky and I can't hide it. The company wants people that participate in group work and is out spoken since the job is mainly for technical consulting. The second major thing that anxiety does for me is cause brain fog, all I can do at that point is listen and watch, because I can't formulate a sentence or an idea pertaining to the group work. I don't even think putting my self out there is scary. The thing about me is that if I feel forced or pushed into something, then I'll most likely underperform or screw something up. I know I can leave whenever I want but it's unfair to my team members if I just dropped and left. That doesn't mean that they aren't about a billion years smarter than me and seemed just fine without my input, but it's just a terrible habit to start doing now that I'm two semesters away from graduating and it's poor taste in character. I'll have to wake up knowing that I flaked and ruined my reputation with other people who could help me in the future.

3) The second biggest fuck up was that I just shut off my computer and told the manager that I'm having technical issues because it's miles better than telling them that I have generalized anxiety disorder, no one wants to hire a liability. Though I know first impressions tend to stick, so I'm at a crossroads of whether I should keep going and show progress or not show up tomorrow. I don't even know where I'm going to begin with this project. If I decide to attend the meetings tomorrow, I want to be the complete opposite of what I am right now but that is a complete 180 that I know won't be able to change so quickly.

On the bright side, I rescheduled an IT internship interview with an aerospace company, since I know this other internship is out of my reach and my progress was very slow.",06Aug2020,1
90,"I'm gonna put the TL;DR first and say my specific question is: a long time friend is clearly having a break with reality and it's reached a point that I need to either intervene with them or ask their family to intervene. I don't know how to approach either of these things. Do I talk to the friend first? What would I say to the family?

Some details - I'm going to keep it minimal cause I know they use reddit. This person used to be my best friend. They've always been a little difficult/weird, but in the last year they've burned a lot of bridges and drove people away - myself included. I'll always be friendly but I've backed off from everyday interaction. 

In the spring they started becoming increasingly weird, smoking too much weed. Over the summer though, it's escalated to all the classic signs of a mental break - mania, egomania, paranoia, and posting bizarre stuff online. They were calling me and talking about it for hours at a time, and I was going along to keep an eye on it and cause I know I'm the only person left they haven't burned bridges with.

But then other friends of ours started reaching out to me. Since I'm known as the best friend, they've confided their concern and some of the same crazy shit they've been on the receiving end of. 

I'd really just like to write this person off, but I care about them and we were friends once and it's weighing on me. I don't know how to confront them, because part of the delusion is that people are targeting them and harassing them and they've unlocked the secrets of the universe and no one else understands. Also, as I said, this person is a naturally weird artist type, and when pressed they say ""it's for my next project you wouldn't understand""

 I at least want to know they're still on their meds and seeing their therapist. At most I would reach out to their family, who know me, and ask them to check in. I'm concerned for their safety and in a way I want to address it so I can move on from it. Personally, I don't have a strong support system in my life either and this is taking a lot of my mental energy and I have no one to talk to cause this friend has alienated everyone else. I can't believe I've not only lost my friend but I also now have to deal with this. I just want to call my parents for advice but they're crazy too and we don't speak so here I am.

Sorry this is so long. Thanks in advance for any advice.",06Aug2020,1

Hi everyone. A guy that I’ve had a thing with just moved to the same city as I did. We were both really excited but since he moved here, as we were distant for over a year. Since he moved here, he has become really distant. He takes way more time to answer texts and doesn’t seem to have interest in hanging out.

93,"So I've noticed recently that every time one of my friends is sad, I always try to comfort them by cheering them up/sending cute animal photos/talking through their problems/etc (depends on the severity of the situation - ie. one of my friends was too embarrassed to tell me what she was upset about one day so I told her that if something is upsetting you it's not silly &amp; then sent some cute puppies, but another day she told me about some past trauma &amp; I took a more serious approach &amp; affirmed she didn't deserve to go through that &amp; I hope she never does again). 

But whenever I'm feeling down, regardless of the severity, whether it's just a bad mood or me venting about my currently abusive living situation, I usually just get some sad faces as a reply &amp;... That's it. Until I calm down &amp; come back to the conversation &amp; we move on to another topic. Which leaves me feeling... wanting? I guess? Wanting what I give to them?

But then I'm left to wonder if the effort I put in is normal, &amp; thus if I should be expecting the same. So, is my method of comforting my friends normal &amp; should I want them to do the same for me sometimes or am I just weird?",06Aug2020,1

95,"I (22f) started a new job recently and upon starting immediately made friends with one of the other workers (let's call him John). John is the same age as me and has worked there for 3+ years. He was pretty easy to talk to and get on with and he would help a lot if I didn't know how to do certain things.

After a while one of my friends (who also works there) mentioned to me that he had a girlfriend. I was pretty shocked, not because I had any romantic interest in him but because he had never mentioned it to me. She also mentioned that john's girlfriend used to work where we do, and that he cheated on her with one of the other workers when they were first hired (the two of them are now never on shift together). His girlfriend (somehow) managed to forgive him and they are still together. 

For a while, john and I carried on as normal - just being friendly towards each other. Until his girlfriend came into the store. I was happy enough to meet her and she seemed nice but I noticed that he was pretty eager to get her out ASAP. This was the first time that he acknowledged he had a girlfriend in front of me. AGAIN, i wasn't bothered by this because I have no romantic interest in him but he didn't speak to me for the remainder of the shift.

Recently, I noticed that anytime we were scheduled to be on shift together be would get someone to swap with him. I didnt think much of it tbh.

I didnt see him for about a month. This was until my last shift, where I was covering for someone last minute. When he showed up I could tell he was shocked to see me but he was actually pretty normal overall. Then over the whole shift it became pretty obvious that he was trying to avoid me (and was just acting more petty overall). 

When we were leaving, I made a comment like ""I hadn't seen you in ages"". And he basically told me that he had started to have feelings for me and has been avoiding me because he has a girlfriend and he was hoping that the feelings would go away.

How the hell am I supposed to react to this? I don't have any feelings like that towards him. However, I am concerned about things becoming awkward between us, especially since I am new and he has worked there for much longer.

Any advice or thoughts on the situation would be appreciated.",06Aug2020,1
96,"Hey guys,

I'm a 20 year old male currently in university.

Since January, I had been searching for a co-op. I've had so much free time (only took one course online this summer) and didn't really put too much effort into searching for a co-op, but I finally landed one.

Its a terrific job which is easy so far starting out (not officially a co-op yet, but I'm working for the company because I initially applied for another part time kitchen job, and ended up with the co-op job) and works directly towards my degree as a Digital Marketing Strategist. As this is my first co-op, this is an amazing title and experience to have.

I know I'm happy with this job, and it's guaranteed for a year (so two co-op terms) with potential for more and growth within the company. People who have been on the hunt for these jobs will know this is a gold mine. I've met my boss' family already (am treated like family), get free food while I work, great hours (8-2), going to be good pay (for first co-op), awesome. Especially during these troubling times.

I still feel dissatisfied and almost sad. I was going to go on a camping trip with my girlfriend and friends near the end of August which I had to cancel (they're still going of course, I'm not controlling), had to cancel another camping trip with my close friends. Today, my best friend told me of an awesome camping trip he had with people I know and could've gone with AND my girlfriend told me she's going to a friend's cabin at the end of August which I could go to but granted I can't because of my commitment to my job. Instead of starting my paper, I started planning ahead for Labour Day weekend in September to see if I could make some fun plans, causing more anxiety as I have no ideas, don't know who'd be able to come with me, and don't even know if I'll be working or not. I wanna go camping man, I haven't been in over 2 years.

Describing this, it essentially seems like FOMO. Perhaps its a sign of a recurring immaturity that I need to get over as I grow up. Perhaps I don't know how to balance my fun (when I was smoking weed/playing video games, I had the tendency to abuse/overuse. I stay away from them entirely). This has happened before (although with relationships mainly) where when I think I've found a good spot, I start to miss the other things and eventually back out. 

I should also note that I do have a recurring anxiety that causes me to overthink pretty much everything and I could see causing depression if it hasn't already.  I should also note that I am scared to have a proper hang out with my friends because a lot of them connect good times with smoking weed and other stuff which I simply have to stay away from, and frankly, they wouldn't want to (or can't)  do anything else. 

I'm only 20 years old, and this is whats mainly causing me to think I should value fun more than I do. It could just be a general spike in my anxiety. I know one things for certain, I can't lose focus on this job, especially with the current economic climate and my need for co-ops in my university career.

Any thoughts? Would very much appreciate any responses :)",06Aug2020,1
97,"Since... EVERYTHING started, a lot has changed in my life. To start with, I've lost almost all my friends. There weren't too many to start with, but still. At the very beginning of lock down I went and stayed at a friends... well some traumatizing stuff happened there and I'm no longer friends with that person or anyone they knew. I struggled a lot after that, even have ptsd now because of it and I'm trying to see a therapist. Other than that friend, I only had two left. I'll call them May and V. May did some bad stuff and was talking a lot of shit about me and V behind our backs.. we stopped talking to her for a while and in that time realized just how bad of a friend she was, from blaming us for her issues to pushing people out of OUR lives. After what happened with my last friend not even a month ago, I didn't want people like that in my life anymore, people who have a negative effect on me. So me and V peacefully broke things off with May, she even seemed to want it more than us. 

Now the only friend I have left is V, but I have the feeling its not going to last much longer... 

I understand when someone is having issues and doesn't want to talk to anyone, V can get pretty stressed out sometimes and prefers to stay home alone and clean. I understand that and respect it. That said, I feel like she's just telling me she doesn't want to call or hang out because she stressed and that she actually just doesn't want to spend time with me. At first I thought I was just being paranoid after losing everyone else, but its different now. she says she doesn't feel like talking or hanging out, that she just needs time to herself, so I give her space for the day. I check up on her the next day and she tells me she was doing better and hung out at the park with a group of old high-school friends.. or one of her other many friends. I looked over this for a while, but its been going on for months. The only time V really talks to me anymore is when she needs advice. I give it and try to continue the conversation and it never lasts. I've even straight up said 'hey we should definitely hang out soon' and that was two days ago without a response back. 

I don't know if it's something I did, or if she just prefers to talk to other people. I've purposely avoided talking about any of my recent stresses because I know it can sometimes stress her out. V doesn't even know I'm suffering through some bad PTSD. I'm pretty used to being alone, I was alone without friends for 4 years before... but this is just different, I need someone other than my family right now and I'm alone. I'm in no position to make new friends with my new trauma after what happened, I find it hard to trust just a cashier after a friend of 7 years did shit like that. I have a job, but the people I work with aren't the type of people I want as friends. I'd look online, but meeting up with people online can be so dangerous.

 I feel like it wouldn't be so hard if I could get my life in order and on the road, but I've only been able to get two part time jobs.. I'm not making enough to pay for car insurance AND rent a place. Well I probably could, but I'd have no money for anything else, even food. 

I don't know what kind of advice I'm really looking for, maybe I just needed to write out my current situation. I'm sure many others have it much worse right now and need the advice more.",06Aug2020,1

Limited capacity, small daily staff, etc. Over these past few weeks, we've picked up in business quite a bit (which is terrible for prevention but I like money).

The bosses/owners are also half insane and immediately make the environment stressful when it gets busy. As a result, I find myself crashing *hard* in terms of work ethic.

All this put together has led me to looking for other jobs. I think a change in scenery would be nice, but I also have strong ties to this place and enjoy working here *most* of the time.

I got into a bad drinking habit. My daughter helped out of the drinking habit. Which I don't understand why because I really didn't care much about her. I always been scared of being a dad in case I turned out like anything like my parents. 

She wouldn't leave me alone or give up. I know now I'm not them and I promised to treat her like I should have long ago. I started pouring all my alcohol into the sink I was done drinking. I realized I still have family that cares and I wanna do my best.

The main thing I want to go for is what I think is OCD. Won’t go into details but everything I’ve read about it matches me to a T and it’s caused me so much havoc I want to finally change it. 

I’ve read CBT works best for OCD, but this comes with some other unrelated motivation issues which stem into some depressive-like symptoms and I’m not sure CBT works for this. 

I’m open to drug therapy alongside talking therapy, so if I could pick a type of therapist that allows for this option that would be great.

108,"So before I get started, I understand the internet isn’t as good as professional help but I just want to hear what other people have to say and I’d honestly like to know if/what depression is to anyone reading

For some background, my family and siblings have a somewhat history with depression but it usually isn’t severe. That being said my brother had a smaller case while my sisters was more traumatic, I don’t know much of the details but she’s carried a lot of baggage. I have been sad a lot, and I’m all to familiar with the random crying at night that I really can’t explain, but others around me (I don’t even believe it) would never believe I have depression. One day I was curious and decided to see if this was something I should be worried about, so I took a test online. I took it honestly and chose every choice carefully, and even while I was taking it I realized some things about myself that I didn’t know before. But it really hit me when I ended the test and it read it bold letters “Severe depression”. At first I thought maybe the site wanted to scare users into working with them, but after I took 3 other tests with the same results or something in correlation with ‘severe’ or ‘high levels’ of depression... I felt awful. They all recommended I call the suicide prevention hotline, but let me be clear suicide is not something I want to do. I’ll admit I’ve thought about it but there’s always been something in the back of my head saying “no that’s crazy” or “what would mom think?”. My parents have stated multiple times that they couldn’t handle it if any of us four had died, and that’s always stuck with me, it’s like I’ve treated it as an obligation. It’s been about 2 months since I have taken those tests and since then I’ve actually met someone! She’s really sweet and I’ve really wanted to tell her about my suspicions but I can’t. I don’t want her to worry and I definitely didn’t want to bring that up so early in the relationship... maybe I’m just using that as a cover, when I’m actually just afraid to tell anyone idk. Everyone including my family and friends know me as the happiest, most confident guy they know. They remind me all the time that they wish they had my level of charisma. Which is why I don’t like telling people about my real feelings, I learned early on that most people just don’t care and so I try not to be a bother to anyone... anyways I’ll try and stick with facts instead of using this a therapy session for me, I guess I ranted a little and I apologize. In regards to what I feel, it’s hard to explain. I’ll just have these thoughts about how life would be different if I wasn’t around, how successful my parents would be if they didn’t have to cover my expensive medical bills, how happy my siblings would be if I wasn’t being so annoying to them, how much better my little brother would be if he looked up to someone worth looking up to, how much happier my girlfriend would be if I hadn’t let her fall for me too. Every time I think of these situations I just imagine how much I screwed up or how much I could be better to the people around me, it’s just never enough with me I guess. This kind of stuff scares me, because I feel like even if I was perfect for all the people I care about, it still wouldn’t be enough for me. I’ve ‘exploded’ a couple times, I’m ashamed to admit. It mostly consists of all my bottled up emotions coming out and getting directed towards my parents or siblings, and then it’ll end with me in my room crying with these horrible feelings that I just want to make end... that sounds exactly how you think it does, but I’ve never done anything on it. I’ve gotten seriously close twice now but it’s like something’s holding my arm and stopping me. After I think a little I stop and realize what I was doing, but before I always said suicide is never the option... but it seems like every time I can’t hold anything down anymore it gets more and more like an option for me. One of the biggest things I can imagine stopping me at this point is my girlfriend, she’s just so gentle and clearly doesn’t open up to many people so I feel like if that were to happen I would be doing the opposite of what I want. I’ve thought about breaking up with her because of it, or doing something so she’ll loose her feelings for me and won’t have to care. I just don’t want her to stop her life for me, I want her to keep going because if anyone deserves it it’s her. But I can never do it, I can’t bring myself to break her heart or betray her so I’m just stuck. In my perfect world we would be together forever and my thoughts wouldn’t get in the way but in hers I shouldn’t even be in it, and if that’s the case then I don’t want to get in the way, I want her to find it.  Everything she says or does I somehow spin into a negative thing for me, like she’ll tell me how her day was and I’ll somehow make it my fault and I can’t stop. I’ll just always think today’s the day she stops caring about me or wants me... todays the day she realizes how much of a crappy boyfriend I am, or crappy brother or son or classmate. I’m just not enough.

She has trouble hearing, but always ""forgets"" her hearing aids. We end up having to yell just so she can hear us.


A few days before she leaves to go home, she goes to the grocery store and buys a bunch of stuff that we end up just throwing away. For example, bananas. She'll buy a whole bunch, won't eat any, and then we're stuck with them. We all hate bananas, and I'm allergic to them.

I have what feels like an obsessive need to be paid attention to. I should say, this doesn’t extend to any public light, as I have no desire to ever really be noticed in public, this is pretty much purely between my friends and I. I’m one of those people who messages and tries to meet up with their friends pretty much as often as possible. I find that talking to people and being around them keeps me distracted from a lot of my own emotions that can become extremely overbearing and intense if I spend too much time focused on them. I also tend to purposefully distance myself more from people if I get feelings that they are getting annoyed by me or don’t want to talk.

During those times that I distance myself, I also tend to feel rather rejected and upset, which I know is not rational, especially if a friend is likely just having a bad few days, but it’s something that plagues me all the same.

Things are probably less extreme than I describe them here but the past two days have been pretty rough as I’ve been feeling a lot of this more intensely than usual. I apologize if this is all sort of unclear; I’m not even sure exactly what’s happening in my head and I’m more than willing to take some advice or talk a bit more about things with someone in a similar position or someone with more life experience.

112,"Please help!!!! I did an internship with an important organization. I procrastinated responding to my (boss?) because of depression and covid. I eventually replied to his email (which was just him checking up on me) weeks later apologizing and everything. I never received a reply to this because the email that I used was a school one and it was terminated when I graduated. 

I'm going to college in a week but should I email him again with a new email so that he can still remain in contact with me?  

Reasons why I want to stay in contact: He had spoken casually about offering me a summer job before. Don't want to lose this important connection. Don't want to seem rude. 

Reasons why I maybe shouldn't: I don't want him to see me as unprofessional or that I want anything from him since my internship is over. I also don't see what the point would be in emailing him if I'm not physically able to be there since I'm moving away to college. 

And if I do email him what should I say in it??? Please help and thank you I advance.",06Aug2020,1

114,"My dog recently passed away at the age of 13. He had a slight heart murmur which I'd been keeping an eye on but bar that he was fit as a fiddle, ate well, played and could still clear a 4ft jump and drag me around during his walks. One day he was outside playing with my other dog when he just suddenly started throwing up blood, took a seizure then died all within 10min... Didn't even have time to get him to the vet!! To say I was devastated doesn't even begin to describe how I felt, still very much heartbroken, as I'd had him since I was 14. I've asked vets what they think happened and they just said it was probably a bad seizure but it came after he coughed up blood so it doesn't make sense to me...
I need a sense of closure as I wasn't even home when it happened, my other half was, I wasn't even there to say goodbye....

120,"

i'm gonna try to keep it short but idk if I can. my mental health has been really awful for years. i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when i was like 12. ive been self harming on and off all throughout middle school and now in highschool, and i had finally thought i quit for a few months but i started again recently. and i hate that i do this. my mom found out before but she thinks i quit a long time ago. i've been having issues with starving myself too and my health is just awful. im in bed most days, especially because of the pandemic. i feel like i'm rotting. i get super bad mood swings and i guess, intrusive thoughts? i think about hurting people. i don't want to hurt anyone, i won't, it just pops up in my head and it's so scary. and i don't recognize myself in the mirror most times. i feel like im crazy and i hate that.

my problem is therapy. i need it to get on meds, or that's what i was told a few years ago. but i have super bad anxiety when it comes to therapists. its impossible for me to open up. idk why. every therapist ive ever had i either told them i was okay or refused to talk about what my mom had told them was going on. idk why i do that. its embarrassing that i can't be real with someone trying to help me. so ive just gone untreated and getting progressively worse. i feel hopeless. i want help so bad but idk if i can do it. i get so nervous and shut down talking to these people. 

another issue is my mom. a month ish ago i tried telling my mom i wasn't doing okay. and she told me to suck it up. she didn't see it seriously. and im nervous to get her to. she knew before when i was self harming and she did care, she tried to help, but when i couldn't do therapy because of not being able to talk she gave up to. and now im good at pretending im okay, she thinks im pretty well. i just don't know how to go about getting help and if it will even work at all. i can't keep living like this but she doesn't need another burden on her shoulders.

i feel like im wasting away in bed. my only outlet is cutting, or guitar i guess but i haven't even been doing that. i have horrible thoughts. i hate myself and get pissed when i eat. my emotions are so intense, but only the bad ones. i want help. but i feel like it can't work for me, it didnt before. im so stuck. what do i do?",06Aug2020,1

128,"I've been trying to be more active lately and eat better. My physical health is pretty poor and I'm trying to work to change that.

I've struggled for most of my life doing both however. The last therapist I saw was 99% sure I have a binge eating disorder, but I'm not sure if thats an official diagnosis or not. But I agree with her. Eating is my only coping mechanism and it makes me eat large amounts of food with no control. I also just love trying new foods and such, so I guess that hobby makes it worse. Exercise is rather painful for me too so it's been difficult keeping routines long-term.

Fast forward to now, a few weeks ago I started going back to the gym and it's going great so far. Changing my eating habits, however, is an immense struggle. I am always hungry. I keep looking up all of these ""ideal numbers"" for calories and cholesterol and sodium and such and it honestly is destroying me mentally. Seeing those numbers makes me feel like I can't enjoy food at all, if I want to get healthy. I already dislike most fruits and veggies (not by choice), and it makes me feel extremely distraught that in order to get healthy, I basically have to give up on enjoying food.

132,"Lately I have been having a major issue since June 2020 with someone constantly logging into all of my online accounts. I was informed by Intuit that my email address was affected by a data breach on [Mathway.com](https://mathway.com/) and the MyFitnessPal website. Someone logged into my Twitter, Instagram, Acorns investment account, Robinhood investment account, Pinterest account (and I didn't even have Pinterest when they logged into it!), Amazon and PayPal account. I changed my login info for all of those accounts except for Amazon because at the time they hadn't logged into it. Twitter said the person's IP address was in Thailand and then Instagram said they were in northern California. So obviously this person is using some kind of proxy server so they can't be tracked down.

A week ago, I get an email notification saying that someone logged into my Amazon account from an iPhone in California. I then immediately change my password.

So today I get another email notification from Amazon saying, ""Thank you for your purchase of Amazon Prime!"" Immediately I'm like, ""Wtf???"" And then I get another email saying that my order will arrive soon on August 8th, 2020. This person ordered $60.00 worth of merchandise: a Samsung Galaxy phone cases, hair growth oil, and cosmetics. I am livid because as I am logging into my Amazon account I am thinking: ""Someone just robbed me!"" But as soon as I log into my account I am surprised and confused: The confusing and surprising thing was: they bought the items with a card that isn't even mines at all: it was an American Express credit card and they were having these items shipped to an address out of state: I live in California and they were sending the items to Pennsylvania. They changed the billing and mailing address to this address in Pennsylvania. I removed their card from my account and I change my password again. How did they regain access to my Amazon account after I changed the password when they logged in before???

I called Amazon to see if they could find the IP address of this person. Whoever the owner of the name and address that these items were being shipped to was probably a victim of identity theft by whoever added their credit card and name and address to my Amazon account.

Why was my account being used to purchase things with someone else's credit card and name and address???",06Aug2020,1

He wouldn't talk to us for days and then would just pretend nothing happened and we'd carry on with our lives. My mom still to this day claims it's just a mid life crisis/ depression.

However, lately, I've been thinking a lot about myself. As far as the highs go, I've been spending a lot of money, making irrational decisions to distract myself from other things in my life, etc. I always considered my self esteem to be very low but there are periods of extremely high self esteem that I randomly go through, lasting maybe a week at a time. Another symptom I have is focusing on goals. Lately, I've been focusing a lot on learning French, making lots of money from jobs, etc. 

However, it's the lows that really spoke to me. It was my boyfriend that first pointed out how I do these things. I socially isolate myself from him and my friends with no explanation. I often stop eating, reducing my intake to a meal a day, however, I always figured that was just because of low self esteem. Often, I isolate myself because I feel ashamed of the way I look or am and don't want anyone else to be around me. Although I'm not suicidal, I often ponder and think about death. Not in a contemplative way.

146,"This  year has been very difficult for me. I have a health problem that I  didn't get surgery for (I've been postponing it the last 2 years), and  I've been sharing a house with a bunch of people to save on rent. These  people that I live with all work in carpentry and I'm studying  artificial intelligence in my master's and all they've done is be loud  and inconsiderate. Every time I'd go to the kitchen to eat they'd give  me ""intelligence tests"" (math problems, trivia questions, stuff like  that). Every time I'd be stressed or upset they'd look at me angrily as  if I didn't like them or something. If I'd study too much and not eat  with them they'd say that I'm rude, and that I'm not studying, because  universities are easy in the UK and that I'm probably wasting time and I  probably don't like them and this is why I don't spend time with them  to socialize. I just want to get this off my chest. So they kept  hammering in this idea of ""you're weird, your uni is shit, it's so easy,  you're doing something wrong, you're bad, you're stupid, you're lazy"".

So  I had to deal with panic attacks because of my health issues, which at  the moment I can't afford to treat. And I also had to deal with bullshit  from these people, even though I kept telling them that I'm not a bad  person and that I just want to study and to be left alone, because I  don't cause  any harm to anyone.

And  then my girlfriend broke up with me. I've known her for about 2 years.  She called me on the phone (video chat) to show me how she was having  sex with someone ""who is bigger"". I then told her I don't wanna talk  with her anymore, but she kept contacting me and my parents, sending  threats. Kept making fake accounts, emails, etc. I kept blocking her but for some reason it was difficult to ignore her and I kept looking at her messages and they were disgusting, she blamed me for everything.

Then  one of my best friends, that I helped throughout the years, just  stopped contacting me. I had helped him with some projects and advice  and then he kept saying it was all his idea, and so on. Then one of my  housemates got divorced, and I made the mistake of trying to talk with  him, to reassure him. Afterwards, he became very clingy, and every time  I'd tell him I want to go back to my room to study he'd look at me as if  I hated him. He's also a musician, so he would play loud music if I upset him with anything (very immature, I know). And I just can't handle loud music. I just didn't know how to manage this situation. My other housemate has a room next to mine and he sleeps only 5h a night and talks loudly on the phone, slams his door (a big wooden door, which makes a loud metallic noise when slammed). I just wanted to go to the library but I couldn't, because of the quarantine. And while  I was focusing on my dissertation I just had no idea how to make sense  of it all. It was just so much information, I didn't know where and how  to start. I kept reading and reading, and postponing reports, postponing  trying to code something. I was mentally blocked, trying to understand  what they've done in the papers and how I could improve on their work. I  kept saying ""no, it isn't that, it must be X... no, it's Y... no... "" I  just hate this situation, my project was one of the most difficult and  (in my opinion) interesting at uni this year, and I fucked it all up. I  mean, I don't how I'll get over this. I don't want to go into software  development and let go of my dreams and values.

I  know where I've gone wrong but I just didn't expect that an environment  would be so important when studying. I mean, I should've broken up with  my ex a long time ago and I shouldn't have stayed in this house (I  think I could've found a better place) and I shouldn't have cared at all  about my friend, I should have focused on what I had to do instead and I  think it would've been better. Also I should have stopped  philosophizing so much, and I should have taken a more scientific  approach instead. But I kept thinking ""I'm a creative person, I should  trust my instincts, maybe I should do this... and that... and..."" and  time just flew. I just didn't know how to specialize and how to invest my skills into something. I tried but I had too many options and I felt like I had no idea where my skills laid.

I  did think that maybe I should speak with my supervisor and ask him if I  can continue the project outside of uni, but I think he would refuse  something like that. I've already been rude (no reports sent to him, no  updates, limited contact because of my personal embarrassment and  stress, etc.) and it would be too much from me to ask of him. I really  dunno what to do. Also, I'm not sure how to get a job in this current  situation.

148,"Hey y’all! I am (20m) I’m currently enrolled in college. A lot has gone down in my life and so it really took a toll on me mentally and physically and drained confidence. To be honest I don’t have a whole lot of confidence in my and I have been working on it but it seems like little to no progress has been made. My parents and friends tell me I’m extremely humble and I am not a alpha male and that I need to form some confidence in myself to get where I am going. 

This brings me to an idea of always wanting to join the military but decided not to until my country is calling me or after college. My father serving 20 years in the military From infantry to artillery  told me to be a medic and not infantry  since infantry  is for alpha males having a talk with my parents about forming confidence and stuff. I am struggling with deciding on to joining military so that it can instal confidence and turn me into someone I am proud of. Or continue my college path and slowly build my confidence there.

153,"I have a long term friend I'm trying to cut off and I need to know how to do it, and prevent him from lying to my friends still at home and playing the martyr.

 I stopped being friends with him because he kept on egging absolutely nonsensical arguments on, and I basically told him to leave me alone and I wasn't entertaining his debate hall washout bullshit about swords being less than an axe because I stopped answering him by text and he messaged me on snap continuing. A year later his mom gets a heart attack so I try to basically let bygones be bygones and offer to go get drinks and squash the beef. Basically he tells me his roommate left and he's not gonna be able to swing rent and I tell him I'll crash with him to lessen his burden. His apartment is a mess. The fridge had been out for two months and the eggs in the fridge had COLONIES of maggots in them. Gnats galore, Dr pepper cans everywhere. Says it's the old roommates fault. Cool cool, I'll help clean up.
So I help clean up and basically it was all for naught. Bathroom gets piss covered and peeled skin and facial hair all over the sink and he tries to say it's me. The thing is his skin was visibly molting and we are literally black and white so there's no way I'm going to have strawberry blonde facial hair. Weeks later he gets an eviction notice because the apartment complex ""stopped taking his payments for the last two months"". I go to court because he had a procedure and because I wasn't on the lease I couldn't defend the notice, but he was 4 months behind. He pocketed it most likely and misspent it. I was going through depression so I really didn't see it until I added one and one. So the roommate with the car leaves (insignificant to the story but he knew probably)  and I sell my bike cause it's trouble to deal with out there. 

Basically his mom says me and him could pool our money and go 50/50 on a car. Since I had a little money left i took that offer, and basically we get the car and often I had to wait or walk because he would leave me hanging for a series of dates with a girl who kept standing him up. A month later he wrecks because a car ""brake checked him in the rain"" (my old job let me see the accident report since I was working that day and he was texting while driving, insurance deemed him at fault, all that) and I'm the only one with a car. He asks me to borrow my car since he needs to work to save for another car. Reasonable, help me pay for gas and put back what you take out. Every time I got off shift 3 days a week I had to put $15 back in it because he didn't. My pockets eventually get thin paying for all that and he's spending his money on rocks for his hobby and alcohol. He keept joking to folks we're hanging out with about how I was broke and basically a child who needed to borrow money from him. I called him out once and said it's easy to make money when you have the same expenditures as a 17 year old riding bitch in their mothers car. Basically this turns into a back and forth and he threatens to punch me, lying about being in MARSOC and being a second degree black belt in tai chi (both are evidently false). I tell everyone in the group he's only been in JROTC and that he's shorter lighter and is out of shape, literally 60 pounds more and 7 inches taller. He throws a punch and I throw him down hard. Plays it off as jokes and tries to shake hands. Not happening.

Months later I found out he got a girl who was absolutely black out drunk to text him (didn't know this until the girl and I split and she showed me the messages) and he took my car to take advantage of her. He texts me saying he had a mental split and woke up next to a girl and asked me to set a therapist appointment for him. Once I do, he no showed and he told me ""I don't need a therapist, you're my therapist"". I didn't say anything for months until randomly fellatio was mentioned as a joke and he said ""that's what your ex did to me"" and without thinking twice I rhetorically asked if she waited until she was sober. Never mentioned again, magically. So now I'm grossed out.

So he wanted to watch Roots one day because I follow history, especially as a POC. The n word comes into play. He's very white and decides to use the n word even though I ask him not to, in one instance using it in unison with a friend of his while mentioning ""yeah he's a dumb n-r, but you're not the one who's gonna hear him upset about it while driving home"". Multiple times I asked and multiple times it's ignored. He picked an argument with me over phone lines going down due to storms knocking electrical lines as well, and persisted I email them about the service being out. No lights, no phone, no internet. How. After him criticizing my intellect I ask him how he can try to lecture me on technology use when he needed me to file job applications for him (I didn't do it for him regardless of his persistence) and figure out any technological issues for him, and to leave me alone so I could sleep for work tomorrow. 10 minutes later he's saying how I got defensive over not knowing how to email and I called him out for trying to instigate an argument (he was bitter because he got ghosted a few days ago and I made a concentrated effort to avoid his misery needing company) and how he needs to handle his own issues without trying to impose them. He gets enraged and tries to buck up to me and I chew him out and tell him he can't try to tell me about anything when he needs me to be ""his therapist"". Denies that whole thing and projects it on me and says I need a therapist (at the time I did but Covid made that disappear). For weeks after that, he likes to act like he's gay for me and it's kinda creepy cause he'll try to grope me, peck me on the cheek, jump on me and persist on calling me honey. I can take a joke sometimes, but he would do this frequently, even in public, and when I shove him off of me when I tell him that's creepy to do because I'm not gay PLUS you don't do that to anyone without consent, he says I'm gay or homophobic because I repel from him doing that. Absolutely convoluted idea.

So when the protests broke out for BLM, I tried to go. He found out about it and made a big boogaloo hunger games wet dream about it. Floral shirt, bought a plate carrier and no plates, (I had actual plates for mine due to my former occupation) basically playing soldier. A guy comes up and asks if we served, I tell him no and that I was a first responder, my ""pal"" says he was in MARSOC from Force Recon, went to Parris Island (we were literally in college together for the time period he claimed he was in basic) and lost an appendage while serving (born missing the extremity). I call him out for it later as he's testing his bow and takes it as me challenging him being intimidating, saying I'm harmless. I tell him that's not for him to worry about, and tell him he has a Napoleon complex and needs to stop lying about being a member of the armed forces that supposedly became a black belt in Tai chi that was a certified genius at a number that frequently changes and no documents to support it. He let an arrow into my hand afterwards and claimed it was an accident. He kept flinging dud arrows at me but specifically grabbed a live one just for that, so there's no way it just happened. Missed time because of it. A month or so later, I moved.

Now I've been ignoring him acting like everything is all buddy buddy, him messaging my girlfriend and commenting on her posts for us to visit him in his new town to play some innocent hearts and minds tactic (I feel like she thinks I'm stretching the truth but I can't blame her, I sat through alot of this due to life circumstances outside of the dilemma) but this brings a dilemma to light about how to explain to our joint friends who he's inevitably going to lie to in his favor about what's real or not. Usually I wouldn't trip but alot of my good friends have been added by him and he tries to make buddy buddy with them too. I need to finally cut ties at some point very soon but I don't have a protocol for this. I'll tl;Dr my question.

tl;dr Lying, codependent/attached, racist, trauma bond that likely has some form of a crush on me, put an arrow in my hand, needs to be out of my life completely, but due to circumstances I couldn't cut loose earlier. How do I explain this to those close to me that know him, once I likely get approached about this?

157,"Quick back story. Growing up, I (male) was always the smallest kid, the runt of the class. I was never very much into athletics or even academics. I was just content with all my friends and playing video games every night. My younger sister Lyndsay (not her real name), who I'm 3 years older than, was the opposite. She was smart as a whip and played multiple sports. I admittedly was always jealous of her abilities and felt threatened in a way, so I resorted to always bullying her throughout my childhood. I know this was wrong, and deep down I regret it. We were never particularly close and me bullying her was one of the reasons.

When I was 17 and in my final year of high school, Lyndsay caught up to me in height. This was a huge source of embarrassment for me, and my friends teased me all the time. However, I was still stronger than her and so I continued to push her around a lot and bully her. 

At 18, I moved out of the house, and when I came back to visit, Lyndsay was a bit taller than me. I was around 5'6, and she was 5'7. A few days after, we were watching TV and I tried to snatch the remote from her. We were wrestling around for it, and she had become noticeably stronger. I had a very difficult time pinning her but finally did and got the remote. 

I continued to visit home regularly (and Lyndsay continued to grow in height slowly), but because of the pandemic and other commitments I hadn't been able to visit in nearly 19 months. I am 21 years old now, and last week I came home for the first time since January 2019. To say an 18 year old Lyndsay is bigger than me would be an understatement. She is around 5'10 and has been bodybuilding, and she took it a lot more seriously the past couple of years. Even sitting next to her on the couch is humiliating as I'm really skinny. I haven't touched a gym in years and have never attended one regularly, while Lyndsay had actually become pretty buff. Not to mention she's like 4 or 5 inches taller.

To make matters worse, she is starting off college next year in a far better school than mine and in a more difficult major. I feel like I did when I grew up, where I was always the runt of my class, the smallest kid that wasn't exactly the brightest. Except this time, Lyndsay is the one who has both physically and academically outclassed me. My own younger sister. It doesn't help that my parents always tease me and make comments that my younger sister could beat me up, and Lyndsay always gives me these knowing smiles, cause she knows I can't do anything about it. Thankfully she doesn't actually beat me up, but she loves to put me in random chokeholds and headlocks. Nothing too terrible, but just painful little reminders of humiliation letting me know that she is bigger and stronger than me.

I told my parents about what Lyndsay does to me, and they just laugh and tell me I'm being ridiculous. I have told Lyndsay herself to please stop, but she just continues to do it.

Am I just subjected to this because I treated her so poorly growing up? Or do I have a right to be upset?

Tl;dr I used to bully my younger sister. She is now bigger than me, and I'm the one getting bullied",06Aug2020,1

It was amazing and I’m pretty sure he enjoyed it.  But after that he hasn’t wanted to do anything.  He doesn’t want to have sex, he doesn’t even want to make out.  I get it somewhat because we both live with out parents ( we are both 19) and it’s kinda hard to do anything intimate but it makes me feel like he doesn’t actually find me attractive.  I have this weird thing where I think a guy doesn’t really like me unless he wants to do all that kinda stuff but that’s because of issues with guys before and I’m working on it. So sometimes it gets me worried.  Some moments he tells me he doesn’t want to do anything and I respect that cause I don’t want to make him uncomfortable or force myself on him and then he gets mad that I didn’t try hard enough.

167,"My parents are out right now so I am rushing to make this post. sorry if my thoughts are a mess. Basically I suspect my father is cheating on my mother and here's just some jot notes of why I suspect it:

* I saw the KIK app on his phone which if you dont know what that is it is a messaging app that is most commonly used for sharing nude/pornographic images with others. this isnt its only use but thats what its quite often used for
* i saw him scrolling through his contacts on KIK and and it looked like he had over 100 contacts. considering he only has like 10-20 friends this is a super suspicious amount
* I saw a message he received from someone on KIK(i was looking over his shoulder so i only got a glimpse of it). it was a selfie of a women I have never seen before
* I saw a glimpse of the username of the person he was talking to. im not entirely sure I saw it correct but i believe it was something along the lines of \[*insert city i live in here*\] hookups
* i saw an image of what i think was my nude dad. im not sure of it was him but it was him who sent it and it looked like it was the very start of their conversation
* when i walk past him i often see him closing whatever he was on and hes just staring at his home screen(waiting for me to pass)
* my mom asked him what he was looking at on his phone, i looked over and he closed KIK, opened facebook and then replies ""facebook"" even though that wasnt what he was doing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My situation is kinda odd so here is a brief explanation of it:

* im on vacation right now. i think that i should probably wait until i get back
* my family is very religious. my dad has been going to church since he was a kid so sex and topics surrounding sex are never talked about in my house.
* i have 2 older sisters who are living at home and in university
* my mom hasnt worked for 20+ years. If she left my dad idk what would happen to her
* my family is by no means rich, when i was younger we were quite poor but my parents started saving money for me and my sisters university before we were born. they now have saved over $200,000 cdn for me and my sisters to use for our university. That is a lot of money so I obviously want to be able to get it. It's in a bank account(idk what type) but im worried my dad will try to make it so that i cant have access to it if i tell my mom about what is going on. Idk if I should wait a couple years to ensure that I will get the money or not
* my relationship with both my parents isnt great. they arent abusive or anything but we just dont get along so i try to stay away from both of them in general
* my parents are very strict and my dad is pretty much always angry. regardless of whether or not these suspicions are true i know my dad will be furious with me and that he will be for the rest of his life.
* my dad is not just gonna own up to it. he will try to lie his way out, play the victim card ect. i know im gonna need solid proof but idk how im gonna get it. if i dont i know he will convince my mother i am lying and i will be grounded for eternity
* i dont want this to affect my life, where i go to school ect. i dont want to have to go through my parents yelling and screaming at each other but idk how i should approach this without that being the result

Thats all that i can think of that i need to say. idk what to do and i feel so lost right now. sorry if i take awhile to respond, im on vacation and like i said my parents are strict so its hard to get on reddit rn. thanks.",06Aug2020,1
168,"I’m 30 years old and for as long as I can remember my mom has shared with me complaints about her relationship with my father (they are still married). 

Oftentimes she will tell me things and say don’t tell your father. Or make snarky comments about him or men in general. 

My mom has a sarcastic sense of humor but I know that she is also serious about her comments in relation to my dad. For the longest, I didn’t even like my father because of the stuff she would tell me. 

It’s been hard for me to stand up to her about it. My mom is more liberal and I can talk to her about a lot of things. But if I express that she did something to make me upset, she just get short and usually hangs up the phone. She doesn’t address my side or acknowledge it. She will also ignore / withhold affection until she’s over it. We got into an argument once last year and she ignored my calls for a week. 

I am the oldest daughter and was basically taught to be a people pleaser. My dad is very conservative and everything is black and white with him. Neither of my parents are the type of apologize. They just act like things are normal. I didn’t even realize this was toxic behavior until I saw how my fiancé’s parents behave. 

Recently I was on the phone with my mom and she made a comment about how I should have my own finances separate from my fiancé like she does from my dad because he would just want to spend it all.

I told her my fiancé isn’t like that. (I trust him and he’s more supportive than my family)

She laughed in a “all men are like that” way. I know it’s not my fiancé, it’s her approach towards men in her general based on her experience with my father that makes her say things like that. Nonetheless, it affects me and plants seeds of negativity into my relationship. 

Later that day I called her back and told her in a respectful way that although she may have been joking, when she says stuff like it it affects me and how I treat my dad and my fiancé.

I told her I know she loves me and wants the best for me. Because I value her opinion I do take what she says to heart. But when she says stuff like that it causes me to treat/doubt my fiancé in a way that I know it not true to his character. 

I said because we are close you’ve expressed to me things about my dad  I know dad has not been the best partner to you. But I’m trying really hard to treat my fiancé with respect and trust until he shows me otherwise, which he hasn’t.

All she said was “okay.” Then ended the conversation and hung up.

Has anyone else had to deal with a similar issue with their parents? 

I feel like I’m constantly having to defend myself from my parents toxic behavior. I know they love me and want the best for me, but they are poor communicators. I’m tired of feeling like I’m the only adult.

Some probably useful info is that I struggled with minor high-functioning anxiety and depression from 2016-2018, til in 2018 my father (49) died. (I was 17). My mental health seriously plummeted, on antidepressants, all that.  
I'm really really into music, movies, books and games, but it's only games that I need to see hours spent. Obviously this isn't that big of a problem, and I feel a little guilty asking for help for something so silly, but it's really paralyzing me from enjoying something I love.

173,"They recommended rubber band therapy for my self loathing behavior. And I’ve dabbled with the IDEA before, but never tried it. They said that every time I have a negative though,”I’m fat, I’m ugly, I’m not good enough,etc” I should snap the band and say one thing I do like about myself.... I really can’t think of a single thing. And I know it sounds dramatic, but I feel so uncomfortable in my skin that I really can’t think of anything. It’s been a day of trying to figure anything out, and everything I can come up with I just don’t actually believe. They are adamant on the fact that I must know that this thing I like about myself is something I truly believe. So, any advice on how I could go about “exploring myself” to find something I truly like?",06Aug2020,1
174,"I began having trouble socializing at 12-13 when I was moved to another part of my country where people seem to speak a different language im unfamiliar of.
I tried to learn the language later but seemed to be very slow in it, I lacked conversation and confidence, I lacked friends too then there goes my trouble in socializing, almost every part of it drained. I wished I was never even moved to that place at all for the sake of my social skills and other things. I was recognized back there as the ""shy and quiet boy""
I finally moved back to the old part of my country where I was able to speak up the language im very fluent with but due to getting moved back to that regrettable place where I drained the social skills, I lost some knowledge of what I knew here.
I tried to change myself to be a better person but I just couldn't, I try and try again and fail again, sometimes my family negates that change im trying to do for the sake of myself. I wanted to tell them about it but 2 things appear right at the back of my head
""oh no! Social problems are here and the dislikeable disadvantages of what will happen when I do this and that!"" I always had my mind think of ""oh no whats that person thinking about what I just said right now??"" im getting tired of this and I wanted to fix this already before I get any worse in the future.

I feel like I have destroyed myself to this point, in short words of the question (might want to read whats said before this for some detail):
How do I change to be a better person? I keep getting stopped by random things and even my family.
How do I get back up again after losing more than half of my social skills?
How can I be confident?",06Aug2020,1
175,"I grew up in a very unstable environment and watched my mom being abused at a very young age. My dad would scream at her and from this- as an adult I find myself very uncomfortable with men.

177,"I am about to be 17, and I have never had a boyfriend or been intimate with a boy before. Throughout Highschool there have been 2 boys that I know liked me, because I was directly told so. The problem that seems to always occur is that I am not willing to pursue anything further. I don’t like to be vulnerable, and the whole idea of being in a relationship with a boy my age is discomforting. I don’t have any friends(haven’t had any since I was 12), and I don’t want to run the risk of them being the only constant in my life(outside of my mother and brother). I am a sensitive person and I think if I were to have a boyfriend I would become to invested to quickly. And to add on I don’t think I could provide certain things that are necessary in the relationship. As pathetic as it sounds, kissing doesn’t sound appealing to me, and the thought of actually performing the act makes me uneasy. There is no room for comfort, and I think my nearly aversion like feelings towards kissing and sexual doings is a worrying problem. I am worried that I won’t every overcome my demur surrounding sex. What if I continue life without ever having a boyfriend? What if I am always this frigid? 

I have also found that this same fear plays itself out even with strictly platonic friendships. I don’t  disclose enough information about myself to the other person. I don’t like sharing things about myself, because it makes me feel like I am a narcissist. I don’t want to run the risk of sharing to much, and then the person begins to dislike me even more. I already have this preconceived notion that everyone who meets me thinks that I am stupid, ugly, and undeserving of their time. Why should I babble on about my insignificant life? Instead I prefer to be quiet and listen to people. I love hearing what others have to say, and I find that most people are always more interesting then me. But, people don’t enjoy carrying conversations. Which is understandable. 

And I am trying not to pity myself. I have no reason to do so. There are people who have it way worse then me. I feel ashamed when I vent about it on Reddit, but there is no one else I can say this to.",06Aug2020,1

182,"Sorry if this is confusing

So basically, I have a pretty good relationship with my parents, I’m 17. 

So when I turned 16 I wanted to get a job immediately, I couldn’t get a job because of their aid or insurance or something, So for months I had to just deal with it, I never had any money unless I asked them, And I would always be so angry while walking, I would just start thinking and I would get myself mad.
      Anytime I get angry about something in my house, It’s like i’m not allowed to have feelings or something, If I’m upset it’s a problem. I would be upset that I couldn’t get a job and that they basically screwed me over. So a couple months later I get a job (Under the table) I work really low hours, maybe 15 hours every 2 weeks (maybe) and Id get paid 7 dollars per hour. I would be taking home rarely over 100 dollars every 2 weeks. Again, I get mad about this and how this job sucks, They’ll say things like “Just get another job” Which would piss me off so much because they’re the reason I can’t get another job. And I can’t get too mad or it becomes an issue. So I keep working at this job, The main workers would ask too much of me and then complain to do other stuff as well when I can’t. At one point the boss came to talk to me because I wasn’t picking up phones even tho I couldn’t because everyone was already at the phones. Also I always do my job correctly and get all of the side work done always. But they only see the mistakes, (Which I rarely make) So I develop just an emotionless face, And I’m not in a good mood anymore, Because I have anger inside that I basically can’t let out. 
    So then i’m already pretty upset about these things, But I’m rarely ever upset at home. I always behave and everything. Rarely give my parents issues. So you might think i’m a little childish for getting mad about what i’m about to explain but it doesn’t matter why i’m angry. I recently developed and interest in cars, I started doing my own repairs and bought books and watched videos so I could become a mechanic when I’m older, My dad spends $200 to change valve cover gasket and spark plugs, Which he knows how to do himself and would take no more than 30 minutes, So he wastes $200 and I tell him why would you do that, You just wasted $200. He doesn’t care and he would tell me to shut up and give the piece to the mechanic (his friend) I’m mad about this as well. But I don’t show it. So I want to buy a $200 car and disassemble it and try to put it back together and in that process learn how everything works, And I wanted to do a ton of research to really have an understanding of every part I touched and took out. So I show my dad a $200 beater, perfect for me to work on, He says no because it’s too damaged (rust) I already told him that that’s perfect since I won’t even drive it probably. He still says no, I try to argue with him but no. So I go look for another car, nobody is getting back to me and there’s no cars within 40 miles that were like that for that price. So I text the guy again and he says he sold it already, So I look and look and there’s literally no cars like that anywhere. So I’m pretty upset, I don’t care how childish it is I rarely ever let my anger show, And it shouldn’t matter because I have the right to be upset right? I’m not perfect. So I’m chilling on the coach and I was looking for cars and at this point I’m pretty mad. My dad call me over, I get distracted and have no emotion or reaction to what he says, Because i’m also upset too, I ask what he wanted and he says nevermind. Then he goes upstairs, Comes downstairs and calls my name once, I say “Hmm?” And he just keeps walking so I stand up and follow him, I look through the window blinds and see he’s coming back so i’m like “Ok so he’s gonna tell me what he wants” Then he acts what’s wrong with me, Gets mad at me because i’m upset, Grabs the frying pan I was using and hits me with it, I just take it. Then he says just go, like I did something wrong. And he starts yelling and shit, I go to the bathroom, My mom is fully supportive of this, and doesn’t give a fuck that I could be upset or something.

So basically my question is, What the fuck do I do? I was mad about something, Apparently i’m not allowed feelings or something so they got mad because i’m mad and had a shitty attitude. And i’m up in my room pissed off, But I can’t show it right because they’ll get mad again. Idk sorry if this was confusing but I had to get it out or do something. Am I in the wrong for being mad???

We also would break up and get back together every other week. But for some reason he was the one? Never have I felt more intense feelings than the ones I had when I was with him. It was like he knew me for me, and didn’t care. And I mean he KNEW me knew me. Better for worse type shit. He knew what to do to make me happy, and he knew what to do to make me smile when I was crying or sad. He knew how to make me less angry when he did some stupid shit. And he always knew how to get me back. He did things most boyfriends wouldn’t even dream of doing without being asked.

This was never really something I thought much of in the moment it happened, or any time before corona really.

I confronted the jerk who was involved in it, and got him to apologize and to admit that he did something wrong and stupid.

However, part of me is unable to move on because it feels like a big deal. It's weird. It's like it just seemed really minor while it happened, but when everything closed down, I became more and more idle. And having more time to myself, things that seemed so small start to feel bigger and bigger.

The problems I am having are as follows:

Every conversation becomes an argument after the first exchange. He cannot help but find an argument in anything I say to him. His arguments consist of calling things gay, calling me retarded, or otherwise finding a nonsensical way to give me anxiety.

Along with this he takes every chance he can get to take a jab at me. He cannot go half an hour without finding something to make fun of. 

He is extremely selfish. For example, it is currently extremely hot and humid and we are sleeping in the same room. He takes the fan and moves it closer to his bed and points it toward him. I say he is selfish. He says I am gay. 

He constantly plays loud music and loud tik toks. I tell him to turn it down but he never does. 

He does the same to my parents. He also talks about strangers when they are in earshot. For example he was talking trash about a lesbian couple as they were a few feet away. 

He has no honor code, sense of authority, or sense of seniority. He does not listen to my parents. He gives me immense anxiety and greatly diminishes my confidence and comfort. I am tired of it.

We told them (angrily) about my moms condition and how she was faint of heart and she needs lots of sleep but they do nothing to control their child.

What can I do? I don’t even know who to report this to or how to report this or how to get them to stop.

193,"Hello! I will be starting my college engineering studies this fall as a freshman. I am currently having a mental breakdown because I need to make up my mind regarding what major I want to go into. I apologize in advance for how long this is going to be and thank anyone who helps me out in any way.

I have narrowed my choices down to electrical and computer engineering (my school fuses the two together as a double major program) and mechanical engineering.

My first “concern” Is my foundation in the fields. I have taken some electrical engineering programs in high school so I am familiar with the basics of electrical engineering such as building circuits and programming and I found these fun and interesting while in high school. As for mechanical engineering, I have no real foundation on the field. I believe the ME field requires a lot of physics which is not something I’m too interested in, but the design aspect of ME is something that I could see myself getting into.

My next concern is the complexity of the math involved in the majors. This is mainly due to the fact that as I progressed through high school I saw a lot my interests in math dwindle as the topics became more and more complex and confusing. I am aware that both fields will require a lot of math but as far as I know, the ME field concentrates more on math than the EE and CE fields.

My final concern is the overall difficulty of the majors. From what I’ve gathered, EE and CE courses are more rigorous than ME courses and that is the main reason that majoring in ME is even on my radar. I had a lot of fun in my high school engineering program and I grasped the concepts very well, but I fear that, like my interest in math, my EE and CE interests will also dwindle as the subjects get harder. I also fear that I won’t be able to enjoy my college experience because I will be overloaded with tons of complex work or that I won’t be able to handle.

If anyone has any information that they feel I should take into consideration or any advice, tips, experiences, etc. please feel free to leave a message or to dm me. Sorry for how long this turned out and thanks again!",06Aug2020,1

Then things started to escalate with us throwing slightly more offensive insults than usual.

206,"I'm entering my senior year of college, and have now been home for four months due to covid. My internship got cancelled, and I've been working on various side projects to stay busy. Everyday, my father will ask me several times what I'm working on. Opening my door to ask me even if its closed, sometimes even coming over to my computer to squint at my screen as I'm working. Coming into my room to observe me if I'm on a call. I've asked him to stop because its distracting but he won't. For context, my father doesn't work, and hasn't had a job in probably 20 years - he is completely dependent on my mother for income. He feels totally responsible for my success, because he feels like if nothing else in his life goes well, at least I can achieve what he deems to be ""success."" But, A) we do not share the same vision of ""success,"" and B) his ""help"" is really just more of an anxiety coping mechanism - having ""meetings"" so he can hear (read: judge) what I'm working on, and lecturing me about what I should be doing to live a successful life. And if I ever resist talking with him, he simply threatens our relationship, saying that he won't talk to me anymore. Additionally, he has a lot of anger and rage for the situation he's created for himself, and this manifests in various ways, whether the anger is directed toward me or my mother. Thankfully it has never been physically, but the yelling, cursing and hateful words can get to me at times. 

I desperately yearn for the freedom of living on my own, and just being able to think and work without fear or the distraction of my father.

208,"OK, so for some context, I'm a 28 year old male. I currently work full time at a job that is disgustingly below what I'm capable of. I'm a highly intelligent individual (not to toot my own horn.) However, I lack motivation. I'm not going to get into it all of the details here. Long story short, I've been through a lot of trauma. The one that I feel affects me the most regarding the immediate situation would be abuse. By abuse I mean verbal, psychological, that kind. The ""you're never going to go anywhere or do anything."" For pretty much my entire life. 

I went to college after high school and ended up dropping out because well ""I'll never accomplish anything."" Right? I've thought about going back but honestly, I can't justify it. I know I'm capable of doing amazing things but I can't seem to move forward. 

Ok, so, of you've read this far, thank you. Now, I'll actually get into my current dilemma. As I said, I work full time at a job that (in every regard) is below me. That's not arrogance, either...if I told you what I do, you'd understand. Don't get me wrong, I get that a job is a job and I'm grateful, so, please, none of that ""it's a job"" garbage in the comments. I'm aware. That isn't the issue. My issue is that I know I'm capable of more and want to get there. I just have no motivation. Every time I start something, I'm super excited for like 2 weeks or so and then it just disappears. I work my job, get home and just want to chill out. I know video games aren't productive but whatever. Again, I'm just tired, stressed and lack motivation. 

Does anybody have any insight as to how I should go about handling this situation? Any advice on how I can work a miserable job but still get stuff done? 

If you have any questions, need extra info or would like to discuss some aspect(s) further, please, feel free to DM me. 

I really do appreciate anyone who took the time to read this all the way through and provide a thoughtful response. Much love.",06Aug2020,1
209,"My 17 year old younger sister has a disgusting habit of pooping in her room and hiding it. The only other time we have caught this was years ago when she pooped in a hat then let it sit in her drawer for what smelled like months. Today we found yet another turd plopped out on a towel in the corner of her room. What do we need to do? 

It's gross and it is definitely not habitable or safe for anyone in the house to have human feces laying around.

210,"Recently, I have been screaming in my sleep. 
First time, I was having a normal, non-terrifying dream and my partner stated I began shouting for my mom. He came into our room, and when I came to, I shrugged it off and went back to sleep. Second time, I was dreaming of something unpleasant but not nightmare-ish. In my dream I was shouting, but my partner stated I was again screaming for my mother. 
This has happened a few times now. 
Last night, I had a dream I was being assaulted and someone was on top of me. I woke up screaming, only to find my dog on top of me (he sleeps in my bed). It scared me and I had a hard time falling asleep after that. 
Also should add I don’t have history of trauma, abuse, etc. It seems this is out of nowhere.

214,"At 7AM, I woke up, made breakfast, drank some tea, and watched The Promised Neverland until I went to work at 11AM. I was at work from 11AM-7PM.  Before I went to work, I forgot to lock my computer. allowing my 9 year old niece to have free access. I didn't think much of it since she mostly just watches TikTok compilations on YouTube. I forgot, however, that I'm an avid indulger of ""P""nography and that I have MANY bookmarks of VARIOUS content. When I got back on my laptop at 10PM, I notice the tab wasn't on Netflix, but on YouTube. I checked the history to see what else she had searched while I was gone and saw google searches with the ""P"" word. No problem, kids are curious, find something different and take an interest in it. I decided to try to talk to her about it and help her understand that there's nothing wrong with what she searched, just to not do it on my account. As soon as I showed her the laptop, she looked at me like she never seen a laptop before. I asked her why she searched those things up on my account and she immediately denied that she even used my laptop, despite clear evidence. I kept trying to explain to her that she's not in trouble for searching up ""P""rn and that it's normal, but she was adamant that she never did anything on my laptop. I live with my niece and my mother, who just had surgery and has her own laptop. I was at work for 8 hours, the same time that the content was searched at 1PM. I believe her acting like this stems from her mother being highly toxic and abusive to my niece whenever she did something remotely wrong in her mother's eyes, which led to severe beatings.

Apparently though even after leaving he’s still texting her and another girl working at the market.

I work a 12 hour shift with no break and we're seeing between 40 to 80 patients a day. We're a testing facility for Covid, an urgent care, primary care, and we do occupational medicine and Workcomp. 

My workload consists of this - answering phones, scheduling, putting in patient info, collecting payments, scanning all documents, faxing to MRO's and any referrals or orders, online scheduling, a separate system for online scheduling, going through emails, calling patients about Covid results and sending them were they need to go, resending out bills, taking care of medical records requests and cleaning the office. 

It wouldn't be so bad if we weren't a skeleton crew. There's three of us there a day to deal with a huge influx of patients. I'm so angry lately because I feel like I don't matter.

  •somewhere that’s cooler weather
  •great with single moms, if that makes sense. I guess if they have programs that help single moms out a little.
  •isn’t so overly expensive and is more livable with the job wage/rent ratio (please don’t say California for example lol)
  •public transportation
  •great place to raise a family in
  •great schools (pre school-college would be awesome)
  •more on the safe/low crime side, if that’s even possible 
  •a good job market, again not like California where it’s hard to find a job because so many people are fighting for any type of job (I’ve tried living in CA twice, not happening again)

Today my son (11)was playing in the park near our house. They were playing a tackle game. I was outside so I could see them clearly. I saw an African American boy (9)that I’ve never seen before. 
I couldn’t hear what was going on but I saw the other boys talking to him. A few seconds later I saw the boy run off and then come back with a football.
They began tossing the football around. Soon the boy tackled my son to the ground. I quickly got up and said “Hey! Get off my  f-ing kid!” The boy got up,but I was still upset and I began wagging my finger in the kids face. I told him “ who are you? You don’t belong in this neighborhood! Get out!”  He cried. And I heard other people saying “way to go Karen!”

I took my son home and he was upset. I asked him why would he play with a kid that doesn’t live in this community. He told me. “That’s James. He lives in the big house on the corner.  He’s lived here for two years. He’s my friend.”  I asked why I’ve never seen him before. He told me because of the pandemic.  And before then he wasn’t sure why I never noticed him 

I do admit that with my work schedule I hardly see my son play outside much. His father usually watches.  His father also confirmed that James has been here for awhile

228,"It's been about ten years now that I've been completely numb to emotions. I don't feel happiness. I barely feel sadness. I don't really feel true love. I do feel a lot of anger.

I would honestly rather be depressed but at least also able to feel happiness.

I don't take any medications. I was on anti-depressants for several months, and maybe that's what kick-started this, or maybe it's just that I've built up so many walls around myself to protect myself and pushed my feelings down for so long that I ended up this way.

My husband is critically ill and honestly, I would not even cry if he died. I know that sounds terrible and I feel like a terrible person. I have no empathy. I don't think I ever have had empathy. I want to be able to feel love like I have in the past, where it's so deep it hurts and you're so happy that you feel like you're soaring, but I'm just a flat line emotionally.

Is it even possible to get those emotions back after so many years of not having them?

240,"This month, I’ll become 26 years old. In my time on this planet, I’ve struggled to make meaningful connections with others.  As friends, colleagues, or romantic interests.  

Throughout school, I didn’t have a circle of friends.  I developed a close circle in my high school years externally, but my struggles with mental health (anxiety, depression, panic) culminated in a psychotic episode resulting in 3-4 inpatient hospitalizations over 5 years.  This totally alienated my friends and they cut ties with me. 

To make matters worse, I consolidated my credits upon returning to university and barely managed to graduate in engineering.  While a student, I committed and continued to feel totally detached. 

After entering the workforce some 4 years ago, I’ve switched jobs seven times and worked in eight different positions.  A big part of my final diagnosis of Bipolar I is making rash quick decisions, which includes impulsive purchases and being rather irritable (if hypomanic).  This makes it hard. 

I’m going to be relocating this year for my new job.  I’m going to be distant, from my only family here, as my parents retire and my sibling goes to college. My only relatives are overseas.  Living alone, I already know I’m going to feel lonely and unwanted.  Living alone is going to be really tough.  

I innately have a longing need to have some close friends.  It’d be nice too to be in a relationship.  But in 26 years, I’ve never been in any relationship, never once been on a date, and let me tell you— during the depressive episodes of BPD, I’ve attempted to end it all because of this perceived notion of being outcast and unwanted.  Don’t worry, that was many years ago and I’ve adhered to a strict but tapered medication regimen. 

My work will be really strange.  I will support a geographic location and not necessarily sit in the same building every day.  I won’t have a corporate office location.  In engineering and in this company, I can confidently say 80% or higher of my team is male.  So I won’t be meeting the love of my life there!  

The nature of this job is going to be really detached from any sense of colleague camaraderie. I think that I won’t have the time to do anything else.  People seem to put in 50-60 hour work days and travel at least once a month.  I’ll be raking in the dough, (six figs at 26), but I think this will engross my life.  

I really feel that I’m not meant to be in this world when time after time, I’ve had no meaningful bond with anybody.  What the hell is the use for money when I can’t enjoy life with anyone else? 

And so I feel I’m going down a bad path here.  If it continues, I don’t know what I’ll do with myself.  Every rejection and failure and lost connection hurts me and reaffirms these notions.  Sometimes, I wish I never existed to experience being outcast.",06Aug2020,1

There was pee on the floor of all bathrooms from his inability to aim or clean up after himself. I remember reading his porno mags and misogynistic pick up artist books in his bathroom at like 7 years old.  We had to keep the blinds shut because ""people were coming for us"" even though nothing ever happened. I don't remember a time when I wasn't scared of him-- even though as far as I know he has never physically abused me. 

There were cameras all over the house, including in my bedroom and intruder signs on the front door. He frequently made comments about my body being ""trim"" or ""appealing"" in a bathing suit when I was as young as 8. Not sure about the exact age it started. He also always made sexual jokes about women in movies we watched (Meghan Fox, Scarlett Johannson) 

As long as I remember I have had many nightmares about him sexually abusing me and I could never sleep at his house for fear that I'd wake up to him in my room or him touching me. I can confidently say I have never trusted a man (even male relatives) in my life and have difficulty seeing myself in a relationship with any man. I also feel paranoid that my step dad will sexually abuse me even though as far as I know he hasn't either. 

Is there a possibility my dad has done something to me that I blocked out? I stopped seeing him when I was around 10 because he had threatened me with knives,made me sit in the back of a LYFT with strange men, and made me run in the dark on the street with him because people were ""following"" us (he is 6ft, 350 pounds and I don't remember any of these threats seeming true) and that was enough reason for my mom to allow me to stop visiting.

 Does anyone know why I have always felt like this since I was very young? Is there any reason a literal child would have constant nightmares about sexual assault from their father for as long as they can remember, yet I have no memory of him ever hitting or sexually assaulting me or my mother?

 I have no immediate male relatives apart from him and my grandfather who I barely know, so there's no chance I was assaulted by someone else. My mother had no close male friends. I have felt this fear of him my whole life. In our family there is a strong line of BPD and schizophrenia. His brother committed suicide and had both of these illnesses. I believe my father has paranoia, schizophrenia and BPD along with possibly many other illnesses, plus a massive ego, but obviously he is undiagnosed. His father was physically abusive as well.

TL;DR: I've been constantly afraid of my father sexually assaulting or killing me since I was very young, but I can't remember him physically abusing me. Could I be blocking it out or is this normal (??) I have a deep distrust of all men but no actual memories of a specific incident that caused this.",06Aug2020,1

248,"Hi, I'm starting to feel a bit depressed with my situation right now. I really want to go a european university to study technology as an american undergraduate . Reasons because its cheaper, theres less of covid 19, and more importantly, all of my family is in europe. My parents are divorcing and my father is moving back to europe for retirement. My mother will be moving out of state once i start college. However, schools outside of my state are ridiculously expensive. 
Cheapest colleges in us are state colleges, but still too expensive. Also, if it is done virtually, i have no one to stay with for housing in the state. 

Im applying for a foundation year at 3 universities but my grades dont meet the requirement right now. 

I have one year left of high school.
Not sure what I should do here, or how can i get an undergrad bachelors in europe as a high school student. Should I transfer later? Thanks for reading and let me know if this is the wrong subreddit.",06Aug2020,1

250,"Throwaway account because this is quite a sensitive topic to me and my family. This is also my first time using Reddit. This will be a long post, check for a TL;DR at the end if you'd like. My husband and I have been married for 20 years now and have two daughters (19F and 13F). When our first daughter was born, my husband was a fantastic father and spouse in every way. Generous, loving, understanding, kind. But beginning a few years ago, probably around 2014, I slowly started to see a change in his personality, which now seems drastic. To keep this as brief as possible, I'll make a list of the changes:

* Early on my husband and I both agreed that he would do the majority of the housework, such as cleaning, washing clothes, and taking care of the pets since he works from home and I do not, instead working long physically demanding hours. I was to help the kids with homework and cook dinner for the family. We were both content with this. Lately, he has pretty much stopped doing anything around the house that he used to do. And when he does, he complains constantly. He used to do this willingly and lovingly. I do try to help out when I am home all day on the weekends.
* He has become extremely stubborn. Where he used to apologize for wrongdoings, he now gets bitter and holds grudges, even when he is proven to be wrong. He immediately turns things on others and is oblivious to faults. Not wanting to make any needed improvements.
* He has shown signs of depression. He has a very set everyday routine and seems to find no excitement or enjoyment in life. When I try to ask about his mental health he denies that anything is wrong.

Now, here is the stuff that really worries me about his health.

* Again, within the last few years only, he has begun to seemingly resent our daughters. They are my everything, and I feel that as a parent he should feel the same way. He has stopped trying to have a relationship with them at all. He gets jealous of the attention I show them, but when I see that he doesn't prioritize them as I do, it is hard for me to want to be affectionate with him.
* Up until very recently, to wind down before bed, my husband and I used to have a drink every night, mostly while spending time together. For a while now, however, he has taken this to an extreme and will often drink way too much. He used to not ever do this. He denies this though, despite him becoming a very different and more mean/aggressive person while drunk. This has greatly strained his relationship with both of our daughters and me as well. He sees no issue. About a week ago though, my oldest daughter suggested that since he claims to not need a drink, that we get rid of all the alcohol in the house. I obliged and so has he. We will see how this goes.
* Also recently, my husband seems to have pretty noticeable memory loss. We will have full conversations about a topic, but when it is brought back up at a later time, he doesn't remember the conversation at all. This worries me.
* Lastly, last night around 4 AM I woke up to thinking our dog was peeing on the floor. But when I sat up, I realized that it was my husband. When I asked what he was doing, he said ""I'm peeing."" and now doesn't remember it happening at all. He has never sleepwalked before in our 20 years of marriage, so I don't believe that's what happened.

TL;DR my husband has had a major personality change including disregarding work around the house that he agreed to do, sudden extreme stubbornness and refusal to apologize, possible signs of depression. And most importantly; beginning to resent our daughters, drinking way too much nightly, memory loss, and peeing on the floor with no recollection.

So, Reddit, what should I do about my husband's change in behavior? Does this seem like a major issue? Could there be an underlying medical cause that I am overlooking? I am distraught and have even considered leaving him at times if he refuses to realize that he has become mean and resentful.",06Aug2020,1
251,"I've had way too much time over the past few months due to covid. And I'm slightly depressed since most of my friends don't really like to talk via online. I've tried making ones online but I'm not very good at it. I've tried to keep to a schedule but that's gone out the window. I live with my brother and mom and dad. Basically all I've been doing is looking at clips of the news on YouTube not really watching the videos though just looking at the likes and dislikes and comments.

I've unfortunately been kinda turned into a islamaphobe which I really wanna get rid of since  the rest of my family are Muslim. While it's not any particular channel that's got me this way it's just the general anti islam stance that's got me this way. It doesn't really help that Reddit has quite an anti islam stance as well. I just feel like I'm losing everything my smarts my friends my point in life. It doesn't help I feel the world is fucked climate change, the camps in china I could go forever. I've started to treat my close family quite badly in the normal teenager way. But given I live in a very Muslim area when ever I like down the street I look in disgust and started to be disgusted by their presence. Which I really want to get rid of. I also really want to escape politics in general.

I feel like I'm losing my purpose in life I don't feel as smart as I was once was and I feel distant from every community I'm usually in. I need somebody to tell me this isn't okay before I go further down the rabbit hole. And end in an worse position than I'm in now.",06Aug2020,1
252,"Hey guys, hormonal teenager here. I’m entering a new year of school next year, but due to the virus, we will have a schedule where half of the kids will go Monday and Tuesday while the other half will go Thursday and Friday, the rest of the days being virtual. Unfortunately, it’s all alphabetically, and I don’t know anyone in my half. Well I do, but the issue is I really don’t know how to talk to the people I am acquainted with. I have portrayed myself as an annoying people pleaser for the past few years because I didn’t know how to socialize. I am the third wheel and but it on other’s conversations, which is annoying for both them and me. Over these past few months, I realized that I don’t have to fulfill the needs of others and can be myself. I am worried that people will still see me this way, or when I go back I will just revert back to the annoying character I made. Or they just won’t accept me for who I am. So how can I make new friends when everyone is already in their own little circles and have a set perception of me? I don’t know how to approach people and start a conversation, I was really annoying and probably still am, and just not good at talking heart to heart with people. I also feel as if nobody shares the same interests I do so it’s hard to relate. Thanks for taking your time to read/respond to my rambling.

TL;DR: How can I move past being the annoying kid and start making other friends when it seems like nobody shares my interests and everyone already has their own friends?

253,"I have what is probably undiagnosed ADHD (my doctor believes this as well as me and parents, and I'm just waiting for an official psych evaluation). Symptoms of inattentiveness were always there growing up, but they were kept under control by my mom helping me to stay on task throughout homeschooling, reminding me to clean up my piles around the house, etc.

When I moved out on my own a couple of years ago, things naturally got much worse without any sort of accountability. It also didn't help that I got pretty bad depression around that time. Eating, having a decent sleep schedule, and taking care of personal hygiene were just things that other, more responsible people did. I'm in a much better place now, but the ADHD symptoms that were masked by my depression are still there, making getting ready and focusing throughout the day a struggle.

My mom is super sweet. She loves me a TON and wants me to be happy and healthy. So, she's been trying to help me remotely with keeping myself on track, just like she did when I was at home. The problem is, I didn't really ask for the help. I want to get better, yes, but being asked every day whether or not I showered, ate, got to bed on time, etc. makes me feel kind of helpless, like if she wouldn't ask, I wouldn't be able to do it. It's also a punch in the gut when I have to tell her I failed at something; for the most part, I've stopped beating myself up over every daily mistake because I now know I'm not just lazy, but it still hits me when this happens (""oh no, I let her down again"").

I've talked to her about how this makes me feel, but nothing ever seems to change; I get talked out of my viewpoint one way or another. I get where she's coming from: she doesn't want to see me unintentionally wreck my life, and she's just trying to help. But I still get a little upset the more she asks me things and the longer this goes on. I'm trying my very best to be respectful, but a couple of times I've gotten so frustrated that I've given her a cold shoulder or snapped at her, and that troubles both of us. I can tell she's worried about our relationship--""You know I still love you, right?""--and I'm worried about how it might progress in the future too. That's why I'm here.

I'm trying my hardest to improve, and now that I know more about ADHD, I believe I would keep working toward these goals even without my mom checking. I know I can't be perfect; I'm just trying to keep my head above water until I can work with a provider to find medication and therapy that will help me. But at the moment, I kind of feel like I have to be perfect so I don't disappoint her.

So, am I wrong for getting upset with my mom's attempts at help? I think I might be, because her actions do help keep me accountable somewhat. I'm just exhausted by the whole situation.",06Aug2020,1
254,"My mother(F50) sacrificed a lot for me and my siblings, especially so for my younger brother(M17) and I(F19), since we are the youngest out of our family. She left everything that she had in our homeland so she could give us a better life, went into a toxic marriage just so we could succeed in the country we immigrated to, worked hard finding jobs so she could take care of us.

On my 17th birthday, and my birthday isn’t often celebrated so I was pretty excited when I was told it would be, and it didn’t go as planned, the person taking me out never came nor told me plans were canceled so pretty much stayed up waiting for who knows long before I realized and started crying from disappointment. I didn’t get any messages from my mum which I was hopeful for, cause usually she would at least send me a text, she didn’t, I understand she was working and it was stressful, just really hurt that I didn’t get anything not even the next day.

Although, that day wasn’t entirely bad cause my older brother decided to come down south on the weekend to celebrate once he heard that my bday was a total bust, but I still ended up blowing up on my mum about it which caused a fight between us which later ended up her hugging me and apologizing. I felt better afterwards.

Two days later my older brother died, a day before he was supposed to come, I heard the news right after donating blood at school so i felt sick and I broke down. I came home and everyone was there in tears and my younger brother made an implication that it might have possibly my fault that it happened.

My mother got angry at the person that promised me that they would take me out the day of my birthday which I had felt really hurt about when I found out the reason why they had to skip.

I was taken aback since I didn’t think she’d get angry at them on my behalf.

A few weeks passed and we spent the time at my brother’s home for his funeral and a lot of things happened like hearing about a shut down at my school because of a shooting, so I had a lot on my mind since I wasn’t completely sure whether it was my school or not until later on in the day.

Later on, my mother around that week left me in charge of some keys that were supposed to opened an electronic gate, and I kept them safe for the majority of the day however the children were running about where I was and I was afraid I’d lose the keys so I decided to go downstairs where all the adults were n I left the keys in a bowl downstairs. I should’ve thought more about doing that and just maybe went somewhere else with it, I don’t really know, I just thought it’d be safer downstairs than upstairs with children running about that could possibly grab it if I left it from my sight from a moment. Later that night my mum asked me for it, however I realized it wasnt there and she ended up shouting at me and saying things like what if there was an emergency and we couldn’t get out cuz the keys weren’t there n someone died. 
I tried to explain and I don’t know if I said sorry then but I just remembered I was crying a lot cause I didn’t really know how to deal with the situation and my older sister got upset atmy mother and I didn’t hear what was said between them, I just recall not being there in the mental sense, all I remembered was shouting and arms wrapped around me, I don’t remember who it was, after the shouting, I didn’t really wanna share the room with my mum after that but she forced me to and I had a talk with her, I apologized and accepted that I was wrong but I felt hollow.

So after a month I was talking about something that I felt wronged about, and she said that it wasn’t for me whining (like I was doing now) about her not telling me happy birthday when she wanted to call my brother, maybe she could’ve stopped him from going and I frozen asked her if she was implying that if it was my fault that he died and she got angry and said that’s not what she said and and got angry at me, so I spent the hour or two crying hiding in the bathroom before I was forced out and then crying in the closet and feeling guilty. After those hours passed, my mother came in and apologized and asked to hug it out. I refused cause I didn’t feel ready to forgive her since she took so long to apologize and she got angry and said some hurtful things before leaving me by myself.

All of that and other things not mentioned ended up leading me to have resentment towards her.",06Aug2020,1

256,"Hey there, living (25) with my gf (24) in a pretty nice and big city, tho we both come from small villages close to each other where also our parents live.

Her parents wanted us to have their old house for 80k € as they moved to the house of her grandma, which would've meant that I'd have to live there at some point with way worse job opportunities and worse pay - for the price of having your own house in like 15 years of payments.

I don't see myself living there so after declining it initially felt really good, but right now it feels lìke a big mistake, because 80k for a whole house with garden is cheap as hell. My mind is going back and forth if it was right or wrong, that even if I wanted a house or move away from the city at some point, I'd be financially able to do it and maybe closer to our parents while also being closer to good jobs (I work in neurological rehabilitation and the next thing would be a 1,5 h drive away for me).

258,"Hey, 22m here. 

I'm gona try to make this short and easy. I'm almost a full year being single. I don't think about my ex anymore because I know she moved on and I know I made the right choice. I did love her but I didn't really think the relationship was going anywhere anymore, we weren't really growing together, I couldn't really make time for her because of school and work (I'm in the medical field), she never really liked my friends or when I would hang out with them instead of her alone (which I did 95% of the time, I lost alot of friends for this relationship), and I couldn't really communicate with her about my personal struggles with out feeling like I was talking to a wall and get no response. Anyway, she moved on almost immediately and started to date her co-worker 4 months after we broke up. Which I predicted that she would do. 

However, I figured I would be able to find someone else too and feel that spark again by now. I have been with others like one night stands, dates, and all that jazz but the problem really wasn't them because most of them really did like me and wanted a relationship with me. However, I basically seize up when I feel the attraction towards a relationship again. I kept feeling like I need to be more, do more, have more experience, be with my friends more, go on adventures more, find more hobbies, and reach higher goals in my career. The best example of how I feel is basically me having a goal for myself and then thinking that when I reach it I'll then be worthy of love again. 

I just reached many goals like gym goals, career goals, personal goals, financial goals, emotional goals, and even family goals ( divorced parents, I grew up basically having no family values because I felt pretty outcasted 99.98% of the time and was living with alcoholic father) but I still don't feel like it's enough. I just reached a substantial amount of goals and now I just see my newer goals and think 'okay I'll be ready then' and the cycle continues

259,"I have tried really hard to grasp my anxiety for years. I’ve struggled with it as long as I can remember but I’ve worked very hard to handle most social situations but this. 

My work hosts trainings multiple times a year to renew certifications and just has meetings in general. My boss will question everyone (anywhere from 4-6 people) kind of like popcorn style. Every single time I’m called on my mind goes blank, I forget everything I was thinking of and of course, start panicking to the verge of me almost tearing up. I normally just get red in the face, say “I don’t know” then start to talk very quietly and proceed with anxious tendencies like picking at my nails, tapping legs, avoiding eye contact, etc.

My boss knows and is very understanding and never mentions it but at the position I am at I shouldn’t be doing this and should be leading by example.  He has to ask me these questions of course as he does everyone else and I noticed he gives me easier tasks to role play and do when it’s time to do so which I appreciate but again, I can’t stand it. I feel stupid and unworthy of my position. 

The thing is, I KNOW the answers to these and it’s embarrassing having this happen. I’ve had coworkers in the same position do the same to me and I literally cannot function properly when asked. I am at a loss with this and it’s so embarrassing and draining as I’m constantly on edge and mess up when performing actions or speaking.

260,"Since I was a child I have slept poorly, recently I got tested for the third time in my life with the same results. This time I have insurance and I was able to get a machine to help with my sleep apnea.

Through testing it was determined I would stop breathing 14+ times per hour, but only during REM. I have always shook it off that I could never remember my dreams in the morning. Like nothing, not even a faint memory.

But now I can remember every dream in great detail. 

3 weeks in, it’s almost been a nightmare ever night.

Through work I have dealt with a great deal amount of death, suffering and evil. Although my position at work is much better, I think about many of these in the past.

I have always felt I was border line ptsd, but I don’t want to seek therapy as it will effect my work, I know it’s confidential, however my work will find out through  either my health assessments or workplace insurance.

261," 

i'm relatively bad at life and relationships, and i really want some advice.

i know the simple answer to my problem is drop the friend, get therapy, etc. etc., but it's honestly not that easy to me?

err, a little warning i guess: **this mentions sexual assault and some really weird stuff**. this is a realllyyy long post, tl;dr at end.

about a year ago (high school), i (15 F) started dating this guy i really liked. we both crushed on each other hard. he was a really sweet, shy guy, and i was head over heels for him. things were great at first, it was just awkward because it was both of our ""first"" relationship (he lied to me about not having any previous relationships). things eventually got bad, he was jealous, clingy, borderline obsessive. he sexually assaulted and emotionally manipulated me (he said it was unintentional and he was insecure, which i tried, and still am trying, to understand and forgive but it's pretty difficult).

i still talk to him, trying to put it behind us. we're friends, and we've had serious talks about what happened--i think he's genuinely trying to change? i've been willing and trying to help him out, but i haven't been relying on him. i don't trust him.

anyway, i told a guy friend about this, and he got really worked up about this, then researched laws, telling me about statutory rape (it could be considered that in my state, but i don't know...my ex was off the hook because he had a lot of stuff he was dealing with). he said he'd be willing to testify in court, and wanted my ex punished to the full extent of the law. he also asked me if i said yes, implying that that automatically meant consent (i was coerced), and scolded me for not responding to him (the call glitched on my side). his reaction was honestly really disheartening. i tried to shrug it off since he's just kind of that kind of person?

well, he told me i HAD to tell someone, be it an adult or just anyone who can help, or else he'd tell another one of our friends and cause havoc around school. so, she had to tell him not to and he argued with her. i tried to shrug this off, too. we were never really close, and during the school year he did really weird, questionable things. he latched onto one of his crushes, a little obsessive, and then dated some other girl because his crush told him to. i used to have a little crush on him, but after all that, i quickly lost it. like...what?

about a week or two after i told him, he confessed to liking me. apparently he also ""liked"" me back back then, while he still had a crush on another girl. i asked him to give me time to process it (especially after what happened with my ex), and he was okay with it. the thing is, i'm pretty sure he doesn't actually like me. he probably just wants a relationship? i'm not too sure. high schoolers.

recently, he joined a sexual assault support group. it's not bad, but i just feel really weird...? it feels like he took what happened really personally, and after i told him he added me to his close friends on instagram. we really weren't ever that close... he's been really involved and active about speaking up about consent, sexual assault, etc. it's a good thing--i think his intentions are good--but i can't help but feel uncomfortable.

he mentioned that he had a masturbation addiction (dudes, i don't think it was? i know it's not my place to dictate whether or not it was, but i think he's just a horny teenager...) and wanted to quit masturbating because i was ""sexually harassed."" that was an understatement of what happened to me, and i don't know why i'm so upset about it.

recently he brought up a project he was working on with a group, advocating against victim blaming (apparently a play on words regarding ""they asked for it,"" using ""i ask for it"" instead). i told him my opinion on it (i personally didn't like it, and thought that it could send mixed messages, though the intent is good), he told the person who came up with it, and he got kind of defensive when i told him more about what i thought? he kind of treated me like i'm stupid (he's getting his driver's license, and got into an argument with his dad because he didn't take a right turn at a red light, though it was permitted. his dad told him to think about the people that were waiting behind him, but he responded with ""if they're behind me, they should be willing to wait."" i thought it was a little selfish and i talked to him about it, especially about respecting others on the road, but he dismissed it). i just don't think he takes me seriously.

i know the simple answer is confront him, communicate, or break off the friendship. i've been distancing from him, but i don't know. i also feel like, maybe i'm wrong? maybe i shouldn't feel this way? i feel like he's treating me like a damaged good sometimes, like a ""broken"" person who needs someone else to heal. (he also low-key acts like a stereotypical anime protagonist. weird) he alsoo turns a lot of conversations into ones about himself.

* tl;dr i had an abusive ex, told a guy friend about what happened and i feel like he's acting like what happened to me happened to him. we were never close. he's a little conceited, but i'm trying to vibe with it. he's an okay guy overall, but just treats me weird, too. i don't know what to do with him.

overall, i want to know what anyone thinks about this, and what i should do. i talked to a friend, my ex, and my mom about it, and they all agreed it seemed a little weird. i want to hear from outside perspectives, since they may have been biased towards me, and some advice. thanks for reading",06Aug2020,1

I just reached a substantial amount of goals and now I just see my newer goals and think 'okay I'll be ready then' and the cycle continues

So basically, what do you think I can do to stop freezing up all the time? How can I stop feeling like I'm not enough for anyone?",06Aug2020,1
263,"About a year and a half ago my parents divorced after being together 16 years. My mom got remarried about 5 months later to a guy she had only met a few months prior. 

At this point they have been together like 10 months i would say. Tonight my the guy she married and her got in a big argument and he snapped and slammed her on the couch and started choking her and she could have very well died. He then left the house and drove away.  

The cops were called everything is as fine as can be for now. They havent found him yet but my mom is staying with a friend. 

I dont live with my mom but i go over there every other week or so and just the thought of him doing that and the thought that she could be dead is fucking with me. Obviously she is going through a lot more than me but I just dont know how I should be reacting to this its all so crazy.",06Aug2020,1
264,"This may sound stupid and like a small problem but.. here we are.

I would like to move houses. I am currently renting a place. I've been here for about 1.5 years.

My landlord is great, he always fixes problems right away. I don't have any sort of friendship with him or anything like that, he's just a good landlord that I can depend on for all his landlord duties.

But I want to move because there are some different things I want that I can't have at this property. I don't *need* to move but I feel I've outgrown this place and area, and have different wants and needs.

But one of the major things stopping me is feeling guilty. Mainly:

* Because my landlord is a good landlord, I feel like I'm doing something bad, betraying him
* I am afraid that because of covid, he might struggle to rent the house again and it will be all my fault, and I might cause him financial issues (although in saying that, I don't know his financial situation)

How can I remove this feeling of guilt and just do what I want to do ?",06Aug2020,1

266,"I am a 26-year-old South Asian male, living in the United States since December of 2019. My biggest problem is that I don't know what I want to do in life. I have several interests such as photo editing, graphic designing, and video editing. But I can’t say that any of them are my ‘passion’, for lack of a better term. I don't seem to have a 'passion' that I can endlessly pursue. I’ve always been told that I have a knack for writing and I sort of feel like it comes to me effortlessly. So, last year when I wasn’t getting many calls from the jobs I'd applied to, I joined a freelance writing firm in my country and have gathered about a year of content writing experience. In late September, I worked for an Australian tech firm, working on their written content. I lost that remote job in April due to COVID and have been living on unemployment benefits ever since.  Having said that, I have severe social anxiety that makes me extremely nervous about going for interviews. I fear people and being new to the country only intensifies that fear.  I feel like it’s been one of the greatest obstacles in me securing a job because I don't think I'm dumb or emotionally unintelligent. I see some of my college friends who have stable jobs and some are even getting married. They look so happy and content in their pictures. It makes me feel like I’m inadequate and trailing behind in life, living through a miserable existence. If only I knew what I truly wanted to pursue as a career I would be so much more fulfilled. Has anybody ever faced a situation quite like mine? Where they had no clue as to what they want to do in life? Is there any way I can identify what kind of career will fulfill or suit me?

Does a phd in ob makes me a behavioral scientist and thus carry weight for me to get a job in AI for top companies as a principle data scientist?

270,"Hey guys, I’m M20 and my girlfriend is also M20. We live together while studying for college and have been together for more than a year. Almost a year and a half. 

Throughout the relationship she has been the ‘dominant’ one and would point out my tinniest of mistakes and get upset over them and what not. She expects me to do every single thing she wants the way she wants and expects me to just know it (without any form of communication). 

(Background on what the matter is and why I need help) My mother is a nymphomaniac and did a lot of stuff that caused my family to almost break apart. It caused us emotional and physical trauma and hence the one thing I hate are secrets. We were once working on my girlfriends laptop and in a new tab i don’t what I typed something pretty graphic (porn) came up in suggested. My mood immediately switched and I got pretty upset. My girlfriend assured me that it was nothing and that it was something her friend typed just for shits and giggles. Tonight we both just kinda slept early without planning on it. I woke up to turn the alarm on her phone on and unlocked the phone to see several tabs of abuse and graphic porn on her phone. The moment I saw this I just went numb, but I did take screenshots of everything and her dm’s that she’s muted. The dm’s are nothing too much it’s just that most of the guys are muted which is suspicious but there is no proper conversation. Just one sided random texts or hearts on her stories from the other person. 

I know this post is not even properly structured but I am too numb to think of anything right now. I know that I love her even though I’ve seen these major red flags. I could have woken her up right now and fought but I didn’t want to ruin her sleep or my night. Can someone please tell me what to do. I just need help. Thanks!",06Aug2020,1

So it ends up lasting us  2-3 weeks for 2 24 packs. He says that we drink it all so quickly that he doesn't want to buy anymore and that soda is cheaper. While it is only because we can't stand drinking so much of it. My dad hasn't bought me a case of water in a long time. I know it isn't healthy but I swear this sucks. And we have the money to buy more. He claims it is also more convenient to them as well since he prefers soda.

273,"Hello guys. I don't want to make you sad too, but I just feel like sharing this to someone. I'm 20 years old and yesterday I experienced my first loss. It was my first encounter with death. My grandma is gone forever now. I know that it is better that she's gone, because she was very old and sick and she didn't live a very good life. She had alzheimer's, which is a really cruel condition to have. Some months ago, when she could still talk, she sometimes said that she wanted to die, so I know that she, as well, didn't want to suffer anymore in this cruel world. Now that she's gone, even though I wasn't very close to her and sometimes I would get pissed at her, I remember all the good memories of me and her. It was the little things: when I went out, she would always tell me to be safe and come back early. I know she loved me a lot. But now, when I wake up, she's not there and it makes me sad. I just hope that she could forget all the times when I got mad at her or things likr that. And I hope that she will live a good life in heaven. 

In 5 days, I am supposed to go on a holiday with some college friends and I was looking forward to this for a long time. But now, I think that I would feel bad if I had fun or drank alcohol after what happend with my grandma. I don't want to be disrespectful to her but I also need to go on that holiday. If I don't go, then nobody can go because I am the driver. And I was also the organizer. I don't know what to do.

276,"So my roommates and I signed for an apartment so we could all have our own rooms. We were all very excited about this but two weeks ago we discovered there are room size discrepancies. The smallest is 115 square feet and the others are all around 150-200 square feet. We had kind of talked about how the person with a queen bed and pet would just make sense to be in a bigger room. But now one of the others thinks we should split the rent based off of room size but now no one wants a big room if that’s the case :,) we are poor college students lol. 

We are sort of conflicted because the majority thinks since we entered into it not knowing the drastic room size differences (didn’t get to tour our actual unit) that it would be reasonable to just set it up based on who has the most stuff/has pets. We are all good friends so three of us really thought this would be a good plan where everyone would be physically confortable considering their lifestyle and all of the stuff they would be bringing. But the one who has the least stuff and would therefore end up with the smallest space does not like this plan (understandably so). The one frustrating part is she was the one who was stubborn about moving and was fighting to stay at our old place where she shared her 115 square foot bedroom with another person but now is unwilling to have a 115 square foot bedroom that is solely her own....

     I enjoy other people being happy. Friends, family, even strangers. I love watching them enjoy their lives and live their dreams. Seeing it swells my mood. But I don't feel the same way about myself.

     I want to be like them. I want to be successful, to write my dream book and become an author. To find a boyfriend and become a husband. I want nothing more than to experience what they feel. But I have no motivation. I never felt pressured to DO anything with my life. Becoming an author is my dream, but I sometimes feel like I could never accomplish that.

     I want to be honest with myself. In the state I feel I'm in, should I really try to find a boyfriend? I have no job, no car. I don't want to feel like a burden. I've never had anyone to talk to, really. I'm afraid I'd scare them off if I opened up to them. And I just feel so distant from my own life. Days spent doing nothing, hate myself for being lazy and then doing it all again the next day. Like I'm trapped in this loop.

     Sometimes I wish my life was like a fanfiction. I could just write in a perfect boyfriend who understands me and supports me, and I could make a manuscript and write a book and live happily ever after. It's just so frustrating to feel so powerless, so unable to change my life for the better.

     Look, I realize that I have my whole life ahead of me. And I'm.....scared. And I know it sounds stupid. I just need someone to understand me. I wouldn't, I couldn't do that to my friends. What if I push them away?

282,"I'm bad at explaining stuff but here I go

I don't want to think that I do but the more I look at it the more it kinda seems true. I am 18m, still living at home. I'm studying for my GED, so I'm home almost 24/7. 

I have depression and anxiety, sprinkled in with PTSD. I remember always picking and scratching at my skin, I did this stuff in kindergarten and it still stuck with me.

The first time I realized I felt depressed, I doodled my emotions. A girl with broken skin, stitched up eyes, staring to the sky saying a goodbye. I didnt hide it. But my mom asked about it, asking if I was okay. Me being 9 at the time, said I was fine.

Until middle school, I learned what depression was first hand. Anxiety was a constant struggle with me. Didn't help that I was bullied, about my feminine look and voice. I couldn't be myself.

And my mom noticed. My teachers said I was the quiet one, and my mom didnt understand that. Until I texted a friend after a rough day. ""I think I'm depressed, I always want cuts on my arms and legs.""

My mom saw it through her parental settings.

Before all of that I was really close to my mom. I wasn't really close to my dad, he was always stone cold. I later learned he still had army mode on.

But my mom confronted me, with a cigarette in her hand. We talked, and she thought to keep an eye on me. SOLs for 6th grade, right at the end of it I needed to use the bathroom. I had a bad reaction to the school lunch, I was in there for 20-ish minutes. My security officer came in and asked me to get out if I can. I washed my hands, walked out. To my counselor holding my artbook. Of all these mangled and gorey pictures.

I had my first hospitalization. And that was when the roles switch. My dad was my safety net, my mom got angry easily. The first 3 years of it was hell. I still remember the screaming and yelling.

""JUST GET OVER IT""
""WHAT'S THE GODDAMN PROBLEM?GROW UP""
""YOU BITCH""
""YOU ARE SUCH A MANIPULATOR""
""YOU ARE TOYING WITH EVERYONE""
""YOU REALLY FUCKED UP"" 
""JUST TRY""
""YOU DO NOTHING""
""WE ARE A BROKEN FAMILY""

Plus a couple of nights where she would just scream and pound the wall

All said by my mother, there is probably more and I just blocked it out. The most recent one was my mom reacting to me having weed. Asking where did she go wrong. I had the worst panic attack ever during that conversation. 

I don't hate my mother. I just don't like feeling like I'm walking on eggshells around her. When she blows up she wants you to hear it. I've been woken up by her yelling and banging on my door. Just to have a talk about how ""we"" are not doing anything around the house.

I don't want to be here anymore, I can't talk to her without feeling tense.

286,"Long story short, I have an IPhone 5s for about 6 years.

Last year in July, I got my first repair for it because the charging dock was damaged. Not only that, I even changed the battery as well which charged me extra. Please note that it was a third party.

Everything is fine until around the late-October, something wrong with it as the screen keeps flickering. It turns out that the battery was swollen.

So, I brought a new IPhone 7 but it still kept the IPhone 5s. The 5s still works until around early November, it stopped working anymore.

I always check my damaged IPhone 5s until March where my online class starts due to the COVID 19, I check it and found out that the left side of the screen popped up not so much.

However, I still kept it because I still have some data in it. It was currently placed in a huge plastic container with other of my family’s stuff.

So right now, I’m planning to get my IPhone 5s repaired very soon as possible.

Unfortunately, there are few reasons about it.

1. I’m Autistic and I can’t go outside unless I have a guidance with me. Because, my mom was very worried that go somewhere far or doesn’t know the direction.

2. It’s currently summer as outside was still hot. I need to put some small cool container in order to prevent the damaged phone from the heat.

3. Usually when I want something, I sometimes ask my mom’s permission first. But, I don’t know if I can ask her about the phone repair.

So, please. I need tips where I can get prepared so I can start getting my IPhone repaired very soon.

296,"Hi Reddit, I work for a company part time, taking on individual projects when they need extra help. I previously worked for them full time until I moved and now work remotely. I’m paid per item that I complete, and I’ve always been paid the same amount. I guess when I was transitioning from full to part time, they changed up the pay scale so that instead of 1 base rate per item, they now pay depending on what it is. Some items take longer to complete, so the pay is more, and some items are quicker to complete, so the pay is less. (Being intentionally vague sorry). They never informed me of these changes, and since I started back up again part time, they’ve been paying me the original rate. (About 4 months now)

I’m a highly skilled professional and have been doing this for a long time and therefore have gotten extremely good at it and can make quite a bit per hour. I’m currently 75% through a project and they just sent an email saying that they forgot to let me know they changed the pay scale, so please use this new spreadsheet to track your work. I went and compared the two and my pay for this project will be cut almost in half. Unfortunately since I now work remotely, all the projects I’m working on are the ones that take less time, and are paid less. 

I responded and said it’s unfair to give me a project under the assumption I’d be getting paid x amount, and then change it in the middle and by such a drastic amount. They responded with “I definitely see what you mean, we will talk about it and come up with something fair.”

I think they will come back and try to give me something in between, which is utter bullshit. The only “fair” thing would be for them to pay me the original rate for this project, am I right? It’s sucks because if I push to get the amount I earned, I have a feeling it will be the end of the job and they won’t have me do any more work for them because they can pay someone else less.

297,"Hi there, NSW Sydneysider here.  


Long story short. My single parent forgot to pay back three months worth of mortgage payments and was on the verge of eviction. They convinced me to fake a home loan application with a lender from a major bank that may or may not have known that I was lying (probably did). Papers and documents about my financial and employment history were forged and faked and I went along with all of it. I just simply did not want my family to become homeless. I didn't have a job back then and was studying. Now I have a really good paying and full time job in my dream career.

This afternoon I received a phone call from my parent saying they received a phone call about how she was able to afford a home loan while she was on Centrelink benefits (We are a very poor family and this person was raising 3 children on their own after my other parent succumbed to cancer). I'm worried that soon I will be questioned next. I am not a ""good liar"". 

I have felt awful for the longest time for doing this and have contemplated ending myself. I can't confide in anyone because I know this is taboo and illegal. I'm not sure what I will face. Jail time, a criminal conviction, a hefty fine, loss of that home. Maybe... possibly all of it.

This is the first time I've ever told anyone. I recently adopted a puppy and now I'm worried I'll have to him give away because I'm not in the right state of mind right now.

300,"This post got removed from the relationships subreddit. I just want some advice. 
So I’ve been dating my bf for 3 years now. He was my high school crush and I was absolutely obsessed with him. Toward the beginning of our relationship, there were two instances of physical abuse and one instance of sexual abuse, which we never addressed at the time. I just let it go. The first time, we were arguing and he choked me. I immediately asked him why he put his hands on me and he tried to justify it. I let it go. The second time, we were arguing and I was laying down on his bed with him sitting next to me. He punched me in the shoulder, close fisted, full force. It knocked the breath out of me. I was shocked by the pain. At first he didn’t care, but then he started crying talking about horrible he felt. The sexual assault happed before we started dating, we started having sex long before we dated. We were having sex in the back of his car, and he was hitting my cervix (super painful) so I asked him to please stop. He continued so I asked him again, and he said “you’re doing this for me” and continued. I asked him to please stop several times. I didn’t address that at all. I didn’t even accept that it was a sexual assault until recently. I’ve been reflecting on these events and decided to address the physical abuse with him. It really, really, really upset him when I did and he begged my forgiveness. I didn’t bring up the sexual assault because I was worried about how he’d react. Does anyone have any advice on how to even bring it up? I want to address it with him to get it off my chest. Thank you for reading!!! It really means a lot!!!",06Aug2020,1
301,"As said in the title, im a freshman and i got into every advance classes my school offered (science, math, and english). I am pretty happy about math and science, but english somehow worries me. I don’t want to use my extra time for english, something I am not very passionate about but can handle. I recently got into drawing and would like to learn more about it than participate in a advanced class of english (mostly writing).

however, I find it wasteful to refuse such a good opportunity to further improve my english. The course content includes a spoken word performance, publishing anthology of short stories, mini-literary criticism essays, and persuasive speech (web conference). These are something i’m not fond of, but I kind of feel bad refusing something only the overall top 35 of my batch got into. should I unenroll (partake in the normal subject) and use my time to pursue hobbies like drawing or join the class despite having not so much interest with the topics but have the opportunity to hone my writing/public speaking skills.

TL;DR = not a fan of english writing yet somehow got into an advanced class, unenroll and continue doing things i like or suck it up and learn to improve english writing.",06Aug2020,1
302,"I (30f) am very very good friends with my coworker (33f), and have been for over a year and a half.

Yesterday she learned her mom tried to commit s*icide. As of last night, she’s in the ICU but stable.

I want to be there for her, especially since her relationship with her mom is not great. I imagine she must have so many conflicting emotions about it. But I don’t want to come across as a nuisance.

I texted her a few times last night and of course she was super slow to respond but seemed very appreciative of me offering my support. I texted her once today to see if she needed anything, and she said she was ok.

I want to check in with her again to see how she and her mom are doing, but absolutely don’t want to be a bother. We had previously made plans to hang out on Friday... should I ask to see if she wants to cancel, or should I just assume we aren’t hanging out and not bother her with that question? I’d be happy to hang out with her to be a sounding board but don’t want to impose.

Is there proper etiquette here? How much support/checking in is too much?",06Aug2020,1

We were at a pit stop where a McDonald's was located. when it came time  to leave I felt anxiety roaring in my stomach  . Instead of putting it in reverse my grandma went forward. Now the pit stop where we were at was next to a rail road which had a gated fence surrounding it.  When my grandmother went forward all I heard was a big BOOM!!! From the impact. my mom cracks her cranium because she wasn't buckled up. My shoulder gets disjointed and dislocated while my sister hand gets broken. My brother has internal bleeding while my grandma doesn't have any injuries.  My sister's two kids who are girls were affected by the crash differently.

I would break down in fear. 
For years I'd see black shadows moving in the corner of my eye. I hear things crashing in our attic (that has a bed and couch, people can stay up there).

i’m diagnosed with bipolar disorder and adhd if that makes any difference, and i’ve grown up with a single mother whom i’ve had an extremely turbulent &amp; intense relationship with. also i had severe separation anxiety from a young age with her. my father left when i was about 1 year old.

310,"I was about 6 paragraphs in and not even passed the half way point so imma cut it down to a few sentences. My friend alex gets in a relationship that we realize only a few months is really a one sided open relationship where his girlfriend sophie is sleeping around and stringing him along. We talk to alex about how this isnt emotionally healthy for him, sophie gets upset about it and leaves him thinking we're trying to turn him against her. Alex gets suicidal. They get back together a few days later in a closed relationship. We realize that she is extremely manipulative, and clearly mentally taxing for alex   so we talk to him again about it. She gets upset about it again but instead of flipping out on alex, she flips out on us for saying things about her. Later another friend of mine, andrew, talks to him face to face at his house alone about this, but before he gets there, sophie makes alex call her on speaker so she can hear everything that they talk about.


Andrew goes on and on about how unhealthy she is for him all while sophie is listening. And from then on sophie did not let alex hang out with andrew unless she was there too, which would never happen because she already disliked him before so she would never hang out with him willingly. Later that week we all agree to not hang out with sophie in return until alex can convince her to calm down. But this becomes a problem because she is very stubborn so she wont listen to advice  and at this point in time alex has become inseparable from sophie so if we hang out with him she will always follow. Skip a few weeks and my girlfriend goes out with them again, mainly because a friend of sophie wanted to talk to her because she liked one of the guys in our group, and from what she could see soph hadn't changed at all, even talking mad shit about andrew while they were out. Skip a few more weeks weeks and we hang out with him again without andrew to see if anything has changed. Much to our disappointment that they had gotten engaged and nothing has changed and instead she had gotten even worse in the manipulative department, like saying something along the lines. But I decide to let it go. Now to how he breaks up with our friend group. A while before he and sophie were dating, sophie and my current girlfriend had a romantic thing together, and were convinced that they would get married in the future. While we were hanging out, a conversation between me and alex about proposals on camera even if they are a joke legally making you engaged reminds my girlfriend liz about how she had a plan for sophie back when they had a thing.


She tells sophie this old plan in secret and we carry on with the day. Once liz is dropped off, sophie felt the need to show alex, who then flipped out because sophie forgot to mention that this something from her past so he thought that my girlfriend wanted to get with sophie and that argue for about 20 minutes outside of the car. While we are getting food alex turns to me saying that I'm getting played and that I should go back to my ex. Later I go home and text him about what that was about and he shows me the text liz had sent sophie about her old plan for proposal. I tell him that she was clearly talking about when they liked eachother in the messages before, alex refuses to listen to me saying something along ""nah dude that was sent today."" And a few other things about liz being a whore and that I'm getting played. I then get mad and go off on him about how he should be the last person talking about getting played and that liz would never want to get with her now since we all thing she's a bitch. Then he says he was sorry that our friendship had to end because I cant see I'm being played and that I'm going to be one of the only guys he's gonna miss. Later I hear from everyone else in the group that he's done and no longer friends, even saying to my friend abdel, who was mostly uninvolved in most if this something like, ""I'm sorry, you're on the wrong side of things so we cant be friends""

Couple of notes:


But that's the thing, he's so madly in love with her that he refuses to listen to us when we tell him this


It's weird because before she showed up alex was the most ""bros before hoes"" person you would have ever met

311,"Discord: Eddie-Gluskin#1577

I know, it's weird that I started this with my Discord tag and such, but it'll help me to verbally talk this out with someone to get help. I need advice on a number of things and just don't have the energy to do so. So I'm just going to make a numbered list with what the issue is and some backstory.

1. My body
- I'm not insecure or self deprecating physically. I'm happy with myself, but I want to begin working out to improve my overall health. I eat junk and that's all I can say, I can't mention the strawberry I ate a week ago or that one time I had a salad. I just eat absolutely unhealthy junk, drink too much soda, and can't really control my diet all too well. 

2. My mind: Education
- I feel insanely stupid despite being a 17yr old, high school senior in Honors and AP classes. I feel as though I can type/write easily, but anything verbal makes me struggle, so I feel that online school will be good and bad for me. 

3. My mind: State
- I recently got out of a somewhat mentally abusive relationship that's left me confused about myself. I'm already in another relationship (I know, I move quick) with a girl that I've liked for 3 years, but she's in a rough patch and I can't keep myself from thinking that she hates me. She lets me know that she doesn't and that she's liked me for 3 years too and that isn't going away, but my last relationship has left me hating myself mentally. I feel that I can't be enough and that I'm not going to be what anyone wants in the future.

4: My parents
- My mom is controlling and my dad is hard on me. My mom expects me to never go on a walk and never have a relationship without letting her inspect the other person and criticize them. She tells family members that I'm gay constantly saying that one of her 5 kids (She only had 2, the other 3 are my half brothers) are bound to be gay and it has to be me. She also has called me fat for no reason, despite the fact that I'm most likely under weight and she's fucking ""5'4"" and like 240 pounds. My dad likes to expect me to tough out everything no matter what. I have constant back pains (Scoliosis, diagnosed), I lack motivation, and I can barely lift a fucking Pigeon. He also interrupts me every time I try to defend myself and insults me, then laughs at me when I try to confront him. 

5. More
- There's many more things that I just can't type right now, I can barely think straight right now. It's 2am and I'm tired. 

Any and all advice is appreciated, I need the help.",06Aug2020,1

317,"I'm 28, I live with my parents, they constantly abuse me psychologically without realising.

I found one job and worked for a year, I had the pressure from the start to come back home. At some point it was stressful, I needed support, but the only thing I got was the same belittling and ""come back home"".

I wake up in the morning eat 3 biscuits and made an instant coffee. The water boils in less than 2 minutes.

I'm sure my breakfast takes 5 to 10 minutes max.

Today my father casually ranted that it was taking too long everyday.

I could try and give other examples of the abuse. If I don't give news to my parents they call the cops or firemen to knock on my door saying that I kill my self or I'm in danger. My mother casually said one day ""yes, this is harassment, so what?""

My mother has bipolar and do not realise that she is insane, she thinks she acts out of love. I'm 28, entry jobs in fast food joint don't want to hire me, supermarkets either, but she thinks I could easily become a lawyer.

My father has not been diagnosed or does not want to disclose it as he avoids psychiatrist. He is supposed to see one soon but just to say that he is depressed. He always gets angry at everything.

By telling more about the life at home I have gotten the usual ""get a job and leave"", finding a job proving impossible and leaving meaning I have to get some kind of restraining order from my own parents... The other thing I have gotten is some kind of ""no wonder you are so damaged"" and one day some kind of half sarcastic ""sounds like when they talk about the damaged homes of serial killers"".

They genuinely think they love me and do no wrong.

Other examples of communication have me saying ""no"" and being asked for years if I still want something I refuse all the time, me saying I like something one way and still being asked if it's the case but it's not going to happen.

The other day my father asked if I wanted something on the groceries website, biscuits, I said ""no"", I had to answer multiples questions. Then he got angry, the conclusion of his 10 minutes rant was ""If I ask 'do you want biscuits' just say 'no' end of story. That is exactly what happened from the get go but I had a 10 minutes diatribe on how I'm fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

I have issues communicating, I refuse to communicate with people that won't let me have an opinion, that always go for the anxiety, that ignore what I say, and only want what they want.

They do not treat me as an individual and refuse to see when I'm right.

The other day there was something with the bank, I'm a making a sane safe choice, I should go harder I have no risk at all, and yet they started talking like my choice was already too dangerous and stupid.

These people that have never been good with money.

They also took away an emergency option for me to access their account because they are afraid I would steal everything and leave. They say ""do like his sister"". Afaik my sister did not take any money, she threatened to get restraining order and cut all ties, she got independent and they don't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

They feed me, there is a roof, I should be grateful. I have tried living on my own and because of my own issues it was not working out. Now I realise I should have had my meltdown on my own rather than come here in the ""comfort"" of the constant craziness and casual psychological abuse.

My father is in a wheelchair, he can only access the toilet of the bathroom. I ask him before every shower if he needs them. He says, in a very peaceful and calm way ""do not ask me, I'll find an alternative"". The truth is, your 5 minutes shower will at some point be interrupted because he needs the toilets, which I can understand, this will be met with a ton of rage. He will barely apologise afterwards not realising how mean and nasty his verbal abuse is. He acts like a lamb and ""I do not bother"" but he has no idea how hard his abuse can be.",06Aug2020,1
318,"So I've (F17) been getting catcalled and weird advances from older guys ever since I was 11 in 6th grade and I just don't get it. I used to have to walk home past corner stores and gas stations and their be these weird men saying inappropriate things about my body and stuff even when I was skinny young girl. Now of course my body has changed but I don't understand it..? One time I was even followed home. I never told anyone because it was a long time ago and thought no one care. But something recently happened that really bothered me. 

2 days ago it was my 17th birthday and I was out with my Grandma and my sister. We both stopped at Walmart first because she said she wanted us to get some jeans and other stuff.(yes,i buy jeans at Walmart proudly).So I went to the jeans section and my grandma wasn't too far away from me. I was looking through the jeans and i found a pair I liked.. But it wasn't in my size. So I'm trying to find another pair but something feels off, like I was being watched. I look to my right and there's a man just standing at the end of the women's jeans aisle staring. I didn't know what to do, I got scared and I just froze and that's when he approached me. I don't remember exactly what he said but it was something along the lines of ""Now you know those jeans aren't gonna fit that "" then he pointed at my butt. I didn't understand what he said at first or what he was pointing at me for so I said ""What? "" but he didn't say anything. Instead he just walked past me smiling really creepily. 

My grandma asked me what he said but I didn't wanna repeat it, I just said that he was being creepy. So we continued shopping in and around that section for a shirt but this time I'm being aware of my surroundings. I kept noticing the same man just lingering around the aisle staring at me and that made me even more uncomfortable. He wasn't even shopping or picking up anything he was just walking around  staring at me and smiling like he was waiting till my grandma and sister left so he could get me alone. I wanted to confront him and say something but I was scared for my safety. I saw this news story a while back about this girl who was raped and killed for ignoring this man's catcalls. I gave him a mean glare and eventually he took the hint I guess because he went to the check out line and left the the store. 

I don't know what I did. My outfit wasn't inappropriate. It was just some high waisted skinny jeans and a long sleeve shirt. Can someone tell me what I did wrong? That was the one day I dressed nice instead of wearing baggy clothes.How can I not let things like this bother me because it kinda ruined my birthday :( I know it's a stupid thing to be bothered about but please don't judge me, I just want some advice",06Aug2020,1

321,"So I have a half sister I’ve grown up with my whole life. We were adopted by our grandparents when we were 6 and 7 years old. Our birth mom was a drug addict who wouldn’t stop using paraphernalia or drinking. My birth father disappeared years ago and my half sisters father is in jail. So our life started out somewhat traumatic, I guess you could say.

Growing up many incidents occurred that proved to me my sister absolutely hated me and didn’t want me around. I told my parents about it over the years but my mom would tell me it never happened, that it was a dream. My father worked a lot to provide for us so he wasn’t around when the incidents occurred. I have a pretty good memory and I have photogenic memory so I remember these incidents vividly. I’m on here to talk about them as I have no one who will listen anymore besides my boyfriend, also my father passed 4 years ago and he believed me about everything.

When I was 5 years old I was home sick laying in bed trying to fall asleep with a slight fever and stuffed nose. I couldn’t breathe very well so I had to sleep with my mouth open to get enough air. My sister and I shared a room down the hall from my parents room. She came in and grabbed her pillow from her bed and began to smother me with it. I was a very small and weak kid growing up and she was strong for her age so I couldn’t get out from under her.

It felt like forever that the pillow was over my face but it was only a minute or two. I began to feel like I was suffocating and that I was going to pass out. My mother eventually got curious as to why we were being so quiet and she came in and saw what she was doing. She got her off me and I began to cry and struggle to breathe. I couldn’t sleep around her after that.

When I was 6 years old I was celebrating my birthday by playing a game on the console our parents bought. My parents told me I had the console for a few hours to myself and that my sister would have to wait. My sister didn’t like that and decided it was her responsibility to make sure I knew she was angry. She came into our room and smacked me across the face and knocked me off the stool I was sitting on. I had a large bump on the back of my head and a headache that lasted for days.

When I was 9 years old, on Christmas Eve my parents told us to decide on a movie together to watch before bed. My sister chose a movie I didn’t want to watch so we started arguing about it. She got tired of arguing with me and punched me in the nose making me bleed. I was shocked that she hit me but my mom heard the hit and came in and looked at me with shock as well. She was disciplined with a stern talking to but nothing more as she is autistic and didn’t listen to what people said to her.
 
When I was 10 years old I was going through a weird depressive episode and began to gain weight. My sister bullied me persistently about it and would tell kids at school to pick on me. It hurt my feelings and I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror anymore. Who would guess it too that a year later when I was 11 I would be diagnosed with depression and bipolar. I also got glasses when I was 10, a lot of name calling followed.

When I was 11 I went into my first year of middle school. My adult teeth couldn’t grow in as my baby teeth wouldn’t make room. I ended up getting braces that would be worn for 4 years. My sister would make fun of my smile and call me names. I was already self conscious but she made it worse.

When I was 12 years old in 6th grade I was being bullied by a group of girls I had been friends with in the past. My sister became friends with them and began to bully me at school. When my parents found out they told her she couldn’t be friends with them. She didn’t listen and the bullying got so bad I ended up trying to take my life and began self harming.

In 9th grade my dad had died and soon after things took a turn for the worse. My sister would get in trouble for all sorts of things and then blame it on me and got me in trouble a lot. I also ended up in the hospital due to my epilepsy, I got a lot of attention. My sister didn’t take kindly to that so she would run away and call children’s services and tell them my mom and I were beating her to get attention. We almost got taken away.

When I was 15-17 years old my sister caused chaos in our house. She would constantly call the police and lie to them and tell them my mom and I were beating her. The police proved she was lying but she kept calling. My sister ended up in the psychiatric units over 30 times for scratching her arms with dull blade knives, threatening end her life and my mom and I’s lives. She just wouldn’t stop.

A year ago we moved into a new home to get a fresh start from the nightmare life we had in the old house because of her. For a few months the incidents stopped but as of a few months ago they started right back up. My sister has gotten me arrested after we got into an altercation. She lied to the police saying I threatened to kill her and hurt her with a baseball bat and knife. She even got my mom arrested after falsifying a report saying my mom hit her.

A few days ago my sister began pretending she wasn’t feeling well and decided she wanted to go to the hospital. A close friend informed me that my sister had told her she was faking seizures at the hospital for attention. I became angry as my epilepsy has nearly killed me several times and she just thought it was okay to fake it. We got into a fight today and she called our aunt Jaclyn and told her my mom threw her out, she did not.

My aunt called my mother and began threatening her. I stepped in and told her where she could shove her opinions and thoughts and she began threatening my life. She said that this Saturday she would be coming to my house to physically assault me. I called the police and told them about the harassing phone calls and they told me to call them on Saturday if she shows up.

After 19 years of living with her I’ve had enough. She makes our lives a nightmare no matter where we go. She is autistic and has adhd but doctors have proved to us she knows right from wrong. I’m not sure what to do at this point as I can’t move out as I’m my mothers home health aide and I definitely can’t afford to live on my own. I just can’t stand to live with her any longer.
I’m just at a loss.

I love her I do but I can’t take this anymore. I know I can stay away from her but, she comes into my room at night and steals from me as I don’t have a lock on my door and I can’t install a new one on the old door. She’s constantly threatening me and not one doctor at the psychiatric units will admit her into a longer term facility. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice on how best to deal with this without breaking down every night feeling like I’ll never escape this. I refuse to leave my mom alone with her as she’s hit my mom before.",06Aug2020,1

323,"in my childhood, when I misbehave, my grandmother used to scare me with a puppet. She said it was real, and that of I kept misbehaving, the puppet was going to take me away. I was too young to doubt what she was telling me. I ended up traumatized, obsessed and with a severe phobia of puppets. 
Now im 25 years old (male) and many nights I wake up because I fell that the puppet is in my room. Sometimes I fell like I hear his footsteps nearby and I freeze.

327,"Hi all. Throw away account for obvious reasons 

I’m currently going into my second year of med school at a smaller private school. My class is about 100 students. As most med schools, it’s a 4 year program where you pretty much graduate with the people you entered with 

Over the summer my school did a zoom meeting with all the students in my class. During this meeting they introduced a new student entering our class. This was kinda odd bc it’s rare for someone to drop and then return. But hey it’s not unheard of. 

I won’t lie, I’m nosey, so I decided to see if I could find any social media for this guy. Couldn’t find him on fb or Instagram so I googled his name. It’s not a rare name but it’s spelling is unique so results for him came up fast. The first thing to pop up on google was an article from 2018 along the lines of “local mans house raided by police for possession of child porn.” I was shocked but I thought maybe it could be a coincidence, same name and area maybe? Nope. The article included his mug shot and it was 100% the same guy. 

Well I did some more digging and found that he was arrested and charged for possession of 600+ images of children under 12. I’m disgusted to say the least. 

He was charged and arrested in 2018 and he originally matriculated into my med school in 2016. So what I can only assume happened is he entered my school, completed his first year, got arrested during his second year and had to take a few years off, and now he’s back and entering into my class. 

I’m disgusted. I never want to see this mans face, yet he’s in my class. We have to work in groups for my curriculum and I don’t think I would be able to ever work with him no matter how nice he is. I’m also appalled at my school for allowing someone with those charges to enter. They constantly are teaching us about ethics and right vs wrong. And this feels very wrong.  Our field of medicine doesn’t directly involve children but children obviously come into the office. In addition, our school hosts many events for children to get them interested in medicine. I’m not saying this guy shouldn’t be around children but with his history and being so recent it just seems wrong. 


Is there anything I can do? On one hand I feel like I need to talk to faculty about this but at the same time I feel like it’s not my business and I should just keep it to myself. But I don’t know because I person who can commit such a terrible crime does not deserve to be practicing medicine. But I’m sure there’s laws with that allowing them to. I don’t know. How should I handle this? If at all?

328,"Okay so this is gonna be kind of long so I apologize. My sister and her boyfriend have been off and on since they were 15-16. They had to keep it a secret because they were not allowed to date at that age and she still isn’t allowed to date because our parents have a lot of problems with it and with this specific boy. Anyways her boyfriend and I have never really gotten along and he has said bad things about me years ago. This summer, I decided to try to make an effort to talk to him and get to know him more because I know it’s important to my sister. Right now they are going through some problems because she wants to be with him and he was unsure for a while and now he wants to prove to her he’s ready to be with her. I can tell they still fight a lot. He also has personal problems and he wants to work on himself and grow. My sister, a mutual friend of theirs, and I all recommended that he go to therapy so he can work through some of his problems. He is adamantly against it and says he’s ‘not crazy’ and thinks that’s what therapy is for when it’s not (he basically pushes all the stigmas around getting mental health help). A couple weeks back I had a sobbing breakdown over some stuff in my life. I felt like talking to my sister would help because she could understand some of the stuff I was going through better than my friends or parents. I didn’t want to open up to her because I knew she texts her boyfriend everything and I was like I don’t want him to know all my deep issues so I asked her to promise that she would keep it a secret. She promised she would keep it to herself. A couple of days ago, I used her laptop when she wasn’t home. I know this is really bad, but I opened her texts and searched for my name/references to me and she basically told her boyfriend word for word everything I told her about my problems. I feel betrayed (I know I betrayed her privacy but I had a gut feeling she betrayed my trust). Also, in the same conversation, I found texts from her boyfriend saying that I’m crazy and bipolar. I know I am not bipolar bc I know the signs and I found it offensive and harmful for him to throw around accusations and diagnoses like that. He also said she shouldn’t have gotten closer to me and said I’m bad for her. He is raising a lot of red flags to me and seems really toxic but my sister won’t listen to anyone who tells her to move on because she is so deeply in love with him and only him. I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s been eating away at me and I’m so angry at her all the time. I can’t even tell my mom about it because she doesn’t know that my sister is still with him but I usually tell my mom about everything else that hurts me.",06Aug2020,1

He recently moved out and lives with his friends who are all guys. I’ve known these guys for years, and they too have taken care of me and acted as brothers to me for as long as I’ve known them. I slept over at their house and my mom was fine with that until I told her that my boyfriend shares a room with two of our guy friends. She freaked out when I told her I stayed in that same room and she told me she didn’t want me sleeping over there anymore because they might drug and/or rape me. I told her to trust me when I say that they are good people. Plus, I’m with my boyfriend the whole time and I know he’d never let that happen to me. She then started crying about how sometimes she can’t sleep when I’m not sleeping at our house because she gets worried about whether or not I’m okay. I tried to tell her to trust me but she just got so angry and told me not to sleep over there and to not trust anyone—not even my boyfriend—because they might do something terrible to me. 

I understand that she’s worried, but I just want her to learn to trust me and my judgment. When I try to defend myself from her, she talks over me and doesn’t listen to anything I try to say.

This new job is as an assistant manager in a different field, slightly less pay but more hours so I end up earning more. I was not excited about it. There's also no benefits for staff and there is a lot of labour. 

I feel like i should be really grateful and go for the job but comparing them both side by side, my current one comes out better and the only downside is the lack of hours.

333,"Concern and dk who to talk to (young female)

Hi

I just recently got into selling my nudes on twitter and I think today I did something quite stupid. I messaged a man on twitter who wanted to buy nudes. First he told me to take a selfie with 3 fingers to prove I am real. I did. Than he sent me money for my first pic, which I sent. He asked me to send him another pic holding up three fingers to prove they’re not old photos and I obliged. I sent him a few more pics for money (all through cashapp). He insisted that I show my face in them all and I did not even question it.


I just checked my DM’s with him and he has completely deactivated. Thinking back, I shouldn’t have shown my face and put up those fingers bc I’m afraid he can take my photos and catfish as me, sell them, etc. I am only 19 years old and genuinely new to this. I was wondering if I should be concerned. Can anyone who has ever sold nudes online specifically let me know if it is normal to be asked to have ur face in the photos/hold up fingers etc. does this sound like fun of the mill and I am overthinking it? I just don’t think I took safety precautions and him deactivating a few hours after our conversation has me concerned. I am not sure if there are sites out there where people can post pictures of naked girls without their consent. 

Anyways, I didn’t know who to talk to about this and this was on my mind so that’s why I’m here. Sorry if this is naive or stupid or doesn’t fit into the subreddits guidelines. Thanks in advance for anyone’s advice xoxo",06Aug2020,1

A few weeks ago I started receiving phone calls from several different numbers, all saying similar things; They want me to kill myself, with an incredibly specific suicide note. Each call has an incredibly vague female or male voice, and sometimes they say slightly different things. I've since blocked these numbers, but more keep coming. I think I'm going crazy from it. On several occasions I've had these people show up in my dreams, and it's driving me mad.

These people claim to have significant power over me and I'm starting to believe this, it's taken over my entire life.

No matter what I say, they keep coming back. I know for a fact they're actually calling but the numbers usually go away after an hour or so.

343,"So, my whole life I've never quite fit in, I've been very misunderstood. I was always weird, but until my late teens, I was very kind.

I was very kind, but I got bullied and humiliated in front of people all the time. At school, at work. People just didn't like me. Maybe the combination of me being weird (which probably made me unlikable) and being nice (which made me an easy target.)

I even tried to fit in. I've always tried, but in Highschool I tried REALLY hard. Still, every part of me was picked apart. How I talked, how I walked, every single flaw in my looks from head to toe.


Thials even happened in public. I went to a New Year's gathering, and while everyone was saying ""Happy New Year's"" to each other, I tried and everyone ignored me. I even made tried with someone who had just congratulated someone else. I made eye contact, smiled and said ""Happy New Year's!"" And they looked at me for a second, but then sort of looked ahead of me to and ignored me. Not even their expression changed.

I noticed that all the people that bullied me and ignored me had friends. They would make a joke about me in front of the whole room, and everyone would laugh or just awkwardly stay quiet.

Well, by 18, I had become sick of this. So everytime someone tried to bully me at school, I bullied them back. I cursed them, called them fat, ugly, stupid pieces of shit, etc.

And guess what happened? I got in trouble with teachers, and people started calling me ""mean, rude, and a bitch.""

So, people can criticize me and pick me apart, to the point where I developed bipolar because I cried every night, and was just fucked with throughout the years.

When the ""bullies"" said shit to me, and treated me badly, people would laugh, and teachers would ignore it.

But when I started fighting back, I became the ""bad guy"" ""the bully"" and got scolded by the teachers.

Well now, I'm out of school. And I'm nice to everyone who's nice to me, and insult anyone who treats me like shit.

But again, when I defend myself by insulting them back, I'm ""rude, mean, sensitive, too angry"" etc. But the people who put me down are never in the wrong.

Because they're more ""likeable"" and probably because in all honesty they're more attractive. I look like shit.


So if I'm nice and let people walk all over me, hold in my feelings, and cry into my pillow at night I fail.

When I fight back, I fail.

346,"My friend, who I shall call Ryan, and I are currently rising juniors in the same university(very short commute). We have been friends since middle school, and we are both studying computer science. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory(Feel free to skip):

This past spring, Ryan and I had both landed our first internships at different companies. As this was our first entry into the working world in our field of study, we were extremely excited. Then Coronavirus hit. Companies had cancelled all summer internships. Our 4 months of paid work were gone. The blank spot on our resumes labeled ""Work experiences"" would remain so.

Personally, I was but merely inconvienced. Coronavirus is definitely not the end of the world. A summer of unproductively sitting at home, to me at least, is accommodable.

However, Ryan was hit harder. He is a sensitive guy, and a fellow introvert. In addition, unlike me, who could afford to both go to university AND dorm at said university, Ryan is..., in blunt terms, poor. His family is large, and thus, he has no income except for what he makes. This summer was meant to be a great way to earn money and earn experience. Right now, Ryan managed to earn a backup job through his cousin's startup, programming for the front-end.

&amp;#x200B;

Present-Day Issues:

In our talks together about his job, he is dismissive, but not angry. He touts his cousin's startup as ""not a real job"", as it primarily revolves around meetings and discord bots, and not actual coding. I have said that ""Still, its better than sitting at home doing nothing like I am."" I stated this in hopes of giving him a sense of purpose. 

In addition, in every conversation, I directly tell Ryan that I worry about him, and that other people worry about him. He always brushes it off.

He has recently started opening up about how he is getting depressed. He acknowledges that it is a medical issue, and that antidepressents and therapy are a known solution. However, he has stated that ""they just make you feel more normal"". In addition, due to his poverty, Ryan has told me that both of those options are restrictively expensive.

Due to his own bad habits and family issues, Ryan's sleep schedule is incomprehensible. He has stated that he gets around 3-13 hours of sleep per day. No, I did make a typo in that range. HE REGULARLY SLEEPS 3 THEN 13 HOURS per day, usually alternatively. In every talk, I tell him that this is extremely unhealthy, and in every response are ther words ""Yeah, I should really fix my sleep schedule"". I have pointed it out to his face that not only, but every other single friend of Ryan's has said this exact same thing. Still, he doesn't change, and I don't know how to sway him to.

Lastly, the topic of suicide has come up in conversation. However, in all mentions of this topic, it was used sarcastically by both Ryan and I as a joke. Still, even after each joke, I repeatedly say, ""Don't actually kill yourself"". I am not a psychologist, but I am certain based on our 12 years of friendship that our jokes on this topic are NOT a call for help. Even reading between the lines of the jokes, the tone of them NEVER suggest that Ryan would consider, nor follow through.

I can say with 99.9% certainty based on my entire knowledge of the human being that is Ryan that he will not end his own life.

However, 99.9% is not enough. If the 0.1% event occurs, I would never forgive myself. My life, and especially Ryan's life, would never be the same. Reddit, I ask for your advice. How do I help him?

&amp;#x200B;

My request for advice:

I tell my friend that he is cared about by many people, and that he has purpose in life, but he is still depressed. How can I help my friend feel more happy about his life, and prevent him from going down a dark path?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I can provide more details as necessary.

348,"So I have been on leave since mid-March due to a certain ongoing worldwide issue, and my boss recently called me and we agreed that I should come back on the 20th if August.

However, I really don't want to go back. This break has showed me just how much anxiety this job has caused me in the past (cashier for a certain large chain that starts with W and is coloured blue and yellow). 

I'm transitioning into University with scholarship and live with my parents so money is not currently an issue. I also understand that I can't just quit things because they cause me anxiety, but I really don't thing the super fast paced environment is healthy for me.

My dad told me to secure another job before I quit, but I'm getting my wisdom teeth removed a week before I'm due to return and can't interview until I've recovered (as companies favour those who can start work sooner). But I don't think I can stomach working a couple of days at current job while in the interview process.

How do I quit? This is my first job outside of summer jobs, and I've never had to quit before. Additionally, I'm on leave and have been for a while so I'm not sure if I should call now or later. I feel extremely guilty for quitting but I think it's in my best interest.

Can I get some tips and outsider opinions on this?",06Aug2020,1
349,"I have tried everything, no really.

Here are all the things I have tried:

Exercising daily, eating healthy, the 4-7-8 breathing technique, avoiding technology an hour (or more) before going to sleep, staying up all night and going to sleep earlier in the night the next day, melatonin, opening a window during the day to let in fresh air, setting alarms in the morning (to get into a routine), relaxing sounds (like white noise), meditation, and finally eliminating naps. 

The least effective ones were probably the relaxing sounds, breathing techniques, and I think melatonin literally had no effect on me (or if it did, it wore off really quickly).

I do not drink coffee, and I do not do drugs or alcohol.

350,"I’ve been contemplating shifting my thematic focus in my art, and I want to make it more personal as I progress in my art classes in college. I figured I could focus on things that I am either insecure about or things I notice I hide from other people, namely my emotions. I absolutely suck ass at being vulnerable, and I bottle all my feelings up constantly (I’m aware this isn’t the most healthy thing, I’m working on it) or just deflect by using humor or sarcasm. I was thinking this would lead to some more interesting and conceptually advanced art.

352,"So as we all know there is a crisis going on with the whole virus thing , anyways most of us are unemployed or have temporary jobs...these jobs are enough to survive but aren’t enough to pay the bills, I live in nyc where the city is already open and the court houses are also open , recently my landlord died from a heart attack and now the business went to his kids cause his wife is not stable enough to do this , anyways their kids want to sell the building...which sucks cause that means we have to obviously move and this can go really bad for the families that live in this building mine including. My mom used to be a chef but the restaurant that she worked as isn’t open yet, and I recently took a job at amazon working 4 days and 11 hours each week, basically this whole thing is on me cause I make more than my mom now cause she recently got this cleaning job that doesn’t even give hours. My sister was working at McDonald’s but for some reason they closed the restaurant down out of nowhere now she’s collecting unemployment but that won’t last for a long time it’ll end at the end of this month , so back to the selling the building thing if you put two and two together you know we won’t have enough to rent a new apartment, one they will be looking for good incoming which my mom don’t have atm. It’s hard to pay rent especially if the landlord wife is coming every week expecting the rent we owe , we already paid last months rent we do got this month rent but my mom is keeping it for a bit just in case something bad happens. So idk what to do I feel like they will sell the place soon cause the landlord wife does need money to pay her taxes , and obviously we’re not paying rent so it would be smart to sell the building therefore she could get her money that’s what I would do. So we’re a sinking ship we’re completely clueless on what’s gonna happen , I just hope the city temporarily band evictions so therefore we could make a savings acc and save up for a new apartment...worst part is there’s 5 of us me my mom my sis and my two brothers and nyc is hella expensive, idek what’s gonna happen at this point some advice would be great , thanks for reading.",06Aug2020,1

So. Yeah. For several months now.
I don't even know where to begin to be honest, so sorry if this is messy.
I've hang out with my friend Emma a lot and sometimes her sister Ashley also comes to hang out with us. It's fun, she's really nice and just a cool person all around.
I've been to their house a lot, we've all gone camping before, and my first time skinny dipping was with them. Sometimes me and Ashley text eachother to just talk, so objectively speaking she's just another one of my friends.
I couldn't tell you the exact moment I had feelings for Ashley, but eventually I did. Fuck.
I don't know what to do, I'm an awkward person, and having a crush on an adult, my best friend's SISTER, of all adults, fucking sucks because I know it's wrong and very weird but I really don't know what to do. 
Being a sexually frustrated teenager is sucky enough as it is, this is just the cherry on top.

356,"I've recently moved into a new place with my gf. her parents are staying with us for about a week. As a housewarming gift to us, they have been doing odd one-off housework. The house we bought is older so it could use touch ups. 

I'm grateful for their help and thoughtfulness but a part of me wishes they actually wouldn't. Its solely because of the situation im put in where if I don't show anything but gratitude, I come off as ungrateful and I risk hurting the relationship that I'd like to nurture with them. 

For instance, and this is just one example, they've painted a small room of ours and honestly I don't think it looks well done. there are stray flecks of paint on the floor, misses, imperfections - small but noticeable stuff. If a contractor had done this work its something that one could legitimately bring up and be upset about. But in this case, they're doing this because they want to help out...

So when they asked me ""how does it look?"", what could I say except that it looks wonderful? And honestly, I don't care much about the imperfections themselves, we can touch those up as needed on our own or repaint. Its really not about the quality of the work itself, I'm mainly uncomfortable with the fact that I'd prefer being able to freely say ""hey this looks like an improvement but there's a lot of issues here"". But I can't say that without sounding picky, ungrateful, and without having feelings hurt or me losing my standing with her parents (or even my gf being mad at me for hurting her parents feelings). 

In summation I think i would rather they just not do any of the housework so that I don't have to be bound to being lyingly polite and having so many downsides to something I don't even want them to do (downsides being relations hurt)

Am I actually being ungrateful? Reading back, I can see I'm focusing on my discomfort rather than displaying gratitude for their thoughtful gift. I just can't shake the uncomfortableness I feel and am having a hard time finding a tactful way of letting them know that while I'm grateful, its not necessarily something I want them to do.

i’m rly close with her boyfriend too (they’ve been dating for about a year) and the three of us hang out all the time. 

the first time this happened we were talking about how common it is for gay people to have sex with their friends, but neither of us thought that much of it. that night we were both super drunk and hooked up at a party (her bf wasn’t there). we kinda joked about it after like “oops sorry for the hickies” and let it slide, both saying we were too drunk to really remember what happened. 

the second time was once again after a party but this time her boyfriend was with us, he was asleep and we were nearby and accidentally hooked up. this time we weren’t that drunk and the next day we stayed super close, cuddling and holding hands more than we usually would. 

this time we talked about it, she told me how bad she feels, that she’s just frustrated bc she wants to explore her sexuality but she still loves her bf and doesn’t wanna break up with him, i feel bad too because he’s my friend and i don’t wanna hurt him, they have a generally really great relationship. 

i also still don’t like her like that at all. like if she was single i’d be happy just hooking up every now and then for fun and staying best friends (if that’s even possible) but things have been slightly tense between us since the last time we did and i have no idea where to go from here..",06Aug2020,1

363,"Without rambling on, there have been multiple situations and “words said” to my boyfriend on his job site regarding his race and/or demeaning him. He is in a management position and is one of two black males in a management position within his company (which is a large national corporation). He is beyond qualified for his position with a college degree and multiple certifications mind you. 
Anyway, I have known my boyfriend since I was 12, went to school together and we grew up in a very diverse community. We now travel for his job and often get relocated to places that are primarily white with a very small minority community, if any at all. Just to give you a background on the kind of people that are working on these job sites. People have questioned his education, commented on his complexion, nationality, hair, religion, you name it, they’ve asked. I’ve heard comments (from being on the phone or taking him lunch) that absolutely infuriated me. Him being the person he is, he brushes this off and tells me, it’s a construction site and “that’s the way they talk here”. Or “that’s corporate America” “it’s everywhere” and I refuse to accept this. 
My reason for writing this and my last straw...
Recently, he had a conversation with his main  “boss” about the next location we will be going. In this conversation, (his “boss” was on speaker phone so I heard the whole thing) asked him what the “other tall black man on the site” name was. This other gentleman has been working for the company for EIGHT years under the “boss” so this man should know his name VERY well. Not to mention he was a former MLB player, so the whole company knows him... well. This gentleman recognized my boyfriend in a companywide meeting for his work ethic and innovation at their current site. I could tell instantly in my boyfriends face, not to mention his moral went down as soon as his “boss” said. “Oh yeah.. and congratulations on your recognition in the meeting... thanks for that... from umm.. you know... what’s the other tall black guys name that said that about you in the meeting.” It sounded to me like, he did not care on the compliment he received and “the other guy who looks like you had your back.” Slap in the fucking face. And seeing my boyfriends reaction just crushed me. 
Fast forward to today, a few weeks later, we got another call about his transfer. Same “boss” very bland conversation about details for the move, but mentioned and I quote.  “Oh well you’ll do fine out there, the other supervisor has dreads just like you, so you should get along great. You two are the only ones in the company with those.” 
I almost fucking died. I was so pissed I wanted him to quit today. He always is rational about things and admits he thinks it’s wrong but I am livid.
Am I overreacting? What can he even do? How can he even prove that? Is that even something his “boss” can even get in trouble for saying? 
I am sorry for rambling and for the many typos but I am just so mad and don’t know where else to go for advice.

365,"TL:DR My best friend's husband left him and cheated on him and now he is in crisis and I have no idea how to help him. He is seeking professional help, but it's not working.

My best friend and I have known each other since we were 13. We have weathered a lot of pain and bullshit together since then, but it seems he may have hit a rough patch that he has been unable to overcome so far and I am honestly at a loss on how to help him. I will call my friend K and his husband A.

So here is what happened:

K's husband (28m) of 4 years (they had been together for 10 years total) just up and left him without any warning or any discussion a couple months back in the middle of lockdown. K was heartbroken but decided to give A some space and let him sort his head out. They agreed that they would not sleep with other people without a serious discussion first during their separation and would wait until they were divorced.

Long story short, A did not abide by this and K found out (since their bank accounts are connected as they're married, some receipt showed up on K's phone and he pieced it all together. A had been bailing on his responsibilities with K and their pets and was lying to him. When K confronted A about this, A told him in so many words that it doesn't matter if they wait until they're divorced because it's just a piece of paper and they have already decided to separate.

K is absolutely torn to pieces. He's heartbroken, depressed, angry, and trying to drink himself to death. He has a pancreatic issue that means he is unable to handle copious amounts of alcohol. He told me he wakes up every day and has started drinking by 6 am and is usually drunk by the time he finishes work (from home). When I told him he is going to kill himself doing that, he said, ""That's the plan.""

I broke down and begged him not to. I have already lost two friends to suicide; I couldn't bear to lose one of my best friends. He cried and said he is trying really hard to keep fighting. He says he is in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist; he has started taking antidepressants but they don't seem to be helping.

I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts myself, so I am no stranger to these issues nor am I inexperienced in fighting them. I am going to try calling him every day or every other day just to help take his mind off of things even if it is just for a little while. But I live 5,000 miles away from him (I moved from CA to the UK 5 years ago) and I am at a loss as to what else I can do for him. Since he has admitted he is trying to kill himself, is there more I can do? I would hate for him to be 51-50'd because he might lose his job, his home and his pets, but if that's what I have to do in order to save his life... I guess I will have to call and warn someone. But with lockdown, would they even pursue it? Please, any advice or suggestions are welcome.",06Aug2020,1

She gave me her phone number and we started talking offline.

I told her I would come to her because I'm originally from the town she's from, so I would have family there and wouldn't be alone. We've talked every night for a few months now and we would be on the phone for at least 3 hours. I told her a week ago I would come visit her next month because I can't really travel right now because I am a nurse and we are swamped with COVID patients. She was very understanding and was excited. We continued to talk. She texted me this morning that she loves me, she can't wait to see me and how excited she is for our future. Then tonight when I woke up for work, I sent her two text messages and it's been 5 hours and she hasn't responded, when she usually responds instantly. The only reason that this is bothering me is because she's active on Facebook and posting Instagram stories of her at home watching TV and eating. Of course I didn't text her again. Any ideas as to why? And should I text her again tomorrow or just walk away? 

TL;DR Why would a female who says she's loves me, is into me, texts back instantly and calls me daily ignore me all of a sudden?

373,"Sometimes I get in the mood where Im meant to be alone. I started feeling like this when I left high school. I thought the people who were my friends were gonna be around forever until I found out my closest friend started talking to this boy I was talking to. She’ll even say smart stuff when he came around like “oh there go your boyfriend”. Whole time she was just tryna be funny. Everyone knew and my other friend knew to. It was so embarrassing. There were rumors going around about what me and the boy were doing together as well. All they did was shake they head at me. That was senior year of high school. I was ready for high school to be over with. Plus it was a lot going on at home , I just wanted to hide out. After that happened I just got quiet &amp; Me and the girl stop being friends as well. After high school I went to a trade school in Georgia. After being there I got over the high school drama. I became a new and improved person. I started being more social , i met new people , I felt great. Then I started thinking more on how I lose a-lot of people. I was so young and naive , that i started back being friends with these people. I don’t regret it. I learned my lesson before but my mind set shifted. I thought people had a lot of friends because they forgave them. So I forgave all of my friends , literally put the past behind me and stared hanging of with them after I left trade school. Me and the girl started working together and everything. We called each other best friends. Me and her got really close. It was all cool till we started working together. Around the time it was my birthday. I get to work , everyone asking me what I do for my birthday and everyone saying happy birthday. My manager asked me as well. He then told me that my best friend was saying bad stuff about me saying that , “oh i didn’t get that bitch nothing “ and he also said that I stick up for her but she don’t speak up for me” That really hurt me because why are you speaking bad on me behind me back. Me and her called each other bitch in front of each other. Thats what girls do. But it was literally my birthday and you talking to the manager like you don’t even mess with me like that. She’ll even be like “oh they think you innocent” I kept my distance. After I got over that we started being friends again. One time were in this group chat with this other boy we were friends with in high school. One time i was like this group chat getting boring and she was going on about how every group chat ain’t gotta be funny and stuff. Den they was like you not funny either. Then I just left and said bye. I never thought it’ll be that deep. She posted something on Instagram saying she never had a genuine friend and she wish she find a better best friend that like to do what she like to do. I asked who she was talking about and it seemed like she had animosity. She said i like to argue , im negative, im just a bad person overall. She was saying my family are mfs. I felt like dat was rude , thats when i was just over the whole situation. She was basically saying I was taking my anger out on the them because some information I told her. She worded it so disrespectful. So I was just over it. I said some words to her to as well. Only thats shes insecure tho. Long story short , We’re not friends anymore because she feel like the way she talk to me is respectful. People don’t know how to communicate anymore these days. Present day , Im really working on myself, trying to find my self and this situation popped up in my brain. I never told anyone the full story on why we aren’t friends anymore. But that was just one peak in my life on why you shouldn’t be so forgiving. People not gone love you more than your self. Be your own friend and love on your self. Dont be a people pleaser. I started the story off depressed but I think im fine now. I hope I find real friends fr. After we stopped being friends , i started questioning my self. I wish i never done that. Because she really gave hater vibes. My advice to anyone is dont be naive and dont lose your self , trying to please other people. I literally have no one rn but my best friend , that stays in new york and my immediate family. It sucks but Im gonna try to stay positive. I just wish I would’ve found a better path. Im 21 at the moment. I just wanna live my life with no regrets. Any one have advice for me ?",06Aug2020,1
374,"my dad has a house with a rat infestation and yells at me about once every 3 months. I just feel depressed in general there, but he payed for most big things and I feel like he, my dogs, and rabbit would be really sad if I left. Every thing there smells bad there, my room smells like rabbit crap even though we moved him outside about 3 months ago. I would feel like crap because he payed for my ps4 and almost all the games on it (about 250$ worth). my dad is nice and a great personality he just bottles up his anger and me my sister and his wife are the his closest so he unleashes it on us. My mom is moving into a new big house and yes it was kinda the catalyst but I don’t want him to feel like that was the reason cause it wasn’t it was all that stuff above.

I have a 19yo sister and she said she might move in with mom permanently because it’s closer to work

379,"Now trust me, I love my family so so much, and it's not all of my family who is causing this, but it's getting stressful for me and it is getting to the point where I'd just rather stay in my room all day instead of feeling self-conscious in front of the people I'm closest to.  
Ever since before I was diagnosed, my anxiety has caused me to have thoughts that no one around me likes me, everyone thinks I'm annoying or a terrible person, blah blah blah. Now, at this point, I've gotten over most of that point... until recently. I guess being stuck inside has made it worse.  
But to get back on track, almost everyone reinforces the idea. My dad, who I look up to and try my hardest to get approval from, has recently been pickier and pickier with me. It's like everything I'm doing is wrong, and even if I remind him to wash his dish (a rule in my family) or to stop interrupting me (something he has promised to do) he is slowly getting more and more frustrated to the point where he yelled at me as I was trying to explain to him that this makes my anxiety worsen.   
The list goes on. My older sister, despite usually seeming interested in what I'm trying to say, seems to have been trying to flee my conversations more by saying she has work or something... and then not doing work. It's almost like she thinks I'm blind.   
Whenever I talk to my little sister, It's like she forces me into a position where I am the listener and she is the talker... for the whole conversation. I have things to say too, not just her. I love listening to her hobbies like collecting stuffed animals and playing Roblox, but I'd just wish she would listen to me as well.  
The only person who seems to actively try to listen to me is my mom, but even with her, I'll try to tell her something and she'll respond with a bland ""mhm"". And whenever I tell her about me feeling down she just says stuff like ""Ah it's just since we're stuck inside. Everyone is feeling like that nowadays"" like since they have a reason for existing that means I don't need to sob in her arms until I feel better.

All of this makes me feel lonely in the worst possible way. It makes me feel like no one cares at all. I know my girlfriend would care but she seems so proud of me that I have stayed positive all this time (through masking my emotions) and I don't want to get rid of that. I know that my family is trying their hardest and a lot of this is learned from their past, but I'm sick of feeling like I'm annoying. I love them, I do, but It feels like they don't care.

So, TL;DR, No one in my family listens to me and it is making my anxiety worsen. What way can I get them to actually pay attention?",06Aug2020,1

384,"Hello, I'm 22(m) and been experiencing the same kind of feelings for almost all of my relationships. I thing I'm a pleaser person in every situation (relationship). I've always wanted to do things the way i think they wanted (or possibly said to me) and keep doing the things that will not cause any damage to them, help them grow, or achieve their goal. It has been always in my mind to help them reach their dreams for the meantime or at least I'd be supporting them. Even if it costs me sleepless nights and heartaches. But don't get me wrong, i've always been told that i really do these stuffs.

Recently it hit me like a truck, where i've watch her slowly loosing interest and even not showing care anymore. I kinda burst or exploded at her asking, ""what seems to be the problem?"" but not furiously or mad, (am a mellow guy i guess haha) just like heart brokenly asked.

For some reason, every time there's small changes on them, I automatically think that i did something wrong, or said something wrong, or maybe i didnt show enough care, and so i'll start thinking things. I'll always look at myself and assess if i did something wrong. I've been trying to recover from this by mustering up the courage to ask on ""whats wrong"" every time i feel change. Well at first it was working so yaaay. Helped me ease my mind and calm my heart on bad nights of thinking. But, the past weeks, tis probably the worst deviation from our relationship. Me asking on whats wrong, but me also getting ignored whilst asking. I felt really scared, i feel like she's getting fed up by me. You know, what enters my mind at nights. And so, i asked. ""Is it me?"" then she said, ""i get stressed when you think you did something wrong while you really didnt do anything"". ""You've changed"" i said. ""im just me"" she said. then i told her that its been haunting me every night, im asking her for help. Because im lost. every time something happens to be a change, i feel lost. but when your lost, you ask questions right? but there were no answers. Me doing some emotional guides i read online, and still failing it makes me feel like im doing everything wrong. i told her to help me. she said she didnt know how to. then she said everything that, ""god knows how i kept trying hard to return everything whats rightfully yours but it seems i cant"".

391,"TL;DR: I cut off contact with my friend, and now shes spreading rumours about me having a crush on her and idk what to do to quell them. 

&amp;#x200B;

God, I hate writing this as I hate being involved in teenage drama, but I just need some help rn. Btw this is in Scandinavia so some things are a bit different

So I recently cut off contact with someone I considered my best friend. There were many reasons for this, most relating to me being introverted/studious/don't do drugs or drink/a bit slow socially whilst she is more extroverted/adventurous/easy-going. Again many reasons but the straw that broke the camels back was a conversation were she insulted my life choices(trade school vs college). The gist of it was that she claimed people going to college are lazy and never going to do ""proper work"", something I'm very insecure about. After I cut her out I realised that our relationship toxic, I feel like I put in the most work(helping her with school, listening to her talking about her life, etc). It has hurt very much and I've been shifting between blaming both her and myself, being angry/sad ever since.

Anyhow, I never told her the reason for cutting contact actually, I didn't tell her anything. Just drifted out of her life and blocked her on all social media. My problem is that she now has started making conspiracy theories as to why I stopped contact. The one that stung the most is that she thought I was jealous of her new boyfriend and that I have a crush on her (I don't I'm asexual as hell). In addition, I discovered that she views me as boring, stuck up, and generally a mood killer and she has been telling all of this to her friends(even mutual ones). For reference, I'm quite sure she's doing this for emotional support, but she isn't aware that these things spread like Pepe memes in 2014 in our rural community.

Now I don't want to open up contact again and am considering paying it no attention and hope it all dies down soon but honestly, it hurts a lot that these things about me are going around in my hometown without me being able to stop it appropriately

My parents said we shouldn’t do anything unless the restaurant directly calls us and tells us to get tested. I’d also liked to add that this restaurant was in a plaza/mall-type thing so although we left the restaurant before they got there, they could have been in another shop/area.

Do you think the restaurant will call us? Or will it just be those who were there during that specific time, which seems to be what they’re suggesting?

I was wondering whether I am just too late to start a Career in UX/ UX Design and by the time I finish Uni I wouldn't be able to get a job anymore.

412,"Hello so I wanted to get into a food science degree to be a research and development chef. I currently work in a kitchen and have found my absolute passion is in food science and to be able to combine my creativity with a scientific subject... However my past education does not qualify me for any programs.

I moved overseas a year ago to live in the Netherlands so Dutch is not my first language I cannot take any of the courses that allow you to get into the degree here. 

I recently took an admission test and got the news 2 days ago that I failed so I won't be starting the degree in September... I have one shot of retaking the admission test I failed next year as you can only take it once per academic year... however if I do not get accepted again then I will be truly lost... 

Back home in Australia I have been in contact with other uni's and they have told me i can do a 1 year diploma but that will cost me 7k and then after it will be another 30k for the actual degree which I simply can't afford especially if I graduate at 28-29 years old... I am feeling so stuck on what to do, what jobs to look into, if I should go back to uni and how to get out of minimum wage. Advice please....

Should i go back home to potentially enrol in a free diploma in say nursing or dental hygiene... I am sick of being poor working minimum wage as an apprentice baker / prep chef and am really upset I can't get into the industry I truly want to be in for my life...",06Aug2020,1

417,"I am a 25 f. My sister is 30 and we have two brothers, 22 and 27. She is looking for her own house but can't find anywhere yet. Sister is a doctor and is always exhausted with the long hours, early mornings. That's fine, but she takes it out on all of us. Cranky, moaning and whinging, and always passing passive - aggressive comments to take her anger out on others. ""It's fine for you you don't have to get up early in the morning."" Stuff like that in a condescending voice all the time. She does this every single day we see her, taking her problems out on every one else. I told her recently ""That you brought it upon yourself. You wanted to study medicine, you wanted this career. Stop constantly feeling sorry for yourself and looking to drag other people down with you because you can't cope with your own shit life, stop constantly mocking and trying to provoke people to get a laugh and make yourself feel better cause you can't deal with your own insecurities."" 

She speaks to my mother and I like we are children all the time, a permanent baby voice, patronizing and smug. ""Make sure you wash your hands,"" stuff like that. Yet she acts like a child herself. She stabs people with keys and hits people to lash out with anger, hits people with hairbrushes and saucepans, locks people out of the house. My mum and dad are the only ones able to put her in her place, especially my mum, but she doesn't do much. Mum always whines and makes it about herself, saying she hates the shouting and just wants peace. Yet, whenever mum actually does get angry with her, sister throws a tantrum because she can't deal with being stood up to by mum. Sometimes when mum gets angry at her she might not speak to anyone for weeks. This hypocrisy is sickening. She never once apologizes for it either as soon after she and mum are best friends once again, and for the next event her tantrum is just enabled even more. 

It's this kind of mentality ""It's my way or no one's way. Everything is about me and everything has to be done the way I want, I walk all over people, if it isn't done my way I will throw a tantrum and not speak to anyone for weeks.""

I don't speak to her anymore. It's the only thing I can do to stop myself from saying something I'll regret. The girl is toxic and no one can win with her. I have always been one of her main targets, she mocks me every day I see her, tries razzing me, laughing at me in front of the family with a face and tone of scorn. It is exhausting being around her and she has an amazing ability to bring out the worst in everyone. I refuse to let her walk all over me. Whenever I am speaking to my mum about something she is incapable of staying out of it and adding her own two cents. I know this behavior is never going to change, I know her well enough. She also twists everything and gets away with it every single time. 

My 22 year old brother sucks up to her all the time. Sides with her in every argument and forgets everything on the other side. She occasionally takes his Nintendo to hold leverage over him to do what she wants. She thinks it is up to her to decide what he does with his free time and says she can't stand his ""scuttling"" off to his room to play his Nintendo. This is her new nickname for him ""Scuttler!"" Whenever my mum gets involved to make her return the Nintendo she has an ability to deliberately evade doing so. Might change the subject or say she doesn't know where it is. 

The other day I told her she's got psychiatric problems and needs to get therapy as she is not capable of seeing her wrongs. She started mocking me over this, but I don't care and stand by what I said.

I’m trying to apply to medical school and it has been my life long goal and it’s been the only thing I’ve ever even considered doing. However now the more i think about it, I really don’t wanna do it. Even with good university grades and high entrance exam scores i feel dumb all the time, and i feel like I’m completely missing basic common sense and have had increasingly shortening attention span for the last 2 years (to the point that i often have to ask someone what they said 2-3 times before I finally hear it). When i talk to my friends/classmates that also want to go into med i realize how significantly dumber i am compared to them and realize I’ll never make it in a field that i no longer have passion for. 
In fact I really don’t know what i want anymore. I spend my morning and afternoon volunteering online and spend my evenings writing essays and application stuff and every day feels so unfulfilling and exhausting. I’ve lost interest in everything i liked before. I haven’t talked to my friends or parents or other humans in weeks. I’ve completely given up exercise (i used to love playing tennis but I can’t stand it anymore). I can’t even play video games or guitar for more than 10 minutes before becoming bored/exhausted so i spend my free time and late nights just browsing reddit without really reading posts but rather just scrolling aimlessly until 5am then waking up at 8am and repeating the same day over again. I’ve tried sleeping pills and they don’t do anything for me, and after closing my eyes for 3 hours in bed I eventually give up and go back on reddit until I naturally fall asleep from exhaustion. The only thing i like doing is cooking but i suck at that too.

Her and her gf have been dating for four months, they’re going great, have never argued, talked about moving in w/ each other, gave each other gifts, all the good stuff.

I know it's probably not common to hear a young man dating a woman twice his age but I really need advice. I originally downloaded Reddit thinking it'll make good content for videos, but now I turn to ask Reddit instead of wanting to try gaining something.
I've been trying to get work/employment to complete a certificate in construction, but I find it difficult to actually find employment, living in a small town with asbestos in many of the roofs of houses, as well as eroded electric wiring can make getting a electrician apprenticeship scary as that's my main goal after construction... But I can't find work I like, I feel like giving in and just accepting any jobs that come my way, but would that mean sacrificing my dream job idea...
Currently my partner is the main bread winner and I'm so happy about that, but at some point I want a family of my own but I'm scared I'm just being selfish, it's just when I think about kids of my own it plays on my heart cords. I'm sure that I'll be able to resolve it sometime in the far future but as for employment, I'm struggling extremely, I've never been the self reliant type because it means diving head first into something unknown... It scares me (apparently it's not only the dark)...
TLDR: I want to find work that deals with electrics that doesn't have to be industrial/renovation... And I want to bring up my feelings about wanting to be a farther, before it's to late (even if I doesn't sound to logical)

434,"I’ll warn you now that this post is rather long. But if you decide to read about my situation and offer some advice, I would most definitely appreciate it. TIA

So the father of my children, who I will refer to as JT (40m) and I (33f) have been together on and off for the past 10 years. We had our daughter in 2014 and our son in 2015. We’re both addicts and unfortunately that has affected our relationship immensely. Our addictions have lead us both to lie to one another, but throughout the years it has also lead me to be unfaithful a handful of times. I am not proud of this, and yes JT knows. We have tried, and I guess are still trying, to work through all of the messes we have made, or mostly that I have made. However, a couple of months ago, JT and I were fighting and I started hanging out with someone else. I hadn’t cheated on JT with this person, but he automatically assumed that I had, given my history, so he was hurt and angry about the situation. This prompted JT to let me in on a secret he had been keeping from me for a little over a year, which was that in the summer of 2019, during one of our “off” periods, he had a short fling with my now ex-best friend, who I will refer to as CB. 

Summer 2019, I moved to a different state to go to rehab and attempt to get clean since I hadn’t had any luck doing so on the numerous occasions I had tried at home. I had been gone for about 2 months when JT and I broke up because I was finally getting sober and he was not. I then started casually seeing someone else. Around this same time, CB had reached out to JT to ask him about one of his friends that she had met because she was lonely and wanted a guy to hang out with. JT saw this as a perfect opportunity to get back at me since he knew that I would be devastated if I thought he had been intimate with one of my only two friends. Apparently they hung out a few times, hooked up, but then CB (who was supposed to be my best friend, mind you) got really attached really fast, so JT ended up ghosting her as he was never actually attracted to her in the first place. His entire motive for hooking up with her was strictly to hurt me. I guess his conscience got the better of him because when I moved back home a couple of months later, he begged me to try again for our kids and never told me about the brief relationship he had with CB. So of course, I agreed to try and make it work, yet again.

Fast forward a year, JT and I are fighting constantly, so I suggest we try therapy or possibly take a little break to reevaluate what we want. He refuses therapy and says that a break is the same as breaking up. So basically we were getting nowhere. I had started a new job at this time and became friends with a guy at work. We spoke on the phone a lot, mostly about mine and JTs troubles, and hung out once outside of work with other coworkers and never alone. JT went through my phone a few nights after and saw a message from the guy at work saying something like, “I had fun the other night, maybe we could do it again sometime?” And I had responded, “I did too, and maybe, we’ll see.” JT automatically assumed the worst, and I honestly don’t blame him considering all that I have done in the past. But this is the moment that JT proceeds to tell me about his fling with CB the year prior and how she wasn’t really my friend because she had even reached out to him wanting to hang out a few more times after he had cut her off and I had moved back home.

I asked CB about it and of course she denied it at first, but when I forwarded her the screen shots of messages and pictures that JT had sent me providing evidence of their relationship, she finally admitted to it. She apologized and said that she never meant to hurt me. I told her that I appreciated the apology, but she had crossed a line that you just don’t cross... you don’t sleep with your best friend’s exes, let alone the father of their children! I mean, I am tied to this man for the rest of my life... and now there are times that I look at him and am reminded of what happened between the two of them, and it’s just as painful as JT intended for it to be. After JT got over his initial anger at me when he told me about their fling, he then apologized and explained why he did what he did and how he wasn’t proud of it at all. I forgave him and told him that to be honest, given all of the crap I had put him through, I probably deserved it. Since then, we agreed to leave the past in the past, to not throw our mistakes in one another’s faces, and to try and move forward in our relationship. 

Which brings me to the point of this post... is it possible for JT and I to move past all of the crap we have done to one another and actually have a good relationship from here on out?  I will admit that there are times that I start thinking about what he did, but I try my best to keep it to myself because that’s what we agreed on. JT, however, still likes to throw my mistakes in my face. He doesn’t do it as often as he used to, but he will whenever he feels as though I’m keeping something from him. He goes through my phone and creates issues where there are none. Whenever he does this, I try to remind him of what we agreed on... that the only way we will be able to stay together is to focus on the future. We also agreed that this would be the last time we ride this merry-go-round because we’ve been doing it for years with the same results. For me though, I am trying my hardest to be the best partner that he could want. If another man sends me any type of inappropriate message, I politely tell them that I am not going to disrespect the father of my children by communicating with them. If I have to, I block people on messenger or on my phone. I am still hurt by what JT did to me, but I remind myself of what I’ve done to cause him pain, so this time around I am honestly doing everything I can to be a better partner to him. Unfortunately, I’m beginning to feel like no matter what I do now, JT will always be stuck on what I’ve done in the past. He will always be second guessing me and wanting to go through my phone to see who I’ve talked to and what was said. At first I didn’t mind because I wanted him to see how I handled it when other men would message me, but at this point it’s starting to feel like no matter what I do, JT will always think that I’m lying to him or hiding things from him. I don’t know what else I can do to prove to him that I meant it when I said I wasn’t fucking around this time. I get that it takes time to rebuild trust, but I honestly don’t know if JT will ever truly trust me again. And these days whenever we argue, he is quick to say, “well this is probably never going to work.” So I tell him that if he truly believes that, then go ahead and leave me and quit prolonging the inevitable, but I’m not going anywhere because I WANT this to work and I want our family together. So then he agrees that that is what he wants as well, but then a week or two later, we will be having the same argument again. 

So, I ask you, my fellow redditors, is this relationship doomed? Our children are 5 and 6 years old and I want them to grow up with their family intact, but at the same time I will not allow them to grow up in a home where there is constant conflict between me and their father. I have done that man so wrong in the past, so I understand why he has his doubts. But I also feel like there comes a point where we either decide we want to be together and we will do whatever it takes to make it work, or we just split up and try to find happiness elsewhere. I know that I truly want to make it work. I think that he does too, but I also think that he is filled with doubt. I know he doesn’t want to be hurt again. Should I just continue doing what I’m doing and being the best partner that I can be and hope that maybe one day he will finally realize that and his doubts will fade? Or is that even a real possibility? Will there always be a nagging thought in the back of his mind that I will cheat on him again and break his heart? I will say that I am currently sober, so I have a lot more integrity than I did while I was using. But should I really expect for JT to believe me when I tell him that all I want is to make him happy and to be a family with him and my children? Do I even deserve that after everything I put him through? Don’t get me wrong, JT was no saint throughout our relationship, but he never cheated and only hooked up with CB when we were broken up. His reasoning for hanging out with her was definitely petty, but I totally get why he did it and when he sincerely asked for forgiveness, I gave it to him.  But I don’t think he’s truly forgiven me for what I’ve done. I love this man so much, and it took him doing what he did to me for me to realize that he’s it for me. But will we ever be happy again? Is that even possible?

435,"Hi redditors,

this is an update [on my last advice post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hzxbcd/should_i_drop_out_of_university_or_torture_my_way/). Idk if it's allowed but I'm full of hope and i wanted to genuinely thank everyone who took their time to encourage me on that advice post. This will also be crossposted to [/CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/).

I'm not going to drop out of university. I'm going to milk the remaining time with all the strength I have left, and I will write that damn MA thesis to the best of my remaining abilities.

I reached out to my boss, who got back at me and told me I could take a month more if I needed to. She also ensured me I would very likely get the promised job.

I reached out to the examination office as well as my academic mentor, asking for a possible prolongation of the exam period, as I lost a whole month of it to looking for financial support as well as a new place to stay and of course coping.

I have two friends who are by my side as much as I let them be. I have other people who support me, so much. I am not alone, even if I feel like it; people have my back. I have places to turn to. I will heal from this, whatever it means, wherever it goes. I am suicidal, but I will get the fuck through this. I didn't struggle my whole damn life just to end it here like this and drop out the last dam half year.

This is a rush of energy and hope. It's temporary. I'll cry again the rest of the day and doing the thesis will be torture the following months.

436,"So I have been around a couple people my age who are pretty bad people. I have endured their toxicity for a couple years now but I'm about to break. They are constantly bullying everyone's faults and harming people mentally, including myself. They bully people for their interests and passions, especially when they are different from their own (e.g. I said I liked acting and they all called me gay and retarded). I was never usually like that, but recently I have noticed I have become a worse person, supposedly from their influence. I remember our group of 'friends' used to be largely shy and kind people that would never diss anyone, but I cannot say the same as of now.

I have attempted numerous times to leave them but whenever I try, they literally pull me back to stop me. So I have basically just accepted the fact that I can't leave. I know I am better than them (yes I know it sounds narcissistic but I'm fed up). Lately I have just been silent during their outbursts but their toxicity keeps getting to me.

What do I do to put up with them?",06Aug2020,1
437," 

The title is some background information. Anyways, my friend has proof of verbal abuse which includes empty death threats as well. He is trying to get proof of physical abuse too, but his dad is acting like a nice guy rn because my friend's grandfather (also entitled) wants to move in. My friend, his brother and his mom share the same feelings. Also, one time, when they were in the US, the mom called the cops bc his dad hit his mom, but when the police showed up, he pretended as though nothing happened and the police believed him.

His (15) father(42) and his father (65) are both very greedy, egotistical, and rude. They both expect that his mother, brother and he serve them and cater to their every need without question. His father is also abusive (mostly verbal like his dad and sometimes physical), not because he's drunk or anything but because someone points out that he is wrong or questions anything he says. His father lived in the US but came back recently after lying about a vacation in India and them leaving his mother, brother and him here. He also bought his father and mother another house to live in because they didn't want to be with my friend's family. But recently his grandmother passed so now there is nobody at his grandparent's place to take care of them so now his father has decided that the grandfather would live with them and that they have to take care of him even though they don't want to.

Since he has about 3 years to go before he can get away from them how should he deal with them in the meantime? Are there any laws that protect him? Getting a divorce is out of the question because we live in India and it is very heavily frowned upon to get one.",06Aug2020,1

439,"I [19M] am a kissless virgin and I would like to start experiencing the romance side of life. I'm a sophomore in university but never really go to parties or meetups with large groups of people so that limits me a bit (although I'm quite happy with this, I'm not a party person). I am in a few extracurriculars but they're very focused (all engineering teams). This isn't to say I'm a complete shut in though, I have a decent amount of friends but could always use more.

So I'm looking to go to some new places and do some new things that leads to meeting new people. The problem is there's not so much of that happening at the moment for obvious reasons. I'm probably going to look into a few new clubs or groups once school starts back up in a couple weeks but am looking for other ideas as well. I'm personally of the opinion that dating apps are kinda bad and superficial (I don't wanna have to ""play the game"") but I'm not completely opposed to them although I haven't used them. But I do also think that first dates would be made even more awkward by having to worry about all the virus stuff we now deal with.

So basically if anybody has advice about good ways to meet new people in general and/or find a girlfriend that would be great, both generally and at the moment when a lot of in-person stuff is cancelled or complicated.

I need them to get a good night's sleep. Without them I wake up quite often during the night, but I don't have the presence of mind to put them back in.

I cannot sleep on my back or stomach and toss and turn in my sleep, so if anyone suggests something to physically stop me from pulling them out (ie headphones - obviously that's impractical but that's just an example), it needs to be unobtrusive enough I can sleep on top of it and it won't come loose while sleeping.",06Aug2020,1

445,"Tl;dr at the bottom

A few months ago I(17f) was pretty interested in finding a animal shelter near me that I could help out in my free time. Unfortunately I didn't find one, but another one that operates in my neighbor country. When I had nothing to do I just looked at the animals and found a cat I fell in love with. At first I just thought about adopting her in 2-3 years when I earn enough to move out. But the more I read about adoption, the clearer it became that she won't be here anymore when I move out so I would need to adopt her now and just take her with me when I move out. That's where the problem lies. My family already has 2 cats and my mum says we won't get another animal and we should wait till we move out. Now, my mum is not my problem, if I would bring a cat home we would keep it. She would be pissed but she's a kind soul and would never force me to return the cat. The problem is my stepfather. He doesn't like my brother and me and just loves to argue about anything. He doesn't like that we have cats, not because he needs to care for them, he doesn't do that, he just doesn't like them because the cats are supposed to be my brothers and I. I realised you still don't know what the problem is (sorry I'm bad at coming to the point but we'll be there soon, so please stick with me.). My mum can't stand up for us kids. She's too scared of my stepfather leaving her and dying alone that she always picks his side. She could be completely fine with one thing, but as soon as she talks to my stepfather she's against it. That's why I thought I just bring the cat home without saying anything, just relying on the fact that she wouldn't make me give it away. But I talked to my grandma and she said it would be bad for my mum because my stepfather would be totally against it. Now I don't want to put my mum in this position but I also don't want to give up on the cat. So my question is what would you do? Do you have any advice?

447,"Hello Reddit. Don’t worry, I’m braced for the DM shitstorm that will likely ensue from this. My partner (let’s call him Bill) has been in prison for 3 years for a non-violent crime which, as it happens, I believe he did not commit. The judge didn’t think so either, but the jury kind of went their own way. We’d only been together a year at the time and the conviction was a huge shock, especially given the lack of evidence. Either way, we are where we are.

He will be coming out in December and living with me. We’ve never lived together before, we both lived in our own places before he went to prison but he had to sell his house as he was obviously no longer able to pay the mortgage. Since that time I’ve moved (for work) to another part of the country, to a house he’s never been to, where I live with my son from a previous relationship. He was only little when Bill went to prison and I didn’t want to take a toddler on prison visits, so their relationship has been based on phone calls and photographs. 

Mine and Bill’s contact for the past 3 years has been daily phone calls, regular letters, and visits every couple of weeks until we hit pandemic land. I’ve not seen him in person since March, but I’ll be able to go next month and I want to discuss some ideas with him about how we will make this work.

I know he’s spent a lot of time by himself and will probably need that occasionally, is it a good idea to turn my spare bedroom in to a bit of a hidey hole for him?

I also know I don’t want to overwhelm him with my son, who he hasn’t seen for years, and I don’t want to overwhelm my son either, but I have supportive family close by and I think my son will probably spend a couple of days with his grandparents when Bill first arrives, to give him a chance to settle. Bill will also be spending some time with his parents. I know I’ll have to take the introductions as slow and steady as we can in the circumstances.

It’s not an ideal situation, moving in with someone you’ve only spent 2 hours at a time with for the past 3 years (and 0 hours for the past several months) and I also know there will be some trauma to deal with, given everything he’s been through, so I would welcome any advice you can give me.

About 6 months ago, she moved back into town after being gone for 2 years while obtaining her degree. We were both so excited after finally being reunited that we knew our lives were finally coming together and we would always be there for each other. 
That was then, unfortunately, and things have never been the same. I have been in the middle of sorting through family issues, moving in with my boyfriend, working, and trying to handle the chaos that is my bachelors degree. Since she had moved back, she had been dying for me to go and see her new apartment and life that she’s started. Although I was eager to as well, our schedules were constantly conflicting and we were never able to find a day for me to visit. Weeks pass and I start to feel the passive-aggressive hints that I’m not being a supportive friend and “how come all of my other friends have seen my apartment except for my best friend” start to come into question. I keep insisting that I’m doing the best I can and that we will plan it. I promised her. 
After months of barely any contact and the constant reminders that her other friends are dedicated and more loyal, I don’t know what to do. I feel like the unsupportive/unreliable friend that I never wanted to be. The last time we talked was 3 weeks ago and it was more of her asking me questions back to back about what I was doing and why I was doing it. I felt like it was an interrogation and me needing to over explain myself and paint myself in the best light. That conversation didn’t last long when she just spontaneously stopped replying. 
Her birthday recently came up. The days leading up to as well as the day of were absolute hell. It would be the first birthday in 10 years that we didn’t celebrate together. I didn’t even reach out because everybody closest to me told me that it’s not worth it. I lost so much sleep over it that it’s ridiculous.

I've always been selfish, egotistical and a downright awful human. 

I live in a small town, so the rumours about myself are pretty rife. 
Always felt like a big fish in a little pond. 

When I was a child I was overly sexual, for someone so young. I was sexually abused by a boy, a lot older than me. Then I was abused by my step grandad. 

I've not long remembered the abuse by the boy, as I was so young, age 4/5. The abuse by the step grandad, I was around 8/9, and I told my parents straight away. It was never spoke of again. 

I went on to crave attention from men a lot older than me. Well, crave attention from any man. Single or taken. It didn't matter to me. 

I've had relationships with exes of friends, more than once. I've tried it on with boyfriends or friends. I've cheated on every boyfriend I've had. I've tried it on with bosses. These encounters, mostly had reciprocation. 

Because of these situations, I can't move forward. I've come to realise that this is not the way I want to live, its embarrassing. I'm embarrassed to be who I've been. No one trusts me. I have no friends. 

I want to move away and start fresh. 
I've been living in a way that's socially acceptable for around 3 years, and my past still hangs over me like a black cloud. Women take pride in tearing me down. Everything I say is circulated in a group of people, who distort and pick what they want from it.

I had a lot of anxiety and I couldn’t explain why but I really loved her even though she made me angry at times.

We would go swimming in my pool and we both liked each other for the most part. We talked about taking a road trips up to my cabin in the north but since it’s my parents cabin I couldn’t just go whenever I wanted and she had school during the week so I went one week by myself and she got upset. She asked me to come home so I drove home the next day and we hooked up. We smoked a joint together and I went down on her and it was really sexy. Somewhere during the sex there was a really bad smell. She lay motionless with her face down and ass up as the scent of shit filled the room. I looked at her butthole and I couldn’t see any shit on the surface but she was holding in a big one and was waiting for me to leave. She was really embarrassed and her roommate came home at the same time so she kicked me out and that was the falling out of our relationship. One of the last times I ever saw her if not the last.

After like a week I asked my boyfriend when he thought would be a good time to go home and he started entertaining the idea of staying here. Eventually he told me this is his parents house and so we can stay here as long as we want to . I have no idea why he lied and he wouldn't give me a reason. We have had fights about this but I don't want to make him mad at me or anything so I usually just drop the subject because he's made it pretty clear he doesn't want to go back anytime soon. he keeps saying it's better for me here because it's just us and my parents are crazy and bad for me, and there's less covid cases here too. My parents are kind of crazy but they are in my hometown right now which isn't even in Canada so we could easily go back and not see them but he says no they'll come back or whatever. My dad and my boyfriend don't have the best relationship. I feel so isolated here like I'm going insane and I really just want to go home. I don't have any money left now because I hadn't expected to stay here so long and I haven't been able to get a job because of covid also I don't even know when I'm leaving so I don't know what I would even tell whoever was hiring me. I don't want to have to owe my boyfriend we were splitting everything at first but now he's having to pay for everything. I don't know what to do! I'm so far from home and he wont take me back and I don't know when he will either :(",06Aug2020,1
472,"I've been with my boyfriend for just over 2 years. Last autumn, I moved into a university apartment with 4 girls and 3 guys. I felt attracted to one of the guys. He even hit on me on the first night while he was drunk, I was nice and friendly but made it clear I had a boyfriend and he backed off. We got on really well and I felt guilty as I don't really get attracted to other people. Honestly, he isn't the kind of guy I would've dated/had a relationship with if I was single- I just found him funny and physically attractive. I began to see a fuck boy side of him within a few weeks after he slept with one of the girls in the apartment. 

I'm really worried about my conduct when we had parties and we were both drunk. I recall being friendly and when he made a dark joke I went ""dude not cool, I'm so offended"" sarcastically, and when he started apologising I went ""oh no no man, I was being sarcastic"" and I patted him on the upper arm/shoulder? I don't know if it wss flirty or not? I had no intention and I would never ever ever cheat. I'm also concerned because when he offered to let me try his vape, I did and maybe that's flirty too? Or just drunken curiosity? Also another time I ran into him in the nightclub and I was so happy to see my friend, and asked him if he was seeing anyone and not to worry cos we all find someone (he had complained about being single before but again, I didn't ask him this in the hope of cheating or something immoral like that. I'vegenuinely never considered cheating, let alone wanted to). I've told my BF some of this and I'm so worried I was being unfaithful and maybe I don't deserve him if I've unknowing been a tease/flirt?",06Aug2020,1

476,"Just wanted to come on here and ask for advice about my abusive dad who has been abusing my mom for years about 20 years now physically, emotionally and mentally. He has violent angry outbursts to the point where he has strangled my mom when I was 7. He has also hit her and broken furniture all over the home.

He has screamed and me and hit me once but he mostly projects all of his anger onto my mom.

He constantly degrades and speaks to her like she’s nothing. He puts on a facade making himself seem like the victim to all his friends and everyone that knows him and makes my mom seem like the bad person. Everyone believes and no matter how many times my mom has tried to leave him he always manipulated his way back in. Especially in a culture where you cannot do anything with a male presence in the home it’s very difficult for us both. 

I have no respect for him as a father and everyday I see him I look at him with disgust because of what he has done to my mother.

Please could someone give me advice on how to deal with this monster that I’m living with.",06Aug2020,1
477,"Alright last time i was on here i figured i wouldnt ask the internet for advice about it but now i fear im losing the only people i feel comfortable talking to about it. I just spent half a day writing my whole life story down and changed my mind about sharing everything to the world. Alright, my only reason for living is a girl who i love and everything else (activtiy, concept, etc.) doesnt feel worth it anymore. My feelings are one-way and shes also my best friend. I never expect anything else and my feelings for her kinda dont matter in the friendship since i try not to make them get in the way. Alright. Recently, it feels like she doesnt want to speak to me. Messages go ignored for days. I get told that shes just no in a socialising mood but i know she's talking to other people. We've fallen apart as friends multiple times in the past and each time it hurt to the point I wanted to die. Now, I'm scared its gonna happen again and ive already lost all the other passion for life i had the other times. 21st July i promised her id wait a year for my life to get better before i give up on it. How am i supposed to wait if it gets worse a few weeks after? Getting through a day is really difficult as is. I cant imagine what it would be like without her. And if she does leave. What reason do i have to continue living?",06Aug2020,1
478,"My friend, let's call her S, worries me very much. We are both 18 years old. I'm worried that she has an eating disorder by the behavior she has been displaying for the last few months. 

She constantly talks about restricting and counting calories and what she ate that day. She says stuff like ""Look, I have only eaten [very small amount of food] today. That was way too much, I have to workout extra hard tonight."" She works out every evening to 'burn her calories', which is something I'm genuinely worried about. Whenever we go out together and eat something, she orders the stuff with the least calories on the menu, as to not 'get fat'. She is a very slim and athletic girl and has (in my opinion) a beautiful body. 

She just constantly mentions working out to stay slim and healthy and not eating enough. 

I have not talked about her behavior with her, as we're not that close that I ultimately know what's good or bad for her, but I'm concerned. 
 
Should I approach the topic? Or not talk about it at all? I'm conflicted because I am on the heavier side of the body spectrum and I feel like it's not my place to tell her what to eat and how to stay healthy. 

I once mentioned that I am happy with how my body looks and she had a shocked look on her face that basically said ""How can you, a thick person, be happy with how you look?"". I was not offended by that, it just made me feel more concerned.",06Aug2020,1

She lives with her parents and when I asked her who it was before she ended the call she said it was complicated. She went silent for 30-40 minutes after, she texted me and told me that the mailman arrived which is suspicious since the person sounded like he was already inside the house but it was brief and she ended the call immediately after and said bye.

She was really sorry about what happened and was so quick to apologize, she told me it was her dad and her dad insisted on eating.",06Aug2020,1

486,My partner cheated with a friend of his. I always suspected something was going on and now he’s pleading to fix things. I don’t know what to do. She’s gross and I’m disgusted.,06Aug2020,1
487,"This year has been ROUGH. I (M35) need advice or support on how to proceed as I am really struggling. 

Up until a few years ago my life was as good as it gets, I have been so fortunate. Healthy parents, good relationship. Wife and daughter. A nice house, job good health for all. Larger social network and lots of fun.

We would go on trips, watch my daughter's activities, go to the beach, watch sports, all that stuff. 

We were together for 11 years. 


Then...

My father in law passed, we watched him unexpectedly but slowly die in the hospital. My wife wasn't the same after.

My wife needed a partial historectomy, there were complications and follow up surgeries. Lots of pain and struggles here. 

I became depressed and so did my wife, we both developed more anxiety. Our marriage unravelled from 2018 forward. Just lost passion and connection and interest. 

I still didn't see it coming when on a family vacation my wife told me she couldn't do it anymore. 

We went to counciling for 1 month or 2 but it was too late, my wife was already done. I probably was too but at that stage really wanted to give it our all to try and save this. We had so many good times. We are both good people. 

The process has been amicable. 

Covid hit as marriage counciling was failing which made things so much harder, stuck in close quarters during such a horrible time. It was traumatic for both of us.

Covid on its own has been hard but divorcing in it has been hell. 

We agreed to split, still lived together, my wife within weeks slept with a mutual acquaintance. This is not at all like here and it devastated me like nothing has.  Just out of respect for me and our history. 

Between all this I checked into an outpatient mental health program for 10 days. 

Fast forward and I have learned a lot. I learned also that my ex wife was unintentionally or intentionally isolating me from our social network and my family during much of our relationship.  I lost all my close connections during our relationship, that falls on me as well for letting it happen. 

For 2.5 months now I am living alone in an apartment, rebuilding relationships but that takes so much time and I am alone nearly all the time. 

My teenage step daughter (ex wife's from previous relationship) who I helped raise since 6 is mad at me and the situation and barely will communicate with me.  My ex won't help much here and I have no legal rights.   This perhaps hurts the most. 

My busy job went to 5 hrs a day and is work from home so I no longer see my co-workers anymore. 

Everyone already has there lives and no one seems interested in a dude who is alone and down on his luck. 

I am extremely careful to balance getting myself out there with not coming off as desperate. I stay positive with folks and don't come off heavy. 

I am quickly losing hope that my life is worth living at this stage. I feel like I already lived my life and now it's just the left overs. 

I wake up every day. Text with a few people here and there, work, exercise, eat healthy, meditate, journal and if I'm lucky do something socially in the evening. 

I see a therapist and take medication. Nothing helps. 

I am finding my new day to day life horrible. I do not yet have deep social connections I lost my social network as I left the church we were at for many reasons. 

Being alone is so unbearable and I can't take it much longer. I worry about winter where I won't be able to go outside and how I will be able to do that. 

I know people will say "" you need to be good with just you"" but I need some companionshop, a close friend group or a few I can really trust. I lost all that and it can take years to rebuild. 

Has anyone else done this before, is there advice you can give?  I know it will take time but honestly the last 6 months have drained me, I don't have another 6 in me this way. 

I really am scared.  A year ago I was a normal dude with a family and great job and life. Now besides a job and my health (which I am SO grateful for) I have nothing. This is very hard to cope with. 

Advice would be really appreciated.",06Aug2020,1

490,"I've been doing school online since lock down started. It started fine until I started getting lazy and distracted on my computer. It built up to the point where I would just do 1 activity per day and just watch YouTube or play video games all day long. I would always tell myself: ""I'll just catch up tomorrow/next week"", but instead I just did nothing every single day.  


So I have about 2 months of missing work for 7 different subjects. I have been lying to my parents the whole time and guilt is just too much.   
My assignments and projects have all been submitted, but many very late and I am worried I might fail.   
There's 1 day before the term ends and my report card is coming. My parents have high expectations from me. I don't know what to do.

He came to visit his gf who is also a good friend of ours. 

We don’t have any spare rooms in the house, and my bf and I go to work. And today the brother asked my bf if he and his gf can crash in our room because they came from a trip and were really tired. 

Normally, I don’t mind people sleeping on my bed but having a couple there is making me extremely anxious and paranoid. 

I said yes to them staying there till we come back home but I’m so uncomfortable. The thing is I’ve witnessed them getting their freak on and it’s quite nasty, and I didn’t want that to happen in MY bedroom because it’s a sacred place for me.

498,"Hello my name is Sofia I'm 16 years old and I'm from Russia and I have 2 years to survive before my end.

A while ago I made one post in subreddit about immigration, but everything I got is a lot of downvotes and mainly got ignored. Like I got ignored by everything my whole life.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure what I should begin, but in short my current status:

* I have big problems with my family. Begining with no right to at least have a hair cut ending with dad that can get drunk, go back home and destroy everything, and beat my mom. Every day when both parents are home there are endless scandals and constant words about divorce.
* My mother always telling me about her problems since I was a little child. And keep talking like I was born to help her and at the same time, she can say why did I give birth to you. I sometimes respond with ""I didn't ask you to give birth to me""
* Even my little brother hates me, make fun of me, call me a girl, that I look like a girl (don't sure how I should react, because I'm transgender), can punch me... I mean will punch me.
* Also, I eating instant noodles and the cheapest food, because we don't earn very much, a few times we don't even have enough money to pay for rent.
* I crying for almost every day. And it's doesn't even matter when my parents saw it, like if it was ok to always cry.
* I have problems at my school. Not only school bullies have hated me, but also some teachers. Bullies can beat me with a big crowd and even if I going lye down they gonna kick me.
* I can't be myself. I can't have my own opinion, every opinion is done by my mother, I can't say It's bad, but sometimes I don't want to be a robot that does whatever they say with no rights to say ""I want"" or simply say ""no""
* I have no friends because they weren't my actual friends. I always used to be their doll with they can play. They betrayed me, they make fun of me.
* I have nightmares, my past is haunting me. It's made even one scar on my hand.
* If I don't escape this country I will be doomed. When I will be 18 there will be forced conscription that has a problem with ""Dedovshchina"". People like I don't survive there, in the Russian army, it's not for weak people.
* I tried to suicide, but I never go too far.
* No one even cares about me, most of the people that I know hate me, no one can help me, even I...
* I scared of everything, I can't even write to people online, I just scared of them.
* A lot of transphobes make fun of me almost every day.
* Every day I keep thinking about self-harm. And sometimes I do this.
* Every time I want to do something to help myself there is something that trying to stop me and if I try to avoid that everything will be even worse than before.
* I lost belief in humanity. I don't even sure if it even exists.
* My dysphoria is killing me, but with depression, it feels so bad. I can't look at the mirror.
* My country took last rights from trans people so I can't live here anymore
* I'm useless I can't do anything. I can't draw, I can't even complete even an easy target. I'm so stupid...
* I'm broken and I have no sense to live on. Should I continue?......

So this is a small portion of everything that happened to me. I going to tell you some stories and going to open some of these themes that I listed above. I'll begin with my parents. 

When I was 10 years old or less my dad always lost all money in casino on a slot machine. He worked as a guard in the same casino where he lost all money. Once he almost gave away our apartment like that.

Now we running out of money because of coronavirus. He was working at the hotel as a guard. The hotel went bankrupt and we didn't receive payment for 3 months. And he was working not legal there so we were totally dead.

Basically, we trying to survive (4 people) on around $544/month but as I said he loves to lose money so it's looking more like $408/month for 4 people but mainly even less. We need to use them to pay for two apartments that look like very bad, having two bad looking apartments in a bad city doesn't mean we rich. And also we need to pay for an extra apartment where we all live. Sometimes we are being sued for not paying at the right time.

Also, there was a stupid situation so we almost got homeless. My dad's father had our apartment, and so he cheated on my grandmother, who was not even close to me, I never saw her until I was 14 years old and eventually, a child was born, later my dad's father died and their family claimed inheritance, including our apartment, they were also rich and this angered me the most, like why they need our apartment in with we live, but also my mom telling about these problems to me. I was around 10.

The baby is one year old. His Parents: WE NEEAD AN APARTAMENT FOR HIM Because HE iS a bik Boi

We don't even have wallpapers before. Just empty walls actually that place still don't have wallpapers everywhere. Mainly, this was because my dad is lazy he doesn't do anything, he was doing only: Farting on the couch, playing video games on smartphone, annoys everyone, etc. Every hard work was done by my mother and with some of our help (kids)

My dad. He doesn't give a fuck about us. And he always will. He living only for himself and only for himself.

The due first month of quarantine in Russia I was eating only one time per day.

When we had no money, father was god knows where, we can't even live in our house at this moment we lived in grandma house and grandma can't even give money or support us somehow, so mainly we were hungry, 

So I hate my dad, but not my mom, she just trying to save us from our dad.

My mom trying to control my life, watching my every step, it continues to my 14 years old, then and for today she just annoys me with asking what I was doing today or who do I write to, etc.

Also, my mom sometimes trying to make suicide, and it's so hard to stop her, she just going to our medkit and start eating every drug. It's terrible.

My mom and my brother love to make fun of me. Trying to annoy me and made me cry. Telling jokes about me, and if I don't act like I don't care, they gonna make fun of me even more.

My mother almost every time very sick. She just sneezed and broken spine or something, she felt so bad, so she crying of pain I asked her for calling to a hospital, but she declines. Every time she looks like she gonna die right now she doesn't want to call for help to the hospital.

Yesterday (6th August) my mom almost set the whole house on fire, by putting a wooden circle on a gas stove and then a big bowl of bad soup, and then after a while, it ignited, and a great column of fire rose and a lot of smoke came out.

My dad drunk at least one time per week. He often loses his items such a phone because he literally can sleep under the fence of some house. He destroyed a lot of things in our house. The fridge still has traces of his punches. Rarely, but he can punch me. He doesn't love me at all, he loves only his second son.

Endless scandals. I don't even know what to say about it. I can't protect anyone anymore when dad is angry.

And things that always with me. Whatever someone does something bad, they told me that it was I. In a time of school it makes me wanna die because the whole class told the teacher that I PUNCH myself, poor bullies, how dare me!

While I was in my classroom due to math lessons, there was break time and I sat in my class since I don't have friends and reasons to go out. And then my classmate ran in class with words that I stole sled of some little kid, then class appears and say that's it's true and we saw you, then the school principal and homeroom teacher appeared and they saying that they got me and me in big trouble but God was on my side in this day and teacher start to debate with them how I can steal something while I'm in school sitting in this classroom! Thankfully she able to approve that they wrong. Actually, this is the first time and last time that someone saved me from hell. But all school already thinks that I stole a sled of little kid.

Also, they love to stalk me to my home and scream that I'm ""gay"" and ""pussy"" and other words. When I go downstairs they very often trip me up and then I fall very badly. They also love to hide my clothes so I stay in school for many hours to find my cloth.

I was in school bullies start to say that I miserable, doesn't deserve a feature and many things, but when I can't take it anymore and say something in their side they start to kick me with a crowd, I was laying down, and 4 people just keep kicking me, whole class watch this everyone was happy they said punch harder, kick harder! I think it just like forever.

But at some point it's ended, I can't feel anything, I don't even stand up, I just cried. Then the teacher walks in class and saw me. I think she was thinking ""oh no he\* is crying again!"". Then she said stand up and said go with me, I thought she will finally help me, but I was so wrong. She went with me to high school (I never was in there at this moment), to the headmaster of this school. I sat in her cabinet and she starts to scream at me that everyone got tired of you and you should die we will kick you from school because of your behaviors. I just crying and can't even listen to all the things that she said, I thought I just disappointed my mom. After 1 hour and more of scream at me she said stand up, we gotta go, I asked what do you mean? but don't get a response back. We walked outside with a fire exit door, there was a black tuned car and it has a lot of people inside. At this time I thought I'll die and I start to say sorry for everyone, but mainly for my mother. I thought we gonna ride in the forest because I never saw these places before, the whole road I just praying. No one is speaking. Finally, I saw my house, and parked at the entrance to the entrance (It looks like English doesn't have this word), she said to go out but gives me some document. I slowly walked upstairs, every step I felt worse and worse, and finally, when I was on the 5th floor I ring to door, my mom opened the door I gave her this document and when she asked me ""What happened?"" I started to cry again and fall on my bed. The document contains something about my expulsion from school. It was my worst day. You can say me, why you can't change school but in a place where I live before, there was only one school.

Is I'm a bad person? I'm always tried to help people and animals if I can.

I stop at least three people and my mother of suicide in real life.. don't sure if this counts...

I destroyed a lot of ""columbine"" community everywhere I can and trying to help people, change their minds. So I stop many people of suicide and killing everyone in schools.

There was a thing as 'The Groups of Death' most popular was ""Blue whale"". It was a game in real life where you do some tasks, but then it quickly flows into tasks like ""cut your wrist"" and so on. The ending of this game is to kill yourself, doesn't matter with way, but mainly it's just jumping from a rooftop. I was horrified about this, so I had an idea to create an anti-group of death called ""Pink Flamingo"". Everything was fine, I helped a lot of people, make therapy for them, give advice, and at the end of the game you should be alright and happy, there was no real end. But in one day my group was banned from Vkontakte as I remember for this reason: I created a group of death. Bravo, they even block my own page almost permanent, it was hard to restore it, it was a special ban.

I really remember that I made a lot of happy birthday congratulations on things in windows movie maker to everyone... I was 8 years old or less... I always helped grandmothers, carrying their products, or moving them across the road.

Some bullies wanted to kick poor cat to death, I don't let them do that, so they kicked me... BUT hey! I saved a cat!

When I had internet ""friends"" we had a community, I called it ""TeaTown community"", we were like a big family, I helped to everyone there, they need something I give it to them and a lot of other things, yes they kinda don't like me because I always want to help everyone and it annoys them. And in one day we built a big city with a 10+ player population and I started this community brick by brick with a new friend (everyone knew them even before I appear there) and in one day after a month of friendship he just asks me to add his friend to private since I don't know him and I was scared of security and for everyone, I said no! They start to scream on me and call me a pussy and such and I add him under this pressure and then they immediately kill me and destroyed my house and storehouse of the city I was broken they even used cheats so I can't fight with them. But it's not all, they told something to all of my friends, and everyone started to hate me and they start to don't trust me. I managed to get a little bit of their trust and I became a part of this community again. I build a church and live in there. I still helped to everyone. But in one day someone busted me, he gives access to church to those two who grief me before and then they destroyed my church, no items survived. I actually have a few footages where they were cheating and griefing. Actually, I showed it to admins. And guess what? I got permanently banned. They bought the admins. The main conflict is very stupid, to solve it I need to apologize for not letting them grief me and don't add them immediately to private. Also one of them always saying something I'm a god and you're nothing.

When I finally realized that I'm transgender, I made a coming out and every friend that I have, even my best friend start to hate me even gay one and it made me feel very bad. A was lone for a month and since I can't find new friends I tried to go back to them. They made a lot of transphobic things like burning the trans flag, mis-pronouns me and everything, but in one day they reach something above of normal, when I died I teleported in a strange place, they made a test lab that I need to pass, they gave me adventure mode, some of them was in spectator mode, my ""best friend"" was behind glass, they said hello and then look in the chest I saw a pufferfish that named ""Trans have no right"" they say eat it. I eat it, don't sure why. The next thing was a potion, that I need to drink to be female, but unfortunately, It doesn't work and I got aids, then they give me a wooden pickaxe and said to dig obsidian... 4 blocks of obsidian with a wooden pickaxe, sick bastards! Then there was another room with insane hard parkour. After a while, I passed it and I got into another room where I should choose one of three answers, in fact, some of them were not transphobic like there was a question about Kazahstan with dates. At the end of the quiz, they hide the right answer behind me, so it should make me confused, once it solved I went to the final room. I saw to ""dicks"" and my best friend said choice dick, sit and die, there was a big black one with racism on a sign that gonna destroy all my organs because it's a big and sticky white one with gonna pull out my guts and made me die. I don't remember what I chose, but it was horrible we was a friend for many years and then they do this? How sad, even my ""best friend""

Since that, I don't really have friends anymore.

All my classmates around me in school used drugs and they were very bad and none of them want to be my friend. This why I never had a friend in real life. Everyone in real life was very bad, many of them were in police stations already. Even girls were bad, they drunk too much and engaged in prostitution.

All the people I knew had a boyfriend/girlfriend/whatever at some point, but I never had, so they very shooked when they knew this fact, but I don't think I need that, I don't think I need something, maybe I just don't deserve life. In fact, I don't even sure with sexual orientation is I or do I even want to have someone.

I hate to remember the place where I lived before because of school, memories, and thing like:

I just going to home from school and then from nowhere on a large speed a big van is riding on the sidewalk not even giving any sign. I jumped out at the last moment. It still gives me nightmares. 

Or like when someone kicked me in school when I was going downstairs and then when I was going home someone walking far away and scream that I'm ""faggot"" and other words but then I saw two small dogs. Nothing special, but then huge dogs start to appear from nowhere and I start thinking about going back and find another way to go home, but when I turn my head I realized I already surrounded by huge evil dogs that barked and growled at me and then ran sharply at me. A big crowd of dogs surrounded me and chased me all over the city and I was running for my life, most of these dogs were huge, and I ran from almost 20 dogs. Honestly, I don't know why they can't catch me and where most of them gone when I was pretty close to my home, but it's doesn't matter. Yes and I cried and scream the whole road to home.

Just a typical day of my life. Mainly when I home I'll be saved. But every time I outside. Something bad is going to happen.

Also, teachers called me rude words and lower my grades. Imagine being a kid and the teacher call you a bag of shit that can't do anything.

I was in this place a week ago and I was praying to my mother to not go there, but she starts to say I never coming outside and I should ride or else I can say bye to my laptop. We stuck there for three days we just should be there for one day. We don't even have pillows or blankets. And I meet old school bullies that start to make fun of me one of them even punches me. He called me ""faggot"" again like in past. It was a nightmare. Everyone hates me there. My little brother hates me because I want to leave this nightmare as fast as I can, but he wants to be there for a longer time. I actually made a wrong thing later. 

I wanted to escape and my reason for that was If stay there even more I will kill myself because so many horrifying memories' was there. I just walked to a train station, so basically I escaped from a mom and my little brother. And a bully from school walked to me, I didn't saw him and he said ""Fuck you"" and then he punches me in a face. Well then since I have no money with me right now (and always), so I have a ""perfect"" Idea to walk to my city on foot (48KM to the final station and also a long way to the city), but I just walked just one station is about 4km from there and I got already tired, but also at this moment I realize that I don't have keys for the apartment and also I need to go another 10+ stations + another more things I don't think of, so I went back.

The second reason I do so is that my mom and my brother start to make jokes about me and I just can't stand it.

I returned to a nightmare place and we got stuck here. I still feel very bad.

Actually, this isn't a serious escape because in one-day whole class the whole day made fun of me by calling me with bad words, they tripped me, they spat paper at me, and do much more. And the teacher remarked not to them but ME. I wonder why??? Then everything like in a fog. It was the end of the lesson and someone made my cry, I run out of class and saw fire exit, with tears, I very fast open this door and ran out of school, they tried to stop me, they even grab my backpack, but I ran away. So next I was thinking about getting drown or just die in the forest, maybe even of starving to death, but temporarily I hide somewhere and lay down there. It was a very cold autumn. I don't even wear a jacket and I was alone, thinking about suicide and the end of me, I was laying on trash, I even thought about live like a hobo, Because I can't live like that anymore. My mom can't do anything to help me she can't do it to end. So bullies can't get punished because of that. I always was in bruises. Even more, bullies have come up with an offensive nickname for me because of which I want to change my last name. The worst part that this thing also works in English and almost in every country, because this word sounds almost the same even though it writes very differently.

My poor relatives made me feel very sad and bad, but not every one of them. Looking at an old, lonely grandfather it's so heartbreaking, it's so awful to see a poor uncle stricken with a stroke and other can laugh on the situation, it's so wrong... also recently grandfather killed a cat... he put it somewhere and close it... he doesn't even feed it... a week passed... and then he opened a place where he put cat... but it's already almost died... on next day cat just died.....

Well, I don't do anything bad. I always tried to help people. But everything I received from them it just hates and other sad things. Nothing good. Yes, I made bad stuff and I apologize for that. I apologize that I was born. Wow, it hurt so much. I upset my parents. And I will upset them even more.

Teachers say there is no way I saying the truth because I can't always be ""White and fluffy"". I mean no one even trusts me for some reason. My friends busted me.

I always, every day, for many years keep talking to my parents that I'm going to make suicide, but they say that I don't saw a real-life, I don't live enough, and what kind of troubles you can even have in this age?

My family and other people keep told that my life is not the worst and I can agree. They can say the other one lives is worse than me, you at least have food, water, and a roof overhead, people from Africa are very poor, do you think about them? Yes, often think about poor people and that they need more help than me in fact I'm living very well in their background.

When I was a child I was thinking about writing a book about my life and write it when I will grow up, but now I don't find this idea very good. In fact, it's very stupid. I always feel stupid. Everyone thinks I'm stupid, retarded, or something. And I can kinda agree with them.

And I can't help myself because something will stop me and made feel me even worse and no one can help me. Every time I want to make animation, website, or whatever my programs got crashed, light turn off for the whole house, I lost internet connection, I got lost files or even worse corrupted because it most painful and any possible way to stop me from working that you can imagine.

I know odd people that sometimes can come from nowhere and write something odd. Something about eggs, something about fursuits while why do I in the world even want to know the cost of this? I don't hear you for months and you come back and say interesting how much fursuit is a cost or even ""docking"", various sort of things. There were only people that I talked with for like 5 months. I feel so terrible. For some things, I feel like I was raped and I don't even kidding.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure about what I should begin, but the current status that I'm suffering from Bullies, of my Family, of my Government, and what is going on in my country.

I tried to find transgender friends in Russia, but then I realized that it's an almost impossible challenge since most of them not just dressing and do other staff. Even when I saw an infinite number of almost always gross people I find the right thing, but even there I find bad people. One of them was younger than me he was 15 years old and then after a long conversation he said that he gives jobs to his boyfriend and do such things and send me some images, I try to change his mind, but he doesn't want to listen to me, he just enjoy that. And other transgenders I found were good people, but they weren't sure if they were transgender, but it still better than nothing. They never called me a friend in fact when I asked, they answer that we, not friends. And it broke my heart... I realized that I never had friends.

I scared to start to speak with anyone. When I don't speak everything usually better. So I can't say even a single word. 

Almost every night I have a nightmare about someone is trying to catch me and I trying to escape. It could be everything and mainly I ran in deserted places even if there should be a lot of people in them. The alternative ending is the screamer version so I can't even run for a while before screamer, I instantly got caught. Also there another type of dream where I walking on familiar but very changed places, most scary that before it had many people, but since every dream there less and fewer people, and everything got weirder and weirder, so everything change, even more, some building is destroying random big holes that always in random place start appear, world start to less looking to real and more have strange odd colors. I walking alone in an odd and scary world and getting die every time. The third type of dream is when I can't help someone, someone died and everything, recently I have only this type of dream.

I need to notice that I'm MtF transgender. I notice it that late because I still scared. I want to escape from this endless nightmare, start a new life from a blank page, and finally be myself. But looking at others' lives gives me a thing. I can't complain about this. A lot of people living even worse than me. 

I never talk to a psychotherapist because I was always scared to know to door or just make an appointment. But it has almost no sense, I'll just break my life forever by visiting a psychotherapist because there's almost no way to apply for a job because no one gonna takes a person who visited a psychotherapist. And most of them transphobes, so they gonna hurt me. The other one can't help me since the government looking for rights from transgenders.

I stuck in a circle of self-harm and writing a suicide note. I don't even strong enough to write this post, it was a nightmare for me. And I need to escape this country as fast as I can, because I can't take it any longer, people like me gonna die there.

I say almost nothing about I got bullied on the internet every day or how my government is worst in the world, I tired and you should know that I don't fully talk even about parents, friendship themes.

I feel like a bug without limbs that can't move and do something. Everyone else can draw, programming, make music, and basically anything else. I can't do anything everything that I made is just awful. My poems, lyrics for songs, my site...

I hate the way I look. I can't look in the mirror. I think I'm fat, I hate my voice, I hate how tall I am, I hate my haircut, I hate that I can't control my life, My face and whole body, The way I talk, The way I write. I want to have HRT and control my life so much.

I can't stand for myself and no one can. I can't help myself and no one can.

Everything I can do is repeatedly dying every day. And trying to not kill me. I didn't do anything to deserve all of this. I didn't do anything wrong. 

I need your help I ask you to find a way to help me! I can't live here anymore, I need to get out.

She even tried to tell me they washed their sheets last week! They've been on a binge for longer than that, I know for a fact those sheets haven't been washed in MONTHS! I refuse to touch their bedsheets because, well, yuck.

The worst part is that they have a fan in their window that points towards the door and is always on, so it's pushing the smell out into the hallway and into my room.

I try to tell them that of course they can't smell it because their noses are numb to it, but they claim I'm being mean. How the hell do I get through to them?? I'm tired of having to cover my nose with a blanket everytime I step out of my room.",06Aug2020,1
504,"Hello r/Advice
Throwaway account since some of my friends use Reddit.
I understand that my problem here is not considered that serious, but please, I would love to hear some feedback as I have dwelt with this so many years with no end.

I (25M) have a friend (25F) who I have known for almost 9 years and have a crush on her since. We will call her Maria.

Maria visits my hometown every summer for at least a month and me and my friends hang out with her almost every day as she is a good friend of ours. We spend good and valuable time together (in many cases just the two of us) and have shared great memories.

Thing is, I like her from the first day that I met her at age 16 
For almost 10 years now, I try to see her as only a friend (which I do sometimes) but eventually my feelings for her keep coming back to me, and that's when my whole mood spirals down and I become miserable.
I would also try to get her to like me almost every summer despite having confessed my feelings for her 5 years ago (in which she turned me down, admitted that she is in love with one of my best friends and sees me only as a friend).

I am confused, I have little to no experience with women and I believe that hanging out with her just makes me miserable.
I feel almost stuck to my 16yo self with this girl, despite trying over and over to convince myself i don't like her and that I see her as a friend.

It is kind of hard for me to write all of these down, but please can someone give me anything on the whole situation. It gets harder also not being able to talk about it with my friends.",06Aug2020,1

Any normal person wouldn’t tolerate the LIST of things they do/say on a DAILY &amp; I’m honestly baffled at how they even still have their jobs?!??

I need both of my jobs right now...we just moved to a bigger place=bigger rent. Both places are extremely flexible &amp; because we don’t have childcare or reliable family for our daughter... this is just a really big help/plus.
It’s still a pandemic so I know they probably can’t afford to lose their incomes(cause shit, i know i cant) so I feel like I can’t contact HR. It keeps me up at night thinking about how horrible that would be but at the same time... the way they talk to me &amp; others keeps me up at night feeling really low.
Management does nothing and my anxieties are just breaking me down more &amp; more everyday....

508,"So a couple weeks ago I(19F) broke things off with my boyfriend(23M). He dms a girl Ik and complements her, when I confronted him about it he brushed it off saying it was just a compliment and that he meant nothing by it. He later went on to say he did it out of spite because he knew it would puss me off, because I had made him jealous by having a guy friend of mine help me move . Caught him in a lie cause he had no way of knowing Ik this girl, I’ve never mentioned her or even shown him a picture. When I confronted him about that and he said “ it’s fucked up ik, there is no excuse for it” 

The next day I broke up with him, but I wanted to talk about things before it got to that point. It’s been 3 weeks since then and ignored my text message and hasn’t said a word to me since. We still have each other on snap but he has unfollowed me on ig but he’s still following her. I’m really hurt by this not only did he make me feel insecure about myself, but he went from loving me one minute to now acting like I don’t exist. He watches me snap but has not said a word, deep down I wish he would. 

I wake up everyday wit this pain in my chest.... he's all I think about. When I go to sleep I dream about him. I miss him and I’m really hurting. I’ve cried, I have contemplated what to do to get him back. I loved this man, but don’t know where to go from here.

511,"Background: We knew each other for a few years through mutual friends. We dated for about 2 months and broke up two weeks ago. The main issue is that I can come of as rude sometimes, and that I didn't reach out enough to her about the everyday things(ie: how is work? etc.) There was also an issue wherein her best friend doesn't like me. I didn't like the best friend because I found her manipulative. Funnily enough after talking to her the other day she has actually cut off this friend because she finally realized that.

We broke up a week ago, and I reached out to her the Saturday after to talk about it and told her I didn't feel great about the break up. We went out for dinner, and before we went home I sat and talked to her about the relationship. I cleared up how I felt and what the reasons were for the breakup. They were mainly that I didn't communicate super well with her during the relationship, which is completely true, and that sometimes I can be rude to people(which is true, and I need to fix. I have no real excuse for this behavior). She admitted I had never been rude to her ever, but I was rude to the girl that was at that point her best friend.

We discussed everything that went wrong and I apologized for making her feel unwanted/undesired during the relationship. She was crying during some of this, and actually discussed some trauma with me from her last relationship. This made me realize why she was so quick to jump ship and why she was so anxious about not getting reached out to more. It also made me understand why she was a bit scared to speak up and communicate when she had a problem. She said she needs to think about it and she seemed genuine. I asked her if she wanted space or for me to reach out and keep talking to her and she asked for us to keep talking.

That very night she sent me some Polaroids of us that her friend had dropped off and said look how great they look. I spoke to her a bit that night and said goodnight. I talked to her the next day about I hike I went on and asked her when she was free. She said she was busy during the day Wednesday and free at night. Wednesday was my birthday and I told her I'd love to see her and she should come over for a fire where I'm having a few buddies.

Her response to this invite was that ""Thank you:), but It's probably best if you just hang out with your friends, I don't want to get in the way of anything""

I took this as she has no interest. Then when yesterday came she still reached out with a ""Happy Birthday!!! Hope you have a great day!"" with a bunch of emojis. This was around noon and I didn't reply till later that night because I still feel like it's just her being friendly and not genuine interest. I simply replied ""Thanks (Her Name)"" and I didn't ask her about her day.

I feel like if she had any real interest she would of offered another day to hang out, or said how bout we do this instead, etc. She had said she'll probably make her decision in a day or two after we had Dinner on Monday. I'm assuming it's a she's not interested and she just didn't want to ruin my birthday.

Do you think it's a waste of time to still talk to this girl? Should I have been kinder when she said happy birthday or reached out more? Or should I just leave the ball in her court? Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

tldr; Ex and I date 2 months. Break up. Talk about it and she says she might give it another shot, but then doesn't want to see me. She doesn't propose any other day but still wishes me a happy birthday and I just say thanks back. Should I leave the ball in her court or reach out and continue talking.

The day that it happened I was filled with all this regret and sadness... and I still feel it today.

I feel as though I’ve wasted 3 years of my life. She’s already having a kid and I haven’t been in a relationship since then... in a way I feel scared that I’ll end alone? Maybe the fact that she’s having a baby makes it... worse, you know? When she got married i didn’t think anything of it, but now... I’m just confused... I mean, should I be in a relationship too?

516,"I’m sorry if this comes across as confusing, as the situation is pretty confusing to me as well. 

For a bit of context, I was terrified of the family cat when I was younger, between the ages of eleven and fourteen. I don’t know why but she really freaked me out to the point where I wouldn’t want to go home after school because I knew she would be there. She always used to come into my room at night (I would shut the door but my older brother was a jackass and he would open it to let her in even though he knew I hated her) and in the dark I would hear her purr or something and it frightened me so much that I couldn’t move and wouldn’t sleep. As a solution my parents would lock her outside at night (I know this probably isn’t great pet care but that’s how bad it got) and occasionally she would meow and yowl outside my window, which was even more terrifying because I felt like she was doing it to spite me. I accept that it was a pretty irrational fear. I was uneasy around other cats, but wasn’t as afraid of them as mine.

Anyway, she died and we buried her in the back garden. I’m now nineteen and I still have a small phobia of cats but it’s mostly fine. The only people who knew how bad it used to be are my immediate family (my mom, dad, older brother, and younger sister).

We’ve been having work done on the back garden because my dad wants to put a small pond back there, and they had to dig up most of it. I made a joke at my mom that they’d better make sure they didn’t dig up the cat, and she basically told me that the cat hadn’t died, that they’d given her away. She then told the same thing to my brother and sister as well, because they didn’t know this either.

The crux of the matter is that now I’m hearing meowing sounds outside my window again in the middle of the night exactly like beforw, and i’m 90% sure it’s my fucking older brother being a dickhead, but it literally scares me so much that I just freeze up in bed and don’t move. I have no proof that it’s him but it literally has to be. I want to confront him, but I don’t know the best way to go about it because he’s a next level manipulator and he will deny everything I say. Also I’m too old to go ‘crying to mommy’ but this does make me feel like such a little kid. I’m so frustrated that I feel this scared in my own house again, but it was so bad when I was little that if I bring anything up now, I’ll look crazy. Any advice on how I should tackle this situation?

517,"This situation makes me so mad.. my boyfriend has a child with his ex (I love his child she loves me she’s adorable) but when asking him about the whole situation, the details of it piss me off to no end. 

She lied to him saying she wasn’t able to get pregnant, all because her previous boyfriend before him was trying to get her pregnant and wasn’t able to. He told me she literally had a breakdown about it. She asked him numerous times if he wanted kids and he said not yet, I want to be married first. He made it clear he wasn’t ready, was focused on his career, and wanted to be married. 

Two days later while he’s breaking up with her they find out she’s pregnant. She gave their child her last name, not his, probably as a slap in his face that he didn’t marry her. The maternity photos they took together she’s wearing a white dress, probably to pretend to look like a bride even though she wasn’t one. She made him kneel down on one knee and kiss the baby bump in one of the photos, probably to replicate a proposal type photo.

This all happened in another state, he only went to this state to get sober, never planned on staying. He said it was a miserable relationship, she was super controlling, and only stayed because she got pregnant. He tried to make the relationship work for their daughter but after she was born she cheated on him. Probably because he wasn’t going to marry her and she knew it. She was so controlling and she knew he wasn’t going to be what she wanted so she found another guy to control. Anyway, after this happens he moves away. They have a child support and visitation agreement set up. After he moved away she moves in with the guy she cheated on him with. 3 years later, their child is calling this guy daddy, he “pops her booty” when she’s bad, and every time we spend time with her she mentions she doesn’t like this other daddy and that he “pops her booty.” 

After looking at his ex’s Facebook a bit I noticed her older sister had a child a year or so before my boyfriend and his ex did. I have a feeling she just wanted to get pregnant and have a child because her sister did. The fact that her ex before my boyfriend was trying to get her pregnant, and her older sister who she’s close with had a child, give me the impression she just wanted to have a child. She also got on birth control after their child was born. So she knows birth control and gynecologists exist but she doesn’t use any of them until AFTER having a child?? How convenient. She never goes to the doctor to check her fertility?? She asks my bf if he wants kids TWO DAYS before he breaks up with her and she springs the pregnancy on him?? How convenient. 

My boyfriend loves his child to death, and I kept telling him it really sounds like she baby trapped him. He said regardless of how his daughter came into this world he loves her and I agree with him, I think it’s great that he pays his child support and is active in his daughters life regardless of what this woman did to him. 

What she did to him is reproductive coercion and it’s a form of sexual abuse. The fact she was so controlling of him during their relationship proves she’s got tendencies and personality traits to do something like this. I had to go to their daughters bday party and meet this girl and every time we FaceTime with his daughter and she’s in the background I just hate this woman. I’m cordial with her, I’m nice to her, I haven’t added her on Facebook or sent her any messages (don’t plan to). I don’t plan on getting in any arguments with this woman, for my boyfriends sake and his daughters sake I refuse to lose my cool. I just needed a place to vent because after everything he told me it just makes me really hate this woman. A child is not a pawn in a love game, it should be something both partners talk about and want. Parenthood is not something that should be used as a control tactic in a shitty relationship, it’s something that both partners should agree upon. Thank you for listening.",06Aug2020,1
518,So I don't party and I don't do drugs. I don't like to drink and I don't like to do illegal things. My friend and I decided to go get taco Bell at like 12 a.m. and we sat out next to the railroad tracks and watched the trains that we're going by and just talked. My mom kicked me out for literally just going out and doing that.

524,"this is gonna be sort of long winded, so buckle in i guess 

so essentially, i’ve got pretty bad abandonment issues, to the point where i can be quite manipulative without even realising. it’s something that i’m working on. in the past it got me kicked out of a friendship group who i reconnected with again around a year later after the incident. the incident honestly traumatised me and continues to fuck with my perception of my relationships, however i’m glad that it happened in the sense that i wouldn’t have changed for the better if it hadn’t happened. 

anyway, i sorta got the paranoid inkling that my friends were going to abandon me again or hated me. i felt like such an outsider from the group in comparison to my friend E, who i brought into the group. she’s known them for barely a year and is closer to them than i am. i just didn’t know what i was doing wrong and i definitely felt more and more like an outsider the more i would hang out with them. 

i would ask them to come over sometimes (i live on my own due to some circumstances that i won’t get into, which is bingo if you’re a teenager) and not a lot of people would show interest despite some of them saying how good it’ll be to have people over often. the real kicker is when i asked who wanted to come to my 17th birthday party (mind you it was a week in advance) like 3 people from said friendship group said they’d come (this is out of 10+) some of them have jobs and genuinely would have come if they could’ve, but some said they were busy when i know they bloody well weren’t. i understand that they can choose not to go if i’m having something on and that’s okay but like cmon it’s my birthday. 

anyway, one guy in the group, J is a weird character. i know he can be a good person but he’s too much of a dick to try. he has a thing for using girls constantly (including me) with the guise of “aha i don’t really want a relationship rn” despite going to hook up with the same girl at every party (whom is my friend). anyway J for some reason just starts acting as if he hates me. like when we all did mdma together i asked him to bring a vitamin (5htp) that would help with the comedown cause i’d been already going through a particularly rough time. i asked him twice to bring it. one of those times was literally the night before. and he didn’t bring it. he didn’t even say goodbye to me while he did to everyone else. 

i brought this up with M and A (A is particularly close with J) and A was trying to back him up for everything despite me telling her all the shit things he’s done to me in the past. i remember telling her that i asked him if he hated me over text to which he left me on read. i even remember saying to him that i just wanted to know what i’ve done wrong but he still left me on read

so one night i get quite drunk and start getting angry at E cause i thought that everyone had had kickons at J’s and just hadn’t invited me cause they all hated me or something. she told me this wasn’t true and i went off saying everyone in that group was a cunt particularly A and J. i ended up having to go to hospital that night cause i was quite suicidal. i told her in those texts i didn’t want to sit with them at school anymore if they’re all going to kiss up to J and that A was a complete bitch and that was that. 

anyway, now it’s been a few weeks and i don’t know if i’ve done the right thing. don’t get me wrong i think A is still quite bitchy but i should’ve confronted her instead of going off about her to E. i also worry that they’ve taken E’s explanation of my side which is flawed considering i was drunk. 

so should i apologise to A? cause i honestly miss that group a lot. i still talk with some of them in class but i miss being in that group a lot. i have a lot of good memories with them 

tldr; should i apologise to someone who i think is a bitch to make amends with them so i can be with a friend group that in the past has (not directly) made me feel insecure/like an outsider?",06Aug2020,1
525,"No, this doesn;t have anything to do with the pandemi because before that, I used to \*wish\* I was alone all the time. I had depression and social anxiety... Being alone was the most ccomfortable for me.

As I've started to get treatment in March, my mood started to get so so much better. I don't run away from people anymore, I'M the one chasing them now. I live with my mom and brothers, I've fought with most of the household and now I'm shutting myself of in my bedroom. It feels like prison...

And if you ask why I fought with my family? Well, I guess I annoyed them for seeking to much attention. I guess they don't appreiciate me or care for me since none of them talked to me since the fight.

As for friends, I'm kinda shy to always be the one intiating conversation... I don't want to annoy them too -.- I just don't know what to do with myself. If I died in my bedroom no one would know about me until they smell the decaying of my body... Well, there are some people that I met online...

526,"I've been banking with a credit union (Desert Financial) for over ten years. I have a savings and money market account with them. I never touch these accounts. I also bank with another Credit union that I use everyday expenses for. 
 In February for the first time I was alerted of  fraudulent transactions in my savings account. I was promted to text yes for fraud or no for legit. I typed yes and had my card frozen. I called the bank asap and disputed the charges on my account. I noted that all of the ATM withdrawals were very near my house I also wondered how someone could have gotten my card and suspected it was stolen out of the mailbox so I requested no card be sent to my house.  They credited my account with the lost funds and I diligently checked all through April and it was uneventful. Then in May Large amounts were withdrawn almost everyday for the next three months. No alerts were sent to me at all. I randomly signed into my app and found my account was drained. I know...I should have been checking and that was my fault.
 I called the credit union right away and filed a police report in the same hour. Froze my credit reports. Put a fraud alert out on all three as well. 
The fraud department was sure it was someone I live with and at the time I suspected my niece but didn't know who it was really. They told me a number that I didn't recognize and I wrote it down. Turns out it was my niece who had moved in with me and my mother in December 2019.  She called the credit union, pretended to be me, ordered a card and used it to drain my account. I am definitely persuing prosecution.

2-3 years ago a male friend (H- I've known for 10 years) of mine accidentally sent a photo of dick pressed tightly in his boxers over snapchat to my wife (P- she and I have been together for 10+ years). She told me about it immediately and that he claimed multiple times it was supposed to go to his own girlfriend (T) at the time. I thought nothing else of it, didn't hear anything else about it and figured that if that's what he and his girlfriend want to do, who cares, it was an accident anyways. 

Over the next couple years we all still hung out with our circle of friends, nothing else going on that I knew about. Over this time I learned more about their H's relationship with his girlfriend, T, of 5+ years (he is about 4 years older than her, met when she was 16 or so). Turns out they have an open relationship and he likes to see T sexually with other men, as in he specifically requests she do it. Again, no big deal to me what they do behind doors, doesn't bother me in the slightest if that's how they have fun.
H and T got married last year. 

Fast forward to now-ish. Last week another friend (Z) within my circle received a meme from H about perks of an open relationship. H immediately apologized over the message, saying again it was intended for his now wife and Z essentially had the same attitude about it as me - if you all want to do that, cool, whatever. H then goes on to continue to say how embarrassed T would be if she found out he sent that message. Z says how it's ok and not to worry about it, leaving it at that. H continues to press on in the conversation, asking if she was curious about what he and T did together with other people, asking if Z wanted to see some photos, and then mentions how he sent P (my wife) a photo ""accidentally"" to see her reaction. He says P said his wife T was a ""lucky girl"" - P never said this and people that know her know that she wouldn't.  When Z did not reply further, H continued to send other messages to her, guilting her to try and continue the conversation. She never reciprocated or expressed interest in receiving more photos or continuing the conversation, but never explicitly told him to stop. 

When Z brought this up to my wife the other day to see if H had said anything to her about this stuff , more details came out. Though it had not been for about a year or so, it turns out that H had also been doing the same thing with P after he sent her that first photo, trying to lure P into talking to him about all of the details she didn't care to hear. She said that he also sent snaps of everyday stuff specifically framed to have his dick in the frame (covered with pants). Also snaps were sent of him doing things like driving and in tiny text at the corner it would say 'send nudes'. Both P and Z talked further and it he had been using the exact same language with P in those snap conversations, trying to bait her into talking more about these things. The language could be called playful enough that he could argue he didn't mean anything about it but I feel like reading between the lines he was choosing his wording very specifically. Lots of ""ha"" or ""just saying"". We do not know what his end goal was here, as no one entertained his conversations for more info. He never asked them for sexual favors but always wanted to divulge and talk about his own sex life and his open relationship.

Now H and T are married with their first little one due later this year. To my understanding their open relationship was supposed to stop after their marriage but here we are. I have a close knit circle of friends and after all of this going on, P and Z are planning on telling T about the messages they received. To our knowledge T doesn't know that we all know about their open relationship and while it may embarrass her (she acts much shyer about her sex life), we feel she has the right to know what's happening. We are worried for her that if we cut off H that she will be without anyone to support her emotionally. Not to mention we figure if cut H out then there's a chance we may never see her again. 
Additionally, I am slightly torn on how to do it, but I feel as if I need to essentially exile H from my group of friends. I have no sympathy for what he did and despise his behavior and for cornering my wife and Z in these conversations (as they both said they were mistakenly being too polite to explicitly tell him no, or to stop talking as they didn't want to make things awkward in the future). Z has said her husband will never want to see H again. Do I give H a chance to be forgiven? Does H just have no boundaries and those need to be laid out? Am I stupid for even considering forgiving him?

He did this intermittently over a year with my wife and now my friend, this is his bed and now he has to lay in it. What should I say?

tldr; Old friend of mine sexually harassed my wife and another dear friend of mine. Am I right/wrong to exile him and his wife from my circle of friends? Is it dumb to forgive? How do I boot him?",06Aug2020,1

551,"Every time I get an e-mail, chat or social media message I feel the need to respond immediately. This has been going on for 25+ years and I've reached the point where it's affecting my ability to work uninterrupted for long stretches of time. I realise I have limited time on this planet and I am tired of wasting it like that.

How do I ignore people? How do I build a routine that will help me balance ""being there"" for others with being able to work long stretches of time, without my brain being the no. 1 enemy?

I've been struggling with this for years, and the best solution I've found is to add a high barrier to entry - leaving the phone in another room, isolating e-mail in a separate computer, removing all notifications and distractions. Once I get ""in the zone"", I pretty much forget about anything and am blissfully working away until I get stuck, and then I remember about checking things. But this is an exception; I can't make it stick. 

This has become a problem of [unpredictable reward](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-variable-rewards-addictive) for which there's plenty of studies to show how it's particularly addictive. 

I've tried ots of things - screen time on phones, the pomodoro technique, giving myself planned breaks, quit various social media apps, but I just can't build a routine for long enough that it becomes a habit - I always fall back to checking all the messaging apps ""in case someone needs me"". I can't get rid of some apps as they are the only way for some good friends and family to get in touch (I live in a different country).

I'm looking for something that can help long-term; I've been pretty much connected to the Internet in various forms for the past 25 or so years, and the only constant in my life has been being ""always there"" to answer to people. From BBSs to IRC to Kuro5hin and Slashdot to Facebook and Whatsapp, I've always been ""connected"". I've founded communities, helped dozens of people in various fields, been a teacher and a mentor; but I do miss being able to work, undisturbed, for long periods of time. And my brain seems to be constantly in the way. 

For contest, my job involves a bit of digital interactions (I work in IT) but I have many colleagues who just ignore e-mail and chat for hours if not days, and I truly admire their ability of not giving a fuck.",06Aug2020,1
552,"I apologize for the lack of coherence in this post. I'm a mess right now.

I am a 27 year old female from a conservative Muslim family.

All my life I've lived for my parents and I'm still not remotely enough for them. There isn't a single thing that I've accomplished that they've given me credit for. To the contrary, they're always accusing me of hurting them for making small mistakes. 

At the same time, I believe I am obligated by God to be a dutiful daughter. I know this is a lost concept in today's time. But I still recognize that I've completely lost the sense of having my own separate identity outside of my parents' servant. 

I'm tired and extremely resentful for not being able to live the life I wanted.

 And honestly, if I didn't have such strong faith in God I would probably take my own life. Why the hell should I live if I have no control over anything? Everything happens to me rather than me being an active participant. Why should I live if I can't live? I know that sounds like an odd question but I mean it. I don't feel alive. I feel like I'm surviving and playing a role. I don't even know who I am or what I want. I have no sense of identity. 

I also don't want to lose my parents. I love them. Even if they don't love me unconditionally like I do for them. They think I don't love them for choosing to live for myself. They directly correlate it to me being a bitch. 

It's a lose lose situation. I stay with them and resent the fucking shit out of my life and drown under the weight of this misery or I leave them and have no family and leave behind everything I know. 

I'm miserable thinking about all the years I've wasted my potential. This is without a doubt the most difficult predicament of my entire life. 

What do I do? Are my hands tied? I've lost the will to live. I hate myself so much it's unbearable.

PS - I am seeing a therapist next week. I've accepted that this a big deal and I probably need (a lot) of professional help.",06Aug2020,1
553,"My dad hadn’t spoken to his dad for years, and I never met my grandfather. When my grandfather died, he left money to his four other sons, and then split what would have been my father's between myself and my four siblings (when I was around 8).

I remember having a discussion (well, being told by my parents) that that money was rightfully my father's, and as each of us turned 18, we signed that money over to them. My parents used the money to move the family abroad, and to buy a run down house they've never visited in a different country. They're now looking at buying another rundown house in a different country.

Some of that money is now sitting in my account (for an unrelated reason, they couldn't have the amount in one account) with the understanding I'll give it back to them when needed. But.... should I?

I'm in therapy for childhood emotional abuse, as is my brother. My parents have threatened to cut my brother off before because he asked to borrow money to buy glasses and shoes when he was out of work.

But basically what I mean is that every time we hang out, eat out or do anything in public, she finds a way to get mad over something and then more often than not, she goes to complain about it. Like last weekend we went out for a brunch and she wanted to talk to the manager because they forgot to heat up her wrap, she could’ve literally just asked them to heat it up, it’s not like it couldn’t be fixed anymore. Or one time at a grocery store, there was a long line and she loudly complained about it for 15 minutes, like nobody needs to listen to that... About a year ago, we were traveling together and she lost something on the plane, managed to call the flight attendant with the button 20+ times and threatened to sue the airline company. Another time, we went to a restaurant and they were out of her favorite cake so she loudly argued with the waitress then she wanted to speak to the manager plus she ended up leaving bad reviews for the restaurant all over yelp and google. And another time at the bar, she spilled her drink all over her dress and blamed the bartender and made a huge scene. I could go on for a long time if I were to name everything she’s done. She’s always been a bit more critical but within the past year, she’s became so obnoxious. I don’t understand what happened. It’s so hard to be around her sometimes. And I know she now probably sounds like the most annoying person but other than this, we get alone quite well.

So my problem is, we're on lockdown and I have no idea when I have my final year exams even though it's pretty close by so I have to study and I don't wanna ask her to leave the room just for me to study but there's no where else I can go to study. No private place.
And secondly I don't have anything to do all day, I just stay in bed and I find it hard to do anything I want on my own because I feel really suffocated that I have no personal space.  I do my bit of the housework and stuff but other than that I don't feel like I have the privacy to read or study or just do whatever any 21 year old does. I just stay in bed on Netflix all day and it's spoiling my eyes. I can't work out as well as I have no privacy. I can't talk on calls or anything because I'll disturb her either.

566,"I  am in my 20s(M). I hate my parents for giving me a bad childhood.  Individually I think they both loved me but I feel their terrible  marriage had a negative impact on me overall.

My  dad cheats on my mom and is aggressive with her, sometimes physically, I  try to interfere to calm things down. One time (I was 18) he put a  knife to my stomach but didn't stab, I punched him in the face many times, things calmed down after that. My mother complains about him and  tells me about his whores (she told me about the whore when I was around  14). There are many nights when I struggled to sleep, sometimes  intentionally waiting for them to sleep to make sure my dad wouldn't  hurt my mom while I was sleeping.

My mother and I left when I was very young but came back by the time the law mandates the father should get the children. I live in a conservative country and  divorce is taboo and the law favors the men who usually get the children. Mother kept telling me she didn't divorce my father just to stay with me but now that I am past 18 she says she won't do it because  people would shame her, and that my dad can provide better financial  support for my education (she has a college degree, but makes less money  than him).

I feel confused because I thought she used to suffer for me, now it is for OTHER PEOPLE!!

The  situation is more stable now, they're too old to make big trouble. I am  in university with a bright future ahead. I depend on them financially.  My dad still isn't nice to my mother. I look forward to graduating and  leaving the house, but I hold a grudge against them for my bad  childhood.

Recently I tried to prevent a garage from falling down, it was outside of my remit  but despite asking those who should have felt with it for help. I was left to deal with it on my own as I couldn’t risk people getting hurt. I get a phone call late Friday afternoon from building control saying the structure is unsound and may need emergency demo. Again I ring round for help as I explained I’d finally managed to pass it to structural to deal with. 

I managed to get hold of the structural report and garage had been marked as unstable needing demolition. So I sent it to building control. They call back asking why the demo hadn’t been done as report was nearly 3 weeks old. I explained in the decision was currently sat with the head of department and they’d need to talk to him. 

The following Tuesday I find out he’s raised a complaint and I’m facing a disciplinary for carrying out works outside of my job description (I removed the loose bricks and damaged timbers, had arranged for these to be replaced but as we progressed it was obvious we couldn’t repair)

Recently with quarantine and the summer, I have found more time to work on/start hobbies that I enjoy. Particularly in the STEM area: robotics, circuitry, programming, etc.

All fun stuff, but it has brought an issue I face to the forefront. That being my inability to ask for help. I have struggled with this for a while, but mostly in school. Growing up, my father was very narcissistic and patronizing, so most 'advice' he gave was incredibly insulting and back-handed.

This has lead to me seeing any advice as untrustworthy, and just a person's attempt to 'one-up' me. I have gotten much much better about it though, and genuinely appreciate the majority of the advice people give me.

The issue arises again with the hobbies. I like finding things out myself and putting in the research, but I have found myself making things MUCH harder than they need to be (and often times fucking up whatever project I was working on)

I am able to ask advice, but I have this nagging fear that I'm being TOO dependent and therefore irritating. On the flipside, I often saw failures/mistakes as the best learning experience, but now I'm not so sure.

574,"Hello Reddit, I have an interesting situation that id like some input on because it is weighing me down a bit.
I have been with my girlfriend for over 2 years now, i am close with her family and we are very friendly. Her older sister by a year has been dating a guy for over a year now and me and him are close. 
recently they have been making a lot of awful life decisions.
They moved from a beautiful 3 story house that they only paid a combined $300 for to a 2 story apartment in the ghetto for more money just because they were not able to smoke weed inside the house, LEGAL STATE BTW. They didnt have money to move so they borrowed a ton from family members without the intention of paying back, and since moving in to the apartment have bought a german shepard puppy, a new cat and a ferrett. They both bought new cars when their cars were easily fixable (which they needed more money for and now have loans). They bought a close to $2k brand new 4k 60incher, and plenty of furnishing too.
They are also dropping out of school, and going to work full time at their $12/hr job where they work together. They are 22, and both attended University, and community college for 4 years with nothing to show, so you can imagine the loans they will both have.
On top of all of this, after moving into the new apartment they were short on rent the first time bills were due and needed to be bailed out again.

All of this would not concern me in the slightest if it wasnt for this. 
I really like the sisters boyfriend, we are same age, get along well and he is smart. He did not live this life before her, and he is making all these decisions on a whim for her.

She cheated on him over a year ago, and has never told him or brought it up. The whole family knows except him. They broke up for 1 week after dating for close to a year and the night the girl broke up with him, she went and fucked an old ex from highschool. Her reasoning for breaking up was that “she couldnt stop thinking about someone else” but she has never told him she ever was even talking to someone else, He would not be cool with it, I repeat he would not be okay with it.

That is what gets me, I see him making all these horrible decisions because he clearly loves this girl, and whenever we try to give him input saying that they are making a bad decision, they ignore it, get upset and do it anyways, but then constantly need to be borrowing money.
I dont want this kid to screw up his life when I know for certain that he would not be making these decisions if he knew that she cheated on him, and would break up with her.
If i were in the position he was in, starting to have my head be unscrewed, id like to be told, but i also recognize that it would be a very nosy thing to do.
I am morally conflicted, but the girl is clearly going to put him down an awful road, where he will have much less success and in the end they will still break up because she cheated on him.

This is the job that I went to college for but there are aspects of it that I had never expected and it is to stressful for me. I work in a group home and there are constant emergencies and I have to assess for things that I am not qualified or trained for. A few days ago I reached a tipping point, I lost my temper and yelled at a client who was trying to push other residents into crisis. I handed in my notice that night. I don't have another job lined up yet so I know that it was stupid to hand it in then. My boss says that she really wants me to stay and wants me to think about how we can change the job so that I wont get burnt out. I would like to suggest working 4 days a week instead of 5 but I think that might be asking to much. 

When/if I walk away from this job what else would I do? I have a BA in psychology and I really don't want to do more school. Im kind of a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" person. I have a little experience in construction, fine arts, humans services, and secretary work but, evidently, im not really good at anything.

I have also considered hireing a life coach. How else/who else can contact to help me with this mess? 

TL:DR: I quit my job before finding another one first. Now I don't know what to do with my skill set and my confidence is in the trash.",06Aug2020,1
581,"So basically I’ve been working for two years at a gas station called Kwik Trip in the Mid West. If you’ve ever been to the Mid West, you’ve def heard of it. It’s a pretty decent company, pays well, get end of the year bonus. It’s just the store I work at, is no longer working for me. We had construction done recently and me being someone who works primarily in the kitchen, where the work was done, it’s been very chaotic for the past 2 weeks. I’ve decided I no longer wanna do it. That coupled with lots of change in staff recently, the whole place feels completely different and I’m not someone who usually likes that. So I’ve been pretty upset recently and unsure of what to do. I applied for some other jobs, was about to quit. When some friends told me I should try and transfer to a different one. Now I have one in mind, but the issue is that it just opened up and people might perceive it as me just trying to get to a better store. In reality, I’m already about to leave the company, but transferring would be the only thing preventing me from doing so. It’s just I have to call my district leader today and talk to him about it and I’m worried I’m gonna be ridiculed for trying to transfer to the brand new store, in all honesty I wanna go to this one because I know some of the people who work there so it’s nice. It’s really sucky and I’m like stuck on what to do. Do I call him or do I just quit? I know so much about the company and am really good with my job so I don’t really wanna go the quitting route. It’s just I doubt he’ll be like “yeah that’s fine.” It’s gonna be a headache that I don’t know if I want to endure. Anyways, any advice ? Should I still quit or should I try to transfer ?",06Aug2020,1

He suddenly went ""oh God"" when he saw her braces and checked her profile- she is 17 NOW but this video was 2 years old so she was 15!!!! I said 'what's up?"" And he went ""I feel like such creep, I thought she ws older until I saw her braces, I think I found her attractive"". I am weirded the f out. This happened before while we watched Party In the USA music video and he thought Miley Cyrus looked good until I told him she was 16 in it and he felt weird then too.

585,"I've been having a shitty last 10 months. I'd say it started with me getting arrested on the 7th of December and losing my truck, as well as taking a bit at work because if the arrest. Fast forward to Christmas Eve, I lose my car. At this point I have lost both of my vehicles and am on reduced hours at work. COVID-19 hits in March and I end up being laid off from work so I now have no vehicle, no continuing source of income except a lousy $250/month, and am almost at wits end. I've been looking for work every since April because although it isn't ""safe"" to work (Georgia is a HOTSPOT and no one seems to care about COVID smh) I have to keep bringing money in and trying to do something instead of just sitting on my ass. Ive applied for unemployment and pandemic unemployment assistance, denied the first time so I waited about a month and filed again, this time being approved for the pandemic unemployment assistance (but still to this day haven't received any money or assistance in any way from it). Meanwhile, my fiance had also been let go from her employment in March but has been receiving about ~$2700/month in unemployment and pandemic insurance, this is all her money and I don't touch it, just trying to being some perspective in the room. Lately she's been getting upset about how I'm not doing that things I used to for her, how she sees people's boyfriends and husband's getting them flowers all the time and going on romantic dates, etc. I literally give EVERYTHING I can In support of our relationship but I DONT HAVE SHIT TO GIVE AT THE MOMENT, and what I can I do (including the lousy 250, it was her birthday and I literally spent my last just to trying to make sure she enjoyed herself as much as possible, but even that was limited due to my funds) and the only time I spend any other money I have (keep in mind I still have insurance and other small bills to upkeep) it is for her or something for us. I want to do these things I used to do for her and make her feel good again in that manner too but I can't, and it's like she doesn't understand the position and hardships I'm facing right now and it's beating me down, making me feel pathetic at times and upset. She's the one person that I feel like has stood by me in some of my roughest of times but it's like I'm not doing enough her anymore, do you know how that makes me feel? Especially considering I WANT TO but I just can't right now. I just got a new job and the pay hasn't started yet (training plus a week in the hole) but I may have 50-100 spare dollars a week that I have to try and manage between getting Ubers to get to work (so I can continue trying to improve), I still try and get her things she may need or want if I can, but I can only squeeze so much. When she's able to take me to work at times, I put gas in her car and try to do what else I can. When the flowers thing was first mentioned to me I tried to say how it wasn't intentional (me not giving her gifts anymore randomly) and that I've just been struggling a lot lately and her reply was she has too (again, she gets a free 2700/month check and has considerably less bills than me, no rent to pay being a huge one), and considering the circumstances I just feel like that's inconsiderate and I don't know how to feel. Sorry if this is all jumbled mess but I'm typing as I'm thinking because I'm high stress and just want/need to get it out. It may be worth noting that I do EVERYTHING I can non monetary wise to still keep the relationship exciting and keep things sparked, and it seems to be enjoyed but it's not enough it seems, and I literally don't have any more to give. This all sucks for me and is requiring an huge personal shift because I'm used to being able to provide and keep her happy and yada yada, but my pride has been taking such a hit I don't have anymore I feel like. I don't even feel content with myself on the matter plenty of times because again, I can't even get things for myself anymore. I don't have the same good feel I had in me when I had my own and was able to do things at will and on my own, and I think it's starting to cause my anger inside again. (Sidenote, thought something was funny, but she has a thing of saying how peoples BF/husband/whatever are buying them flowers or chocolates but I almost guarantee the same ones shes referring to have to take their car to the shop to have it fixed, meanwhile I'm doing repair jobs on her car that I KNOW would cost at minimum $500 sometimes FOR FREE (mechanic by trade), I guess being able to actually do shit for you too isn't valued anymore)",06Aug2020,1

590,"I had a car accident. I was completely at fault. I backed into the car behind me because I was stupid and did not look into my rearview mirror. I don’t know why I reversed so quickly or why I did not look. I normally try to drive carefully. I don’t speed, drink and drive, or look at my phone. I have enough driving experience (couple of years, lots of mileage), so I do not understand why this happened. There was no reason for me to reverse so quickly and not look first. This is not my first car accident either. I am always the one at fault.
My car now has considerable damages that I cannot afford to repair. It was a brand new car and I saved up a long time to get it. In the other car were people who were on vacation. I apologized, of course, but I ruined their holiday. Luckily nobody got hurt and the other car does not have that much damage, but I can’t stop feeling guilty and ashamed. I keep playing the clip in my head. Why did I reverse? There was no need for it. I could’ve backed up a little bit, but slowly. Why did I not look in my mirror? I feel so ashamed. My friends were in the car with me. I put them in danger. I am the only one in my friend group who has had car accidents. I am afraid they will never trust me again. And what if I had backed up and there was a person walking behind my car? I feel so stupid. I cry all the time. My insurance fees were already high because of the previous accident.

597,"Not my original account. 

So today I get call from my best friend (we've been friends for about 4-5 years) and the convo starts something like this 

She: hello? 
Me: heyy
She: so you free? 
Me: yeah. What's up

And then I hear something like low sobs but I'm not really sure so I ask her if something's wrong and then the sobs get more clearer and louder so I get into serious mode as well and I let her be for a while till she's okay enough to talk, and she goes on to tell me how her brother(younger btw) beat her today, like beat the shit out of her today and she couldn't fight back cuz he's a guy and she doesn't have so much strength to fight back.
 For context: we live in India, in the capital Delhi, and it's quite developed in a sense.But the village her immediate family comes from is only what I could call misogynistic, her parents' views are really and I mean REALLY Orthodox, her mother says things like ""The village that I come from, one girl dies there EVERYDAY"" Ask her why, and she answers ""cuz she was Crossing limits"" , the limits being asking for education, for equality at least in her own house, for human fucking rights. Ironically enough, her father writes  in a magazine  about human rights, in the science section. Her brother is younger than her, by one year I believe and Is really skinny but somehow strong enough to beat the fuck out of her older sister. 

So she goes on to tell me how it hurts and how she couldn't do anything about it, and how she feels like killing herself everytime she looks at her family's face. She's been depressed for 2 years now, got a little better around last year for maybe a month or so but then her mental health went downhill again quite fast. I obviously/ strongly believe her family has A HUGE role in it. She  moved to a new place this January where things have only been worse for her. She tells me things I above mentioned and I'm ngl I'm raged after hearing this, I ask her why didn't she fight back kinda knowing the answer, she tells me how badly, I'd stress more on it if I could, HOW BADLY she's treated in her house even after being the older sibling. I suggested she talked to her mother about what she's talking to me, cuz obviously she's an adult and a woman and maybe, just maybe, it'd help. She tells me she did try that, the convo ended with her getting beat up again. We discussed a few things she'd try to fight back but she sort of was convinced she couldn't do anything about it and I try my best to convince her otherwise. After like 28mins of talking on the phone, she tells me her mother is banging on the door of the room she's in, yelling at her to come out and then at 32:31(mins) she tells me her parents have cut off the electricity of the room she's in, now she has no fan, no light just dark and hot. All of this is going on with her crying almost constantly so while her parents are yelling at her to come out, I suggest her to go out cuz maybe if she doesn't, things could get bad. I tell her to wipe har face, eyes and I tell her to take deep breaths while I'm on the phone with her. She then tells me that she's actually good at cleaning herself up after crying cuz she's been doing it for a while now and she tells me how she'd never let her parents see her cry cuz they ain't worth it, I agree. Then she says how she likes her face and I tell her yeah she's actually beautiful ( I'm not the one to give compliments but I thought it's help maybe just a tiny bit, but it would) and she thanks me and says that it felt good to hear that. I told her I love her, she thanked me for listening and before hanging up I told her that she's gotta fight back, they won't stop until she makes them. In the convo somewhere I remember saying that if things get real real bad, there are helplines she can reach out to. 

I just don't know if I could've said anything better or if would've been better if I didn't say a particular thing. Idk. I'm dealing with my own mental health rn and it's not pretty. I do want to help her, I love her and she's going through so fucking much. But I don't know how to do just that. 

Help.

Some brief backstory that may be needed to help: 

I am housebound with mental health problems. My communication is generally limited to email. I have a person who helps me with phone calls and appointments on my behalf etc, but they have been unable to help me with this current issue (not through lack of trying).


I've lived in my current rented property for 13 years. Sadly, the landlord is now planning to move back in. He gave me notice for the 30th of September. Since then I have been desperately trying to find a place to rent. Alongside my obvious disadvantages, I have two dogs and nowhere is willing to let me rent. I am sure I will get advice that says get rid of the dogs, but they are - mentally - my lifeline.

Things I have tried:

Estate agents, and private landlords.

The local council.

My doctor and mental health support workers.

Family (no luck, and I don't have many friends).

Things that have been suggested, but I am unable to do:

Pay 6 months rent up front (not possible for me financially)

Move out of my county (I have looked all over and still get the same story)

My salary is above average but against the dollar and euro currencies it is incredibly very bad and the price of everything in my country is going up. People are so accustomed to interest rates that most people live below the poverty line, believe me this is the truth, and this country is next to Europe. Today we got bad news economically, the value of our money has plummeted, and a waiter living in America has much more purchasing power than I do. I cannot be angry with the people who brought the country to this position because of wrong policies. Because if I say something wrong, I can go to jail or, worse, be declared as a traitor. Today I could not work at all because I cannot be motivated myself. Trying to improve myself in the middle east country is a mistake; I know that. People my age are aging very fast spiritually in my country because living is hard in here, I graduated from a good university but not everyone is so lucky like that.

It was also difficult to go to another country after the COVID problem and I cannot motivate myself in this country. I know I don't belong here. As a man in a country where people are not happy, women are raped, animals are raped and killed, I cannot feel as belonging here. People in my country do not vote for science, art and modernity, but for bigotry, restrictions, prohibitions, silencing women. And I'm tired.

\- Asylum in a better country

I would get annoyed with him and was frequently physically aggressive to him. I’m not sure why he continued to spend time with me or how it was never addressed by adults in our small rural community. I’ve never addressed this with him, even the last time I saw him at his graduation party. 

The second person is a woman I met while staying with my friend in a different town from where I grew up. I was saying stupid offensive things (the way people try to joke when they don’t see they aren’t funny but offensive). She got up to leave and I (still laughing like a jerk) physically stopped her from leaving. I swear that’s all that happened but I think about the anxiety she must have felt as though something much worse could have happened.

In both of these instances, I behaved in a really shitty way (one for years). I’m not looking for anyone to make me feel better about what’s happened but advice on how to move forward over a decade later. If you were on the receiving end of either of these situations, would you want an apology all these years later? Is it better for me to leave it alone?",06Aug2020,1

A few months ago cousin (I’ll call them L) texted me asking if I was interested in moving in since they are still in school and finances are tough. I, of course, said yes and that I’d happily move in with L when my lease was up, even though I love living on my own and moving in was going to be a significant impact on my finances. I told them the only rule/request I had were my dog comes with. Fast forward 3 months. We signed a lease and L is moved into the new place and I’m moving in at the end of the month. Since asking to move in L has done nothing but be petty towards me and my dog and make snide comments and jabs about the pup and how Im not as clean as they are and that my pups shedding is annoying (she’s part corgi). L also has an issue with my drinking (maybe 2 glasses of wine a week) and my occasional use of narcotics (for anxiety,sleep, and stress working 60+ hours a week). L told our family that they’re worried I’ll get them in trouble with work/the police because I occasionally take an edible/smoke and veg out. L said to their parents that I’m basically a druggie and am throwing my life away and now my family is judging me. (I work 2 jobs, excel in my career and have a masters degree and was just accepted into
a PhD program, so I don’t think I am throwing anything away). Here’s the kicker, over this past week, my family went on vacation and L was there. L ended up smoking weed with other family members and bragging about it to them. L also asked me for edibles and stuff to smoke while I was working and said no. On Monday, L again told their parents that I’m a bad influence and is worried I’ll do something to impact their future and is still scared of living together. So what do I do? Do I confront L? Do I leave it? Am I overreacting?",06Aug2020,1

Around new year’s eve 2019 my aunt posted a stupid article on facebook. The article was about a woman researcher/ scientist in the Trump office calling out Greta Thunberg and calling climate change a hoax etc. This article was not only ridiculously stupid, but it was published on an untrustworthy website.

In response to this post, I decided to call her out, so I asked if she’s become a Trump supporter? I sent a screenshot to my mom making fun of my aunt. My mom also thought it was a weird article, but was against me commenting, because she’s anti-drama. 

Now, this is where I fucked up. I sent the same screenshot to my niece. My thought process was as following: if my mom or a family member posted ridiculous shit like this, I’d like to know about it. And I HONESTLY thought we were on the same page. I was wrong. My niece told me to grow up and quit acting childish. This bugged me because since when are politics “childish”? I replied with a “what the fuck” and “are you serious”. My niece was 100%  mad at me. Then came the call. A few minutes went by and my aunt called me. She never calls me, let alone texts me. I picked up and she was raging. She was screaming into the phone like a mad man, calling me all sorts of nice things.

She asked me why I posted the comment and I told her it’s because of what the article contained, as it was quite pro-Trump. I asked her right then and there if she was a Trump supporter, and she said: no, I’m not a god forsaken Trump supporter. She then went off about how inconsiderate and childish me sending sc to her daughter was, and I kind of agree. I apologized and said I’m sorry if I hurt her feelings or made her feel uncomfortable. She laughed at me and said her daughter is also laughing at me. My aunt continued screaming at me, calling me names, and mentioning private things about me that I’d only told my mom.

I then told her if she didn’t calm down, and manage to have a proper conversation, I’d hang up. I wasn’t about to sit there being shit talked to like that. She laughed yet again, and said I’m quite good at that. I hung up and my aunt immediately blocked me on facebook. (now who’s the childish one?) I deleted my niece from fb and never spoke to them again.

Now here’s the whole point I guess.
It’s been six months and my grandmother just passed away. Afterwards, my aunt proceeded to carefully talk to me. Just a few pats on the back and polite conversation. Today, at her funeral, my aunt reached out to me. She asked if we could please become fb friends again, and that she couldn’t find my user. I found this to be awkward and couldn’t bring myself to remind her that she was the one blocking me, not the other way around, so I simply said sure. She then spoke like nothing’s ever happened. She didn’t apologize. This bothers me because I honestly feel like she owes me an apology if she wants to be friends.

Any advice?",06Aug2020,1

He has been there for me since day one and has always thought of me as his daughter. I’ve never met my biological dad, and it feels wrong to even  call him my “dad”.

I'm looking at purchasing a car in the near future and I need something smaller than a family car but bigger than a hatch back and I've landed on the qashqai or seltos as they are a similar size. I like the way both of them look (particularly the exterior of the seltos. It reminds me of the range rover evoque and I just love the look of it), and I've been looking at reviews and comparing features because tech and specs are the second most important thing I'm looking for in a car (apart from safety of course). It seems there's a trend at the moment of people just loving the seltos and even the reviews between the two cars seem to paint Seltos as the better car but I just don't understand it because it seems to me the qashqai has a lot more to offer than the Seltos specs wise. 

The Ti has things like the full panoramic roof, all round bird's eye view camera, side view mirror placement memory, dual climate control, drivers seat placement memory (not sure what the more technical term for this is) and all the information the driver needs is placed in a screen just behind the steering wheel next to the speedometer (can't remember what it's called), apple carplay and a flexible storage system in the back (there's even a compartment for the back cover). It's also cheaper than the GT Line. 

Alternatively, the GT Line comes with a bigger screen, wireless charging (but you apparently still need to have a cord for the phone if you want to mirror it), it’s got a heated steering wheel, ventilated seats and a heads up display as well as voice activated notifications (like to tell me when there are speed cameras around). These are some of the positives I like, however, the GT Line also has single climate control, a smaller glass roof and less flexibility for storage in the back, and it’s more expensive than the Ti. 

Because of everything I’ve mentioned above, it seems to me the TI is the better car, but I'm not sure considering everyone else seems to be saying the opposite. Please, WHAT AM I MISSING!?",06Aug2020,1

631,"Hello,  everyone!

So, about 2 or 3 weeks ago I met my plug to get some joints and I started flirting with him. He said to me he was single and wanted to keep singles, he had no rings on his fingers and he even said he shared house with other male friends. We just kissed when I pick up the stuff with him and that was all.

We never even speak after that until like a week ago where I sent him a message asking for some products and he hit on me and I hit back, but that was all. 

Today I wake up to two messages on my phone. One frm him and one from another number with a girl picture. I answered them both and the number with the girl pic told me it was my plug, that he had changed his number and tht pic was just for disguise. I was innocent and said ok, what you want? Then he started hitting on me,  I was replying and theeeen...

A message on his previous number pop up saying that was his GF talking to me that she found out my number and I was like wtffff???? I don't even like you man, I don't even have you as a crush, it was just a kiss wt??

Then i told his GF i had no intentions with him, I didn't even know she existed because he never mentioned and I am no part of their problems.

it's been like this for quite some time, i got used it. it was always fun until now. the situations are scary and the problem is that i can almost physically feel everything that's happening.

one night i dreamt about falling off a cliff, i was falling and trying to get a hold of the chairs that were falling with me for some reason. as i was about to land everything got silent and became black, chairs now gone. and then.. boom.

i hit the ground, glass shattered. i didn't wake up. stayed like that for a while. woke up suffocating because my face was flat into my pillow. i usually sleep on my stomach, yes but this didn't happen before.

another one, this person i know in real life was forcing themselves onto me. this happened but with different person. we were fighting until they started choking me, and then drowning me in the sink of my old flat. i woke up suffocating because my arm was on my chest, elbow directly in the middle of my chest. i still don't know how.

i've had problems with sleeping too, for a long time but it has never been because of this. now, it's summer and i have nothing to do. i don't go out much and all i do is play video games or draw a little. i try to make myself sleep as little as possible.

641,"So, for quite a while things have been these past days have been quite tense with him and today we fought regarding the dishes...
 Last night my family ate really late and none of us washed the dishes. We have a rule that everyone washes what they use (this was proposed by my dad because he was mad that he had to wash other's dishes); I was going to wash everything but since he had told that I made too much noise at night and didn't let him sleep (which is fair, I mean, I go to sleep very late at night and should have been more mindfulI of their sleep) so I decided to instead wash the dishes in the morning. Unfortunately, he woke up earlier than me and saw the kitchen a mess. He got really mad and started washing everything; he started complaining and arguing with my mom about clothes too (When he gets mad, he is snappy about everything). He told us that we needed to wash our dishes and I told him that he didn't washed his; he had been working till veeeeery late so he told me it was an exception. My intention was not to blame him but to argue that most of the time we did wash our dishes and it was an exception last night. He said that regardless he NEVER wanted to see any dishes without washing, no matter how late it was and if it woke him up. I told him that we were not perfect and there would be days when inevitably we would not be able to wash the dishes. We started arguing back and forth and it ended up with him yelling me that I needed to put my head down and listen and accept what he says because he is my father and knows more, that I didn't know how to respect him, and that I should have been spanked more as a child; I told him that he didn't know how to respect others, was a hypocrite, and I wouldn't respect him. 

Tbf, I kind of understand why he is so mad. He was working in a hard job he hates until very late and had many problems yesterday, he also has five assignments due this week. But still, I don't think his reaction was right and I don't agree with what he says. I don't think I should conform to everything that he says without a word, am I wrong for thinking that?   I don't think I'm in the wrong, so I don't want to talk to him until he apologizes for screaming... but I want to hear from others because maybe I am in the wrong and I should be the one apologizing?

I do agree that I don't respect him as much as I should though... I roll my eyes and I talk back; I automatically disagree (I'm not always verbal about it though) with anything that he says. I automatically feel annoyed at him when he talks, even when I agree with what he says. I reject hugs, and when we argue, I have screamed at him.

This is not excuse, but I think part of it is because I have resentments towards him... When I was little, my dad was rarely home form work and when he came home, he would always argue with my mom and be mad about everything in the house (He still argues badly with my mom, he has called her things like ""dumb"" or ""stupid"" and screams at her. Most times doesn't do it in front of me or my brother, but I know about it from my mom. That it why I told him he did not know how to respect others), and unlike my mom, he spanked us. I dreaded when he came home and, more than respected him, feared him. It was not until I turned 13 that he started to change and promised us to never spanked us again. We finally started getting close and talking and in this past years I have gotten to know so much about my dad that I did not know before. I was very hurt today when he screamed I needed more spanking as a child. I also resent him because he has another family and I always felt that he would one day leave us for them. He doesn't like many things that I do like, and unlike my mom, he has an ugly way of telling me. So I have felt rejected from him many times, and even when now he much more tolerating, these feelings of rejection are still there.

I feel like I'm not being fair enough to him in this post... Despite these things, he is a great father and I love him very much. He has changed a lot and has given us so much to me and my brother. I have learned a lot from him and I am very thankful for everything that he has done. I am not an easy daughter to deal with, yet he has stayed and done the best he can to guide me...

But there are these feelings of annoyance that keep pilling up and I don't know what to do. I don't know if they are because of feelings in the past or just natural from being a teenager. I don't want us to be resentful in the future, and I know he doesn't want that either. 

How can we improve our relationship? Are these feelings normal? What is a healthy relationship to have? Was I wrong in what I said during our fight today?

I don't really want to tell him about my feelings and thoughts because I don't want him to feel guilty and sad. He has changed a lot and I know he feels guilty about many things from the past, I don't want to make it worse...",06Aug2020,1

She begged me to finish it as I was on my last year, but I've had an epiphany that my whole life has been a series of living up to people's expectations, and now I don't know who I am or what I want, but I do know it's not the misery that comes with finishing the degree.

The first time we argued we didn't talk for 3 weeks. I said I was going to text her my reasons for dropping out but during our argument she said ""you won't do it"" and stormed out saying she was disappointed, so I didn't send the text (which was a huge chunk of everything I never told her in the end). After three weeks she contacts me and I send her the text, which contained a lot of my feelings, first time I've ever managed to admit them to anyone. She's probably hurt, in the text I mentioned how her anger always scared me and I felt that made me hide my voice and feelings because I thought she wouldn't love me if I didn't go college or say what I want to do, which at the time was go travelling (can't now because of covid). I also said I think it would be a good idea to go see a family therapist. So far it's been a month since I texted her and not received a text back. I don't think I should text her again as I've made my feelings known already. I'm just waiting now. I'm not that sad about it, I just feel it will be awkward if this is left for too long. So I don't know what to do.

Just wondering what others would do in my situation or if there's any guidance available. 

TL;DR Mom's angry I dropped out of college, sent her a text explaining my feelings about everything, haven't spoken in a month since. What do I do.",06Aug2020,1
648,"Last year I met a guy, we became best friends. We had a huge fight, stopped speaking &amp; then we reconnected. We discovered a crazy attraction to one another, but I fell faster then he did. &amp; Things got complicated.

We've only been dating for a month. But through these past 30 days we've had so many conversations. We love each other, but I'm coming into the reality that he's not ready to love &amp; commit on the level that I am, and it really doesn't matter what I do, that's something he has to do on his own.

We are meeting for lunch today, &amp; I'm nervous to tell him that I think it's best that we go back to being friends and let the relationship blossom from there. I feel bad because he has done his best this week to do the things that I have asked him to do. I see his efforts, but I also don't want him to feel any pressure. 

Idk what to do because, I also want us to find our way back to each other again. I know there's plenty of fish in the sea, but I don't feel like going swimming. 26F",06Aug2020,1

651,"I’ll call her S. This started when quarantine started. Last summer, S and I hung out almost every day for weeks at a time. We went to the fair, shopping, out to eat, etc. 

This year of course is a bit different with COVID and everything. We are still able to hang out, but everytime I say I want to hang out or have a sleepover, I always cancel and tell S I don’t feel like it. I’ve done this at like 6 times over the past 5 months. We’ve hung out once, and it was for 5 days... which tired me out. 

I am sure at this point S is very tired of me doing this, but I don’t even think I feel guilty. I obviously do think that I should stop getting her hopes up, only to cancel after. 

My other best friend even asked if she could come over for about a week, and I had said yes. Next day comes, I cancel and tell her I don’t have the energy to spend a week with someone. 

I don’t know what to tell S. I just never feel like hanging out with anyone anymore.",06Aug2020,1

654,"Friends of my husband and I are getting married in a few months. My husband and I had originally agreed to be in their wedding party, but now we don’t know what to do.

Our state is doing horribly with COVID, and our friends aren’t really planning on taking any precautions. No masks will be worn, the dinner will be set buffet style, and they expect to have between 100 and 200 people in attendance.

My husband has been friends with this couple for over a decade, so we are trying our best not to sever that friendship, but we do not feel comfortable attending the wedding, let alone being in the party. COVID is no joke, and on top of everything else we are currently trying to conceive and there is a large possibility that I will be pregnant at the wedding.

The pay is not scarring me or anything financially. It is my first brand new car, so it was my first experience going to a dealership, talking with sales folk, and everything else all by myself.

659,"I'm almost 24 and I feel like all I've done is stumbled after high school. I tried to go to college twice but it got ruined by stuff out of my control both times.
I spent my 20's living in a hotel and shelters.
I've tried getting jobs but the money never seems worth the bullshit I put up with and I end up saving almost all the money anyway then quitting because it feels like most of the stuff people produce is useless garbage if it's not a complete necessity. Most of my devices have died and I look at replacing them, but it's all trash not worth spending my money on and I continue to just use 1 phone.
I don't feel 'attached' to anyone or any problems today, I just don't care. I realized I see everything humans do as really petty and largely narcissistic. I would be happy if I could just live alone, in a small house, away from everyone else and cities and just drive in from time to time for supplies and stuff and work from home.

660,"I (18F) just graduated high school, and I don't have any friends to show for it. After I moved states three years ago, I only ended up socializing at school, and even then I never connected with most people. My brother is a natural extrovert and had a much easier time finding friends, and is always socializing with them one way or another. I guess I thought that my casual school clique that I sat with at lunch was enough but now that school's out, I don't know how to talk to people at all, and I'm painfully reminded that I was never really part of their main friend group, even though they were mine. I have strong social anxiety in the idea of hanging out with people outside of school or wherever I normally see them, and now there is no place. I try to be an interesting person - I have a job, I'm in school, I try really hard to be nice, my interests are admittedly pretty common (theater, movies, art, etc.) - so I feel pretty comfortable calling my own lack of action out as the problem here. So now I'm trying to look at a community to join where socializing doesn't feel forced. I'm not a crazy gamer or anything, but I do enjoy playing games with my brother, and I know that there's a lot of ways to meet new people through online gaming and have genuine fun doing it. All I want is a group of online buddies to play games with regularly so that I don't feel like I'm all alone in what's suppose to be the prime of my life. Does anybody have any tips on how to start getting into online gaming, and which games/communities you recommend? I appreciate any and all help.

662,"I am a 15 year old male and I recently found my father dead from suicide.

Since my parents divorce, my father became a big alcoholic. My mom cheated on him during their marriage and it ruined him. Since then, he had never put the bottle down, except when he had to work. With COVID, it made his drinking problem spiral out of control. He didn’t have a job anymore, considering he was an art teacher, so he drank all the time. My brother and I used to go to his house every other week, but we were forced to stop going because he was drunk all the time and couldn’t take care of us. My fathers side of the family had cut off all communication with him because of his drinking problem and how mean he became due to it. We all tried to help him, but he would refuse it and deny that he had a problem. He would start fights and say the most hurtful shit.

Once my mother stopped allowing my brother and I to stay with my dad, I felt really bad for him. All he would do was sit at home and get drunk everyday day. He didn’t have anybody and I was worried about him. That’s when I started visiting him a few times a week without my mom knowing, but it was hard. Every time I went over to his house, 90% of the time he would pick fights with me or be blackout drunk. If he was nice, it lasted only a few minutes or he was sobering up. After a little while, I stopped visiting him because I couldn’t handle the things he would say to me and he was really scary. I felt sad and really alone about the situation. I wanted to help him, but I’m just a kid and I didn’t know how. I tried to express how his drinking had negatively impacted me, my little brother, his family and himself, but he wouldn’t listen. He only got angry. Once the visiting stopped, he would drunk text me everyday asking me why I don’t visit him, why I don’t love him, etc.. I tried to explain to him why I stopped visiting him, but he would just become angry like always. I started writing him letters and leaving them on the counter, hoping he would read them when he was sober and decide to get himself the help he needs. After about a month of writing letters, I noticed that the drunk texts had stopped for a few days. I felt like he had finally read my letters and was working on sobering up. I decided to visit him to see what he’d been up to and if my letters were not in the spot I left them. 

I entered his house, went to the kitchen and noticed my letters were moved into the mail, unopened. I also noticed my father wasn’t on the couch like he usually was. I called for his name, checked the downstairs bathroom, but there was no answer. I noticed his cats were very chatty, like they were awaiting dinner and very hungry. I figured he was in bed sleeping. I went upstairs calling his name, but no answer. I entered his room to find him laying back on the bed with a horrid smell coming from the room. At that point I had this horrible feeling. He looked strangely positioned and I got closer to see the gun, his blood and lifeless body. I ran out of the room because I was so scared. I couldn’t believe what I just saw. I sat for a few minutes trying to process what my eyes just saw and the image wouldn’t leave my head. Then I called 911 balling my eyes out. I couldn’t stand being in the house, so I went outside. I started screaming at the top of my lungs because I was so horrified. I thought it might have been a joke. I thought maybe I imaged it. I didn’t want to believe my father was gone.

It has been a month since I found my father and I am completely ruined. I haven’t been sleeping, eating, socializing. This is the first time I’ve talked about it, although this isn’t really talking. I have constant flashbacks of the day I found my father. I hear gunshots. I smell that horrid smell of my fathers dead body. The images don’t leave my head. I am scared all the time. I have anxiety attacks. I have suicidal thoughts myself. I don’t know how I will ever get through this. I have constant guilt and hatred towards myself, suffering, sadness, depression, anxiety. I think about how I could have prevented it, why I didn’t just keep visiting him, how it’s my fault, how bad of a son I am. My mom tries to get me help, but I don’t want to leave my bed. I am angry. I hate myself. I am constantly in pain, not just emotionally, but physically too. Sometimes I get sick to my stomach and throw up.

I know this isn’t the best place to look for help, but I just need some love, support and advice from the internet. I feel completely alone because it’s extremely hard to talk to my family about it. Being the one to find him, it’s a whole new level of pain. I cannot physically talk about it. Even this took me a week to write out. 

How can I help myself? How can I get out of bed? How can I cope? How can I heal from what I saw? Has anyone else been through what I have? How do you bring yourself to live another day? Everything seems too hard right now. I can’t stand living. I miss my father so much. I was so close with my father. Me and my little brother did everything with him. He was a great role model and a great man. He would do anything for anyone. He was so kind and caring. So fun and funny. He taught me everything I know. He was a positive ball of life before his drinking. I would do anything to get one more day with him. For him to be here right now. I wish I knew how much pain he was in. I feel like a failure of a son. I feel like he thought I gave up on him. How do I live with this pain?",06Aug2020,1

665,"Some background info:

My mum is a typical asian parent, and my dad is basically her slave. He does not dare to defend my siblings and I whenever she scolds us. I have 2 older sibling, a sister and a brother. And of course surprise surprise male&gt;female because asia

Today as I got ready got school, my mum wanted me to fold my clothes before she got home. She tried guilt tripping me by saying ""I'm old and tired why can't you just do what i ask you to?"" But I had school so I left the house without folding it.

I got home from school and was resting, and in less than 5 mins, she came home too. She saw my unfolded clothes and started screaming ""When will you ever fix all your mistakes? All you know is to use phone and play games. If you do not fold it by (time), you are washing, drying, folding and ironing all your clothes yourself. I should take picture and send it to everyone, to show how sickening you are.""

I do admit that I should have fold my clothes the previous day, but I was really busy with school. And I was really hurt that she basically called me useless. My own mother, who raised me called me useless. I also hate how she punishes through embarrassing me, threatening to tell my relatives and boyfriend.

I cannot stand being around her. I just felt like crying and suicidal thoughts were flooding my head. This is what I grew up with. If my siblings and I disobey her, we would get scolded viciously

Anyways after I folded my clothes, I went to my boyfriend's house. If I were to remain in the same house as my mother, I don't think I would be able to control my anger.

My boyfriend's family and I were talking after dinner, and it was a pretty long talk. They talked until 11pm, I had to be home by 10:30pm. I didn't want to interrupt the conversation as it was a serious topic. At 11pm when I checked my phone, my mum has spam called and messaged me asking where am I and that it is very late.

Again, I was at fault for not informing her I would be late and worried her. But if I were to tell her I would come home late, she would just refuse and ask me to come home straight away. I figured whats the point of informing her, I would still get scolded anyways.

When I reached home at 11:30pm, she was furious to say the least. I told her that I did not want to interrupt the conversation as it was really sensitive and I did not want to be a jerk and leave mid-conversation when they were sharing such a private topic. Long story short, my curfew is now 9:30pm.

This is just what happened today. And this occurs weekly. I am not allowed to stay overnight at his house or even travel WITH his family or friends until I'm married. I am not allowed to reach home late. I am not allowed to disobey her. I get reprimanded if I don't do the chores up to her expectations. My sister is in the same boat as me but my brother however gets to do whatever he wants as he is a guy.

I don't know how to handle this situation anymore. I have been suffering all my life with such strict rules that i thought that it was a normal family thing. Am I just a spoilt brat? Am I the one in the wrong? I feel like I should not even be feeling this way, I have had a pretty easy life so far, I need not worry about lack of resources. How can I feel this way when others are having it worse? What should I do? Do I just obey my mum? I cannot move out until 25+ as it is not cheap to buy a house in my country.",06Aug2020,1
666,"Hi, my name is Line, and I'm from Denmark.  

I have so many problems and I don’t know what to do. I feel so lost. I first now realized how toxic my mom is, and it's breaking my heart. She is my hero and I love her so much, I need her. But the longer I am with her the more damaged I feel. I feel so torn, like no matter what I do, I'm gonna lose someone. 

But I also know that I can't live like this anymore. I cant live with the fact that I am miserable and my mom is never letting me be sad. Because I am lucky. 

She isn’t an alcoholic or hitting me or taking drugs. So I'm lucky. I have a roof over my head. I'm lucky. She just forgets about the times where she calls me fat or ugly, or that I first get pretty when I use makeup. Or that she is kicking my sister out because my sister doesn’t get manipulated that easily anymore. Or about how she only cooks once a week.  

But we can't complain. In her eyes, I'm an ungrateful brat. But the thing is I just want a mom. I want someone to support me and love. And not complain about being a mom. Or talking about how happy she was before I was born. But she not even trying to be a mom. She acting like we are roommates and she's annoyed because she is doing most of the work. 

But I help too. I was the floors and vacuum the house, I clean the toilets and I clean my room. But it's not enough. It never is. I'm not enough. I don’t know if you can help me. But I am running out of options. 

My mom's family is more on her side than on my side. I have no trusted adult, they are all more loyal to her. So, this is going to be a really long story - because I feel like u need the backstory to help me if u can. 

I’m a 16 y/o girl who lives with her sister and mother My parents got divorced when I was 10 - on my birthday -  But already before that, there were problems.  My dad got PTSD from the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After that he was different - he started to cheat on my mom and left for 6 months straight multiple times. 

It was hard for my mom, sister, and I but we got through it at they got divorced - this was from when I was 6 - 10 y/o. 

Then my dad got his first girlfriend - my gymnastic teacher. She was really nice, and I liked her, but my mom didn’t. She talked to us - me and my sister - about how inappropriate it was and eventually we told him that he should break up with her. 

By the time it seemed okay to tell him that and he broke up with her - but now when I look back, I can clearly see that my mom manipulated me and my sister to think that the girlfriend was mean. 

Then he got his second girlfriend - let's call her Melissa - Melissa was known in the town to be very nice. But apparently, she didn’t like us - or that’s what my mom told us - My mom then again told us about how mean she was and that she didn’t want to have us as her kids, she only wanted dad. So, we again told my dad that he should break up with her. 

He got annoyed because he didn’t understand the problem. We told him to choose between us and her. He chose her… 

We didn’t see him for 9 months. It hurt. 

My sister got panic attacks and I developed suicidal thoughts and minor depression. 

I was 11. And my sister was 13. 

I remember that I dreamt about him and I cried in my sleep calling for him. 

I started to get teased in class because I cried so much. My mom made an appointment with the school counselor. The first time I was there I talked to the counselor about how I felt that I wanted to be with my dad, but I couldn’t like him because of my mom. The counselor then talked to my mom about how she shouldn’t take me and my sister into all of this. But my mom got mad and I wasn’t allowed to see the counselor anymore. 

Back then I thought that the counselor was stupid - but now I see that it was one of the first signs that my mom was toxic and emotionally abusive.

For those 9 months, my mom treated us more like friends than daughters. And she still does. She would gossip to us about how stupid our dad was - she even talked to us about how bad he was In bed, I was 11! -  

She made us sneak into his house and steal our drawings we made him that was hanging on his fridge, while she put his toothbrush in the toilet. 

Melissa (his girlfriend) later received a message that was from an unknown number written from my sister¨s POV, about how she was ruining our life. My dad was mad and tried to find out who did it - we obviously didn’t do it-  My mom kept telling us that Melissa did it so we would look bad. 

I first now realized that it was my mom. The message had spelling errors that my sister typically did - that my mom always corrected her on -  

We then saw our dad again - but refused to see Melissa - also a ¨suggestion¨ my mom made. 

We moved to another town close by and a couple of years went where i kept silent about being suicidal - because my mom got mad everytime i told her.

we saw him a little bit. Until recently where we agreed - to much dismay from our mother - to meet Melissa. 

She was the nicest person I have ever met. She didn’t try to push us, she just sat and listened - she was everything I wanted in a mother. 

But I always think that she doesn’t want us. because thats what my mom always told me.

While my own mom never cooked food because she was lazy and always told us how lucky we were. She wasn’t a mom - she was more like the eldest in the friend group. 

Me and my sister started in May to talk about how we felt about our mom. We used to be really close, but my mom started to trash talk her to me, so I got manipulated to ¨dislike¨her. 

Our mom decided that my sister - who is now 19 and has no money - that she needs to move because she has an attitude. My sister tried to change her ‘attitude’ but my mom doesn’t even care anymore - she is supposed to move in October. 

I think that my mom wants her to move because my sister can see through her manipulation. 

It was in June that I realized how toxic, manipulate and abusive my mom has always been. Every time I told her about my suicidal thoughts, she called me selfish. 

We tried to talk with child services to get advice and we ended up accidentally reporting her - it really was an accident! -  

She threatened me that if I didn’t tell them that I was fine then I had to move over to my dad and then she didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. 

So, I did that. 

And now after I talked anonymously with a counselor that I realized the me and my sister has been abused by my mom, how horrible it is living with her. 

I don’t know if I should move over and live with my dad - who has subtly offered - because he also did a lot of bad stuff. But I know that if I leave my mom, I won’t be able to see her side of the family - who btw is more on her side than us -  

I’m so confused and upset, and I don’t know what to do. Please help me. I don’t think that I could get sent to a foster home - because the problem is not ¨bad enough¨",06Aug2020,1

Then last week one of the managers just nonchalantly mentioned one of the dishes I cleaned was dirty, so i stayed til like 1:30sm on my last shift last week to make sure i cleaned. Then this week i noticed i only got one shift for the week so a few hours before my shift I called and asked what the deal was. Then my GM told me that its not working out and that they found like 12 dirty dishes and said he was letting me go.

I needed this second job to pay my bills I recieved no warnings or write ups about this and it seems a little unfair to just can me like that we have cooks and servers that have no call no showed that didnt get fired.

I feel like a complete failure because of this... like if i cant handle a dishwasher job how will i be able to handle a real job when i graduate...

669,"Very long story, but he was in my life when I was very young. At the time my mom was physically abusive. I would vent to him about it. One night he threatened to kill her, which is when I decided cut off all contact.

I regret ever having spoken to him but I was lonely and he was a friend of a friend online. He’s trying to get in contact again. The last time we spoke was 6 years ago, when I was 16, a few years after he threatened my mom’s life. I told him I did not want to reconcile and I do not want him to be a part of my life.

He found my new account and messaged me to say “Hey.”

I am absolutely terrified. I’m not sure if I should ignore him or respond to try to clear the air. I had hoped he would’ve just forgotten about me. 

Last time we spoke, he told me his life was going badly and that he had dropped out of school. He said his life was better with me in it. I don’t feel safe. I’m sorry I know this is jumbled I just haven’t felt like this in a very long time.

676,"This account is a throwaway account so my wife doesn't find this post. Also the death was a complete accident. Please read for more details.

Let me give some context to this statement. My wife is currently out of state attending the funnerals of both her grandma's. One died on July 27 and the other on August 1st. I am currently home with my 3 kids. Our lease for our apartment is up in 2 days so I am packing everything on my own, dealing with her grandma's death and consoling her (nevermind the fact that I loved them both and I'm greving myself). Movers come first thing tomorrow morning and I'm scrambling to pack. We also just put an offer on on a house so we are also dealing with a lender and a real estate agent to boot. It's a lot of stressers in life for the past two weeks.

So this morning I just finished purchasing a washer and dryer online (another stressor). I packed a box in my bedroom.and was taking it to the living room. I tripped on a box in the hallway and stepped on the cat. I am pretty sure it broke its neck. The cat is no longer breathing or moving. I was able to hide the cat from the kids in a box. This afternoon I am going to go bury it at the family farm.  However I don't know how to tell my kids much less my grieving wife. We all loved this cat so much. I couldn't express in words how much we loved the cat. It was one part of our lives that brought joy these past two weeks.

How do I tell my wife? Right now the kids don't know anything is wrong and I am going to simply tell them the cat must of gotten lost during the movie if they suspect anything, but my wife. What do I tell her?",06Aug2020,1

681,"Social welfare touches the life of many people in the US. Just think about these questions: does anyone in your family receive Social Security? Has anyone you know ever been on unemployment? Did you attend public schools? Have you gone to the doctor or been hospitalized? Do you work in a human services agency? As you approach the final assignment for this course you are encouraged to draw on programs and policies with which you are familiar as a worker or as a consumer.

This semester, you can explore the following areas:

* policies and programs for the elderly
* policies and programs for children
* policies and programs for veterans

Within each of these areas you will pick a specific policy and the programs that have emerged from those policies and examine its evolution in two historical periods, (1) the period when the policy was first initiated and (2) the present.

You are encouraged to narrow your topic so that your research and writing is more focused. For example, if you to write about policies directed at children, you could focus, for example, on foster care, or care and protection, or after school programs, or child health, etc. You would choose one specific set of policies and examine (1) when the policies were developed and the programs that emerged at the time to implement it AND (2) the policies that guide our approach to that social welfare area IN THE PRESENT and the programs that exist today to implement them.

Your paper should be about 8 pages long and address the following:

(1) a statement about the social policy area you selected.

(2) discuss the historical time in which this policy area emerged in the U.S.

a. discuss how this policy area was identified as a “need” and which sector of society was determined to be in need of the services provided by this policy or program.

b. discuss the social perception at the time of which sectors of society are responsible for meeting these needs –the individual (or their family), the government or public sector, the private or voluntary sector (such as Church and community groups).

(3) Focusing on the policy area you chose, discuss the status of those policies in the present time. Discuss how need is determined today. Discuss also the sector of society charged with addressing these needs (for example government or private non-profits or private for-profit sectors) and if it is a government program discuss the level of government that is responsible. When you submit your proposal, I will provide some guidance about where to find this information.",06Aug2020,1

I always had a pessimistic view of life, and I believe that it is better to not be born.

I try to do what is best for people around me, knowing that life is hard for most and we can only help each other, trying to make us less miserable.

 So, I talked to her last night. I was going to wait a bit but she said, “Will you go to this lgbt-friendly temple with me?” so told her I’d go if she promised to hear me out. She immediately started getting upset. Keep in mind this entire time I did not raise my voice, I knew the best action was to be polite.

 I started off very simple, “Why can’t there be two dads in a kids show? There’s straight families everywhere, so why would same sex families be sexualizing kids?” 

 She then said she knocks it all, that kids shouldn’t be sexualized and coupled up. I was in shock because obviously that is not what I was talking about. I said, “Mom, we can’t take relationships out of the media or real life. Straight parents exist and are in a relationship on shows everywhere why couldn’t they be same-sex?”
 
“It’s not fair to parents! Kids shouldn’t see that! You’re pushing your agenda! It’s wrong and gross for children. Sorry I care more about children than your lesbian agenda!” She started screaming at me, I felt so heartbroken.

 “It’s not about an agenda! It’s normal! I’m normal! We just want it to be normalized! Kids can learn about love without it being sexual! How do you think people explain how mommy and daddy got together?’” (how parents met, ex: your mother was so beautiful I fell in love) 

 “It’s just wrong. You’re wrong. It’s pedophilic and disgusting. You’re being a pedophile trying to push it on kids! I CARE MORE ABOUT PARENTS THAN YOUR AGENDA! Parents shouldn’t have to explain that to their kids. What if they’re homophobic? They shouldn’t have to see it.”  She was wailing at this point, waving her hand at me. Basically siding with homophobic parents, like it’s impossible for them to have gay offspring too. 

I nearly threw up at this as the whole pedophile acceptance thing has been something homophobes hurl at the lgbt+ community to make us look bad. Also it hurt because I was molested by one at a young age so to be called a pedo kinda makes me want to die. I don’t see how I’m sexualizing kids for wanting at least same-sex parents in a couple kids shows. It’s not like I’m saying it only has to be cast of gay people. I feel so lost and heartbroken because after my whole life I never thought she was actually a homophobe. 
BUT HAHA! look where we are now. 

 My 9m brother was in the room, he told her that she was wrong herself. Even earlier in the day he secretly confided in me that she asked “do you think it’s okay for gay people to be in cartoons?” to him and made a stank face when he said yes. 

It ended with me looking her straight in the eyes “The fact that you refuse to even listen to me and immediately shut me down proves you aren’t ignorant, just homophobic.”

  Anyways, I left to stay a friends house because she kept screaming and saying I was wrong and disgusting. So that’s fun! But I’m dropping it for now. I’m going to write a long essay with every talking point I can think of to say “hey, you’re being a homophobe mom.” in a dumbed down way. I’ll update what she says to that and possibly cross post it on Insaneparents because well- yeah..... anything I should add to it? Suggestions? Advice?

693,"Hello everyone! 

So I'm gonna give you some background. I'm a 20 year old girl. Recently got in my first relationship. He is around the same age and a really good person. I really care for him. 

One thing I haven't told anyone except one irl friend is that I am bisexual. I have been sexually attracted to both guys and girls many times in the past but just never acted on either cause I was scared and felt intimidated by the idea of sex (still am but working on accepting it as a normal part of life). The thing is, I always looked at my attraction to girls as a phase because for a long while I was lonely. 

Now that I'm in this relationship I'm starting to see that my attraction to girls isn't just a phase. And I'm feeling upset at myself for some reason, because I always wanted to be with a girl at least once in my life. Even as a one night stand. 

But I really care for my boyfriend and don't want to break up with him. We haven't been together for too long but I hope we have a future together. However sometimes I find myself on the edge of almost sexting girls on various sites and I don't know what to do. I don't know for how long I can resist this.

Is there any advice you have for me in this case? Or some things to think of to avoid thoughts about cheating? I believe it's more of a ""I wish I could do that"" and expiriment a bit with the same sex but I don't want to end my relationship. Should I choose one or the other?",06Aug2020,1

698," Im 13F.

Ever since I became aware of my own actions (age 10 or so.) my level of empathy has screwed with me alot. I think more about the feelings of other people than the consequences of my own actions.

Every time I hear about ANYONE getting hurt, whether it be through online means, in person, or otherwise, I get the feeling like I'm falling down the stairs. Like a literal stab of fear in my chest that leaves my heart racing. It's scary. I feel so fucking bad any time anything painful happens to anyone. It doesn't matter who it is. They said my brother MIGHT have had to get the virus test a little while back, and it sent me into a panic. I couldn't stop thinking about that for weeks, even after they confirmed he didn't need it. It wasn't because he mightve had it either, it was just for work.

I saw a video of someone getting tested like that on reddit unintentionally, and the expression on that person's face caused me to break down in tears. 

I can't play pranks on anyone. Ever. It makes me feel like shit. I think daily about how two years ago I told my brother it was a later time than it was before school, and he freaked out. I told him like 10 seconds later it was a joke and he was fine, but I feel *so bad* for doing that even today.

My friends call me a nerd because I won't insult anyone they do, but its because I feel terrible for them not knowing they were hated.

 can't play video games with any violence in them, pretty much whatsoever. it's not because the violence itself is hard to watch for me, it's because the characters go through so much they don't deserve and I can't handle that.

 talked to a pedophile on reddit for a like month, until my (online) friends convinced me to stop. He was making me extremely uncomfortable, calling me his crush, saying he would commit suicide without me being there, talking about finding me through timezones, that sort of deal. I recognized the signs and knew what he was doing. But I didn't wanna block him, because he had no other friends and everybody needs someone. Maybe it wasn't intentionally pedophilic. maybe that was just his sense of humor. Maybe the only friend who could understand him was me. He was active in mental illness subreddits. Maybe it wasn't his fault he was like that.

That's not all of it. but it's fucking with my life. How the hell do I handle this??",06Aug2020,1
699,"I want to preface this by saying my friends are lovely people, there's nothing wrong with them or how they act, so I think the problem is with me. 

When I am around them I do have fun and I try my best to listen to what they're saying and engage in the conversation, but I feel like I can't fully connect with them and be fully present (my attention and memory has been very hazy, idk why bc I'm in my 20s) but in my head, I'm always thinking ""they must think I'm so awkward"". I try to stay away from more meaningful/deep topics since I don't want to make them uncomfortable, I think this is one of the reasons why I don't have any super close friends. I am nervous when they make plans with me. I feel like they feel bad for me and they're only hanging out with me out of pity. I'm afraid to make plans with them and impose myself/be a burden.

Another thing is I'm quite introverted, I used to be more extroverted but as I grew up and met more people, I started feeling more insecure - my friends and the people around me are amazing people with strong goals, I don't feel like I measure up and over time I slowly start to withdraw from social gatherings out of shame. So there were times when my friends were going out they would always invite me, most times I would turn them down or go home early because I felt so anxious, so over time they just assumed I wouldn't be having fun and stopped inviting me as much, 

It's probably just in my head. I think if I was more comfortable and open then my friends would open up too. There's just that possibility that I'm actually intolerable to be around and my fear of rejection is holding me back from forming meaningful friendships. Does anyone else feel like this?",06Aug2020,1

We're both open to each other and talk about anything without awkwardness. At some point, it came to the topic of sex and I whipped out the question ""What size do you think is small for you?"" She replied ""I think 5 inches is really small."" But the thing is.... I'm around that size. I've listened to her story about having sex with well-endowed guys and how much she loved it. Obviously, it left me shattered into pieces. Should I still confess or would it be better to remain as friends?",06Aug2020,1

709,"[M 17] For the past month or so , I've seen myself get progressively worse with my mental health. It hasn't been a fast nor slow decline but its starting to get to the point where I cant bare it anymore. I'm slowly losing interest in the things I love such as art, piano, games, football etc. And I can see myself as being a burden to others for feeling low. Its as if I'm just idly watch myself lose everything.
Im getting exam results on the 13th which I didn't even take the exams for (didnt get the opportunity because of the current situation) and all I can think about is my career path lately and I have no back up plan

I constantly feel like I have no space, in my head and to physically breathe. Constantly nerves, shaky and i get panics in uncomfortable situations.
I also get these panicky dreams where when I wake up from them, I cant tell if it was real or whether it was a dream (numerous occasions ive found myself recollecting memories that never existed with people and realising it was a dream) and sometime that really hits me hard in the head in the morning 

I went through therapy a while ago but it didnt help but somehow I managed to find a path to recovery but right now I'm struggling to think of things that are keeping me from being happy or things i can do to improve. I just feel like a terrible burden on the people around me and feel like if I dont do something they'll end up getting fed up and give up on me. I genuinely just feel like I'm drowning at this point and I need some advice on where to start because im fed up of sitting around doing nothing all day.",06Aug2020,1

I'm panicking. They are my best friend, I've shared everything with them. I trust them with my life. I don't want to ruin it.

We're both thirteen. I've stated many times that I'm too young for a relationship. I've had to reject someone before, so I've ranted about it to them.

712,"I have high high anxiety. I left my job as a cashier in January, I have been jobless since. I am a full time pre-med student. My parents are paying for my school under the condition I keep a job and don’t get pregnant and a couple other things. They don’t care what job it is, they just want me to work and gain experience. 

I am very very clumsy. I walk funny and trip over my feet a lot. I am still teased about it as an adult. A family member used to relentlessly laugh at me for it and flat tire my shoes as a kid and I think some of that has stuck with me and I’m pretty scared of being like the worst waitress ever.

Once I have a coffee I’m pretty great with customers, I know a strength I have is that I am very charismatic and can keep up positive interactions. This helped me out a lot as a cashier. It pissed my past co workers off and made them resent me though when customers would come in and ask where I was.

I also have really bad memory, and I know that at least in my family food orders are always very complicated and substituted because of diet restrictions. I would be very worried about messing up orders constantly. My old boss used to get very upset and throw things/cuss when we messed something up. I stuck around because I fell in love with my co worker. (Yes still together)

713,"My boyfriend (25) of 8 years and I (26) are in the market for our first house. 

I’m looking for advice regarding if we should move to Location A or Location B.

I’ll list out the pros and cons to each location below.

Location A Pros:
- Close to both our jobs and potential future jobs. We work in a specific field and all the jobs are in this immediate area (5-10 mins away). We’re working from home currently and have no idea if we’ll ever have to go back to the office. 
- Close to boyfriends friends and family 
- Diverse area with lots of foods from around the world
- Nicer amenities (library, leaf clean up, rec areas)
- More walkable  
- Nightlife 

Location A Cons:
- Expensive property taxes
- Louder (from traffic)


Location B Pros:
- Close to my friends and family (My relationship with my family is tighter) 
- My family could help us out with child care 
- More affordable houses, taxes, larger properties 
- Close to my medical care. I have a rare chronic illness and my doctors are 40 mins-1 hour from Location A/10-30 mins from Location B (depends on which doctor/location I’m seeing on any day) 
- A really nice area with a huge potential for ROI
- A hospital is 5 minutes away 
- Better schools 

Location B Cons:
- Far from jobs (30-1 hour away) 
- Far from boyfriends family and friends (he sees his friends almost daily where we are now. He’s extroverted and I’m very introverted so this is a huge thing for him) 
- Everything is way more spread out, takes 10 mins to get to a grocery store. 

If you were me/us, what would you do? Move to Location A or B? I know this is a very personal decision, but I’m honestly extremely conflicted and just want to hear some outside opinions",06Aug2020,1

718,"Hi reddit, I have a work issue. I work for a small tech company in a major city. I'm the office manager, which is not a particularly well-paid position, but it's simple and allows me a real work-life balance. I have really loved working for this company and I feel VERY lucky to still have a job in the COVID world since, ya know, office manager on the internet is kind of not a thing. 

I managed over the course of the first month or so of WFH (my city has been locked down-ish since mid March) to redefine my role to focus on culture, and solving problems remotely. I know my boss (and others) are happy with the work that I have taken on and I have essentially fleshed out a fully new role for myself. 

Last month, the leadership team decided that we were ready to do a partial reopening of the office, where a small number of people at a time could go in, with specific rules and restrictions in place (although no one would really be there to enforce them). The office will be open, by reservation for *only the employees who want to go in* on certain days during the week, and in between those days, I am expected to go in and clean. There has been A LOT of emphasis on how this whole process is voluntary and no one should feel pressured to go in and no one will be asked to go in who feels unsafe or doesn't want to for any reason. Except, you know, for me. 

I do not feel safe going in. I have asthma and other health issues. I will need to take public transit to commute to and from the office. Outside of this I really do not take risks, (pretty much just grocery store and home for me) so if I get sick, this will 100% be why. 

My boss, who is also being required to come into the office periodically (he's VP level, so he's also involved in the decision making) and I have spoken many times about this being stupid and a bad idea, I have told him that I don't trust other employees social distancing/virus mitigation behavior. I feel strongly that he knows that I feel uncomfortable. I have not, however, officially said to him ""I don't want to do this, I feel pressured, I feel unsafe being asked to come in"" and we have been talking about this reopening plan for a long time. I don't know if the time has passed for me to ask not to do this, or to ask for hazard pay or accommodations. I am scared to lose my job, but I am also very scared that I will get sick. 

What can I/should I do?",06Aug2020,1

721,"Girlfriend and I (both in our mid 20’s) have been together for 4 years. Recently things have gotten difficult in our lives and we’ve joked about making an OnlyFans or selling nudes and sextapes. Well over time this has seemed to become less and less of a joke and more of a serious thought for both of us. A little insight on me: I find the idea of doing this extremely hot, in fact a couple days ago the situation got brought up by her again and I said I was down to do start in a couple months, more on this later. Well today it got brought back up by her again and today all of my deep emotions and concerns about this hit me like an 18 wheeler with a broken brake pedal. You see, I have a lot of insecurities. I’m a little overweight and I’m insecure about my penis size especially as I’m a little overweight (6 - 6.5” roughly). Both of us are also insecure people, a clear indication of this is both a prime example and another reason for my skepticism: neither of us likes the other one looking at porn or nudes of the opposite sex, it makes both of us feel insecure and jealous. This is another contributor to my feelings about OnlyFans as clearly more men than women will be subbing and I hate the idea of my GF getting an inbox full of dicks. The idea of her just selling her nudes makes me feel so strange and I don’t know what these emotions are nor do I know what to do with them. I have a history of clinical depression and I feel like exposing myself to this kind of lifestyle would cause me to obsess over the messages and the comments and what my girlfriend is thinking and feeling. I’m very torn because I don’t want to not do something based off my emotions only because I’m the type of person that constantly needs to question myself and make sure I’m not just being weak and letting my emotions get the best of me, but I’m scared of the repercussions on my psyche and our relationship if we go through with this. Thankfully I’ve mentioned I’m concerned about all this and she has told me that if I’m uncomfortable we don’t have to do it, so she’s understanding. But now I’m at a place mentally where I feel like I’m holding her back from doing something that she may want to do. Again, I do think that it would be really hot to actually go through with doing it though It’s a separation between my sexual desires and my feelings, I’ve never faced this before and I don’t know what to do.

My parents have been arguing too many times. They were married for 20+ years and I don't understand why they're still together. My dad is ignorant while my mom is aggressive and always has high expectations. My sister moved out a long time ago and recently she has noticed how toxic their relationship was, she also thinks she got anxiety from them. 
My parents would argue almost every week and a major argument happens every month on average. Divorce is a common thing that's talked about and god I wish That they divorced . I want to run away but I'll regret it. If I call my sister to pick me up and have a break then my parents (mainly my mom)  would get mad at me for not being there. I always witness the arguments and I get headaches from my mom yelling . She thinks she has a right to get aggressive and she thinks that that would help her husband understand but no. They want me to help renovate a house I never asked for and even though I am an a+ student they think I can be a more better child.   
They say if I don't like living there then I should leave but I don't have a strong mind. Arguments have been normal to them and at this point they are expecting ones in the future. I hate it how they yell in front of their child I hate it how they expect so highly of a 13 year old I hate how they put smart over emotion I hate how I have to be stuck with them I hate almost every thing. I'm not treated horribly but it's agonising to be called dumb or  
Smarter than my husband or to be witnessing so many arguments. Of course there's good in the Bad and that what makes me feel so guilty. I dont understand why they're still married and I feel hopeless. I don't wanna ""stay strong "" I'm sick of it I wish they can just be the parents they think they are. They have a false sense of hope and they think they're raising a kid for major success. I hate the pressure and I want to stop it.

Can I refinance the individual private loan to lower the rate? Should I?

He wasn't a bad doctor, I just think that some of the things he said might be harmful, coming from a doctor.

I first had an ultrasound with him at the beginning of March, the Corona virus was known about but quarentine hadn't come into effect yet.

During that ultrasound he spoke of how the news is blowing up the Corona virus to try and cover something else up, that it's not serious, it's not as bad as the comun flu and there is no need to worry or take any precautions.

The second ultrasound I had with him was about a month ago. There are alot of rules and precautions in place due to the virus, one being using a mask while a public building, so I had to wear one in the clinic along with everyone else there.

During this one he had his mask at his neck the whole time, while being very close to my face, continued to talk about how it's all exaggerated and said that the masks are useless because the virus can pass through the holes. He also spoke against vaccines, insinuating they cause autism.

I thought this was very inappropriate for a person in the medical field, specially dealing with a vulnerable group (pregnant people). 

He also said a few racist things, I wouldn't say they were ""very"" racist but they did make me slightly uncomfortable, specially as he didn't say anything of the sort when my bd was in the first ultrasound (he is black) but then said in the next when he wasn't present. 

I don't think it's enough to get fired for but is it enough to mention to his bosses or something?

If I'm not cruel I feel like women definitely take me for a fool. And if they don't take me for a fool then I kinda take them for a fool, because when you have power you can use it to the best of your ability. Like i feel like submissives like when a person in power knows they are in power and is willing to express that power to the fullest.

And i don't want to be sadistic, but I feel like I have no other choice. I feel like if you aren't sadistic then you are just making it easier for others to acquire power which frees them sometimes to be sadistic to you. So i distrust everyone and feel constantly suspicious and like every conversation is a power struggle and don't know how to get around this and if I can't then i just see myself as just...idk. like maybe i'm bad at it and that's why women don't like me. And if everything is a power struggle friends don't exist, or they do within that.

Idk. I want to make friends but I fear being honest cause it could put me in danger. I want to make friends but I kinda feel like friendships dont exist and are only temporary.

751,"I am a teaching assistant in a classroom with three other TAs and a lead teacher. Last March, right when schools closed because of covid, I caught covid. The lead teacher knew this and is extremely germaphobic. Well, for this coming school year, we were changing classrooms and so we needed to pack up all our stuff to move it to the new classroom. But she was afraid of having me help out with packing and moving since I was exposed to covid so she wanted me to stay home. I asked her SEVERAL TIMES over the entire summer if there was anything I could do to help them out. I also asked her to let me know of anything at all I could do to help them out. She told me every single time no because of me having covid (even though that was all the way back in March, but whatever.) I tried to take the initiative. I tried to reach out to help. But she told me no every single time. Flash forward to yesterday, she finally asks me to come in to help with some of my own teaching supplies. I come in first thing that morning and the very minute I walk in, she seems very irritated and says, ""...all THESE ladies (the other TAs) came in helped out ALL SUMMER"". I can't remember exactly word for word what she said but it was as if she was angry that I didn't help all summer, even though she TOLD me several times not to come in. She said it with such attitude and resentment. I tried to remind her that she told me not to come in, but she just interrupted me. Now, I'm afraid all the other TAs think I'm a jerk for not helping out, as if I just chose not to. What do I do? I don't want them to be mad at me but I don't know what to say or do.",06Aug2020,1
752,"My apartment closet is pretty long and the lint from my drier gets everywhere. I've tried wiping the machine down in between loads but that doesn't seem to help. I also empty the drier filter after every load.

I bought some covers for my clothes but two issues there: 1) it's not the most ideal setup having to take clothes in and out every time and 2) the lint covers the entire area to the closet door and gets on everything, not just the clothing.

753,"I am now in my 2nd year of college. Since we graduated from high school, we met once a month for the first year and then twice a year. However, she has become really really toxic lately. Making mean comments about my appearance, hurting me physically (throwing stuff at me which she finds funny), and more. 

To be honest in high school we were not that close. We only talked in school but outside not because she  intimidated me. I was never myself around her.

I changed a lot the past 2 years. I have other interests, I am more confident about my appearance, I am working out, and even wearing make up.

She made fun of all of that one time we met saying that she didn't expect me to wear make up or to dress ""girly"". We don't have anything in common now.

I decided to stopped talking to her this year around March after we met and she nearly broke my nails (I like to keep my nails long). It scared me and since then, we didn't meet anymore. I decided to stop talking to her.

I didn't reply to her DMs but she called me twice daily to the point I was scared to turn on my phone. After days she stopped but then called my mother. My mom told her my phone was broken.

Things were ok until now because she didn't call. She just DMed my mother again.

754,"I know this isn’t AITA but I’m not allowed to post the update there due to the nature of it. And I REALLY need advice. 
original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i3wi20/aita_for_calling_my_mom_homophobic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
 
 So, I (18f, lesbian) talked to her last night. I was going to wait a bit but she said, “Will you go to this lgbt-friendly temple with me?” so told her I’d go if she promised to hear me out. She immediately started getting upset. Keep in mind this entire time I did not raise my voice, I knew the best action was to be polite.

 I started off very simple, “Why can’t there be two dads in a kids show? There’s straight families everywhere, so why would same sex families be sexualizing kids?” 

 She then said she knocks it all, that kids shouldn’t be sexualized and coupled up. I was in shock because obviously that is not what I was talking about. I said, “Mom, we can’t take relationships out of the media or real life. Straight parents exist and are in a relationship on shows everywhere why couldn’t they be same-sex?”
 
“It’s not fair to parents! Kids shouldn’t see that! You’re pushing your agenda! It’s wrong and gross for children. Sorry I care more about children than your lesbian agenda!” She started screaming at me, I felt so heartbroken.

 “It’s not about an agenda! It’s normal! I’m normal! We just want it to be normalized! Kids can learn about love without it being sexual! How do you think people explain how mommy and daddy got together?’” (how parents met, ex: your mother was so beautiful I fell in love) 

 “It’s just wrong. You’re wrong. It’s pedophilic and disgusting. You’re being a pedophile trying to push it on kids! I CARE MORE ABOUT PARENTS THAN YOUR AGENDA! Parents shouldn’t have to explain that to their kids. What if they’re homophobic? They shouldn’t have to see it.”  She was wailing at this point, waving her hand at me. Basically siding with homophobic parents, like it’s impossible for them to have gay offspring too. 

I nearly threw up at this as the whole pedophile acceptance thing has been something homophobes hurl at the lgbt+ community to make us look bad. Also it hurt because I was molested by one at a young age so to be called a pedo kinda makes me want to die. I don’t see how I’m sexualizing kids for wanting at least same-sex parents in a couple kids shows. It’s not like I’m saying it only has to be cast of gay people. I feel so lost and heartbroken because after my whole life I never thought she was actually a homophobe. 
BUT HAHA! look where we are now. 

 My 9m brother was in the room, he told her that she was wrong herself. Even earlier in the day he secretly confided in me that she asked “do you think it’s okay for gay people to be in cartoons?” to him and made a stank face when he said yes. 

It ended with me looking her straight in the eyes “The fact that you refuse to even listen to me and immediately shut me down proves you aren’t ignorant, just homophobic.”

  Anyways, I left to stay a friends house because she kept screaming and saying I was wrong and disgusting. So that’s fun! But I’m dropping it for now. I’m going to write a long essay with every talking point I can think of to say “hey, you’re being a homophobe mom.” in a dumbed down way. I’ll update what she says to that and possibly cross post it on Insaneparents because well- yeah..... anything I should add to it? Suggestions? Advice? I feel like I don’t know who my mom is anymore because of this. If she doesn’t realize it’s wrong to call me that then I might have to cut contact with her after I move out.

756,"My sister is my roommate. She pays rent and other bills on time. But when it comes to cleaning it's like pulling out teeth. We've been living here for almost a year and I am pretty much the only one cleaning the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. Eventually I realized I don't even use the living room that much and the mess in there is from her and her cat, so I stopped cleaning the living room and continued cleaning the other rooms. If I want her to clean something I have to go up to her and tell her to please clean it.*

We have a dishwasher, for the past year I've been rinsing my dishes and then going around the apartment and finding and rinsing her dishes and putting it in the dishwasher to be washed with my stuff. 

About a month ago I realized I was cleaning up after a grown adult (She's 28). So I stopped and her side of the sink started to pile up for a while. Last week she finally put her dishes in the dishwasher and left it. Didn't clean them at all. The dishwasher wasn't super full or anything but it had enough for her to do a load, and over the week she gained more dishes that she could have put in to make it fuller. 

So on weekends I always clean. I do my laundry and clean my room and put dishes in the dishwasher. Her dishes were still in there. I tried to fit mine in but there was no room. So I took a few things out to fit my stuff (one was a really gross moldy bowl, I kind of didn't want it to be washed with my stuff). My logic is: 
Why would I put in half my dishes, wash hers and mine, with my dish soap, and come back later to finish off my dishes. When I can take a few of her things out to just do all my dishes. She had all week to run her dishes through.

When I explained it to her she gave me a (https://images.app.goo.gl/8pTDAhTMcciLzBay8) look. She's like ""well if you're already doing dishes why not just run my stuff?""

I do a (https://images.app.goo.gl/BjK21pBeW2EJjRiY8) look and explain again, ""why would I do half my dishes and come back to do the other half? Like I don't want to waste my time doing dishes twice."" She gave me that look again like I wasn't making any sense. And I was like, ""plus I only took out a few dishes and you had all week to do yours. Also that bowl is moldy.""

She says something like ""well I don't know how you do things and I don't want to mess it up and upset you."" She does this a lot and it's very annoying. 

When we first moved into our current apartment she kept moving my stuff around, I couldn't find my stuff and I got upset.** 

And she moved my stuff around on my shower caddy that I paid for to make room for her stuff, instead of putting it on her shower caddy (yeah it's cheap and flimsy compared to mine but it's hers) or putting it on the shower corners. 

She put my dishes in a box to give away to Goodwill, and she would have just dropped off if I haven't noticed the stuff in there was mine.*** She explained that we have to many dishes and silverware (her past roommates left behind a lot of stuff) I asked why she didn't put her stuff in the box then. She said her stuff was better quality. Which was true I got cheap silverware from Walmart, like a 4 pack of forks for under a dollar cheap. But it was still upsetting either way. I told her she needs to ask me before doing these things because it was really upsetting me. 

And ever since these events (and a few others) she's like ""well I didn't do this or that because I didn't want to upset you"" and I'm always like, ""well why didn't you ask?"" And she basically never responds to that and moves on. I really think she's just the type to do first and ask for forgiveness later. (It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.) It's very annoying and disrespectful in my opinion but I guess a lot of people do it. 

Am I in the wrong for removing her dishes? Like an I actually being crazy and unreasonable like she's making me feel? Maybe I didn't explain things right for her to understand? I don't know. I just need advice communication isn't my strong suit. 






*Pretty much every time I cleaned the bathroom the next day she'll do her makeup or decide to finally wash her hair and make it dirty again. It drives me nuts and most of the time she didn't clean up after herself. I have to tell her to clean it up after she's done and she always half-asses it. So I end up making passive aggressive comments like ""don't forget to clean the bathroom"" not the most mature way to handle things but yeah. 

**I'm a pretty emotional person some times so I get upset and cry or get angry easier than others. I have no idea if it's because of my childhood trauma or because of my learning disability or just part of my personality. 

***She even put her Christmas gift to me in the box. She didn't even realize it was her gift to me because she regifts stuff she got from people and gives it as gifts to other people.",06Aug2020,1

759,"I feel like a big baby for saying this, but it's more annoying and frustrating than anything. It's gotten to the point that I don't even want to talk to either of them anymore. Well, not have real, actual conversations with them, anyway.

Example: Husband and I will be talking about his work, well more like he'll be upset and griping about work - off and on all night for HOURS - and I'll try to make suggestions. Like ""You're the face of the company that the customers actually see. And customers know that you can get things done, so they expect more from you. Tell them you WANT to help with the issue, but it's not up to you... People are usually pretty understanding..."" and he will literally RAISE HIS VOICE, speak over me, go on about how TERRIBLE and AWFUL people are, and literally not hear a thing I'm saying. As if he doesn't want to hear my opinion or suggestions or anything.

And it is very frustrating. I feel like a therapist at times that can not even offer advice to the person that's taking up all my time and energy discussing their issues/problems that they have no interest in actually solving/fixing.

As for my Mom, she listens to me for the most part, when I can get a word in. She has ADHD and talks talks talks so it doesn't bother me as much as my husband's (imo) rudeness.

How do I deal with this? Is it my fault that they're talking over me nowadays? This feels like a new development. Maybe I wasn't listening to them before and this is their response to my actions?

I don't know. I just shut down at this point. With husband I say a lot of ""uh huh"" ""mmhmm"" ""oh"" and nod my head a lot. With mom I actually have a pen and paper and write things down as they pop up in my head - because she actually has GOOD, interesting discussions that get my mind working. It's just that I can't really add to the discussion bc she's talking so much lol

Should I actually try communicating and saying ""You're talking over me a lot. Are you listening to me? Do you have any interest in hearing what I'm saying?

There will be a TLDR if you don’t want to read this.

So at the start of this year I moved to my current school and yeah I made friends a settled in and all that jazz,then in my friend group there was this one girl who I thought was cute and kinda unique,we grew our friendship over about a year and a half and I was the closest boy to her,so that meant a little something,we always annoyed each other but I don’t think anyone had any idea about how either of us felt,about a year into school I we started to like each other but no one knew it.


A few months pass and we’re in lockdown,now  there were about 10 people who’s parents made them come in for half days for whatever reason,and lucky me that girl was in there,so I was thinking on how to ask her out for a bit and thought just do it when we are next alone.


Skip a few weeks and I asked her out,she said yes and I found out she had liked me for a while but was too scared to say it,understandable.So yeah now we are together 


A few months pass (her phone was taken away) and I start to text her,but I’ve noticed something about her,she’s always busy and doing something so I can be left on delivered for an hour upwards,now I dont blame her,we have talked about all her issues and family is one of them,I do not blame her at all for not being able to get back to me quickly,but currently I can’t do anything to occupy myself besides youtube,message her a bit,and eat.but the times I’m not with her or not talking to her are the worst times of my life because I just feel empty like I have no reason to exist (I’m not suicidal)and I love this girl ,I see myself getting married with her,I want to be with her to the end I mean it,I don’t want to leave her,it would emotionally wreck the both of us,probably me the most as I feel I’m more attached.

Now here’s the thing,I feel like I’m just thinking all of this because I’m bored,impatient,not understanding,and overthinking,and the worst thing is,we will go back to school in a month so like I’ve came so far just to feel like quitting at the end,but her lifestyle doesn’t match mine,probably because I’m a no life with nothing better to do and she’s actually busy being productive,but I feel truly unhappy when I’m not talking to her (most of the time) because the times we are able to talk no one can think of anything and it pains me that that’s how it is,I want to talk to her,but it’s just becoming a struggle.

If this goes on I will consider leaving her,believe me I know it will be the worst mistake of  my life but in the long run I feel it will be better,I feel she’s the one I feel she deserves my love and I deserve hers but I need to be realistic,am I just unable to handle her actually having a life or do I need to leave before something bad happens,as I said,I would be dare I say actually depressed if I leave her,but (here comes the douchebag part) one of the only reasons I’m staying with her is because she’s attractive and is good at doing chores,I know how that sounds I’m a piece of shit for “using” her but I’m not happy right now and I cant even talk to her about it because il just get a “I can’t control how busy I am” please help me

Then you pull each 4 cards, you're not allowed to look at the cards, and lay them on the board.

Then you must pull a cadd from the deck. If it is lower than your card (the one you saw), then you can switch it.

If you get a Queen from the deck, you can switch one of your cards with one of your opponent s cards.

For a bit of background, I am 24, I am doing a PhD and I don’t really have any friends. The reason I am mentioning that I am doing a PhD is because being at university is what made me happy. Since lockdown, I am back in my parent’s home and I feel like shit.

My parents have always treated me like a child. The latest example is today when I wanted to go and buy a bottle of wine. On the way to the shop, my mom called me and asked where I went. I told her I was going to the shop and she said “what for?”. I told her I was going to get some chocolate because if I tell her I want alcohol, she will make a big deal out of it (not in an angry way but more of a belittling way). For example, I am a very shy person and alcohol makes me ‘come out of my shell’ (but honestly I can handle myself when I’m drunk). Whenever I have been at family events and have dared to speak up, my mother will say something like “awwww look she’s drunk!“ and embarrass me. I feel like I can’t drink without being almost made fun of. Anyway, when I came back, she saw the bottle of wine and said “chocolate...” in a condescending way. It makes me so mad, I honestly just want to be left alone. I want to do whatever I want without having it questioned.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years and we are completely different. When we argue, i am almost certain that I want to break up with him, but when we don’t, I feel like everything is fine. He is not a bad person but I must say, deep down I feel like I know he is not ‘the one‘. Although we get on well, it is almost like a friendship. I honestly have no interest in having sex with him.  When we argue, he says horrible things and in the moment, I actually DESPISE him. 

I don’t really have friends because I was bullied in school and always have found it hard to make friends. 

Before lockdown, I felt like I could deal with my life. It wasn’t perfect but it was bearable. Since lockdown, I want to fucking scream. I want to move to another country and start again. I am sick of being treated like a child by my parents (they are not and people but I have zero confidence and I am 100% it stems from them because they belittle me all the time (even if they don’t mean it negatively).

And now it is messing up again and I do not want to put any more $ into the car. I have the option of living with my mom who doesn't like me and just want me to live with her to help out with bills. 

Of course I want my own place and a new car but at this time I can't a for both at the same time. I just started a job that pays well but I have to wait a month before my first check. I really need a car because I know for a fact it will break down soon and I really want my own place because I do not want to go back into an abusive situation living with my mom again.

780,"  
My (18m)  dad (50m) has been coming home and starting to argue, scream and curse either at me, my mom(40f) or my sister (14f). It's really getting on my nerves, he is the absolute definiton of a piece of shit. In front of other ppl he is the soul of the party and behaves nice. He is a kiss asser for other ppl while he treats us like utter trash. My home is downright disgusting. For him me and my sister are nothing compared to the other kids our age. It doesnt matter that me and my sister are trying to do smthin so we wont work 8 to 5 our whole lifes like he is doing.. No that doesnt matter. We arent going out fking all day. We are not working underpaid jobs.. etc. What is mostly getting on my nerves is the way he treats and the thing he does. My mom has a business which he actively tries to saboutage. It's a small business wchich requires a lot of restless nights and all the money she has made. The bastard would go out of his way to ask for money from my mother and take money from wherever she has hid her savings. He has done the same with my and sisters savings. He thinks that since he is paying the electricity bill he is almighty. 

I can go all day on abt the shit he has done. This is the recent stuff. But believe me when I tell you that my father is a coward and piece of shit. He likes to curse and talk smack abt my mom when she aint there. Cursing out loud etc. When I was younger and ofcourse weaker than I am now. He used to corner me alone in my room. When none was around. When I was 16 that was the last time he tried to come at me, because the moment he tried to come and hit me and beat me, something in me snaped and rage filled me I was about to fight him with all I have got. But the damned coward noticed it and he backed away. Same happened with my uncle recently he was screaming at my mother abt some argument and I am really tired of those 2 brothers( him and my father). So at the sight of him screaming at my mother, I snapped and  told him go abt ur day u fucking faggot. He was surprised for a second and decided to come at me as if he would fight me. I got excited... and went up to him but my mom got between me and him before I went on him. He stoped tho and was puzzeled that I would go at him like that.  


Now that you have a basic understanding of how much of a prick my father is. What should I do to get him to stop treating us like that ?   
Or to change the situation we r in, since we dont have anywhere to go..?  
 I dont wanna move out and leave my mom and sister, I would rather do something nasty to both my father and uncle. I think that because of them I have deveoleped strong anger issues.

tl;dr: My father is a prick and I dont know what to do abt his behavior towards us.",06Aug2020,1

Honestly just want to buy a bus and drive around the US helping marginalized ppl in every context, but it sounds unrealistic.

Is there any way we can not let her get away with this? I have her contact information but the cybercrime unit here is not that great and the amount was really less(close to $10).
The fact that she got away with it upsets me and I just can’t deal with the fact that there was nothing we could do. Is there any way we can make her pay?

793,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for some opinions on my current situation. I've been living a shared flat in a super nice location for a year now, it's nice but has it's bad sides and sometimes it's very very frustrating (dirty kitchen, dirty bathroom, flatmates not sharing costs of common stuff, etc.). The station is 5 mins away and very well connected to everything (40 mins to work). I found a flat, for the same price as my room, but it's a studio apartment, only me. Good size, big windows, first floor and all good. Except the location is not as great as my current flatshare, the people are different also (more poor, hence why the flat is cheap). The station is 10mins away walking, and to work it's 55 mins.

The only thing bothering me kinda about my current shared flat is having people around, is t worth it to give up all the other good stuff to live alone? Anyone went from shared to alone and can share their experience? I'm more introverted and like being alone usually, and I'm 23 years old.",06Aug2020,1
794,"I was involved in a toxic and mutually abusive relationship last year. My lack of self-awareness, drug abuse, and unresolved mental issues led to me being unable to contribute to said relationship. More importantly for this post, I fundamentally lacked an understanding of consent during the relationship. This entailed fingering my ex's vagina to try to pleasure her while she asked me to stop and then not stopping until she faked an orgasm. Then, there were various times in which I initiated sex but she never resisted nor said anything to try to stop it, but this is still non-consensual and I should have known better than to engage in sex without enthusiastic consent. Additionally, there were times in which due to extreme relationship strife, I began having self-harm thoughts and voiced that to her because as toxic as the relationship was, she was the only one whom I told about my issues at this point. These incidents happened when she threatened to stop talking to me and I simply couldn't cope with the idea of that because of toxic co-dependency and lack of strength. Finally, there were a couple completely accidental incidents while we were in the same room that led to her being injured; nothing severe, intentional, or lasting injury.

Recently, she made a multi-part story on social media detailing what I did to her, calling me a physical and emotional abuser and rapist. She used my texts to her as evidence against me and performed character assassination. She said that my explanation of accident to explain her injuries were an excuse to mask abusive behavior when I never once intentionally laid a finger on her. She claimed that my self-harm idealizations were false simply because I did not actually hurt myself in any significant way. Finally, with the rape part, I understand fully now what I did to her, and can not downplay the significance of my actions on her, but still feel that there were never ill intentions in what was already a complicated relationship in regards to these sexual encounters.

Now, I have deleted all social media and am currently laying low during the fallout and am not sure what I should do. I have pondered so many different scenarios in my head including:

1. Making a social media story explaining the numerous ways that she used coercion or straight up violated consent with me, emotionally abused and manipulated me, and had a penchant for intentionally hitting/punching me
2. Making a social media story earnestly explaining my recognition and taking of responsibility for my actions while vowing to become a better person, learn from my mistakes, and try to make amends for what has occurred
3. This is the one that most of the people in my life have suggested, which is to simply lay low for a long time, not have a public profile (social media and IRL), and give people time to forget about this and me.

All my close friends and family already have heard my side and those that stuck around support me and are expecting big changes in me to never get myself in this kind of situation again. However, I know that it is very possible that in the future new people who enter my life will find out about this or the guilt in my head will make me want to confess about this toxic relationship and associated fallout.

Just as a factor of what kind of person I am, I am choosing not to run away, nor change my identity, nor hide, but I also don't really know where to go from here. Everyday I teeter between making a public confession (#2 mixed in with a bit of #1) and sticking with my brain with #3. I am not too emotionally bothered by the fact that I was exposed on social media like this anymore, but also am very concerned about my life path after such a reputation tarnishing story on my ex's part. I understand the severity of cancel culture and only wish that people out there can see the good in me and see my action to make up for past mistakes and be better going forward.

I have already told myself this is necessary information to tell any future romantic partners if I see myself going the distance with them, and even wonder if friends I meet in the future should know this part of my life. I do not want to live a lie but also understand the practical necessity to keep such a difficult situation under wraps.

About 2016 Early Fall, she calls me at about 11pm. Saying the she tied to cut her wrists, because he boyfriend dumped her for good. Talked her into going the the hospital’s psychiatric ward. 

We hit off our friendship with a bang. Didn’t press anything romantic at all, she wasn’t in the right mindset for that anyway.

But when I get home in the evening, I’ve been finding it so, so hard to motivate myself to do anything other than laze around.

802,"Hi everyone, I wasn’t sure where to post this but I’ve been stuck in doubt and worry for some time over my current relationship. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months now and it’s been an interesting 8 months between Covid and my personal struggles. We’ve spent a lot of time together, every day in fact (until this month when she went to see family before college starts again) and I have enjoyed being with her but my emotions are stunted by depression and anxiety. I am currently seeing a therapist and will be trying medication again because I have struggled with my mental health for many years.

I’ve made a lot of changes in my life with her support. I’m going back to college in the fall and I’m working a better part-time job for my schedule. I’m not doing great personally but I’m doing better than before - I was drinking a ton and not taking care of myself whatsoever. My girlfriend helped me through all of it, but the mental health aspect requires professional help and I’m hoping it helps me.

The biggest worry I have with our relationship is my lack of feeling ‘in love’ with her. This is also my first real relationship - my first “relationship” was a summer fling filled with infatuation and lust. I know now that that wasn’t love and it wasn’t healthy. With my GF now things are much better; however, I have this nagging doubt about us and I don’t know whether it’s my own insecurity, my anxiety and depression preventing me from opening up and falling for her completely, or if she isn’t the one. She’s wonderful. She cares about me so much. She supports me. She is open with me about working together in the relationship. She’s a good person and hardworking and I’m lucky to have her.

I was the only one really trying and I did everything, including begging him to love me correctly.. he was cheating on me as I suspected but I never had real proof until I moved to his home state, for him I might add. He was trying to get with his ex, had sex with multiple girls and somewhere along the line I contracted herpes. We fought a lot. Things were supposed to stop but he continued to talk to people behind my back and try to meet up with people. Looking at girls while he’s with me. I even had dinner once with one of the girls he cheated on me with Bc it was his sisters friend. Eventually I stopped arguing about it Bc time went on but the pain never went away.. we just grew really toxic. I come from a family who screams a lot so I picked up on that bad habit and don’t communicate my feelings very well because I’m just very angry and hurt. Basically traumatized. He’s put his hands on me, choked me, smothered my face, pulled my hair and body slammed me and has slapped me. But that hasn’t happened for awhile. I’ve dealt with him critiquing me ALOT, calling me dumb, trying to one up me all the time, a person who has a get-back mentality and somewhat I feel he’s in competition with me. He says he talks to me this way because his mom did it to him and he competes with me because I basically replaced his sister? He never really has had respect for my parents and now has an even deeper issue with my dad. Somewhat I think it’s related to his dad not being in his life. I always try to sympathize with him. 

Up until probably 2 months ago he was looking up his ex’s profile and the girls he cheated on me with. Now he doesn’t really do anything like that. We even deleted social media, his request Bc now he’s insecure thinking I want to get back at him. Now he’s trying SO HARD, because I’m completely NUMB. I’m so angry, hurt and depressed.. I feel emotionless but I’m really not in actuality. I don’t really feel the same towards him anymore, I somewhat hate him. He’s always been really nice, loving, motivating, giving and affectionate in between all of this and that’s really what’s toxic.. 

I guess where I’m at now, is he has changed a lot of things about himself for our relationship and has proven he can change. There are things I still want him to change, like he has irritability problems for example, and he always takes it out on me and talks to me like shit. We’ve talked about this and I’m not sure it can change because he’s always been this way as long as I’ve known him. I honestly stopped trying because I’m exhausted and I was putting in all the work for almost 4 years and only now he’s trying his best. I could put in more effort if I felt it was worth it but it’s hard to say. 

Our fights are insane, we never see eye to eye. He likes to drag them most times and I feel he picks the smallest things to blow up. I would much rather not fight as all, and almost never choose fights, I’m usually wrong for reacting which he says I’m wrong for. Idk I’ve been wanting to leave but I guess I’m just trying to see if you guys think there’s rooms for improvement here. It’s kinda hard to fit 4 years into this post.",06Aug2020,1

Anxiety with covid and BLM protests got the best of me. It's not affecting me now, but I know if I don't have success this month I'll be on performance review.

I feel like a different person than when I started. I've started hating capitalism, the idea of a 9-5, the structure of society putting people's worth on the title they have and the money they make. The expectation to be 100% ""productive"" 100% of the time. I just don't think it, anything matters. It's all a construct. Honestly just want to buy a bus and drive around the US helping marginalized ppl in every context, but it sounds unrealistic. 

I also feel ungrateful because it is an amazing opportunity... people have lost their jobs. My family and friends all say I ""really have no choice"" so I stopped confiding on them, but things just got worse. This job has moved me to depression, my hair's falling out, I'm breaking out, I throw up all the time, I breakdown over the smallest things.

He isnt allowed to leave his room when she has people over, he isnt allowed into the kitchen at night, he has only just gained his right to shower whenever he wants, if he wants to go anywhere he needs her permission because she is his only way in and out of town because they live in the country for the rescue. If she calls him, he runs out the door no matter what hes doing because of what argument itll cause if he doesnt come immediately.

I have a lot of issues with my all my brothers but currently I live with the youngest one i have. He's almost 11 and hes really fucking annoying. He really likes FNAF and all he does is sit on his phone all day watching videos not listening to me, my mom, or my dad. He never appreciates anything we do for him, all he does is scream and cry. We try to take his phone away but he'll just throw a fit and cry for hours. Besides that today I ran into an argument with him. My dad told me to tell him to come downstairs. I did and he just said no. I kept doing it and jokingly said I would hit him if he didnt but he kept screaming no at me. And then he tried to hit me for real so I was fed up and yelled at him and then I threw a toy at him. What my problem is, I dont know if I did it on purpose or not. I think I did but I dont want to believe I did. I hurt his eye bad and made him bleed. Part of me was happy because of all the shit he gives me I finally got back at him but I shouldnt hurt him and my parents are mad at me. I think I have anger issues cause every time someone pisses me off I just want to hurt something or someone. Sometimes i'll even have homicidal thoughts but I always try to ignore it. I dont know what to do and I really wanna stop being so angry but I always have a reason to be angry. Nobody ever takes me seriously, I always get blamed for stuff, and sometimes Ill just get all the shit from everyone around me and I dont know why. I wish I was an only child sometimes.

The fact that the boss ended my interview with ""and by the way - ALL LIVES MATTER"" on top of there being actual zero covid precautionary measures in place are making me highly anxious. It's a small office space with 5 employees - social distancing is impossible and I had to share a computer with someone.

831," I'm looking for desks for a gaming pc that also doubles as storage for various things. I was originally planning on buying an IRONCK desk off of amazon with overall positive reviews, but then I was recommended another desk. It's a Sedeta desk with all the things I wanted in a desk! Monitor mount, CPU shelf, and extra shelves. But, I saw this shelf only has 2 reviews so far and that makes me nervous. Both the reviews are positive but I've heard of companies making false positive reviews before so I'm a bit paranoid. 

Should I settle with what I was originally planning to get, or should I take a risk and buy what may be my perfect desk?

832,"Context: I bought a gaming laptop for college last year and I’ve decided that I’d rather have something simple. The laptop was over $700 and is still in perfect condition. My little brother wants to buy it from me and offered $700 for it, I told him he could have it for $600. 

Issue: we are moving, due to a lot of conditions I don’t control and issues in my family my dad forced my brother to pick up my stuff and move it while I was away. They put it in a trailer then covered everything with a tarp as it was going to rain. After it rained they uncovered it and found my laptop was wet. It is currently drying and I am going to try to take it apart and make sure that all the water and anything that got into is cleaned. My little brother tried to start it when it may have still been wet and it worked until a blue screen. He turned it off and it’s been drying since. 

I’d like some opinions on what to do now. I am broke from just buying a car and don’t have the money to just replace the laptop. My dad is in denial of any responsibility even though I had planned on moving everything that week and there was no reason to move it any earlier. My brother and I have a good relationship and I don’t want to mess with it by pushing the laptop on him now that it has possible damage. However we had already agreed that he was buying it so I could get a cheaper laptop and use some of the money towards my car. I’m upset that neither my dad or brother cared to move my +$700 laptop out of a trailer they brought down the highway at +60mph when it was raining. My current opinion is that regardless of whether he is buying it or not leaving the laptop to go in the trailer was incredibly reckless with an expensive laptop. I had been working for weeks and was unable to get home to move my stuff. If they had just waited two days I had already planned to move everything myself. Nothing has been done since and so there was zero reason to move my stuff other than my dad being impatient and reckless. I am upset with both of them and would like some outside opinion so I don’t get stuck in my own echo chamber.",06Aug2020,1

840,"How to get over arguments that never come to a solution?

One big argument I always had with an ex was him setting boundaries with a friend who would talk negatively about me. I just wanted him to make it clear to her that she can’t talk that way about me/ to me. Also, she would send little flirty messages here and there. He never wanted to because he wasn’t “the police”. I had issues with it so I had to deal with it and speak to her.

Another one was seeing each other during the pandemic. When cases have dropped in NY and I got tested negative multiple times and quarantined but he saw his friends everyday. I got upset that I seemed to be last place. Again, I was painted as argumentative because I kept bringing it up.

841,"(18F) I know this is kinda dumb coming to the internet for advice like this but, idk what else to do.

My best friend (19F) of seven years is dating now. The guy she's dating is a great guy. But every time I see them together it really upsets me. I think its because its just a reminder that, even though we're so close, we won't be able to stay best friends for much longer. One day one of us (most definitely her first) will find someone that we want to spend our lives with. I know that she won't go to me when she needs advice, wants to talk, share a life moment, or just hang out. She'll go to her partner. I won't be the person she goes to anymore. This has already been happening. And I know that might sound selfish ""well duh she wants to go to her partner its natural."" I know that our relationship can't stay the way it is forever. People change and grow up and we move on. But its still painful watching it happen.

She leaves in less than a week for college. We haven't been able to hang out at all though because she's been busy with work, getting ready to move, hanging out at a resort with her boyfriend's family, and now has her family over visiting. I doubt we'll be able to hang out together, just us, before she leaves. Like we used to.

I really want to talk about this with her, but how do I tell someone ""Hey I can't stand to be around or see you and your boyfriend together because it makes me feel like I'm not getting attention and like I want to cry""? Like? I can't just do that. Especially to her because I know it would make her feel awful and I don't want to do that to her. I would also feel like a little kid saying something like that because, even though she's only a year older than me, this past year or two has made me feel like that difference is so much bigger. I still live at home (an issue I'm still dealing with), no job (also trying to fix), and literally no friends besides her (I lost a lot of them after graduating high school). Meanwhile she's moving out, has a job, has friends, a bf, a car, and her parents actually treat her as an adult.

When she moves, I'll literally have no one to hang out with at all (not that I would much with quarantine but ya know.) I don't really know what to do rn. It feels like my best friend is slipping away and I can't really do anything about it without risking looking selfish and inconsiderate of her happiness.",06Aug2020,1
842,"My wife and I bought our first house 6 years ago and are now looking to buy a new home.

While looking at homes for sale, we were given the advice that we need to list our home first, as nobody who is selling their house will consider an offer from someone who doesn't have their own house listed for sale. But we're concerned about being able to sell our home first, and then not being able to find a home before we have to move out.

We live in northwest Indiana, and houses that are listed sell *fast.* We know people who have sold their home in 2 days (right around the corner, 300 ft from our house), and even in less than 6 hours (in a town \~25 minutes away). People are moving out of the Chicago area in droves and hoping the border for lower taxes. So we anticipate selling at least within a week if we price it right.

I'm thinking that if we find a house first, and then essentially make an offer on the home and list our home simultaneously, we would be fine. Since homes are selling quickly, would that really be a big issue? I know we can stipulate (as the seller) that we'll move out by X date, but I want to minimize that window so as to be good to the buyers.

Also, we are working with a realtor, and she will be feeding us listings as soon as they go on the market, so we are not relying on websites like Zillow / Realtor to search for homes.

I feel like waiting to list would be better than listing and then rejecting offers if we're not ready, but this is the first time we're selling a house while also living in a house we need to sell, so I'm just not sure.",06Aug2020,1

Then this became something we did online, currently a website and soon to be app. It records our location, also. And now they are telling us we have to do it every day, even on vacation and weekends/off days. 

Does this seem like some kind of invasion of privacy and/or asking a lot of your employees?

I just feel like none of them understand that I’m trying so hard to please everyone, and that I DO love and care about them, which is why I’m trying so hard to spend time with everyone, but that I’m also starting to hate myself for not being perfect and for not being able to spend 24/7 with every single person in my family or with my partner.

I’m in incredible pain. I’m 36 and my life as I know it is over. I’ve accepted that. I’m not certain what the future holds but I’m ready and excited. I need your help.  I’m sending out an internet flare for an idea, an offer to help, or perspective.

An incredibly quick summation of my life. I’m about to be very cavalier about this next part. I promise you there’s no emotion you feel like you need to convey to me I haven’t experienced (check my unsent letter).

Parents hated each other and used me to fight once divorced (I think I was 2). That forged a world class shit eater and a professional peace keeper. Having fun yet?

When I was 15 I started dating my wife.  We waited till marriage, at 23, to have sex and chemically it was a letdown (yea hormonal birth control) glad all the shame and self-denial paid off. The relationship while sweet and an amazing love story was based in a crazy dynamic of me serving her fear and jealousy. I’ve experienced very little in life and have never really grown up.

Aug 8th 2019

After years of struggle and heartache and domination my wonderful wife confesses she has had a 5 year affair with my best friend. And several others online with people I know and some I don’t.  22 years of hard work self-denial and sacrifice gone.

I’m devastated, Suicidal but most of all I’m a fixer.  I wash her feet every night for 100 or so nights.  I wash my best friend’s feet tell him I forgive him and love him and its best if I never see him again because I’ll not be this way. I comfort her. I suffer in isolation to ensure our ability to move forward. I have a precious wonderful life I’m very thankful for.

This has been unspeakably devastating and breaking our cycle (ruts) of domination has been a challenge.  Not to mention my best friend is inescapable. I get group texted with him often. My therapist fell in love with me, my mom conditionally supported me with restrictions. My kids lovingly talk about him. That is to say one year in I am very disappointed in my growth and peace and hope  I feel like a closeted human.

Here’s where I need help,

Actually let’s start with what I don’t need.  I don’t need fuck her, fuck him, fuck your kids blagh blagh blagh.

I’m legit a good dude and those decisions of forgiveness grace and “fuck it that’s life” have been made and are in the past.  I truly see the incredible blessings in how those choices served me and her and maybe someone reading this.

I need an escape.

I need formative individual experiences.

I’ve been dehumanized and emasculated and I need to undo that.

I need 10 spring breaks and one night stands and summers and flirts and bachelor parties and to get high and see some tits and chill and breath and be validated as person and be chosen and supported.  I feel so left behind in life. I feel like a closeted man, human.

One year is Saturday and I want be destructive (see the unsent the letter in my profile (if I post it)). like I want to post that on my insta and burn down his life.  I’m thinking instead of taking from him I’ll give to me.  Like leave.  Meet strangers. Have an adventure. Be chosen be served. Not have a plan or a boss for a minute. Disappear.  See if I come back   or come back with confidence and clarity and with experience. Maybe clarity.

So… what do you think? I’ve never thought for myself. I don’t know how to be selfish.  And the fucking world is on fire but who cares.  I have some motorcycles and I’m not afraid of corona, I’m afraid of regret. I’m a little afraid of this day.

Maybe I could post my burner snap for those that would like to follow this adventure.

847,"  Hi everyone!  


I would like to ask for help on how I should approach the project below. I have no experience in creating websites except for CMS, but I would like to implement the following idea and learn something about creating websites. I would like to create a website for high school graduates, where they will be able to check which courses at my University they have a chance to get with their results from the maturity exam.  


Side note: I am from Poland so the admission process may be a little different then in other countries. Here is how it works: 

1) High school students write matura exam from three mandatory subjects (Maths, English, Polish) and facultative subjects.

2) Universities take into account all of your scores for mandatory subjects and usually one extra subjects of your choice. However, for every course there are different wheights so:  


If you apply for maths your score from Maths will have higher weight then Polish and English.   
If you apply for linguistics your score from English will have higher weight then Polish and English.  


Soo if there are over 100 possible courses you could apply it would take a loot of time to calculate your points. Also you wish to benchmark well againts last year lowest accepted score and/or minimum treshold University reqires.  


\-----------------------------------

In principle, it should work like this:  


1) the candidate provides the results of all the baccalaureate he wrote  
2) the party converts the points from the baccalaureate into recruitment points based on the weights in force for each major  
3) The page counts the maximum score that can be obtained with the given scores for each course  
4) the page returns a list of fields of study for which the candidate can obtain more points than the last year's thresholds and / or the established minimum thresholds, together with the most favorable combination of high school diplomas for a given field of study  


I know that something similar works at other universities.

\-----------------------------------  


My questions:  
1) What tools should I use?  
2) What skills should I learn?  
3) Where to start?  
4) How to create an algorithm that will count the results?  


Thanks for all the advice!Send feedbackHistorySavedCommunity",06Aug2020,1

Our Neighbors, who seem like nice people, did a DIY project during quarantine and built a patio around their pool along with a privacy wall that towers well over the fence line. They put quite some time into the project, but from the second they started it, I was bothered by the fact that it was so close to our property and so tall. Doesn't look good. Being a new homeowner, I wasn't aware of setback regulations. They're unable to build a patio within 10 feet of their property line, so it's obvious that they don't have a permit.

853,"I recently started a new sleeve with the tattoo artist I've been going to for years. I am considerably covered in his art work, so I am a consistent client of his. This time we didn't get into the chair until an hour and 20 minutes after we were supposed to start the session. I was overall completely out of it afterwards because it was a long session. So when I was checking out and he ended up charging me for the whole session, I froze and had no idea how to approach it without being confrontational. I wanted to say something, but at the spur of the moment I ended up just tipping him for the hours we actually did. 
His rate is really high and has gone up over our years of tattooing. I feel like at the very least, he over charged me an hour. But he was also taking longer personal breaks during our session than he usually does so I was more likely overcharged for more than an hour. I'm not going to worry about the exact rate though.
I feel bad because I was ready to tip him very well, for the rate of our initial session but just one hour changes the % of the tip drastically. I have a follow up session in a couple weeks to continue working on the sleeve. I wanted to approach it the next session but I don't exactly know how to. I don't feel right being over charged, and I hope he wasn't taking advantage of me. I would like to avoid this confusion in our future sessions.

My wife recently returned to grad school for a second degree and has been renting books via Chegg.  I'm also in grad school and we both took classes and rented books this summer.

On July 20th we printed labels to return our books.  She received a FedEx label, which has never happened before, and mine was UPS, like usual.  We dropped mine off at the UPS store and went to Walgreens to drop off hers.  When we dropped off hers, they didn't have her sign anything, didn't print anything for her, nothing.  Just took the box.  It seemed strange but we just shrugged it off because we've never had issues before.

Lately, I'd say the past year or so, he has gotten kind of intolerable most days. He just rants. He goes on and on about how everything he disagrees with or doesn't like is bs. And he does usually have solid points to whatever argument he has. Justified opinions, but not justified emotion. He will even get to the point where he will sit and yell at me about things I agree with him on. From politics, to social rules, to how he thinks things should be. If you ever differ in opinion about anything, he will probably end up yelling about how you're wrong. Even if its about something as mundane as how to make the bed.

Quite frankly, im sick and tired of it. I feel like a punching bag all the time. Ive told him this, but nothing really changes.. I'm pretty close to just wanting to leave him, but we have a young baby so i want to make it work. How do i bring up maybe looking into some sort of anger management or counseling?

869,"I've been down on myself a lot lately. This stems from my sexual frustration and falling way short of my potential.

Sexually frustrated because I'm spending hours out of my day swiping and DM'ing constantly. It doesn't feel so much like I'm trying to find love as it is chasing leads. People don't take into account the effort that men have to put into messaging. I can't just say ""hey"" and expect anything. I have to deconstruct profiles and construct texts that lead to engaging conversation. With many, this turns into long, promising correspondences with lots of flirtation and interest in meeting up. But then it inevitably dies down. Keep in mind, it's enough with one person, but when you're doing this with multiple people, it's like a full time job.

While I've had success, it's such a low return on investment. Even when there is one, there's no guarantee that I'll get to have that experience with them again. Earlier this year I was battling erectile dysfunction. I was with an incredibly attractive girl, and as I was in the bed, I thought, ""why is this happening? I've been looking forward to this so much."" I felt empty. Then I slept with a couple of girls I wasn't attracted to after that.

Then I reconnected with someone who I had a one night stand with a couple of years ago. Met up a few weeks ago for a couple of good rounds. Then we met again last week, and it had to be some of the best sex of my life. Everything was going perfectly - three rounds in an hour's time. But the issue is, she has a boyfriend. I know she's not available, but going through long periods without hearing from her makes me feel like I'm going through a breakup all over again. She reaches out occasionally and we'll talk for hours. I will feel better again. Then I'll see where I sent a message to her and I'll be marked as ""read"" with zero response. I feel dead inside again until the cycle repeats.

Society has a way of minimizing the emotional beating men take from getting rejected over and over again. And as a guy, I can't say ""I have a sex addiction"" without it sounding like bragging, but, to be honest, sex is the only thing I look forward to.

Whenever I go a week without, or when I don't have a steady FWB, I feel dead on the inside. And that unearths every insecurity I have. I have to clear Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat message histories because it crushes me to see reminders of being rejected. The worst was yesterday when I messaged an older woman I used to work with. I had a crush on her. She responded, but then dismissed me by saying ""have a good rest of your day."" Even though it was a polite rejection, it still cut deeper for some reason. I blocked her.

Then I messaged a girl I slept with a few times last year, who works at the coffee place I go to every day. Yesterday, sent her a message mentioning that I saw that she was single again. No reply. I didn't send any messages after that, because I stop as soon as I get the hint. This morning when I got my coffee, she acted very cold and distant towards me. Didn't even make eye contact. It's really depressing to see someone who once acted so friendly towards you become disgusted by you. She was really great in bed and it stung to read old texts where she wanted me to come over for sex.

And now I hate myself. I hate that I'm lazy, and that I'm a college graduate working retail because I am too much of a bum to submit applications. I live at home at the age of 27, and people treat me like a loser for it. I skipped my family Thanksgiving out of social anxiety. I'm condescended to constantly. I have a communications degree, with minors in chemistry and psychology from a private university (with a 3.5 GPA). My professors have told me that I'm bright. I go to the gym. Yet I still don't like my body, I feel stupid, I hate that I am the way I am, I'm on the brink of berating the next customer who treats me like I'm a dumbass. I feel constant jealousy too.

877,"So, the the title says, I have a really bad habit of ghosting people. 
I think traditionally ghosting is seen as a conscious choice made by someone to somebody else but for me that has never been the case. I don’t just ghost potential romantic partners, but also my friends and family, and I never do it on purpose. In general I have identified two cycles in which I end up ghosting someone. There are as follows:
Situation #1 (the dating one): I start talking to someone on a dating app-&gt; we talk for a while, maybe even a few days -&gt; eventually I forget I have even downloaded the app -&gt; I remember and look at the app again -&gt; I realize the amount of notifications coming from the app are extremely over whelming and I can’t even open it -&gt; I don’t respond to the person for weeks, and at that point the connection is lost.
Situation #2 (the friends/family one): my friend texts me/I text them -&gt; we talk for a bit -&gt; they take more time than like three minutes to respond -&gt; I forget we were talking at all -&gt; they respond, I open it, read and respond in my head -&gt; I get distracted/side tracked and don’t physically respond right away -&gt; I forget they texted me at all and since I opened it I’m not reminded by the notification -&gt; I remember way too late that they texted me and at this point it’s weird to respond
I would say for me situation #2 is way worse because I know that it’s a bad way to maintain friendships, and it makes me a flaky friend and that’s not what I want to be. While it could be solved by just not reading the tests they send, I get overwhelmed by a lot of notifications, as previously stated, and generally end up leaving them on read longer by not opening the messages up. I think there is only one person on earth who I don’t have this problem with, and I don’t know why that is. I’d say that Situation #1 is mostly frustrating because it makes it way harder for me to form new relationships, especially since I’m not meeting these people in real life for some obvious reasons. I will say I do have ADHD, which explains but does not excuse my memory lapses/tendency to distraction. I just want to know how to break these cycles. If you have any advice that would be greatly appreciated, because I know when I get ghosted it hurts me and I don’t like ghosting people even though I’m not doing it on purpose.",06Aug2020,1
878,"I have one cat and an extra large litter box. I clean it about every day or every other day. Ever since I adopted him I have had issues with keeping gnats out of his litter box. No matter how many times I empty it, scrub it, bleach it, rinse it, dry it and replace the litter, once he uses the bathroom the gnats are back. 

His litter box is in our laundry room which is sharing the door with our garage where we keep our garbage until it gets taken up each week. There's no where else I could really keep it other than a bathroom downstairs that isn't near the garage. 

Should I move the litter box into that bathroom? I don't know whether to try gnat traps, replacing and cleaning the litter again and then moving it or what. It won't be an issue with the cat and moving the box because when we first got him this was where his litter box originally was. It's very visible and open, so he'll see it very clearly.

Well, I've told my parents about it and they are going nuts thinking that I won't be able to make it, and they keep telling me not to. I have a family of three: my wife, a baby, and myself. So I need some advise from you guys, particularly the ones who've been in sales and commission.",06Aug2020,1

882,"My ex and I were friends for a few months before we got together. Was about seven months before I broke up with him (I was dealing with mental health issues and didn’t love him anymore). During the relationship we both thought we were a great couple, now I’m not so sure. It is driving me nuts thinking of it so I want an outside view. I will try to recall best I can. Me first.

1. I was a very emotionally distant person. At first I told him every waking thought I had, by the end I barely told him a thing.
2. I snooped through his journals for the hell of it. I confessed due to guilt and he said “what’s mine is yours” and that he didn’t care at all. I’m still convinced I did something extremely wrong.
3. I constantly pushed him to get a therapist for his depression for months but would ignore when he suggested the same back to me. I always told him to be honest with me with his feelings then continue to not tell him mine.
4. I knew for a while I wanted to break up, but I put it over for months due to not wanting to hurt him. Near the end I started to ignore him and be distant to try to make it easier.

That’s all I recall for me. Obviously there could be things I don’t recall or things I don’t recognize as bad. Now him.

1. He told me when we were friends he wasn’t over his ex. After we got together and I learned he still followed her I said it made me feel uncomfortable. He said he would unfollow her but didn’t. We had the conversation twice.
2. He was jealous of my friend who was like a brother to me. Said friend had a small crush on me before I met my ex and the crush was over before we got together. My ex knew this because my friend and I made jokes of it. When my friend came over to visit, my ex would message me things that translated to “I think you two are going to get physical.” I reassured him over and over it wouldn’t. But the longer my friend was over the meaner and my ex’s messages got to me. To clarify: friend and ex were close friends because I introduced them to each other so he knew both of us well. My ex would also get quite upset when I said I found anime characters or actors attractive.
3. TMI: He never got me off. He constantly instigated sex and nearly always got off. I never did once during months of dating. When I brought it up he said he worried he was doing things wrong and gave up on trying to pleasure me.
4. He was incredibly clingy. Like if I wasn’t touching him constantly he would make little whiny noises. If I didn’t message him within ten minutes he would spam me with sad faces until I answered. Went on for months until I blew up at him and he stopped.
5. When we were friends we talked of moving in together. When we started to date I said to wait. He still would constantly ask me about moving in together. I always said I wasn’t comfortable with it but felt more and more pressure to do it though.
6. We weren’t dating at the time but this hurt me the most. So we are both trans dudes. We both were pre HRT. One time we were hanging out alone in a room and in the middle of our conversation he called me my deadname. It wasn’t a mistake, he smiled softly and said it as if he thought it was a cute sign of how close we were. I slapped him, told him to never do that. He never did.

There are more small things he and I both did but would take forever to list them so I’ll leave it at that. He is a good dude, he cared a lot for me and was constantly making sure I was okay. Showered me in gifts and affection and planning our future together. He isn’t a bad guy, and we were both going through a lot mentally during our relationship. This was my first time dating so I think I’m just still worried and unsure. And want to know what to change or watch out for whenver i date again. Be aware I could be biased towards myself and for all I know I did a lot of bad things. But from this, what do you guys think?",06Aug2020,1

Ok so basically, I'm still questioning by sexuality (I'm most likely bi), and when I told my mother that I am probably bisexual, she said that I was just imagining it and that it wasn't true (when I told her she just said 'no' repeatedly). Please, don't say that maybe I am not old enough: someone can understand they are bi/pan/gay/lesbian/other even when they are young.
The thing that makes me mad is that she supports gay people (she said it like this) because they ""are weak"". By ""are weak"" she meant like weak mentally.

892,"Hello. I am a 19 year old female starting my sophomore year in a college in the USA. My college is opening up this coming year (I only have one class online), and so my situation has nothing to do with COVID-19. 

This summer I worked really hard and made quite a bit of money. I think I will be able to pay for my tuition myself, with a bit left for books. However, this coming year I am staying with my parents rather than living in the dorms. This is for a number of reasons: the dorms are very expensive, COVID-19, my parents want me back. My parents are asking for $300 a month for rent, which is a lot less than the cost of living in an apartment as well as what I'd pay for living in the dorms. On top of this, my parents recently added me to their car insurance, which will double it (because I am so young). They are expecting me to pay the difference between before vs after adding me, which would be about $250. So they are asking for $550 a month. I do not have to pay for my phone bill, internet, or TV, and food is included in rent. 

Now, my parents expect me to keep my summer job, reduce my hours, and only work weekends. My mom mentioned an on-campus job would work too. If I work my current job on the weekends, then I would have 0 time off, little time to do my homework, and my entire day would be high activity, high stress. For only minimum wage ($13.50 where I'm at). I am estimating I'd work about 16 hours a week. I would prefer an on-campus job, but they are incredibly hard to obtain. I am actively applying for them, but I probably won't hear back for a while. If I got an on-campus job, my hours would be capped at 10 per week maximum, the same wage, but my job would be much easier and I would have more time for homework DURING my job. It would be much less stressful. And because on-campus jobs pretty much only work M-F, I would get my weekends off.

This coming semester I am taking 18 credits, which is the maximum number of credits. The number of hours I would be in class per week would be 19 (I take one credit, three hour labs), not including my one online class. I am going to be swamped. 

Do I stay with my current job on the weekends, be burnt out but make more money to give to my parents? Or do I quit and HOPEFULLY get an on-campus job? I am so stressed just thinking about it.

904,"I'm 14, but please don't attack me for it lmao About the post itself - I live in Europe + I'm not asking if it's *hard* to get that scholarship, so I won't be giving out any specifics. Anyways, this is quite lengthy, so if someone reads it all, I will be forever greatful. Sorry for grammar mistakes and whatnot, it's late and I haven't slept much recently.

Onto the subject. In a year I'll be graduating school and enrolling in High School. I didn't choose a specific one yet, but there's this school I am interested in and oh my god, that's *the dream* school. I fell in love with it as soon as I've read about it. It's a boarding school with a british educational system - it would give me a chance to study abroad and would also open many opportunities before me. So, what's the problem?

The fact that I'm poor and it's a boarding school. It's... *really* expensive. Around 135 thousand dollars. My parent's income would let me apply for a scholarship that covers all of the fees and there would be NOTHING left to pay, but since it's a scholarship contest for a prestigious school it would be really hard to get in. Especially since I would be entering the academic contest.

There's two stages: first, you need to submit your application via an online form. I don't know how many people applied last year, but twenty-one students were chosen for the second stage. It takes place 2-3 months after the 1st stage's deadline and it's a weekend, where the candidates meet, write general exams, attend lectures, take part in group classes and have individual meetings with the teachers. Usually, 8-9 people get the scholarship, but that depends on how many students actually pay.

Should I try? I've gone through the ""required academic background"" section and my grades and other accomplishments seem to suit the description of what they're looking for. I'm taking part in two competitions next year - one is literary, the other one's subject is a foreign language (English for me, because I don't live in an English speaking country) and if I win, the exams (the ones you take at the end of the year) from the said subject will be marked a 100%, leaving me only with math.

About my GPA - I was the second best amongst my classmates this year, which I know is not speaking in my favor here, but I am sure that I could get better grades beginning September if I really tried. Another con - I think that the fact that we were in quarantine for half a god forsaken's year might negatively affect my chances to get that scholarship, because, I don't know, the grades this year seem less legit.

I genuinely don't know if I should try. There's another school I will be applying to, 10 thousand dollars this time - I think I'll be able to get a scholarship here without trying harder.

Keep in mind that I'm an above-average student, but I'm not exceeding expectations. I think I would be able to switch to the latter with hard work, but is it worth it? I'm not sure if a one extremely good year will be able to make all the above-average years seem better in the yes of an examinator.

Another thing I feel like I need to mention - you've probably guessed it already, but I don't have friends. I wouldn't be losing much if I just studied for a year, especially since I'm graduating soon. I just... need a little push, reassurance that it's possible and that I'm not just mumbling.

Also, yes, I genuinely love studying and want to get good education. My parents don't even know I want to apply, so it's not them pressuring me.",06Aug2020,1
905,"I (F22) found out today my boyfriend (m25) of nearly a year cheated back in February. We had only been going out for a few months and so the relationship was quite new. 
I found out today by the girl messaging me and sending my screenshots of their chat, apparantly she didn’t know about me until recently. He slept with her twice. 
I confronted him immediately and he was apologising over and over, basically begging me to stay. 
The thing is, in February we both were in a bad place mentally. He had just experienced his first close death and was suffering with his mental health and gambling addiction. In his thought process he thought that he wasn’t worthy of me or our relationship and the only way he can push me away is to cheat. As soon as he got his head straight he realised what a mistake he made. 

The thing I need advise is what to do. My head is saying leave him, once a cheat always a cheat etc but my heart wants to stay and try and work things out. 
He has cried to me and spoke and laid everything out what he’s going to do including deleting all social media, going to couples therapy and individual therapy and communicating more regarding bad days. 

I just don’t want to throw everything away and always wonder what if it did work but at the same time I don’t want to waste my time and a few months down the line it’s always going to be in the back of my mind and a constant sore spot. Will we ever get the trust back?

906,"Hello all! 

This is a bit of a long story but I'll try to keep it short, I'm a woman who started college in the fall at 19 - and then decided to transfer end of semester (great decision just another long story)  and came home to do CC got accepted to my dream school and because of credits became a freshman again, which I was totally okay with, but with corona I decided to defer a year since things look like they'll be a mess. That means next fall I'll be a freshman at 21 and finish right before I turn 25. I feel like I missing the boat. I know you can get an education at any age, and I'm very excited about my major, however I really want to have a good social experience. Highschool was a really dark time due to mental illness and being housebound due to a disability.

So I'll basically be 21 with not a single life experience to my name. I feel very lame and lonely a lot of the time. I'm excited to start school and do a little partying and crazy stuff, and join organizations/rush a sorority + get involved on campus. TBH I'm way more worried about how that will go because the very brief time I spent at my last school I finished with nearly a 4.0 and same with CC - I vibe really well with the academics in college versus HS Anyway I've heard people say they already feel old and can't connect with younger students as 22-23 seniors which makes me nervous, and I had someone even say it's weird to hang out with freshman because they're ""just kids"" I thought we were all more or less adults?

Life's been kind of a disaster since I was fifteen and I was looking forward to being somwhere new where I could make a some friends, improve myself, and finally have some independence unimpeded by my disability. Despite being isolated a lot I'm a really extroverted and social person. I have a lot of interests and passions, just haven't had many opportunities to explore them. 

I also worry I'll be ""wasting"" my twenties by spending the first half in school and not rushing to get out, even though I genuinely don't feel ready to be completely in the adult world, or have any qualifications. I also feel like I'm running out of time 18-19 felt like ""free"" years because I still had all of my twenties, now I feel like the clock is ticking. I'm lucky because I don't have the financial fire burning under me yet - parents contributions+ scholarships should cover my whol undegrad, which I'm incredibly grateful for.

Does anyone have any experience/advice?

Basically, I live with my parents and sometimes a sibling(college breaks) and we also have 3 cats. One of our cats has really bad matted fur, and we try to cut it (carefully) and brush him, but we don't do it nearly enough. We also don't brush any of their teeths, which we need to start doing. Our other two cats though, they're what's upsetting me. They're both overweight, one is 17 pounds and the other is 15. For years I've tried to ask my family to help them, to put them on a diet, and FINALLY my family has caved. They said they will take them to the vet and ask the vet for diet advice and help. Both of these cats frequently bite and pull out their fur, and also pee on everything. I try to scoop their litterboxes frequently, but sometimes I go a few days without doing them bc of my own health issues. I've started doing them everyday again, and I also change them every week no matter what. I feel so bad though. I feel as if we have neglected them.

911,"TL;DR 
- my partner said he would support me in finishing my degree then he quits his job to work on his business model in a PANDEMIC .


My partner and I have been together for almost 4 years, believe it or not he and I have made it through some very turbulent situations on my side of the family and his.  A consistent discussion that he’s had from our first date was that he wanted to start a business. I don’t normally start taking discussions like that seriously until I feel they’ve consistently talked about it for at least 2 years .

He has been bouncing ideas with me from the moment we started a relationship. I was working at McDonalds at the time and he told me that I could do so much better, so I started applying to work in financial services and then I realised I hated it and went to work as a software technician (I studied IT at Uni before I mat my bf and I stopped cause I wasn’t sure if it was me). My partner is a chef and has been a chef for 14 years. He’s been a head chef and been asked to be an executive chef. The problem is that he cannot stay at a job. He doesn’t get fired. He just leaves. He either is too ambitious . He is either not loving the paperwork that he needs to do - he’s not good with documentation. He hates being micromanaged by the owner daily. Those are only a few of the reasons that I have come across. His mother and his friends have told me that when he was younger he never stayed at jobs for too long. I confronted him and he says he can’t work for people but it’s normal in the cheffing industry to change jobs...He wants to put his energy in bettering his life and not others and he feels he can only do that by running a business. 

My partner was given work through his chef friends so that worked well. Due to my family, I went back into depression and I drowned my self in work but I was also unfulfilled due to the fact that the position I wanted to work my way up to required me to hold a degree. This then cemented what I needed to do. I wet back to uni to finish my degree - my partner said he supported me and even bought me a laptop so I could study full time. I handed my resignation in. Got accepted back into uni and I’m in the full swing of it all...Then my partner quits his job. “I’m too old to be getting yelled at work everyday” now he is like I need to start pursuing my business and since it’s covid...he feels it’s the right time to be planning it whilst he is “able” to.  I have done a few business courses as I have to whilst studying my degree in IT and he does have a good understanding of the different business models and he does have a direction he wants to take. He’s actually had really amazing ideas actually and I can’t fault him. He’s been using my old text books on Business Information Systems listening to podcasts (I told him to start having a routine) 

It’s a business he could easy start in the middle of a pandemic and not feel the financial strain. 

We don’t have the money behind us for him to get into his business. I was hoping he’d let me finish my degree first and then I’ll work and support us both while he pours his heart and soul into his business.  He just fucked over one of his friends who sorted him a job...and It’s just disappointing. 

I am going to be looking for work at nights again so I can still study but I don’t know how to approach this. I need him to work as government assistance due to covid won’t be here for much longer.  I don’t know how to talk to him? 


Like should I even approach him? I am just really struggling to study and I want to support him so bad and make his dreams come true but yeah.....

913,"Okay so this is gonna be longgg.

So I just graduated high school and I was all ready to get into college when this pandemic happened. The reason why I'm stressed isn't because I haven't got into college - it's a bit more complicated. My country has this system where private institutions have their own tests called 'entrance exams' and the colleges run by the government have a seperate country wide entrance test which pretty much works like any other college test - the higher you score, the better your college options are. (I explained this because I'm not quite sure how it works in other countries, just wanted to give y'all context)
Now my problem is I wrote this one test for a private college (let's just call it C). It was done online because of the pandemic and I got in. It's a good college but I'm not quite happy with it - never wanted to study there actually but I needed back up in case I don't get into the college I want. I had to pay the fees for the entire year and it's pretty expensive. My plan was to keep it as a back up and write the country wide test for the government colleges (these colleges are said to be wayy better than the their private counterparts and its definitely better than C). But the thing is C has already started classes which I did not see coming and the nationwide tests (gonna call them N from now on) keep getting postponed. I expected classes to start after N gets over because a lot of us in C will be writing N and they know that. C's refund policy says that if I don't leave the college within a month I don't get any of my money back. But by the time I write N and get the results it will be way more than a month. Not saying that I will definitely get in through N but I'd love to have my options open without having to lose money, study for college entrances and college exams at the same time. My parents keep telling me that it's okay if they lose the money but I know it's not - the amount is huge. We don't have enough money to pay for a college that I may not even go to.
I barely have time to prepare for N which I really want to write and I know if I just have the time I might just be able to crack it. But I can't just neglect C and skip classes because they have this thing where if you don't attend classes you will get thrown out (I know people who have been asked to leave C because of skipping a few classes). This whole 'I need to get into a good college' thing has given me sleepless nights for years ever since I got into high school and the stress has affected my sleep and my health to the point where I barely have hair on my head, I feel like puking constantly and I'm almost always feeling dizzy (sounds dramatic I know but that's just how it is). I thought maybe if I just put in the effort now and stay up and work my ass off, I'll get into through N and some time, even if it's for a day to just sleep without having to worry about something as small as this. 
I tried telling my parents that this is really stressing me out, I've told my sister, family, friends almost everyone I know and trust but all they say is 'you're doing fine' or 'you did well in school you'll get in where you want don't worry so much' or ' so many other people haven't even got into college'. Yeah I know a lot of people haven't got into college and I'm not saying my problem is the worst. But this whole thing is getting to me and I don't want to end up doing something that could negatively affect me. I know a lot of people have it worse, now more than ever, but I'm sorry I really need help. I've tried dealing with this myself and clearly this isn't working for me.

P.S: Just in case y'all are wondering to get into any college under N your marks should meet the cutoff. Otherwise you don't get into any college. That's why I haven't left C already",06Aug2020,1
914,"Just one year ago, I switched my entire career path. I’m 18 now, just finished sixth form, and applied to university. Depending on my results in a few days (fingers crossed) I’ll be going to September. I was dead set on interior design for a few years, and then I worked on set of a feature film and realised just how alive I felt doing it. I fell in love with every aspect. Since then I switched it around and applied to film schools for a broad degree (which includes acting, screenwriting, directing, cinematography, etc). I’m ecstatic. However I know universities aren’t easy. I know I haven’t been set on this for long. 

My biggest insecurity is my memory. I’m okay with short term (so learning scripts is fine), but I constantly forget names of everything. Not sure if the poor memory is a side effect of anything, but it’s been getting worse and worse, I forget key moments in my life etc. I’m afraid everyone around me will be name dropping all these directors and actors and actresses, editors etc, whilst I’ll be forgetting plots of movies I’ve seen the week before. I’ll stand out. I’m not sure what kind of advice I’m hoping for. One thing I don’t want to hear is that I’m too insecure for film school. It IS something I’m working on and planning to overcome. I’m unsure how to prepare for a film university all together. Any helpful tips, links, or words of comfort would be really appreciated. Thank you.",06Aug2020,1
915,"TW: emotional and physical abuse

So there will be a lot of long stories made short, and that will include skimming over my own hot mess behaviour - but it’s much more complicated than I can cover here, and I am well aware I need to stop looking. I would just really like some advice please. 

My ex was emotionally and one time physically abusive - cheated on me, manipulated me, what I now know is classic insecure narcissist controlling behaviour. Our relationship was a toxic shitshow and with the grace of hindsight (and therapy) I cannot imagine why I didn’t get out sooner. 

As well as the emotional side of things, he also pushed me aggressively a couple of times, more than once people in the street asked if I was okay because of how he was talking and acting towards me, and once this escalated to him pushing me down, pushing me against a wall, putting his hand around my neck telling me he’ll kill me. I woke up covered in bruises and with a swollen lip. 

He was with his ex before me for 5 years and within that time she attempted suicide several times during arguments ‘because she loved me so much’ - his words. Completely fucked up, obviously, but I have no concrete knowledge that this came about because he treated her in the same ways he treated me - it just doesn’t take a giant leap, right.

Anyway, he moved almost immediately on from me and I got his new relationship, and at the time I agonised over whether to reach out and warn his her about him. In the end, despite it causing a lot of guilt, I decided I couldn’t face opening that can of worms, and hoping that either he was different now or that she would find out and get out quickly. I couldn’t bear to open a chapter that absolutely broke me whilst I was still trying to put the pieces back together, and I didn’t want to face any possible revenge. 

It is over a year on, and no I shouldn’t be looking, but I have, and I’ve seen things that make me worried for her. Apology playlists that coincide with a trip away without her, the type of love bombing he only did with me twice - for spending two months cheating on me, and for threatening to kill me.

I didn’t even consider messaging her when I saw this, but it was the first thing my best friend said I should do when I mentioned it to her. Now again, I’m torn between the possibility of saving someone hurt (is this even realistic to believe I could do?) and of opening myself up to some sort of revenge (or even contact from him). I usually try and live by the principle of doing as much as is in my control to do the right thing, but I don’t know what that is here.",06Aug2020,1
916,"So, I've been wanting to dye my hair for a while now, and I asked my mom (hairdresser/barber), to do it for me. She said that she wouldn't do it, and throughout the next 2 weeks I kept asking her to do so, or else I'd simply do it somewhere else. Obviously she didn't take me seriously because today I bleached my hair at a friend's house, thought it looked pretty nice like that, so I didn't even bother dyeing it. So I come home, I wait for my mom, and she sees me, and immediately gets this sad face, asking me why I did it and what not, then she just looks at me, with the most disapointed look she's ever tossed at me. Proceed to my sister asking her how much food she wants (dinner time), and she said she wasn't gonna eat, and went to her bedroom to CRY. BECAUSE OF BLEACHED HAIR. SHAVED, BLEACHED HAIR. Like, next week I'll shave my hair again. The bleached hair will be gone. She cried for 1 hour straight, because of bleached hair, and the worst was the surprised look on her face, like I didn't warn her multiple times. Her reasons for me not dyeing my hair were that it was a thing for girls to do. It's 10pm rn, and she's still sniffing. WHY SO DRAMATIC???? My sister and my dad literally laughed when I got home, why does she gotta make me feel so bad about a decision I took upon MY hair. I think that at 17 I can already make a decision on what to do with my hair. It's just such an annoying situation. PLUS, my mom simply cannot interpret signs. I guess it's never occured to her that, the reason why I do everything alone and without mentioning anything to anyone, is because she has these reactions when I wanna do something. Such an overreaction that simply ruined the day.",06Aug2020,1

I saw it and I started looking down and I grabbed my phone. It was going really fast and it looked like it was pushing to the side of the road I was on. When it was passing me I waved and smiled but I couldn’t see anyone- though the windows in the front were all down. Then it drove off. I was relieved and I kept walking back and forth. (I was mad and needed to clear my head) Now I am a 13 year old girl and not very flexible/fit. And in my head I was thinking “what if I comes back?” And I pushed it away because why would it right? It came back. I saw it and I was close to the entrance of the neighborhood and I started running up hill. The car was going the same speed as before and it had passed me.

They are both overweight, and I feel awful about it. One of them is 17 pounds, and the other is 15. For years I've asked my parents to help them, to put them on a diet, ect, and today they FINALLY listened and said they'll talk to the vet. I feel devastated, though. We take fairly great care of them: we feed them day and night, give them fresh water, let our eldest cat outside whenever he wants and he always comes back (he needs to go outside, he loves it there), and we give them constant attention. I feel so bad for them though. The 2 overweight cats pull out their fur and constantly pee on things. The vet says they are stressed. We try to give them their medication, take them to the vet regularly, and take care of their health. But they're overweight and I feel awful. Also, sometimes I don't do their litterboxes for a few days. I ALWAYS change them out and give them fresh litter if that happens, and i change them out everyweek. I'm trying to do more.

But now that there’s no real proof that she call me those names she wonget fired but rather changed her schedule around so she doesnt work in the mornings when I go.

I honestly dont know what to do.  I love this gym that it’s the only one if my area for women only. And it sucks that I’m the one that has to leave.

The manager believes me but I think it’s that she doesnt want any consequences as the receptionist is claiming all this is happening because she’s black so she doesnt want any backlash

However, the manager did tell her that if I come ONE more time to her saying she called me a bitch, then she was OUT.  That she got one shot

Not sure what to do as sometimes we are alone at the gym. 

The three of us talked, and she said in front of the manager she never said those things . Also, when the manager looked away. She pulled down her mask and called me a bitch again.  I even told the manager : she just did it again!

We wanted to discuss getting out for a bbq and fishing (only classmates) and ofc they got random people (that im only ""buddy"" with , so no actual friends that i trust , only buddys) with them , so that upset me a little , but was ok , one of those friends was my ex that i broke up with because she started smoking (hate smokers , have made it clear in all of my friend groups , if they smoke , atleast don't do it in my face , and don't lie about it.)   
This was some backstory , now going straight to the point  


Seeing my ex smoking hurts me , because it destryoed our realtionship (made it clear to her too that i hate smokers , she lied) , seeing my best friend smoke its ok , since we've been friends for a long time and he didn't lie (thinking of ending that friendship as well , but not now , i can't do it now)   
Seeing my \*Female\* Best Friend smoking? lied to me that she does not? doing it in my face? i had to get out of that group , call a friend and tell him that i am really fucking sad. discussed things with him and other friend when i got home.

Did it in my face  
Everything. While knowing im am completly against it.

930,"This is my first time posting on this subreddit, I really feel down.

I've known for a while that my girlfriends mum and step-dad are homophobic and racist. I'm white (and so is her family) so I never had any issues when it comes to race but I still hate the fact they are racist (obviously). They kind of know that I'm bi. I told my girlfriend ages ago (before we were together). Her mum went through her texts (she does not know what privacy is).

My girlfriends birthday was yesterday, I slept over from the 4th-6th. She has always been nice to me when I'm there but she chats shit behind my back, even to my girlfriend and tells her not to tell me???

Apparently she doesn't want me coming over anymore because I asked her, ""Why don't you put your drinks in the fridge?"" The fuck? I'm 99% sure she is saying that because I'm bi or for some other reason.

My girlfriend desperately wants to move out. We are both 17. Her mum has always been nice to me, like whenever I talk to her. This just makes me more confused. Her mum is a bit of a dip-shit tbh. She never sat her exams, never went to college/uni. Never had a stable job that I'm aware of.

My girlfriend has 6 siblings. 5 of which range from 1-8 years old. The other is 18 and has Autism, cerebral palsy, ADHD. He is a nice guy but mentally 6. My girlfriend has to basically look after everyone. Her life sucks being honest. She does so much work and really gets nothing for it. Her step-dad (massive dickhead) is not kind to her because she is not her biological daughter. I don't really know her step-dad that much, she is worse than her mum but he is constantly out and works during the night and sleeps during the day.

My girlfriends family illegally claims benefits. Her mum is a cleaner at the moment and I know for a fact that she isn't paying taxes because she is getting unemployment benefits. They used to claim single parent benefits and claim that my girlfriends step-dad did not live there. They eventually got caught out.

Their family is SOMEHOW rich. They have the biggest TV I have ever seen in a house 50+ inches. They have a TV in nearly every room. Including the kitchen, kids room, their room, etc. They have a BMW and another expensive car, they even have an electric bin. I don't understand how they can even afford it. They buy TONS of food. It makes no sense how they can afford to have 7 children. I hate the fact that my mum (a psychiatric nurse) cannot even afford a proper home. Yet her mum has so much money. About 6 weeks ago she was telling my girlfriend that she couldn't afford something because she ""doesn't have enough money"". Since then she has bought a NEW car and that massive TV. I honestly don't understand how they have so much money. I know they are illegally claiming benefits but it makes no sense how they can have that much stuff.

931,"Hi! This might be a bit long so thank you to anyone who reads the whole thing!

Long story short, my ex \[20F\] of 2+ years broke up with me \[20F\] last month in order to work on herself. Our relationship was slowly becoming unhealthy and even though I wanted to stay in the relationship and fix things together + simultaneously work on myself, she felt she needed to do it alone and that's totally okay.

We had stayed good friends ever since then and always kept in contact, but recently she messaged me and said she thought I was the right person for her. She wanted to have space to work on herself for a few months to a year, but one day she wanted to revisit our relationship and hopefully end up together because she loved me so much and could still see a future with us together. I told her that I still loved her too, and I also thought she was the one for me. I told her I would've waited for however long she needed to feel ready to revisit things, until she mentioned seeing other people in the meantime. She said that unless we’re officially dating again, she's still going to meet other people and date people casually, with no commitments. What made it worse for me is that she's actively making the effort to do so; She’s already on Tinder, HER, and other dating apps talking to other people.

I honestly felt so hurt, because it doesn’t make sense to tell me how much you love me and want to be with me, when at the same expressing a desire to casually date and hookup with other people. I told her that I felt like a second choice and a back-up plan, for when things didn't work out between her and someone else she met/if she just got bored of being single. She insisted that I wasn't a backup plan and actually did spend a lot of time reassuring me that wasn't the case. However, even if I wasn't just a backup plan, did I still have a right to be upset? I understand that it's her right and it's her business to meet and date whoever she wants since we're officially broken up, so I'm really trying to see things from her perspective. It's just that personally, if I broke off from a relationship to work on myself and still had my ex as the end goal, I wouldn't even entertain the idea of dating again or actively pursuing other people. Not just because I still had a close attachment to that person, but because of how that would have made the other person feel; I wouldn't have wanted to pursue random people on Tinder if it meant hurting someone I loved or jeopardizing any past/present/future relationship with them.

After I pointed out how contradictory she was being, she also got upset and we went back and forth for a bit before I got tired of it and told her to please give me space to think. Should I cut contact with her forever? Or would I just completely mess things up with someone I love?

**TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend expressed how much she loved me and wanted to be with me in the future, once she's done working on herself. But until then, she also wants to see/casually date other people in the meantime. Do I have a right to be upset/Should I cut her out of my life completely? Or would I mess things up with someone I love forever?**",06Aug2020,1

Until yesterday. I was offered a job as a virtual PA/receptionist (you work in a call centre and answer the phone for other companies). It pays pretty well and would be stable which is a plus at the moment. It would also allow me to move out of my parents house and into a flat with my friends.
Then today, I interviewed for a content writing internship (interview was booked in before I got the other job). On paper this is more what I saw myself doing as it follows on from my degree, but I came out of the interview unsure of whether this company was for me. The ceo seemed quite old school (judges his life success on the money he has, expects you to work all hours of the day, saw me as somebody to mentor and that I was lacking life experience) it’s 4 months, unpaid with the potential to be paid after that if they liked me. I have no savings as university drained them so I would rely on my parents for the simplest things like petrol to get there.  Also, I’m not sold on this being what I want my career to be, I just seemed to fall into it because i already have some experience. 
Was expecting to hear back next week, but he rang to offer me the internship about an hour later.

So, please! Does anybody have any advice on what I should do?",06Aug2020,1
938,"This is a throw away account, so sorry if that isn’t really allowed in here, but I prefer to remain anon for this. Anywho, I’ve (24M) been talking to this girl (20F) for about a month now and she got out of a pretty rough relationship before we met. She made it very clear she wasn’t ready for a relationship and I told her that was fine and we would move as slow as she wanted to go. We had sex on the first date. Oops.
She admitted to me that she is talking to other guys, (has tinder still) and that we are FWB, but is physical with me exclusively. That’s fine, what confuses me is the fact that she seems to actually have feelings for me but she just doesn’t want to admit it. She drives 35 minutes one way at least once a week just to see me, she’s blown off her friends just to spend time with me, she even borrowed her moms car to watch a movie with me, no sex involved. She says she enjoys spending time with me and obviously has a good enough time to keep wanting to come back, and the most recent few times she’s came over it’s like she doesn’t want me to leave for work and she definitely didn’t seem to want to leave after we watched the movie.  We go out for dinner, lunch, she’s met my dad and a lot of my friends, and she’s even considering joining the fire department I’m with. In my mind, these are all things you would do with someone you’re in a relationship with, or want to be in a relationship with.
I guess what I’m trying to ask, how should I proceed? Because I would like a relationship with this woman, I’m head over heels for her, and we like doing so much of the same things. I really don’t feel like being just a rebound, so I’m not sure if I should cut it off or see if it develops into something more.
TL;DR, I’ve been talking to a girl, she says we’re just FWB but she exhibits some desires of actually wanting a relationship, and I’m not sure how to actually proceed as I would like a relationship with her.",06Aug2020,1
939,"I (23F) currently make about 2k per month after taxes. I’m in a really tough situation right now. I was living with my boyfriend, but we broke up. I feel like I don’t have many options financially on where to live. I’m just trying to handle everything as best I can without biting off more than I can chew. I’m looking at room rentals or roommates, but everyone seems to be pretty flakey. Like, not getting responding or not sending the application after saying they would. It’s all really frustrating as I am trying to get out of my ex’s house as quickly as I can. I don’t have any friends or family to stay with. 

I want to spend about $500-650 maximum per month. When talking about this with friends and coworkers they are like “well you wont get anything for that” or “anything you find for that price will be the size of a closet”. My coworkers friend just bought a house and was wanting to rent out the basement. She kept nagging me about how much I was willing to pay and when I told her she laughed and said no. 

This is all stressful and now I’m just feeling completely ashamed about how much money I make. It’s not a great time to be switching jobs, though I have been applying.

We started talking like everyday and one day at our local pond I told her I liked her or more in fact I loved her and wanted something... She said she only saw me as a brother and nothing else which didnt bother me at all especially bc we have known each other since childhood but she brushed it off and we didnt make it awkward afterwards then she texts me later that week saying that she has been getting curious about me and when I try to talk about it she quickly changed the subject so I went with it. I go to her house a lot to watch movies and one day she had the movie Friends With Benefits and another fwb movie and got me thinking maybe this is what she wants then after she locked the door and asked if I wanted to play tennis (its a code word in the movie for sex) and I said yes like a little boy who was asked to go to Disney land so now im at the point where she talks about us being together in hypotheticals and idk if that means she is contemplating us or if I should just not push it and let her do her",06Aug2020,1

One of my big abortion concerns is my mental health and privacy. I don't want to hear it from my mom. I'm worried if I lie I'll make it worse... if I say I had a late miscarriage at 16 weeks I'm worried she'll call my bluff and I won't be able to keep up the lie and then she'll be upset not only because I got a second trimester abortion but then went and made up a story and lied to her about it. Is there a ""good"" lie? I considered like a chromosomal abnormality or something that my doctor told me will likely result in death before or shortly after birth but she knows all my scans so far have been great and I'm worried about that being a way bigger lie and digging a way bigger whole.

They’ve mentioned before that they’re required by law to tell the employees if a coworker has a confirmed case or was exposed to a confirmed case. Turns out, the second employee’s husband got a positive result on Tuesday, and they just told us today when she got her positive result.

950,"Hello.

Some months ago my father and my sister joined some religion, I think it is Brazilian and called umbanda or something like that. Everyone in my family is Christian (even my father was before joining this cult).  This is causing serious problems in our family and breaking us apart. First, my father and my sister stopped talking to my  aunt (my father's sister) because someone on the religion ""sensed"" that she was making macumba to give him bad luck or something like that. My aunt is Christian but she doesn't even care about religion. She lives in the door next to us and is one of the most hard working and humble persons in my family. My aunt tried multiple times to make things right and understand why my father and my sister don't talk to her. She called me multiple times crying begging me to help her make things right with her brother.

Recently my grandfather became sick and my father started burning incense in the house because he believes it makes the bad energies go away. This stuff he burns give me a hard headache. The first time he did that I asked him to stop. Today he burned this stuff again, not only that but I was on the Zoom meeting and he went right behind me (through the camera) burning that stuff and singing weird songs that I don't understand.

I told him before that I was going to be in a meeting. After the ZOOM call ended I went to ask for an explanation for what he did, he was in a verbal fight with my mom who is against him burning this stuff too. He told me it was my fault because I did not told him it was a video meeting and so he assumed I did not have my camera on. Recently everything my father does wrong is always everyone elses fault.

I don't know what to do anymore. Currently I am living with my parents because of the virus but I have an apartment of my own in another city, close to the university where I am taking a PhD and teach other students.

I don't know if it is relevant but my sister does not live with my parents.

Right know, after posting this I am going to pack my stuff and drive back to my apartment. I am thinking about not returning to my parents house and forbid my father from visiting me in my apartment as long as he doesn't leave religion. What do you guys recommend? Am I making a very aggressive decision?

Thank you.",06Aug2020,1
951,"throwaway account because I am an active redditor irl. 

Hi everyone, I love reddit and have seen redditors deliver in some really sticky situations so need your advice. My sister's kid has recently revealed to me that she is trans (and yes those are the pronouns she is using). She has come out to some of the family but not to her grandparents. Now I know that her grandparents will be super supportive. But she came out to me indirectly (her mom told me), and came out indirectly to her cousins (I told them), and came out indirectly to her brother (her friends told him). Everyone has been supportive and unconditionally loving (although of course there is that ""ok, well, wow"" moment.) 

I would like to encourage her to come out directly to my parents (her grandparents) but I can see myself wanting to protect her and telling my parents myself. Am I being a bad aunt? Am I enabling her or protecting her too much? I feel like this is her story and she should tell it, but she is very shy (always has been) and is having intense anxiety around coming out, even though her family is super supportive. How can I encourage her without pushing her? How can I respect her shyness and natural reserve (which is extreme) but still help her find her voice? What should I do???

Thanks in advance, awesome redditors.

Ok so last year I started highschool it went pretty good I put my self out of my comfort zone and talked to anyone and pretty much anyone which was big for me since I’m normally rly shy and anxious.

I now have 5 close freinds, and talk to quite a lot more but ofc not as much or only at school.

Since I’m going back to school soon I need to sort a problem I was having on the first year if highschool 

Ok so at first I did talk to ppl but didn’t have much friends just the two and weren’t that close. 

Fast forward until the “friend group” is all well freinds we all got along and we all went to the same classes mostly. 

But there is this one girl let’s call her Carla, 
I don’t like her and either does anyone of my friends, I know it’s mean but we can’t be forced to like her.
I (and my friends) just find her annoying and I’ll explain 

She always follows let’s say Lucy, 
Like idk why I feel bad for Lucy, she’s qui the and nice so never rly says anything and just jokes about it but I can tell Lucy doesn’t like her, we eventually realised that she probs likes her which ngl I found funny just because well Lucy is awkward and doesn’t know her sexuality yet so she ofc said no , and cause she doesn’t like her that way 
And say when we are going to class or lunch or whatever she just follows us everywhere and it’s so annoying, and when u try to talk to someone else she walks between u and go’s “WhAT?!” and it’s so annoying lol

I don’t want to hurt carlas feeling though, yes she doe annoy me and I mean a lot but I don’t wanna make her upset.

She doesn’t have any other friends than “us”
But recently well before lockdown with this other girl (she also doesn’t have that much friends I don’t like her either but ofc not rude or anything)

I just need a way of saying like leave us alone we aren’t your freinds, but how am I supposed to say it politely?

I try to be nice but sometimes she annoys me that much I say thing I shouldn’t have (not anything extreme, just say when she buys into Our convo I jokingly say “we aren’t talking to you” which tbh we are in highschool ik Scotland so you would hear way worse

But yeah idk what to do, don’t wanna gurt her feelings but do not want to be freinds at all and no one in our friend group does

However, since it is a rural area with not much going on, the friends with whom I normally plan this and I thought it would be nice to at least do something.

An outside event, enough ventilation, while preventing acces to the bar so people can only stay outside. Placing standing tables &gt; 1.5m apart from eachother. (Not open to the tourists)

But today I heard that some people where really angry with me without letting me know or telling me that this was not acceptable in their eyes.

959,"So to summarize the background I am a 25 year old female and my girlfriend is 21. We have been together for a little over 3 years. A year of that time was 3,000 miles and 3 hour time difference long distance. We had a lot of outside obstacles thrown at us and personal struggles to overcome and have managed to grow stronger as a couple as a result. I am an officer in the military with a bachelors degree and she is one year away from obtaining her bachelors degree and commission as an officer. She is very mature and intelligent and ranks high in her class. We want to get engaged and have at least a two year engagement (so by the time we married we would be 23 and 27). To us an engagement serves to signify an increased commitment to each other and intention to marry. We plan to use the engagement period to plan a wedding and to ensure we are both ready for marriage and set ourselves up for success(premarital counseling). Neither of us feel rushed and we both have goals for what we want our professional and personal lives to look like in the future. 

That being said, my girlfriend recently told her parents about wanting to get engaged and they had a negative reaction. My girlfriend and her parents don’t have a bad relationship but it is clear that they aren’t very supportive of who my girlfriend is as a person so we weren’t too surprised by their reaction. They also believe she is too young and that she should spend her youth being single and “doing her own thing.” They said they are still uncomfortable with the idea of her being gay and by the way they treat us it is evident they don’t see our relationship as completely legitimate. They also said they don’t see the point of getting engaged if we weren’t going to get married right away.  

After a lot of discussion and support from my side of the family, we have agreed that getting engaged is the right thing for us right now and what we both want. I understand that we are both still young and that she is younger than me and therefore we both need space to continue growing as people. Nonetheless, we feel we have a very stable relationship with clear boundaries, communicate well with each other, and are ready to take this step together. 

My question is, how do we respond to her parents as we know they will be upset with the engagement and hurt that my gf didn’t take their advice? Should I try to talk things through with them after we get engaged or just give them time to process? I also have been struggling with how to handle this because I want our families to support each other and I want her parents to be a part of our lives but it also frustrates me to see the lack of support they give their daughter despite having a good head on her shoulders and high aspirations for herself. We also want to include them in everything but it can be very draining and can put a damper on what should be a very exciting and hopeful time.

I’m honestly just so confused as to why they are doing this; we’ve only lived here for 3 months and we’ve never done anything to piss anyone off (to our knowledge). We hated our annoying neighbors at our last place (loud music, loud arguments, loud sex, etc) so we try to be courteous. The only thing I can think of that would make someone angry is that we had a BLM sign in the window. However, I’ve seen the kids and they are actually black, so I don’t really understand why they would be offended by a BLM sign. I didn’t want to but I took it down just in case.

So here is where I ask for advice: What do I do to get them to stop??? Our leasing company is a joke and won’t do anything. I really don’t want to invoke the police, but my mom said this is technically vandalism.... Any and all advice is appreciated.",06Aug2020,1

Ok so this might be a bit long and sry if it’s hard to read I suck a t writing, but I’ll try my best. 

Ok so last year I started highschool it went pretty good I put my self out of my comfort zone and talked to anyone and pretty much anyone which was big for me since I’m normally rly shy and anxious.

I now have 5 close freinds, and talk to quite a lot more but ofc not as much or only at school.

Since I’m going back to school soon I need to sort a problem I was having on the first year if highschool 

Ok so at first I did talk to ppl but didn’t have much friends just the two and weren’t that close. 

Fast forward until the “friend group” is all well freinds we all got along and we all went to the same classes mostly. 

But there is this one girl let’s call her Carla, 
I don’t like her and either does anyone of my friends, I know it’s mean but we can’t be forced to like her.
I (and my friends) just find her annoying and I’ll explain 

She always follows let’s say Lucy, 
Like idk why I feel bad for Lucy, she’s qui the and nice so never rly says anything and just jokes about it but I can tell Lucy doesn’t like her, we eventually realised that she probs likes her which ngl I found funny just because well Lucy is awkward and doesn’t know her sexuality yet so she ofc said no , and cause she doesn’t like her that way 
And say when we are going to class or lunch or whatever she just follows us everywhere and it’s so annoying, and when u try to talk to someone else she walks between u and go’s “WhAT?!” and it’s so annoying lol

I don’t want to hurt carlas feeling though, yes she doe annoy me and I mean a lot but I don’t wanna make her upset.

She doesn’t have any other friends than “us”
But recently well before lockdown with this other girl (she also doesn’t have that much friends I don’t like her either but ofc not rude or anything)

I just need a way of saying like leave us alone we aren’t your freinds, but how am I supposed to say it politely?

I try to be nice but sometimes she annoys me that much I say thing I shouldn’t have (not anything extreme, just say when she buys into Our convo I jokingly say “we aren’t talking to you” which tbh we are in highschool ik Scotland so you would hear way worse

But yeah idk what to do, don’t wanna gurt her feelings but do not want to be freinds at all and no one in our friend group does 

So yeah reddit can u help?",06Aug2020,1

970,"So here it goes. 

My mom died when I was around 4 and I was raised by my dad, trust me when I say we have a horrible relationship. Throughout my whole life I was always treated like I’m an object, locked in my own house and never let out. I had everything in life, money, clothes and stuff, but I always felt like I’m a bird in a cage as cliche as that sounded. I was deprived of so much as a young child and now that I’m 18 he wants me to marry this guy that he likes. Words cannot explain how much I hate the guy he wants me to marry. It isn’t the first time he tried to marry me off, he’s constantly trying to get rid of me and tries to play it off as caring for me and wanting me to have a good life. 

I’ve had enough of it. I don’t even feel human anymore. I have no say in anything I do, or in any decision in my life. 
I was controlled my whole life and honestly I’m at my breaking point. Everything screwed me up mentally so much that I’m even scared of myself. I used to go to therapy and stopped like two years ago, and I’ve never had it as bad as I do now. I have scary thoughts filling my head every second and it just doesn’t stop. 

I’m constantly in the verge of crying and hurting myself or smashing something around me. I don’t recognize myself anymore and I’m scared. I want out. I don’t want to get married, I want to fall in love and plan my life as I WANT IT. Sometimes I realize that I’m selfish, but I’m physically exhausted of this. I don’t have the strength to do this anymore.

973,"My boyfriend and I both live in abusive, unstable homes and we want nothing more than to live on our own. We are both employed (+ some savings) and are students who will be re-enrolling in classes this fall semester. We both wanted to get better paying jobs this year but the pandemic has been a huge problem as far as employment goes. 

We live in SoCal, so living isn't cheap here. Moving out of state is out of the equation, as we are both in school and neither of us *want* to move elsewhere. 

We always tell each other that we can suck it up for just a couple more years until we can properly afford to live on our own, but I don't know how much more abuse we can take. It's easy to act tough and to pretend that everything is okay. We have both had to our whole lives thus far. We deserve to have our own space; somewhere that is safe. Somewhere we can cook in peace, shower in peace, and sleep in peace. The fighting never stops in either of our homes and I know that it takes a toll on our mental health. 

I don't have any adults in my life who can teach me about renting an apartment, financing, budgeting, how to know if I'm being charged an appropriate amount; basically I have absolutely no one in my life who can teach me how to be an adult. I'm entirely independent, except for the fact that I don't have my license (though I never need it because I walk to work) and I still live at home with family. 

Any advice is much appreciated! Please be kind in your responses. As I said, I do not have the support of a family who can teach me about adulthood. It's horrifying to figure this stuff out on your own. I feel utterly alone, and I feel stupid more than anything. Please help !!!",06Aug2020,1
974,"I'm in Ireland. I know things vary by place, but some general advice would mean so much to me

Basically the house is a dive. When I moved in, I was aware it wasn't the cleanest, but not of anything else. It's my first time renting, and I was in a situation where I would lose my job unless I found a place immediately, so I ended up here. I'm also autistic if that matters, it's harder for me to judge things like this.

The landlord and his adult son live with us. They're both morbidly obese and don't leave their room. As far as I know neither works (the son says he does, but he screams at video games all night until 7am). The job he claims to have is local (when covid isn't around) so it's not the games. I saw the owner downstairs once in a month. The son does most of the shopping etc, the landlord doesn't even leave the room, let alone house usually.

When I moved in, he said the son does NOT use the shared bathroom I share with two other tenants. It turns out in fact he does, and leaves it in a mess (peeing everywhere etc).

My lease was for a year (July until July). But I assume due to the depths of issues I didn't know about, and landlord's refusal to fix them that that can be gotten around.

To summarise the worst issues;

1) Shower/bath is about to come through the ceiling. When you stand in it, you can feel it sink down. The ceiling looks horrendous, and lumps fall off, and my dad who knows about at these kind of things is scared about the structural integrity. Whole bathroom is always wet, the other tenant uses shower hose as a bidet. Taps don't work properly, water comes out but they aren't properly fixed (move when you turn them). The landlord told me these were being fixed within a week (although I didn't know the shower was in such a state until I used it).

2) House has a severe damp/mould issue. Probably partially because of the shower, but there's also other leaks the landlord can't explain. According to the other tenant, water comes inside from the conservatory when it's raining. Landlord couldn't explain this when the tenant asked. There's visible mould in my room that wasn't there when I came (looks like wallpaper was painted over, and windows must have been open 24/7 before I came, as that's what he does in the other vacant room).

I can't use locker in room because of damp. Anything put in has a toxic mouldy smell. Everything in my room is damp unless I run a dehumidifier for hours (and I mean 6+ hours a day).

3) Kitchen has no hot water. Main freezer does not work and is filled with mouldy food (there is a second freezer that does work). Fridge is at a hotter temperature than should be, and is connected to the broken freezer so I assume it's not much better. Extractor fan is unusable on oven due to dirt. Oven is barely usable (1/3 are), and is covered in filth. They (landlord and son) leave take away food on counters for days. Leave butter out 24/7, and leave food waste everywhere. They do not cook, but use other things in kitchen. Bathroom is just as filthy too. The food shelves they gave me are not usable due to ingrained dirt.

Other things are broken like the kettle (the switch is snapped off, you need to use a knife to turn it on). Windows are tricky to close. Lights have no shades, switches are broken. In my room there are no plugs, only extension cords that come from the walls. I hadn't noticed most of these things before moving in. There are frayed electrics in my room (locker has fitted lights and wires are sliced). Under the sink in the bathroom is a multitude of wet rags, silicone bottles etc. Shower has inches of silicone to prevent leaking (which doesn't help). When I reported the shower to him, he said oh I must have left the curtain outside of the shower.

There is two mattresses on my bed. The bottom one is in bits, but instead of replacing it, he added another on top of that. The bed is uncomfortable, and my mattress keeps falling off. There's also mould on the bed frame that was covered by a sheet when I viewed the property.

There are no fire safety measures. No alarms in kitchen, halls or my bedroom. No carbon monoxide detector. From a simple google I found these are all required by law.

4) The owner and his son are up ALL night making noise. Extremely loud TV in the father's room, and son plays games all night and takes calls. Sometimes straight through until 7am.

5) Owner lied to me saying there was a 2nd tenant (female). She does not exist, and has not been there in the 3 months the other tenant has. On the housing advert he lied about being a doctor. He lied about more things such as willingness to fix things etc. He's lied about there being a cleaner (other housmate works from home and has done for 3 months and she never came), the bins etc are never done unless we do them (despite being shared with the owner).

My room was filthy when I viewed it, but he said a cleaner was coming the next day when covid regulations lifted. This was not true, and me and my mother had to scrub the whole thing. Unfortunately I wasn't smart enough to take pictures of this, but it's still obvious from pictures of the radiator, walls, ceiling etc.

6) They have dogs (two, one male one female) which are very neglected. Garden was overrun by weeds (about 3ft high grass) until a few days ago. Dogs have nowhere to go except an unfinished building site. Dogs get fed once a day, but no walks or cuddles etc. They howl for attention all the time. These dogs are bichon frisés too (usually require frequent grooming etc). They do not trim the dogs nails, the dogs appear to have dangerously long nails. The dogs had their fur trimmed just before I came, but they have some kind of discharge around the eyes, and just generally look neglected. The area the dogs have to play in is the path about the length of two rooms long, and the grass if it's cut. They are outside 24/7, and sleep outside, even in rain and cold. They have a rabbit hutch which they do not use. I find this really upsetting, because I'm sure the dogs would be lovely in a better circumstance.

7) There's always flies everywhere. There's also what I hope isn't a spider's nest above my bed. I've squashed 13 tiny spiders in three days, all of which came from the lightshade (I assume). I don't know if this counts as pests, but if so there's rules about a landlord preventing those.

8) I reported issues to the landlord and son a few times. When I sent a written email after paying my 2nd month's rent, he sent me a very nasty reply, accusing me of lying, having an agenda, and he said he is taking my issues as notice.

9) I think the owner may not have planning permission for some of the works. A second staircase built to the attic looks fishy, and there's an unfinished ""apartment"" in the back of the garden which looks dangerous and not fitting building regulations.

What I'm hoping to get out of this is my deposit back if possible. I was definitely overcharged rent for the conditions, but there's not much I can do about that. I'm hoping to make it so he can't rent to anyone else ever again, and hopefully report him to agencies like fire safety, planning board, and animal protective services. Some of my co-workers live local, so after I'm gone I can show the conditions to their local resident's association or something. I have pictures of most things, and they're like something off one of those TV shows about evil landlords. I want to make him pay too. To make sure that he either fixes every little thing or never rents again.",06Aug2020,1

977,"Hello everyone, M22 here and I would like to ask for an advice what to do with my life because I don't know anymore, I'm so lost and depressed. 
So since I was a kid I always used to be extremely shy to everyone that I don't know although my childhood was pretty okay.
Everything has changed few months after I turned 16, my mom has cheated on my father and she has been doing it for months, when she got exposed
we agreed to not say a thing to father and she has promised that she won't ever do it again. (my father used to work abroad back then so he was barely home) 
2 months later she did it again and this time she decided to tell my father that she doesn't love him anymore. And that was when the hell started, my dad was heartbroken and 
since that day he started drinking, doing dramas and he became aggressive. Well... now I don't really know how to describe it anymore. I stopped caring about anything, my grades went down and I became depressed because of my family situation. 
I started avoiding school, barely talked to friends and that's it. Sometimes I got even beaten by my father when he was drunk which was awful experience and I remember it til now.
That wasn't the only one problem in my life though, on the next year I graduated and had to find a new school for myself. And since I wasn't in really good mental condition, had a problems with socializing and making new friends
I decided to go to the class (mechatronic) with 2 friends of mine from old school. I knew them since I was 6 and they were pretty nice to me in the past, anyway everything has changed since first day of the new school.
I don't know what happened with them, but I started getting bullied by them for no reason and they quickly convinced whole class (which was huge, like 35 people) to bully me as well. 
And this was like a nail in the coffin for me and my mental health, I couldn't stand this and I tried to talk to teachers to seek for help or move me to different class, but they really didn't see a problem. 
I remember a lesson where I got called out by my class and the teacher has mocked me in front of them while whole class was just laughing. That was just so disgusting and I'll never forget this shit.
After 2 or 3 weeks I stopped going to school because I couldn't handle it anymore and my family problems were still going on, so my life was a total hell back then. 
I dropped out of school after 1 month and I had a court case because it's illegal in my country to drop out of a school if you are below 18. 
I was threatened to go to child care home and tbh I was so scared back then because I didn't hear good things about these homes and somehow I wanted to stay with mother.
This case has lasted maybe 1 month and somehow we won it, I just had to find some volunteer work or go back to school since new semester. 
Well, I didn't go anywhere, I just decided to sit home and my family never cared anymore about me much. About my parents - they divorced 1 year later and my father has finally moved out.
I felt safe in my room because I didn't have to meet anyone or talk to them. But with the time passing my depression was getting worse...
In 2018 I've met some girl online and she was like a charm for me. She's the sweetest and nicest person I've ever seen in my life, but also very helpful and caring. 
I have developed a crush on her. Well, it's not even a crush, I just love her and that's the first person I've ever loved this way.
She's from different country (UK), 4 years older than me, we're good friends and we talk to each other a lot. This feeling was like a trigger for me back in 2018, I loved her, but i knew I can't be with her because I'm just... nobody. 
She has finished university, while I didn't even finish high school and it made me even more depressed, I remember I stopped eating once for like 2 weeks because I was just feeling dead. I never confessed to her because it was just pointless. 
With the time passing I don't know, I might be wrong, but I realized that she's into me. We've been calling each other sweethearts and talking really sweet.
And tbh she made me realize how nice is to have someone and how good is just to ""live normal life"". But I have huge social anxiety and depression and it most likely holds me back from everything. 
I can't even think of going out and I don't know how to start fixing my life, I have no money on therapist also. I just don't know. I'm stuck, my parents don't care. 
I have asked my father if I can move out somewhere, but he just dodges this question. I don't have any friends IRL, I have problems with talking to people. I dunno, I'm just so lost and depressed.
I had thoughts of killing myself because i can't achieve anything anymore, but the thing that holds me back is a future. More clearly - somehow I still have hopes that I'll be happy in future, find a work, a second half, who knows, maybe even that girl? But I doubt it...
I wanted to work, but I can't really from this place. And even if I do where could I work? I can't do anything, I have no experience in working. 
I live in the worst shithole and there are really no job offers. Closest city is 20 km from my village and as I said before I have developed huge social anxiety. 
I really don't want to meet anyone from childhood or my school on my eyes ever again and this is why I wanted to move out and asked my dad for help, but seems it isn't happening.
Another idea was to move abroad and find a work there. Well, this is very risky if something went wrong while me being there I could even end myself most likely.
I really don't know what to do with my life, I don't want to be stuck on this episode forever. I just feel so tired of living and depressed, but I still have to figure out something.
That's why I ask you guys for a help, what would you do if you were on my place? Please help :(",06Aug2020,1

A while ago, she decided to talk to me for the first time in 5 years. We have each other on social media and all that. After a while, she finally admits that she has a crush on me, which I kind of suspected that she did. I said to her that I don't know her well enough to date her, which made me feel like absolute shit, but not for long. After admitting that, she seemed to want to always talk to me. On Instagram, whenever I was active, she messaged me. Every morning at her school (I wait there to get the bus to my school), she waits there to talk to me.

980,"I'm in my 4th semester of university (in Europe, non English speaking, just to keep it vague) studying computer science and I don't know what to do anymore. 

Every semester my performance got worse. I skipped the last two exams because I was too scared to study and just cried scared the night before. 

Last year in December I got a cold and stopped going to the gym for a while, after that I couldn't motivate myself and then the whole pandemic happened. I feel like not getting any physical activity made my mental health so much worse but I just can't motivate myself. 

I'm interested in computer science and tech stuff, I WANT to study this but if I keep going like this I will fail. And I know that because of that nothing is worse than not trying but something is blocking me. I feel completely lazy, I already had a month to study for the exams coming up (I skipped the first one already) but I just don't. Every time I think about studying I put it off because I'm scared. Scared of  not being smart enough for the subject, scared of failing the exam, scared of failing the semester, scared of flunking out, scared of disappointing my family. 

Because of this I can't seem to bring myself to even start studying. In my mind it's like 'hey if you didn't try you didn't fail because your were too dumb. If you had more time you probably could have done it.' which is obviously a stupid excuse for being lazy but I can't seem to get over it.

985,"So I'm (F21) dealing with depression, anxiety, and just overall feeling pretty hopeless about life. I recently quit my job to figure things out and my family reacted badly about it. I don't have many close friends, just a few surface-level friends.

My only support system is my bestfriend (M23) and as much as I appreciate his efforts, I feel like he's not doing enough to help me and sometimes I feel like he makes me feel worse sometimes.

It's hard for me to ask for help sometimes, due to so many things. I feel like I'm annoying, or that asking for help is useless. I feel like I'm not worthy of help, or I start to think that he's just does the bare minimum to help me so he can say that he tried. He then blames me for not reaching out to him, or blames me for continuing to feel this way. He blames me for reading between the lines, and tells me it's my fault that I overthink too much. I feel like he continues to blame me on things I feel like I'm trying so hard to control and fix, even though overthinking and feeling sad isn't just a switch I can turn off.

He keeps giving me what he calls ""tough love"" and continues to speak to me in a demeaning way. He points out all my flaws (that I'm very aware of on a daily basis), all the trauma from my childhood that he knows and I know, the mistakes that he knows I dwell on, and says that if he is softer on me, that it enables me to continue to be depressed and insecure. When he talks to me like this, I feel less than human. I feel worse about myself and confirms me that I'm not worth living, not worth care and love and confirms that I'm a weak individual who doesn't deserved to be treated humanely.

I recently found an instagram page through an acquaintance that I found helpful. It explains the effects of various mental illnesses and how you/a loved on can help. It made me feel, ""Wow, I'm not the only one feeling this way"". It made me not feel guilty on days where it's hard to get out of bed, or days when I don't feel like talking to anybody. It made me feel like explained.

I told my bestfriend to go through the Instagram page because I think it would help and teach him how to treat me better. I also told him to read Brené Brown's ""Braving the Wilderness"" to better understand what I'm feeling, because it's sometimes hard for me to properly explain what I'm feeling and thinking (I'm working on this, though it is extremely difficult). I felt like these two resources that I resonate with will help him help me.

He proceeded to shit on these two resources, especially the page. He said ""the advice this page gives people just enables them to just keep acting depressed for the rest of their lives and doesn't actually help them"". At least they'll be alive and be cared for, is what I thought. He then proceeded to shit on my counselling, which I have had a handful of sessions in 2 months. My counselling has helped me with one aspect of my life (my career), but I felt so crappy that he insulted the slow but steady progress I've had from counselling. He says that my self-improvement is baby-steps, but then tells me that I'm not helping myself enough and not improving enough. He tells me the bettering myself isn't linear, then proceeds to shit on me when I fall back from my progress of bettering myself.

There were two instance where I had a suicidal episode and as I was harming myself, he kept shitting on me. He kept ordering me to put the knife down or throw the pills away, as if he was a military commander or some kind of powerful figure. I remember crying to him, ""Can you just please treat me with kindness and compassion? Can you please just treat me like I'm human? Can't you just tell me why I should live? Can't you just tell me why you want me alive? Can't you just tell me why you carr about me?"". He did nothing of the sort.

I couldn't bring myself to kill myself. After one of these episodes, he came to see me to distract me from my suicidal thoughts. We usually grab a meal and he breaks away from his ""tough love"" for a moment. He promises to bring me to my counselling sessions. He promises to check up on me. He promises to note when I'm not being my usual self and note my symptoms better. He said he'll learn to be kinder and more understanding of my feelings and thoughts. So long as I do my part too; so long as I pull myself up too. I feel hopeful and agree and feel better for a moment, but then the cycle continues.

I feel like I'm in a cave; but not one where you can see the exit. It's a cave like the one those Thai boys were in. There's underwater areas and I can't get out myself. I need help from outside. I feel like my bestfriend threw the rope, but isn't bothering to pull it. He isn't bothering to come in the cave to come get me. He wants me to climb the rope and hold my breath in those underwater areas, but if I climb too slowly, he'll cut it and blame me for climbing too slow. Maybe I should just stay in the cave to drown. 

I have nobody else to lean on. He does a decent job of distracting me, with meals or talking about surface level things. But it's hard for me to now trust him. He wants me to continue to open up to him, but I'm scared he'll continue the way he treats me, which just makes me feel worse. I don't expect him to fix me, I just wanna know that I'm cared for and loved and that I'm heard. He doesn't want to listen or hear what I'm saying to him. But at the same time, I have nobody else. I'm scared. Before, I thought, ""I have one person that really cares about me. This person makes me feel like I can keep living"". At this point, I feel like I will kill myself regardless of whether he's in my life or not. I don't wanna be here anymore. Please help me.",06Aug2020,1

988,"work in law support. The person superior to me, who is a lawyer, was fired and never replaced. Their work is now assigned to me, not a lawyer.

My task was to register my company directors at a French authority. I do speak French but have no idea about French company law or requirements. I reached out to my manager over and over again asking if we could get an external lawyer for this task. He told me to just keep trying so I asked the authority and they requested details of a particular director.  I provided them (these documents and checks actually took months and a *lot* of headache to complete). 

Now it surfaced that the authority and I were speaking at cross purposes, and the director whose documents I provided is not fit for purpose. It should be another director. It's just months of work and stress down the drain and I likely have to do it all over again. 

I think my managers will completely blame me. Particularly as the director had to attend a bunch of appointments to get the docs done. I'm just so fed up. I *told* them I didn't know what I'm doing and I still had to do it. I'm not a lawyer. I feel like I was set up to fail. A similar thing happened at my last company. Is it just me?

997,"TLDR: a kid fucked me up, and I don't know what to do.

I'm a 13M I was a 7-9 y/o when this happened.

This kid, who was the same age as me started to become friends with me, and at the time I didn't realize anything, then latter after about I got to know this kid for about a few months she started to get pretty mean, at first it wasn't much like, she moved my bike to the other side of my house so i had to walk all the way around which I mean sounds pretty annoying if they do that a few times(i mean like \~30 times)

then then it started to get a little worse, when I had to leave and go home they would put there foot in the door so I couldn't close it, or put there feet in the line of sight in my garage door sensor so I couldn't close it. which wasted a lot of time, (it would take up to 20 minutes ignoring her to be able to close the garage door or the door (I still didn't realize much at this point, but i was getting very annoyed at her)

Then i got kinda weird, she would put my bike at the other side of the neighborhood, she would act like it was stolen (at this point I was pretty skeptical and saw right threw her lies, but I still hung out with her for some reason.) or claim I did something I never did that was pretty drastic (like I punched her, or kicked her or tripped her) she didn't have much proof of this but still my parent and hers agreed with her.

And after all that, I decided to move schools and just ignore her, (and at this point my dad thought she was all fine and dandy and my mom was started to doubt that she was a good person so I had to figure up something to get her out of my face, \[what is in these parentheses doesn't really matter much, but that caused me some stress and i thought you might want to know that\])

Now, you may be wondering why I'm asking for advice (well you probably do) and this is it: So this kid, who may still be called her and she and kid caused me a lot of problems, she caused me a whole lot of trust issues to the point where I don't believe anyone, and if i think that someone is a decent person I will consider them acquaintances and then get mad at them for some weird reason and stop talking to them forever. which probably helped my already developing depression and suicidal thoughts.

Now, after i got out of the way why i'm asking for advice, here is what i'm asking... What should I do? should I ignore her like I have been doing should I get revenge in some way? should I talk to her and her parents and how they could help? (her parents probably wouldn't help me though, there only a little less mean)?

I apologise for my excessive parentheses (and any grammer I didn't do right)

998,"A while ago, I put my CV on Indeed as I'm looking for a part time job. This marketing company reached out to me and, long story short, I've got a job offer from them. At first, I was elated... but now? I'm not so sure if I wanna take on the role. I've been feeling a little uneasy about some things I literally just noticed.

First of all, this marketing company claims to work with big clients such as energy and broadband providers. However, I've only seen evidence of them working with just one. A little more research into the company (bear in mind, AFTER I got the job offer cos I'm an idiot) and it turns out they were only founded last year or so. Now that in itself isn't so worrying to me but I do have a few other concerns:

1. Why ME of all people? I was happy to receive a job offer but I don't really come from a marketing background. Sure I've got transferable skills but I'm just a student at the end of the day
2. Their job posting on Indeed and other websites was kinda vague. They're looking for sales advisors but I didn't realise this was to do with professional marketing until the actual interview
3. They make a lot of claims about pay and also about commissions. But no-one has actually told me what salary I'd be earning and I never asked cos I assumed they would eventually tell me. I do not want to join if my wage will solely be based off commissions
4. A couple reviews from previous staff stuck out to me. Mind you, there were only like 2 or 3 but this was out of about 17 reviews anyway. They mentioned how the whole company is a sort of scam and were being intentionally vague to prospective employees. Some even said that management was shit and taking a cut out of people's commissions .\_.
5. In a final interview with the manager of the company, I asked some more questions about pay, hours etc. hoping to get some more info. However, he just said that I should have already been told that by the lady I had my first interview with; she did go into some detail about this but assured me that the manager would tie up the loose ends and talk more about my contract

I now have 5 close freinds, and talk to quite a lot more but ofc not as much or only at school.

Since I’m going back to school soon I need to sort a problem I was having on the first year if highschool 

Ok so at first I did talk to ppl but didn’t have much friends just the two and weren’t that close. 

Fast forward until the “friend group” is all well freinds we all got along and we all went to the same classes mostly. 

But there is this one girl let’s call her Carla, 
I don’t like her and either does anyone of my friends, I know it’s mean but we can’t be forced to like her.
I (and my friends) just find her annoying and I’ll explain 

She always follows let’s say Lucy, 
Like idk why I feel bad for Lucy, she’s qui the and nice so never rly says anything and just jokes about it but I can tell Lucy doesn’t like her, we eventually realised that she probs likes her which ngl I found funny just because well Lucy is awkward and doesn’t know her sexuality yet so she ofc said no , and cause she doesn’t like her that way 
And say when we are going to class or lunch or whatever she just follows us everywhere and it’s so annoying, and when u try to talk to someone else she walks between u and go’s “WhAT?!” and it’s so annoying lol

I don’t want to hurt carlas feeling though, yes she doe annoy me and I mean a lot but I don’t wanna make her upset.

She doesn’t have any other friends than “us”
But recently well before lockdown with this other girl (she also doesn’t have that much friends I don’t like her either but ofc not rude or anything)

I just need a way of saying like leave us alone we aren’t your freinds, but how am I supposed to say it politely?

I try to be nice but sometimes she annoys me that much I say thing I shouldn’t have (not anything extreme, just say when she buys into Our convo I jokingly say “we aren’t talking to you” which tbh we are in highschool ik Scotland so you would hear way worse

my mother works a well paying job and has a company so she can work as an independent contractor rather than a employer at her workplace. this allows for her to work kind of for ‘herself’ as she pays herself as an employer for her own company. it’s complicated but also doesn’t play that much of a role in this. 

anyways, with the company she can distribute money among my family, rather than have it taxed. (this is legal don’t worry, it’s just a loophole her financial advisor found) 
so my sister and i are ‘employees’ at her company and get paid a small sum of $1200 
every so often. 

now we don’t do much work so i know there is no way that money is mine but she just told my sister she’s transferring that money into her account. when i asked if she’s doing the same for mine she said she’s keeping it for herself. as in writing it off as if it’s going to me but then keeping it. i was hurt. i know i’m not an adult yet like my sister but i would like to save that money so i could at least have some spending money in university. when i explained this to her she just scoffed and said ‘we’re already paying for your tuition and everything else’ 

how do i ask her to do the same for me as she did with my sister? transfer the money into my account so i have it?

She is a minor that lives with her two brothers, sister, and father. 

F - my friend
S - her sister
B1 - brother 1
B2 - brother 2
D - her dad

S has a tendency to bother her until F gets to a point where she retaliates. Things like poking F while she sleeps, hypocrisy in her daily actions, etc. Then when F retaliates, S acts like nothing in the past has happens.

This goes to the extreme where S rips out a chunk of F's hair, and S acts like nothing has happen-- leaving F with trauma physically and mentally.

B1 has threw F into a ironing table, in a fit of rage when F was younger. And on another occasion, B1 threw a book at her. However, now he looks at her in shame(F's words) because she won't take his BS anymore

D has anger problems where he would act irrationally and extremely due to how he is feeling. For example, he broke the TV because he was angry. Now, he threatens to break the newer tv they obtained by chance. 

D also doesn't allow F to talk to her normally without giving orders, or giving punishments that isn't deserved.

D also enables the others behaviours by not acknowledging what happens in the past to F, but holds on to whatever F did wrong (whether it be big or small).

While F tries her best to make have a nice relationship with them, these things continue to happen-- which contribute to her depression.

1013,"So when i was a kid i used to love video games. Halo, skyrim, call of duty, all that good stuff.played games most of my life. I never thought it was worth saying i was good at anything in particular but i still enjoyed my self y'kno.

 So, fast forward to today. Work a lot. Only a couple days a week where i spend free time mostly doing laundry,cleaning, groceries etc.The remaining time i do have is me sitting there like a vegetable binge watching star trek or doing some shitty sewing project (which requires minimal effort and is surprisingly a hobby I've managed to keep after losing interest in all other stuff)
 So anyway boyfriend is a very avid gamer and is one of the things that we had in common. But since that point to now we've had double the responsibility put onto our plate with being an adult y'kno. So when i come home im almost always mentally exhausted. So i haven't picked up a controller in a hot minute.

I've been having a rough period recently and I've wanted to try to get back into bc i thought it would give me an opportunity to try to relax and spend time together with my boi ..But the thing is that its not fun anymore since i lost all gaming capabilities?

I understand im rusty,  but its something I've never forgotten.even base instincts. I feel like its a waste of time to go through so much mental energy to just be DECENT at games. Especially multiplayer. Oh man. I can barely survive single player games. I get decimated in a moment's notice without fail in a game like warzone.

Idk if its also because im a bit self conscious around ppl i care about, but i don't want to drag my bf through long tedious frustrating games because of me who has the reflexes of an old cabbage. Its just humiliating to me. He says he just enjoys playing with me but i mean he will literally never be able to play without having to worry about me not dying etc. And bless his heart but he never has had to feel that way around me so i don't think he really gets it. Its also just being reluctant to try ANY game. Any genre.

1017,"Was I abused as a child?

I am a 21 female and I grew up with both my parents and a younger sister (17years old). My mom used to physically and mentally hurt me when I was growing up. And by physically hurt me I mean she used to drag me across the floor by my hair and throw me into the wall, slap and hit me repeatedly, hit me with things like chairs and anything she could get her hands on, etc. By mentally hurting me I mean she used to say she wished I was never born, constantly remind me of my weight and how I need to lose weight (I have been under weight - average my entire life), say things like “you’re the devil’s child” or “you’re the reason I want to k*** myself”. She would threaten to k*** herself and lock herself in her bedroom or leave the house for days, then return like nothing happened. This continued until I was 17 years old and something happened where it pushed me over the edge and I asked someone for help. Social services got involved and wanted to take me from my parents. I don’t know why but somehow I let my parents convince me to stay and get family therapy. Now that I’m 21, my parents are now divorced and my mom is remarried and REFUSES to acknowledge anything she did during my childhood. Because she has remarried, she acts COMPLETELY different in front of her new husband and his children and it’s been extremely confusing to me. Every time I want to talk to her about her extreme switch in personality, she says that she’s moved on and doesn’t want to bring negativity into her life. She denies a lot of what has happened and doesn’t want to address any of it.
I have been diagnosed with PTSD, general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, eating disorders, and depression. I feel as though closure is something I never got and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this besides my sister, but even talking to her is hard. Because my mom has completely changed, it’s hard to accept her new personality 100%, and her not acknowledging the past or wanting to talk about it and denying it makes me feel like it didn’t happen.
Was what she did abuse, or am I overreacting?
If it was, what should I do regarding closure?",06Aug2020,1

1020,"Hi! This might be a bit long so thank you to anyone who reads the whole thing!

Long story short, my ex \[20F\] of 2+ years broke up with me \[20F\] last month in order to work on herself. Our relationship was slowly becoming unhealthy and even though I wanted to stay in the relationship and fix things together + simultaneously work on myself, she felt she needed to do it alone and that's totally okay.

We had stayed good friends ever since then and always kept in contact, but recently she messaged me and said she thought I was the right person for her. She wanted to have space to work on herself for a few months to a year, but one day she wanted to revisit our relationship and hopefully end up together because she loved me so much and could still see a future with us together. I told her that I still loved her too, and I also thought she was the one for me. I told her I would've waited for however long she needed to feel ready to revisit things, until she mentioned seeing other people in the meantime. She said that unless we’re officially dating again, she's still going to meet other people and date people casually, with no commitments. What made it worse for me is that she's actively making the effort to do so; She’s already on Tinder, HER, and other dating apps talking to other people.

I honestly felt so hurt, because it doesn’t make sense to tell me how much you love me and want to be with me, when at the same expressing a desire to casually date and hookup with other people. I told her that I felt like a second choice and a back-up plan, for when things didn't work out between her and someone else she met/if she just got bored of being single. She insisted that I wasn't a backup plan and actually did spend a lot of time reassuring me that wasn't the case. However, even if I wasn't just a backup plan, did I still have a right to be upset? I understand that it's her right and it's her business to meet and date whoever she wants since we're officially broken up, so I'm really trying to see things from her perspective. It's just that personally, if I broke off from a relationship to work on myself and still had my ex as the end goal, I wouldn't even entertain the idea of dating again or actively pursuing other people. Not just because I still had a close attachment to that person, but because of how that would have made the other person feel; I wouldn't have wanted to pursue random people on Tinder if it meant hurting someone I loved or jeopardizing any past/present/future relationship with them.

After I pointed out how contradictory she was being, she also got upset and we went back and forth for a bit before I got tired of it and told her to please give me space to think. Should I cut contact with her forever? Or would I just completely mess things up with someone I love?

**TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend expressed how much she loved me and wanted to be with me in the future, once she's done working on herself. But until then, she also wants to see/casually date other people in the meantime. Do I have a right to be upset/Should I cut her out of my life completely? Or would I mess things up with someone I love forever?**",06Aug2020,1

1024,"This past weekend we had to put down my dog. She was 12 years old and technically my boyfriend’s dog. She came to be his after dating someone for a few years and the woman in question (we’ll call her Sally) abandoned her and another dog in my boyfriend’s care.

At first, Sally was unable to take the dogs due to where she moved. Then, Sally took only the dog we had to put down for a week or so, but the dog didn’t do very well with her because she’s very closely bonded to another of our dogs, who was a gift to my boyfriend from this ex girlfriend.

I’m not sure how often Sally visited after they broke up and spent a week with the dog, but I do know she moved to Hawaii and hadn’t seen them at all since she moved away. I’m not sure how long she has been living back in our state.

In February she showed up to our house unexpectedly. She was blocked and for good reason. We unblock her, we’re nice, and all goes well as she plays with our dogs for a few hours, mainly the dog that has just passed. Our other dogs didn’t care for her much at all, 2 of whom even tried to sit behind my boyfriend on the couch to avoid her. When she left, the dog we put down stood in the blinds to watch Sally leave, and laid sadly on the couch for several hours and was basically abandoned all over again. It broke my heart.

Being the peacemaker that I am, I became friends with Sally on snapchat to send pictures and videos of the dogs and keep her in the loop on them. Sally very frequently changed the conversation, which was uncomfortable for me as I didn’t know her and didn’t want to be involved in her life other than to keep her updated on the dogs, but I made small talk. One day Sally decided to criticize my boyfriend for about 30 minutes, then pretty much told me that we would go to dinner with her and her baby daddy after she spent a day with our dog. I told my boyfriend about the conversation and how Sally tore apart his character, gave a lot of backhanded compliments towards our relationship, and said she missed him as a friend. (Key note: they have never been friends, nor friendly. They dated, they were both toxic in their relationship, and things didn’t end on good terms).

I blocked Sally after this conversation ended, as I didn’t feel I had to go out of my way to do nice things for someone who spoke to me that way. My boyfriend did the same.

Last week, my dog’s personality changed in a matter of hours, and we knew something was wrong. Knowing how my dog felt around her, I urged my boyfriend to unblock her number and call her. I knew it was going to be my dog’s last day, and I thought my dog deserved to be surrounded by people she loved, regardless of how my boyfriend and I felt about that person.

She drove 3 hours or so to see her. She pet her and sat with her for about 30 minutes, and then sat on the couch. She had conversations with me about her pregnancy while I was on the other couch with the dog, of whom was wheezing, visibly in pain, and not very aware of her surroundings at this point.

We drove to the vet a little out of the way from where we live because we trusted them, and I sat in the back seat with the dog. I held her up so she would have an easier time breathing. She had cancer, and a mass had spread to her chest and was making it difficult for her to breathe.

When they put her down, I sat on the ground and held her face while she passed. I even turned my boyfriend’s ex around so she wouldn’t have to see the vets lift her lifeless body into a plastic bag and then into a box.

Sally spent the night on our couch, as we put the dog down around 3am and she would have had a 3 hour car ride home in the middle of the night with no sleep. When we got home, Sally was complaining about being hungry nd how pregnancy has affected her. Sally demanded my boyfriend make her food, and dug through our pantry angry that she didn’t like anything we had, going so far as criticizing us for our food choices because was on a diet since before she got pregnant. I was annoyed with her holier then thou nonsense, but given the circumstances of the night I just let her comments and demands go.

We planned to spread the dog’s ashes together, but a few days later when we got them back, they were in a box that could only be opened by unscrewing the bottom of the box. This would likely cause a huge mess, and I couldn’t bear to see that. My boyfriend relayed the bad news. Since then, Sally has been demanding he decide between either giving her the dog’s ashes, or the clay paw print the vet made us.

I’m against both of these things. Personally, I feel like she should be grateful we even called her. I’m full of grief and emotion, and I know this makes me a total asshole. I’m torn. My boyfriend thinks there’s got to be some kind of compromise, but I don’t think we’ll do some joint custody of the dog’s ashes or anything like that.

Honestly, I’m worried that Sally will unscrew the box and spread her ashes, then later tell us this and demand the pawprint. I’d rather have spread her ashes, because otherwise she is just sitting on my mantle and that doesn’t feel very good of me to do for her. I know my dog was amazing and the nicest dog I’d ever met, but I’m not. My boyfriend wants me to act in the way my dog would have, but this is so much more than that. My dog is gone. I’m traumatized by the events we all went through. But I was the only one who could handle looking at her, let alone holding her and telling her everything was going to be alright and that we’d make her feel better.

Reddit, what should I do? Ultimately, I think the decision lies with my boyfriend, but I know he’s going to want my input and it will mean a lot to him.


Important: the vet also stamped her paw prints and nose. Since I was the only one capable of speaking to the vet after she passed, I asked the vet to make 3 copies of each. In the event I am ever not with my partner, I will still have a piece of her. We will be giving one copy to Sally as well. I’m not keeping everything from her.

TLDR: previous dog owner is demanding we give her the dog’s ashes or paw print made by the vet, but she abandoned the dog. Tried to be nice by allowing her the option to be with the dog in her final moments, and she will receive stamped pawprint &amp; nose, but she feels entitled to more",06Aug2020,1

When we go grocery shopping together, we split our groceries (we split rent) which I don’t mind but that means we buy double sometimes. There’s been several times where I’d buy chicken and I’d be busy all week to cook it and he’d just buy more chicken for himself and let mine go bad... not sure why he couldn’t just cook what was in the fridge. He’d get mad if I eat one of his apples. Or if he buys a 24 pack of energy drinks, he’d get mad if I drink one. He has protein bars from Costco and I grabbed one for a hike one time and he got mad when I did that. I buy stuff and don’t care if he eats it. He has literally asked me if he can use my huge jar of JAM for a sandwich once.

He just wrote on the energy drink container “really sara????” Then wrote on the protein box “don’t even think about it”

So I took a picture of the containers when I got home and sent it to him since he’s at work.

He said “I don’t want you eating my protein bars”

Then I said. “Fine I won’t eat them. Or anything. I’m just a “roommate””

Early this week, he said I need to be a “better roommate” because I need to “pick up after myself more” even though I do! He said “couples are roommates”

He said. “Seriously? Your really taking that roommate comment and letting your imagination run wild?”

I told him that my imagination isn’t running wild.

He said “ I’m sorry you took it the wrong way”

I replaced two of the energy drinks and left them on the counter and staying at a friends tonight since I’m mad at him. I’m mad he wrote that crap on the boxes, how he claims I’m “messy” and don’t clean up after myself even though I do... so when I left, I made sure everything was spotless. He’s been sleeping off and on on the couch for a month because he was “angry” that our bedroom was “messy.” There’s so many things I’m upset with him about and his excuse is that he’s “naive” when it comes to relationships.

I am not perfect and sure I leave a mess sometimes or leave a shirt or cup on the table... but I work at a psychiatric hospital on a violent ward and there’s just some days that I need to relax or sleep after work because of the stress.

I am not sure where to post this but I thought I'd try here . So I'm 28 yearold male and my ex was 27f . We broke up about 7 years ago and it was a nasty ending for our relationship. 

We were both in bad places at the time addicted to drugs and just depressed people . We ended our relationship.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago , a friend tells me she's killed herself , then another friend and another friend.  

I was ok the first 2-3 days then started feeling abit sad about it . Now it's progressively getting worse where I cant stop thinking About her , the pain she must have been in. And I also cant stop thinking about us as a couple and things that were said, memories we had together bad and good. 

I have thought about her from time to time since we went out separate ways and always wondered about her as I cut contact which now I feel guilty about. 

Is there anyone with advice on how I can deal with this . I don't know how she killed herself because I cut my self out of that circle of friends and moved country . It's making it hard to grieve .

1039,"So, I have had a crush on this girl for 10 months or so. We are all 17 in the story.

It was quite complicated as a situation, my friend was with her for a week, then another friend invited her to prom and I was just standing there doing nothing, not even trying anything. I was kinda sad when one of my friend was close to her and she didn't care about me. All through the year, she talked in DM with all the guys in the group except me and it was just killing me.

I recently learnt from a friend that quitted our group that she knew (her and my crush) that I had a crush on her. Why? Because my friend that invited her to prom decided to tell her I had a crush on her in January. I know, a true good friend (all of the guys in the group stopped talking to him after that, since it was a massive dick move). 

The part where she knew all about it might explain why she always seemed a little bit distant, she probably avoided giving me false hopes. So, at least, there's that. After learning that she knew, I decided to cut the bullshit and talk to her about it. Long story short: I revealed my feelings, told her I knew that she knew and I knew that she probably not interested. She told me that she wasn't interested and we are still good friends and all.

Tbh, I don't know if I still ""love her"". In my head, it's in the past and I won't try anything on the ""love"" side. She probably won't change and I know that.

And I feel like it's for the better I didn't get in a relationship. I knew that her relationships weren't toxic, but unusual. E.g: my friend that was in a relationship for a week with her before she told him she wasn't sure about this anymore. In this week, she got weirded out when he tried to hold her hand (and they were together at this moment). So, I knew it would be kinda weird to be with her with the way she acts.

However, even with all of that, I can't help but feel jealous when she talks about other guys or when she talks with another guy. Recently, she told her that there was a guy that she wanted to get closer with at work. I didn't say anything, but in the inside, it just made me sad. Like, I would have given a lot just to be that close with her and it sucks that it's another guy instead of me. I see her online like on Messenger and I just have in mind ""maybe she is talking with this guy"" or something like that.

I know that she will have a boyfriend one day and that it won't be me. I don't get jealous like because she talks with other guys, I just feel sad that I am not at their place, talking with her. It kinda happens with all my previous crushes, like being a little bit jealous that there is another guy with them.

I just want to change my mindset because I know that I shouldn't think like that and that it's toxic for me. What should I do?",06Aug2020,1

We care a lot about each other and we have a very strong and unique friendship. He takes care of me as if I'm his partner however recently he has shown more interest in exploring girls by using dating apps and even planned on meeting up with someone.   


When this was not happening there will be times that I don't have any romantic feelings and at times feel trapped in the relationship but in light of recent events i've found myself becoming a green eyed monster, becoming quite jealous and possessive of him.

As far as Im aware most people daydream about happy things that they want to happen...not me. In my made up scenarios Im always a victim for some reason. E.g. there was this one scenario I made up where I get hit by a car and Im lying in a hospital bed unconscious hooked up to drips and a ventilator surrounded by the worried faces of my loved ones. There's another similar scenario I made up but this time it's a house fire instead of a car crash. I've always wondered why my brain does this and why I seem to lowkey relish? these scenarios. Clearly theres something wrong with me but what is it? (p.s. I dont actually want these things to happen to me in real life but I enjoy the ""attention"" in that moment)",06Aug2020,1

Throwaway account because my family / friends / boyfriend know my main, and I want to keep this as confidential as possible. Please please please read it all the way through before you comment.

I've been pondering this question for a while now and I need your advice. I'm going to go through why I think I should, then why I think I shouldn't.

For context, my parents separated when I was 1. They do not live together, though they do live in the same town (as of 2019, anyway. My Dad used to live elsewhere). They were never married and had an extremely toxic relationship (which I will talk about later). I've lived with my Mum mainly for around 10-11 years, then my Dad moved to my town and has demanded that I see him for a full week every 2 weeks (if that makes sense). He pays child support to my Mum. A year ago I was diagnosed with severe depression and PTSD after I was groomed at age 8-11. Not going to go into specifics, as it is only semi-relevant. My Mum and my Dad were brought up in different towns, and when they lived together they lived in my Dad's town. All of us live in the country famous for loving tea.

My bad relationship with my Dad started when I was 8. Each year I spend Christmas with my Mum, and then I would go over to my Dad's town (2-3 hours away by train, neither of my parents drive) and spend maybe a week there. His parent's would come over and we would have Christmas dinner, open presents etc etc. This particular year me and my Granddad were playing video games whilst my dad was putting up picture frames in my bedroom. After around 15 minutes he came down the stairs and complained that we were being too loud. OK, sure. We toned it down a bit. 10 minutes later and he has gone completely red in the face. He began screaming at my grandparents to get out of his house. I don't know for the life of me how is escalated that quickly. He began calling my Grandma awful things that I don't want to repeat. When my Granddad tried to calm him down he was also called awful things, and he has a phone thrown at him (a huge home phone, but with a wireless phone). At this point my Grandma was crying and they left the house. As soon as they left, he began blaming me for making too much noise (I was 8, what do you expect from an 8 year old?!) and sent me to my room for the rest of the week that I was there. I was only allowed to come out to have a bath, eat or use the bathroom. For making 'too much noise'. I've been scared of him since then, and I've never had the courage to stand up to him.

Next reason. As I said, I was groomed by older men at a young age. When my Dad found out, he and my Granddad (Mum's father) consistently called me a slut and reminded my constantly that it was my fault and how I was worthless. That still gets to me even now.

Another reason. My Mum was in a toxic relationship with him and she sees the same red flags in my relationship with him. He's possessive: he would never let my Mum see friends or family. The same is true with me when I am round at his. Won't let me contact anybody or go out and see anybody. He's violent: when he was with my Mum he would throw things in arguments. He still does, and has broken many things right in front of me. Has never apologised.

One of the most important reasons is that I've always felt as though I'm never first priority to my Dad. I'm not being selfish. When my Mum got away from him, she asked if he wanted to move to her hometown (so he could be part of my life and upbringing, She did'nt want me to grow up hardly seeing my Dad). There was a job opportunity for the same company my Dad worked at, just in my Mum's town. He refused, said he wanted nothing to do with me or my Mum. When my Mum was in hospital (when she was pregnant with me) he didn't visit her once. She had to go in early because she's disabled, so he basically chose not to see her for 7 months. He didn't show his face, but his Mum was there every day with freshly baked cookies.

Last reason. He is using me for money. He gets a payment of around £40 each month from his parents for things for me. Never has been spent on me. Recently, I've found out something else. The reason why he want's to see me so much now is because he is trying to claim that he should't pay child support because he is taking care of me for half of the time (even though I'll either be banished to my room or completely ignored when I'm there.

Enough with the reasons why I should, here's why I'm hesitant.

An obvious reason why I shouldn't is my age. I'm 13 (as you can see from the title) and I think it would be bad to go non-contact as such a young age. Not seeing my Dad much for a large portion of my life would be hard, even after what he's done to me. Another reason is that I wouldn't want to make him feel awful. I know what depression feels like. I wouldn't want him to feel as bad as I've felt for years. If my kid one day turned around and said they wanted absolutely nothing to do with me for a while, and wanted to go live with the other parent I would be mortified. I can only imagine what it would feel like. I'd never want to put him through that, even if he is absolutely awful. Another reason is that I would lose contact with his family (his parents, who are amazing and caring and his sister who is creative and an all round nice person) and I wouldn't want that to happen. I'm scared that it would happen, anyway. He is an extremely possessive person and would no doubt at least try and cut contact.

That's my reasoning. What do you guys think? I've talked to my boyfriend about this and he thinks I should do it. He says I need to stand up for myself and what is right. He doesn't want me to be miserable when I'm with my Dad. He basically said screw my Dad's feelings. I don't know what to do. Any advice?

1049,"About a week ago I was walking with my girlfriend when we talked about death. A weird feeling came over my body and I just suddenly realised that everything that I know will be gone and I will be gone. 

Now, for the past week, I’ve hardly been able to sleep, and every time my mood perks up I get the same sudden feeling that my life will all end. 

I seriously don’t know how to cope with this, it’s driving me mental and I can hardly have a good time because my brain always cuts back to these thoughts. 

I would absolutely love people to share their personal views on death, their knowledge, their fear. I hope talking to people will make my mind realise entire different ways of looking at the inevitable.",06Aug2020,1

1051,"This is a throwaway account, simply because some of the things that are mentioned here. PLEASE consider reading this.


First of all, I struggle with procrastination. This is the biggest problem I have. I can't do a single useful thing, especially since when covid-19 started and school stopped. Next year I have my first important exams that can at some point effect my life. I need to start studying and preparing for these exams or else I will not pass. I need to start doing work, not play for the whole day.


During self isolation, which for me took place between March and June, I lost 5 kilos and I was very happy with that. Then, I stopped training, I stopped eating properly, and I started eating lots of sugar like I did before. I also stopped training as I am not motivated enough and because of all my procrastination. I now weight 2 kilos more. This puts me down especially when I see the effort it took me to lose the 5 kilos and then I see what I'm doing right now, nothing. 


This is NSFW. This is not that big of a problem but I am gonna mention it anyway. As a teenager, I masturbate. But sometimes I feel like I do it way too much. I usually masturbate once per day but then there are days where I'm just hornier than usual and I masturbate several times, which then makes me feel like shit. I do not think that I have a porn addiction tho or any of that sort, more  of a masturbating problem. 


Another minor thing is that I feel like I'm worse than everybody in everything. So basically I struggle with self-esteem. Like for example, I look at my friends and they all have very good pcs, and then I look at my laptop, which can do nothing. I can't play the nice games they play, and all the games I play are not smooth. This just makes me feel like I have it worse than other people, even tho I know that compared to other people I'm fortunate. 


Some more minor things. I have mild to moderate paranoia, and I'm scared to seek help for it, as I think that when I'll tell my parents they'll be like, ""It will go away with time"" or ""we can't afford to help you with that right now"". I feel like paranoia ruins certain parts of my life and I really want to stop having it. 


And all of the above, makes me question myself. What's the point of living this life, if I'm not productive in any way, if the only things I do are unhealthy and useless. What's the point of all of this? 


And this is why I made a throwaway account to try and get some help. I am TRULY fed up with all of this stuff and I want my life to change, I want to live a better life, a life where I am actually useful, a life where I can feel successful and happy.",06Aug2020,1

I asked a friend if I could borrow their bike to get there and he said sure but I thought better of it, because I’m meeting a stranger online. Then I asked my dad (50M) to see if he’d be okay with paying the tolls to get me there and bring me back with the wheels. He said yes, but that doesn’t mean much because he’s not always the type to do what he says he’ll do, which I’ve learned multiple times.

this is a difficult topic to explain.

 a little over a year and a few months ago my mother had marital problems with my father and they separated, so she got another partner, but after time she started missing my father and from then on all this happens.

This is how her depression started and she wanted to have a family again as she says, but although she wants to return to my father, he is already with someone else and is happy.

Despite that, he harasses him and continues everywhere, on more than one occasion he hit my father's girlfriend, this and more.

    Here’s how it all started one day my dad was having a drink with my brother in law music was not loud and neighbor across the street came over and said it was too loud so my dad told him they weren’t being to loud and to go back on his and mind his business of course I’m pretty sure their was some bad words in the argument they had. After that dad actually went over to his next door neighbors and asked if they were being too loud and they said no. They asked if they were sure because a certain neighbor was complaining they told them who and one of the next door neighbor said “oh don’t worry about him he’s got a stick up his ass”.
  Nosy neighbor Filed his first complaint.”Loud Music”
There are three vehicles who drop off kids at my moms place.
2nd Complaint he said we were throwing so much trash and it was all going on his lawn 
“We drive nice decent cars who’s owners hate having any type of mess in their vehicles” he said the amount of trash was absurd.
3rd Complaint we got a letter from landlord that said “please do not slam car doors and do not yell or talk loud” (we go to work at 5am we do not even have the energy to make our lunch why would we be yelling or talking loud and to whom our kids are half asleep) 

This guy always has his window and door open at @5-6 in the morning who does that.?? 
This area is close to some railroad tracks there’s always a train honking late at night early morning everyday how does that not bother him more where he would have already left this area.?

Today my dad took various breaks in between trimming the grass with the weed eater because he didn’t want “Nosy Neighbor” to go and complain again. It honestly made me feel sad. And here you have to maintain your own lawn. 

Here’s some extra info 
Nosy neighbor happens to be a maintenance guy
Landlord/owner is a very nice lady
We happen to be Hispanic 
He is white (hope it’s not a race thing)
I’m guessing he still holds a grudge that my dad got in his face and told him to go back to his lawn/area.

His replacement had a masters degree and was able to figure it out.

Let me start with the simple stuff. My maternal uncle (let’s call him L) has always lived at home (that is to say with my grandmother and, while he was alive, my grandfather). And, considering recent events, he will probably always live at home. So with that in mind, I’ll try to start at the beginning of the whole messy matter. I, admittedly, have never had to try to explain the entire issue to someone who wasn’t already involved. It may get a little confusing.

Several years ago (more than six, and most likely more than ten) one of L’s closest friends (let’s call him T) died. I was never really privy to the details of the matter, being as no one would really talk about it, but what I do know was that it happened rather suddenly. This left T’s girlfriend (let’s call her B) with nowhere to go. So, L and my grandmother (let’s call her E) offered to let her stay with them. Let me just say now, I don’t think any of us thought this would be a permanent situation.

After a few years of this, L and B started “dating” (I use that term rather loosely). I always assumed this began because they both missed T, and were trying to process their grief in a way. But, it’s hard to tell. Not too long after this started, however, my grandmother seemed to grow... uncomfortable with the whole situation. You see, B isn’t exactly what you might call a pleasant person (although, neither is L, admittedly) and she seemed to reinforce certain negative behaviors in L. Also, as my father put it, E didn’t care for them just living together without some kind of commitment. But, things went on. And, they got worse as they did.

You see, L has always had a very peculiar stance towards certain things. He seems to resent anything that makes him uncomfortable, or gets in the way of what he wants to do (such as responsibilities). He also seems to view my grandparents’ house as already his. (For example, my father cites incidents such as when my other uncle would call home from California and have my grandparents pay the charges, because he couldn’t, L would grouch about him “wasting our money”.) And as things went on, it became rather apparent that B shared these kind of views. She grew almost resentful of my grandmother. The three of them argued a fair amount (particularly around the holidays). My family was regularly put in the middle in some way or another; either we would have to listen to them complain about each other, or we would be called upon to adjudicate their arguments. There was more than once that B and L would talk about marriage, which would kind of smooth things over for a bit, but nothing permanent would ever emerge from these talks.

Things only grew tenser as time went on. Going over to my grandmother’s house became more stressful, and family gatherings took on an uncomfortable edge. B and E would clash over just about anything, and L would more often than not claim to be uninvolved or have no opinion. Add to this the fact that my sister-in-law and B developed a particular distaste for each other, and things very easily got ugly. If we had a family dinner, and my sister-in-law was there, B would spend all night in her room. Christmas grew particularly bad. To begin with, my grandmother has always grown... high-strung around Christmas, especially after my grandfather passed away. This was just an unfortunate fact of our lives. But, with things as they were, the holidays were an absolute gauntlet. I remember one year my mother tried to mitigate the usual fight about cooking (something B and E would bicker about) by ordering food for Christmas dinner. For a little while, it seemed like the idea had worked. Until B and E started bickering over who would make dessert. It was as if they were trying to out-do each other. Over the years, it got to the point that the only time we would see B during Christmas was the few moments she would come out of her room and collect her presents, before going back to her room and shutting the door.

Then, six years ago, my mother died. It hit us all hard, but it hit my grandmother the worst. In the wake of this wrenching change, my grandmother started asking all of us to get together more often. So, to try and mitigate the obvious tension, a deal was struck. Every Saturday, L and B would drive down to see B’s kids and grandkids. During the time they were gone, my family would go over to my grandmother’s house for breakfast. Said deal seemed to take the pressure off a bit simply by separating B, E, and L for a while. They still grumbled about each other and even periodically argued, but the time apart did them all some visible good. Around this time, B’s daughter came to live with B, E, and L, too. I was tentative about the idea at first, but it seemed to smooth things over a little bit more. It gave E someone to help in the wake of losing my mother, and gave them all a sympathetic ear.

Then, a couple of years ago, L had a stroke. A really bad one. As in, emergency fly him up-state, he had to be resuscitated bad. But, silver linings are on most horrible things, right? The sudden shock of potentially losing L seemed to scare B quite a bit. For a couple of months, while L was recovering enough to be sent home, I was hopeful we’d see something resembling peace in their household. Then L came home, and everything went back downhill. Fast.

L is going to be physically handicapped or the rest of his life. There’s no other way to put it. And between this and L’s struggle to get better, both B and E had completely different responses. B wants to do everything for him and treats him like he’s fragile materials (she has to pour his coffee for him, and tries to help him walk). E, on the other hand, pushes him to get better (encouraging him to have conversations, even though they’re difficult, and to get out and walk around the house and yard). With vying stances, the relations between B and E started to degrade further; E’s attempts to get L out of the house were deemed “unsafe”, B did things like tell E not to talk about current events and politics with L because it could be “hard on him”. And while B’s daughter helped where she could, it wasn’t too long after L got resettled at home that she moved back to be closer to her kids. (At least, that’s the reason she gave us. I always felt that B’s sudden strict attempts to make up for a lack of mothering during her daughter’s childhood, as well as having to play sympathetic ear and impartial arbiter to the others pushed her away.)

So, suddenly without the Saturday trips and B’s daughter, everything began to really curdle. Practically every conversation with B, L, or E alone was about the others. Suddenly everything E did was wrong, and as such was a reason to argue. (B started regularly complaining that E “stomps across the living room floor”. My grandmother has bad knees, mind you.) B started to grow more irritable about “doing her own dishes”, and having separate food that she threw a fit if someone else ate some of (she grouched at my grandmother for supposedly using some of her ketchup once). In response, my grandmother grew more aggravated and defensive. (She barely uses her computer anymore because she “types too loud” and “blocks the door” to B’s room.) It’s gotten to the point where E is basically trying to drag the entire house into her bedroom just so she can “be out of the way”.

(Of course, now let me be clear, my grandmother is probably not an easy person to live with. She, like many of us, has a very specific way of doing things. And she mostly does them at high speed. She’s done this since my mother was small. And when my grandmother is stressed out or feeling depressed, she simply does more and goes faster. She also has a habit of thinking others should do things at her speed. However, this is not a new behavior.)

And, well, I guess that’s the gist of it. There are other issues, such as B’s problems with alcohol, but these are the high points. Quite frankly, I’ve grown very worried about how the constant stress is affecting my grandmother. You see, she’s always had this odd habit when she’s stressed out of being a bit confusing to talk to; during a conversation she jumps suddenly from topic to topic. It’s something she’s always done, and something she’s been doing more often. That, and how the stress is affecting my family; none of us wants to go over to my grandmother’s and visit, which I know hurts her. Over the years my family has tried just about every solution we could think of. We’ve suggested they see counseling (they all refuse to do so). We’ve tried suggesting they separate (which again was denied, and is now something that’s no longer viable considering L’s current conditions). We’ve suggested B alone leave (E feels sorry that she “has nowhere to go”, and says her leaving would “hurt L”). E always ends these conversations with how she hates all the fighting and arguing because of “how hard it is on L”, so I’ve tried convincing her that it’s hurting her too. But, my words are swept aside.

1085,"i do dumb things a lot. or what other people would call dumb. i’ve pissed people off by doing these things. like one time, i was washing dishes at a new job and they had a system where they would put the trays on top of each other upside down to avoid food from getting on the bottoms of the trays. and i didn’t pay attention to this system so i just collected the trays as they came without putting them upside down. and the woman washing the dishes stormed off and got pissed and started complaining to the head of the kitchen about me. 

another thing i did to piss someone off was at my current job, i started folding the laundry that my coworker had put in the dryer and she got pissed when she saw i was folding the laundry she had put in the dryer. she went to my coworker and complained to her about me. 

also today, someone asked me if they knew where my coworker was. i said ummm no. and instead of calling my coworker on my walkie talkie, i just left it at that. 

there’s a lot of things that i do that defy common sense. i don’t do it to sabatoge people. i just do it because i wasn’t born with much common sense. i have trouble seeing the wrong in what i do. 

for example, yesterday. i had bought 6 pops which were divided into 3 bags with 2 in each bag and then some other stuff. i put them in the backseat behind the drivers seat. when my dad and i got home, i got out of the passengers seat, went around to the back side on the drivers side and when i opened the door, the bags of pops were in front. so i tried to hand my dad a couple bags of pops while he was still sitting in the drivers seat with his door a little open. i guess he was waiting for me to pass by so he could go to the back seat and grab some bags. but he called me names and said there was something wrong with me for trying to hand him bags while he was in the car instead of just carrying the less heavier bags and going inside. to this day, i still don’t see the flaw in my logic because i feel like i was trying to save him the hassle of going to the back seat. 

and today at work, i asked my coworker if we were taking out the trash since it was thursday. and it took her a while to respond. so my other coworker was smirking in embarrassment in the background. i think she was uncomfortable at me asking a question i already knew the answer to or telling on myself. 

i think i have a hard time interpreting common sense. even when i think before i act, i make my brain confused because it doesn’t grasp logic well. 

i’m stressing myself out by trying to be perfect. i can learn from my mistakes but i’m going to make more ditzy mistakes because that’s just who i am. i can try not to make people uncomfortable but i am going to make people uncomfortable because that’s just who i am. i can try to make everyone like me but people are going to find a way to dislike me because i am who i am. so should i stop trying to be less cringe or just say whatever? 

tl;dr: having a hard time at common sense which makes people upset.",06Aug2020,1

I had to research how to clean the stuff up only to learn your basically fucked if you have carpet because apparently Google has little to no information on cleaning rat droppings from carpet. Then  I went down a rabbit hole of rat diseases and what not to do when dealing with them. Tell my parents and first thing they do is sweep it up , which I told them not to do in case it agitates the droppings to release viruses from them. I'm so tired and stressed and I'm only 17 about keeping our family safe from all this crap.
