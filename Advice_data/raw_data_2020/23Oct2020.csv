0,"Sexual activities with my last partner was horrific. I'm inexperienced and insecure as hell and now I have a very mature partner and I don't want to fuck this up.

For real like, what do men actually want. Usually I'm the submissive shy ass hell type but like now guys want someone enthusiastic or something?? I don't know how I can be confident and enthused slobbering on some guys parts when I'm panicking on the inside wondering if I'm doing it wrong. And no I can't explain this to my partner because I did that last time and the blowies were even more awkward and uncomfortable.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIVE A HANDJOB. Do you just stroke it?? Spit on your hand??? Or the dick?? Isn't the dry friction bad?? I just... Ugh helpp. How to sex?? Is there a manual? 'ask what they want' does nothing for me.",23Oct2020,1

2,"Hello, this is my first post here.

Long time ago I had a friend. She was a great friend. I shared every day with her. We studied together, played video games, etc. However, when we graduated, each one went his own way, but we kept in touch once in a while.

The thing is, I haven't talked to her for like a year.

I have her phone number, but every time I try to call her it gives me a lot of anxiety, I'm afraid that she will reject me, hate me or ignore me. 

I want to reconnect with her, but I'm very scared. I don't know how to start a conversation after so long.

So, What can I do?

Thank you, and sorry for my bad english.",23Oct2020,1
3,"She's 13, and I see her active on school days at 2/3/4am, which means she probablys gets to sleep 5 horus or less. That's in the most cases really unhealthy, and on top of that I think she's got some mental health issues (she went to a psychiatrist this week too). I don't want to take away her freedoom, but I want the best for her so I think I might tell my aunt. (I am 19M if you would like to know)",23Oct2020,1
4,"Hi idk how to start this but i am a second year uni student who is at rock bottom and I dont usually do this but I am desperate need of some advice. I know this is long and rushed but pls answer because idk what to do anymore.

To keep things limited but still provide some back story this year has been the year from hell. My grandad who is my favourite person in the world was diagnosed with an aggressive form of skin cancer during the pandemic and as he lives with us I couldn't see anyone for 6 months causing me to lose alot of my at home friends who decided I wasn't worth it. It was a tough time but I had a purpose which was keeping him safe and I was content with that.

Fast forward to September, I moved in with 3 of my best uni friends and tbh I focussed so much attention on them that they have fast become my only uni friends.
The flat we moved into has turned into the flat from hell - we couldn't see it before we moved in and  the way it is set out means that I (and only me) am under the flat of all night partiers who do NOT stop. I've been living in the flat for 4 months now and I get no sleep like ever and I have tried everything including reporting them to the police but they never come out or do anything. 

The lack of sleep makes me kind of cranky but not too much that I can't socialise - however we all hit lows and when I hit my low I noticed my flatmate, who deals with mental health issues, start to snap at me and only me. I tried to distance myself from her but it's difficult because my room is constantly noisy and because of covid I can barely go anywhere so I have to stay in the kitchen and study. I also tried to avoid any controversial subjects but I noticed that no matter what I talked about (Washing dishes, celebrities, food, music) the snapping got worse and worse until I finally got the courage to ask her what was wrong because she was making me miserable. Well, she flipped off, buried her head into the ground and let out shrieks which I have only ever heard from horror films - it was traumatic to say the least - followed by a panic attack and more hysteria all because I asked her what was wrong. I was already at a low but seeing that and her reaction has knocked me completely and to say I am struggling is an understatement - I have never been so miserable in my life. And to make things worse my two other flatmates (who I considered my best friends even more than my third flatmate) have completely washed their hands of me and treat me like a burden. They never talk to me unless I talk to them, they eat with out me, they go to the store with out me, I could trip and hit my head in my room and they wouldn't think to check on me for months at a time. 

I feel like I don't have any friends left and although I've managed to get them to move with me I have to stay with them until the end of the year and idk how well I'm going to cope. I am miserable, I'm usually quite cheery but I find myself crying multiple times a day, I'm constantly on the phone to my mum crying about how much I hate it here and all I want to do is make new friends who actually care about me but due to covid there are no events to help me meet anyone so I'm completely stuck here.

 I know this was long but if anyone has any similar stories or advice for me I would really appreciate it. Please be nice to me too I really can't take strangers coming for my throat my friends do it enough.",23Oct2020,1

6,"So my grandmother is a type 2 diabetic now and she has non alcoholic fatty liver disease. She’s been told a few months ago that if she doesn’t change her diet she’s beginning to develop cirrhosis. 

Before her diet consisted of mostly 4 family size boxes of double stuffed Oreos and 5 party sized bags of Cheetos a week. Then she threw in a bunch of candies.  

After she was told the news of her beginning stages of cirrhosis, she cut out the Oreos and Cheetos. However she’s replaced those with “healthy” options. These “healthy” options are three musketeer candy bars. 

I knew she was sneaking them in because a few times I’d walk by her room and hear a wrapper. So today I went in to clean and I got nosey and found them. From the receipts and wrappers that I found she ate 47 full size 3 musketeer candy bars in 14 days. I knew these would be a problem because she’s always said “they’re low fat.” So in her mind they’re healthy. She also eats about 5 large tubs of Pork Rinds a week as well. 

I’m her cook so I know what I feed her, however she barely eats any real food. I’ll cook her a steak and she’ll eat 2 bites and claim she’s full. I’ll cook her a fish and she’ll eat 2 bites and claim she’s full. So I always figured she was sneaking in food she wasn’t supposed to but I didn’t realize she was eating 4 candy bars a day. Some days, the only real food she will eat is a single carrot and half an avocado. 

She also volunteers at this place religiously, more than most full time employees, and often all she claims to eat for lunch is a small can of Vienna sausages. So I know she’s sneaking in food over there too but that’s out of my sight, there’s no way I can find out. 

She then goes to her doctor and claims she’s been following the keto diet like she’s been told to do but can’t figure out why she isn’t losing weight. 

I need some advice on what to do. Technically I’m not supposed to know about the candy at all, she thinks I don’t know about it. Any advice would be helpful.",23Oct2020,1
7,"Didn’t know where to post this...

So a little backstory, me and my girlfriend have been together for 1.5 years now she’s 22 and I’m 24. Before we moved in together she lived with her mom in a small street, across from their house is a place that sells second hand cars.

Anyway, our appartment is about 5 minutes from were she first lived. 

Today she got a friend request on Facebook from the guy that owns the place, apparently he’s 21, they had no friends in common so she thought it was a bit weird which is why she told me. I didnt think much of it, figuring he’d probably knew her name because they lived across from each other.

So our appartment has 2 front windows in the room where we have the washing machine, freezer etc. those are the only windows that face the street. The rest of them is on the backside of the building, our garages are still being made since it’s new and everyone parks their car upfront. There are only 6 residents so we know all the cars. My girlfriend was cleaning in the washing room close to midnight when a porsche with garage license plates pulls up (in Belgium garage cars that are up for sale require special plates), she comes to get me and tells me she thinks it’s the same guy that sent her the friendship request. While she came to get me he moved across the street and parked there with the front of his car facing our windows. Lights out. 

At this point I’m still trying to make sense of things, maybe he has friends living there, maybe he’s waiting for someone. I’m watching him, but couldn’t see anything since he had his lights out. I’m in shock and so confused at this point, who does something like that and stays after being ‘busted’ he left about 10-15 mins later and I’m still not convinced, so I drive to the garage and check the parking lot and yep the car was there, same license plate. Mind you this is about 10 minutes before everyone has to be in their houses because of COVID. 

After that I checked his instagram and he had a clip of shopping bags in front of the store my girlfriend works in.

Who knows how many times he did this before, last night I was watching a series on Netflix and went to get something in the freezer and felt like I was being watched, so much that it gave me goosebumps. And that was before all this.

I dont know what to do, my girlfriend is scared, I feel like a total pussy because I can’t think of any solution.

8,"I am currently 17, I turn 18 next August. I am planning on moving to Tromsø, Norway next October. I am still deciding on wether it is a good decision or not, I have gotten in contact with some volunteering agencies that provide accommodation and food. I figure that I will volunteer for about 50 days and then during that time search for jobs. After I have one secured I apply for a work visa and then start my new life. I estimate it will cost from 3-5 thousand usd for the plane ticket and other costs, I currently do not have that money so I was thinking I take out a personal loan and pay it back from the money I make in Norway.

9,"I found a hard, bead-like, painless lump in my breast and went to see my general practitioner. He first acted like I was being dramatic but when he felt the lump, he kind of changed his demeanor and told the nurse to schedule me a mammogram.

He then told me I was good to come in because he had a patient who had a lump very similar to mine. He said this woman waited six months to be seen because she didn’t think much of it. Six months after going to the doctor, she was dead. 

My mammogram is scheduled for four days from now. 

I KNOW my chances of this being anything scary are SO low. I know that. I still can’t keep myself from crying at the thought of death, leaving my husband without a wife, leaving my kids without a mother. I haven’t been able to hold my ten month old without crying. 

I know I really shouldn’t be worried but the small potential mixed with my doctor freaking me out has led me to complete anxiety. 

I realize how completely ridiculous I’m being by going to worst-case-scenario and crying but I can’t help it. How do I go through these next few days as normal? It doesn’t seem to matter what I tell myself. I can’t calm down and I can’t relax about it.

10,"So, for the last 4 months a girl who i had just been talking to as a friend has been going out with a guy from my school, she is from another school and her bf goes to my school and we’re not friends but we know each other. her bf has a reputation for being tough and fighting and all that stuff. 

Last week they had a major fight as they found out he had been cheating on her with his ex, so basically this girl and me have been on facetime for like the last two nights for like three hours and there was a small bit of casual flirting really that was it. 

But then tonight she told me she really liked me and i just told her she was losing connection and that was that, she has texted me but i’m worried to open it. the problem is most people’s would say this is someone’s dream as a teenager but the only reason i haven’t said i like u too is beacause of her ex. 

Just last year he threw my friend on the ground because he said to him that he never gave him his pen back, he has also been known to fight, drink and all that stuff “hard” guys do, i’m just scared that if i say yess he will make my life he’ll and much more.

11,"Yesterday, a...good friend of mine and I got into a lengthy, seemingly heated discussion about politics. Without going into details, I was an idiot.

I told him so, too.

I don't expect him to be over it right away, but I'm worried that if I just leave it where it ended, it'll only get worse. On the other hand, I'm worried that he's not ready to talk to me yet, and that if I do message him that it'll just make things worse. So I'm torn between these two options.

22,"Okay, Reddit, I’m new to this, but I need advice. Long read ahead. 

So. To start out, I’ll explain the situation from the beginning. A close friend of mine(who we will call Hips), a few years back, introduced a guy friend into our very, very small, very tight friend group(we’re basically like sisters, known and loved each other as such for a decade or so). Now, Hips first introduced him as a potential bf, she wasn’t sure yet. He was invited to things we usually do as bonding activities with each other(fam movie night, drink/game night which we rarely had, etc.) because she slowly considered him to be a friend more than potential bf. 

A year or so passes and things slowly start changing. He gets clingier. He starts pushing boundaries, but in such a way that it’s not like warning bells going off juuuuust yet. He starts talking to us about depression. Turns out he suffers from it. This is important to note because around the time I really started getting fed up with his pushiness and lack of boundaries(which before anyone tries to come at me for this, we HAD talked to him multiple times about) not just for us but for himself, he admits to me and who we will call Donk(one of my sister-friends) that he randomly, out of nowhere with no actual reasoning for it, quit his meds cold turkey. Idk if y’all know this, but you don’t just randomly quit depression meds. Especially not high dosage ones, it really messes with your body, you’re supposed to be weaned off of them if you decide to stop from what I was taught. 

There had been multiple incidents that we thought at the time were accidental, such as, him sneaking a peak while I was changing tops(he claimed he wasn’t really looking, just joking), sending me c*mshot on Snapchat and then claiming he didn’t mean to, to which I was almost screaming in my parents’ house at 3 in the morning. He’s also given Hips and Donk troubles as well. With Hips, he’s tried to guilt her into hanging out multiple times during which she made it clear she needed time for herself(we’re all very non-social, introverted people and at this point she was dating someone she really liked), and gets upset when one of us doesn’t agree with him and will literally start crying and throwing tantrums. He cried once because while we were drinking, he asked if he was my absolute best friend(can’t make this up). I said no, because I don’t like to lie to ppl and it took me off guard, so he walked off in the middle of a VERY risky area on a party night in downtown and started crying simply because I said that. 

Now, you may be saying to yourself “why haven’t you dropped this fool from the friend group already if he’s given you guys so many reasons and your personalities don’t mesh”. This goes back to the depression bit. We are honest to God freaked on how he might react. We were tentative friends when his mother passed away and just seeing the route his personality/character/extracurricular activities went when “coping” with that, makes us scared of what he would do if we just completely cut him off. To be clear, he’s especially “bonded” in his mind to Donk because she has also lost her mother and this lead to another, even deeper spiral of Very Bad Decisions/Behavior. To be clear, he even thought he caught a disease at one point(this has since happened twice) and was still trying to convince me to share my drinks with him. Turns out he had a thing for me. Brought it up a couple times to which I shot him down. He also asked Donk about if she thought he could convince me to which she replied a big “Hell No.” to him on 🙌🏻 We invited him once to Friendsmas, that was hosted at our other close friend and last member of this particular friend group’s house(we’ll call her Hair), and he wouldn’t stop touching my feet. I snapped on him. He mashed his face down in the carpeted rug, again behavior fitting of a spoiled 4 year old. Acted like the world was ending. The way he reacts to any negativity in his life is what makes it so hard to just be direct with him about not wanting to be “friends”. 

I’ve had nightmares about this guy going off the deep end/snapping off from reality and kidnapping Donk and murdering Hips who has actually been able to ghost him because she doesn’t live around here anymore. He also has this habit of buying us gifts when he goes out of town, which hey cool except we don’t want them and we’ve told him not to and that he should keep that money for himself etc. so anyways, after just giving a fraction of the background on what’s going on, what do you guys think the best course of action is? I have personally snapped on him in person and through text with multiple of the incidents that have occurred, he’s not taking the hint that we just aren’t close to him as he thinks he is with us. 

We’ve practically begged him to go to therapy and/or get back on his meds, talk to a doctor, anything so we wouldn’t have to be worried about a whole ass human life when we disconnected from him. I thought we were good as far as where we stood until recently when he messaged out of the blue for the first time in months apologizing for being absent from mine and the friends’ lives. Should I just message him and be like “I’m not trying to be a heartless bitch but I don’t really see you as a friend, like I’m really having to force this and that’s not what friendship is...” or????  I just don’t want to feel responsible for another human’s life. And I feel like that’s the root of why I have never officially been like “go away”. I tried to make myself okay with him, and I’m just not.",23Oct2020,1
23," 

Hello everyone, I'm gonna try to make this as short as possible.

I am having lots of issues lately regarding my relatipnship with this girl. We met at the beginning of the pandemic and hit it off pretty well, she was straight from the beginning and told me she wanted to try relationship with me, which I wasn't sure. We were/are honest with eachother all the time, and I always told her that I'm not too sure if I want to be in a relationship because my feelings for her aren't as strong, but I still decided to try it out since she told me she could wait for me and if I wasn't ready she was willing to accept it too.

Here's my problem, I think I love her, she's super nice, she's such a good soul, she's smart, atentive, supportive, affectionate, a good companion, and many other good things. The problem starts where I, even with all the pros, don't feel much passion, ""magic"" or strong love emotions towards her. to put it more visual, it's like everytime I wake up I feel so empty and when I think about her I don't feel anything, no emotion, no happiness, no will to go and hang with her at all. And it's not like I feel like that because I'm depressed, I've had relationships before where I do feel happiness towards them and an urge to wake up and wish my couple a happy and good morning.

At first I thought I felt like this because I'm not that attracted to her physically, she's physically not my type and I thought it was stupid of me changing all the value she brings to my life, just for something so superficial. But now, I'm not so sure if it's only that anymore; she brings joy and happy moments to my life but I just can't feel emotionally strong towards her, at least not as I used to in my past relationships (which Im over btw, just bring it up to put an example).

Now, I feel like she deserves to be out of that limbo, and she deserves a decisive answer from me, she's been so patient all this time, I don't want to lose her but I also don't want to feel like I'm trapped in a relationship just because I'm scared to lose her affection. I've tought about it for so long, that my brain shuts down everytime I try to come up with a decision Idk what to do anymore and I feel lost.  
Sometimes I feel like I wanna be with her (it be for a short time) and for longer times I feel like I rather be alone.",23Oct2020,1

25,"I got dumped by my girlfriend around four months ago. She was the only woman I ever loved, even though she would abuse me. She would manipulate me in the worst possible ways imaginable. She would play with my emotions and control me, but I still loved her. I love her even now. I always forgave her even though everyone told me to drop her. I didn't believe them, I didn't think they knew what was good for me. Even though it hasn't been long I feel that such a weight has been taken off my shoulders looking back now, these people were right. However, I still miss her and I would put up with the abuse if it gave me more time with her. It's contradictory and toxic, but this is how I feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

As it often happens with breakups you think about the past, you try to work out where things went wrong. I have been thinking about the whole thing lot, and I do think that I loved her so much because she was so cruel to me. When I met her she gave off this, ""I don't care about you"" mentality and it made me want to chase her and change her mind about me. When things were good I felt bored. I was always bored by the whole ""going on a date while holding hands"" thing. I never wanted it and would prefer to be alone if that's what was on the table for me. When she would get angry with me I felt good - as masochistic as it may sound. Seeing her cry over an argument proved to me that she cared enough about me to cry. Hearing her yell at me proved to me that she loved me. I wanted to suffer because of her. When she would abuse me I felt like I was doing a good thing, I was to proving to her what I was willing to take to be with her. I wanted to show her that I loved her enough to take it, and I did. She could have done anything to me, she could have killed me and I would have still loved her. Her main reason for leaving me was her desire to protect me from herself as she told me. At the end she became disgusted with how she treated me, and wanted to spare me from it even though that was what made me love her in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who is single now I have begun looking at other women, and I know that a girl at work likes me. She's the type of woman who no one likes, she says what she wants and she doesn't care about the opinions or feelings of others. She is cruel, she says things that I wouldn't say to others. She treats me in this similar uncaring detached way that I found found so attractive about my ex. One day she flirts and jokes around with me, the next she behaves as if I burned her house down, and I can't keep her out my head because of that. I work at a place where I am often the only guy in the room so I am surrounded by women all the time, and I know that some of these women are into me. I have been asked out on dates by two separate women from work since the breakup, but I find no interest in any of these girls. I can only be attracted to women who show cruelty to me. This has always been the case, from my early crushes to the films I like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do. Can I change that part of me? How do I change the type of person I am attracted by? Are all of my relationships going to be toxic because of this?",23Oct2020,1

It was her choice, but basically it came down to neither of us being happy and us needing to call it quits.  So I am ready to start dating casually.  I think its something I need to do for me.  I just want to go out on dates and have someone to spend time with when I am alone.  Just hang out, dinner and a movie nothing serious.

So here is my question.  How to do I let my ex-wife know about it without breaking her heart all over again?  I know she isn't ready for that step but I am.  Even though she doesn't want to be together it is going to be rough for her to hear.  Any advice helps.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",23Oct2020,1
27,Hi had to make a new account idk why. I have been working at a cotton textile mill in the Charlotte area of NC since August of 2019 I just got off the phone with hr manager who said I am being terminated. This stems from the manager being told I throw a bobbin from a co worker. The manager then comes and asks me if I'm ok. I said yes why? He asked if I was throwing bobbins around. I answered no and he said ok. That was about a week ago. I thought that was it but apparently not. I didnt throw any bobbins at most I forceably dropped one and that's an extreme extraction. It didn't break it was a 2 foot drop. Happens hundreds of times a night from much higher up from the machines themselves. But I've never been written up or had any verbal or written warnings. I've only missed 3 days since I started. Never been late and I get the best numbers on my shift. And all I got was a termination for hearsay. What are my options? If your a person who can actively help me then pm me and I'll answer any questions you may have directly. If anyone has any other questions comment and I'll answer all I can. I'm not new to reddit but I haven't posted much so I hope this is all ok. Btw I'm a 24 year old male. And yes I've applied for unemployment. But we were on it earlier this year so I'm unsure on if I'll get it. Also have no savings because I just bought a car. Sooooo not great timing lol also if you know of a better place to post this let me know.,23Oct2020,1

29,"I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for 4 years now. I’ve been doubting my relationship on and off throughout it, but my stupid ass was heartbroken when we got together, we bonded over him introducing me to weed, and I was looking for anything that needed me in some way. Turns out, weed just helps me ignore my problems instead of dealing with them, and I have major codependency issues. Now here I am 4 years later, we live together away from our families attending college, and I want out. His ex posts her own porn, and while she is perfectly free to do her own thing, i shouldn’t have to tell him more than once that I have an issue with it. I don’t give a fuck if he watches porn, watch whatever the fuck you want, but don’t make it personal. I don’t know if they are communicating, I don’t think he would cheat, but I don’t think he would block her if she sent him anything personally. I’m just done dealing with it and him, but I don’t want to leave in some explosive way. I’ve never had good healthy examples on how to deal with this shit.",23Oct2020,1

I work for two different teams at my workplace half and half, and I feel like I'm not a part of either one of them. I am so angry right now because I've just found out that both of my teams, including my bosses, are currently on some sort of field trip that I knew literally nothing about. Not only was I not invited to this thing that sounds like it is definitely something I should have been involved in, but I didn't even KNOW about it. Nobody told me anything and I'm so fucking sick of this. Noone keeps me in the loop, noone remembers to invite me to team outings, and now they've completely excluded me from an important work trip that I think I could have offered some useful support for. 

I'm so angry and upset that I just want to hand in my resignation right now, but I'm not willing to throw away the experience I'm gaining from working here. Should I talk to my bosses about this? Should I just grin and bear it while I look for another job? I'm losing so much respect for the company every day and just want to leave as soon as a better opportunity comes along, so maybe I just don't let it bother me in the meantime? Idk. This is so upsetting to me because I've been constantly left out of things in my friend groups since I was a young child, and now it's even happening in my workplace. It really hurts and feels like there's something wrong with me.",23Oct2020,1

To summarise I have had by far the worst 2-3 weeks of my life. And honestly, it seems like it’s only getting worse.

I’m 16 and within the past few weeks all of this has happened (in order): 
My dad has died,
My grandad got diagnosed with cancer,
I lose my job
And my girlfriend (first love) broke up with me after cheating for another person 

On top of this, we are to poor to be able to pay for my dad funeral 

And through out all of this so many arguments in the family have erupted and almost gone to fights

My school grades have plummeted as I’ve just started A-levels and all of this is happening back home 

I really have no idea what to do from this point. 
Everything has gone south so fast and I can’t keep up, I have to keep everything bottled up because I have nobody to tell, it used to be my girlfriend who I’d vent to but we have broken up.

I am about four months in and have noticed a lot of issues within the office, so I decided to bring them to the attention of the doctors and manager at our last meeting. Afterwards my coworker pulled me aside and said that the office manager privately told her that she was worried by talking points because the doctors already feel I might not be the right fit for the position. However, could not provide details as to what I need to work on specifically. Today, the other receptionist told me that while I was out on vacation the manager asked how I am doing because the doctors feel I’m not fully grasping the position. She assured her there is nothing to worry about, but this still really rubbed me the wrong way. 

I would like advice on how to approach this situation. In my opinion, the manager should be coming to me directly and letting me know some concrete areas I need to improve on.

Over a year ago now, I was ghosted by a guy I really liked. It really hurt, damaged my mental health, and took me several months to get over. Occasionally, despite my happy relationship now, I still think about it.

Earlier this month, this ghoster requests to follow me on instagram. I accept, telling myself I'll just figure out what he wants. He doesn't message me, just likes one of my posts, and checks my story occasionally. And tonight I noticed he unfollowed me, and I'm ashamed to admit I'm disappointed.

I figured if he truly wanted to speak to me, he would contact me. When he ghosted me, I messaged him often and even saw him in person several times and we never spoke. I told myself he wouldn't get anything else from me unless he made the first move. Now, I'm wondering if I should have said something.

I am currently in a relationship with a great guy, who I really love. We just moved in together. I would never actually do anything with this ghoster. I think I just want some closure.

Should I message this ghoster and ask him what he wants? My boyfriend knows who he is and knows he followed me. I'm torn because I don't know if he would be comfortable with me messaging him. He is usually okay with talking about past relationships.",23Oct2020,1

TLDR: flatmates are playing pranks and taking the piss out of me but when it’s just me and then individually they are really nice to me and act as good friends.

Edit: back home in my friend group we all take the piss out of each other but never target one guy so I’m used to taking the piss and giving it out but not being the only/main one. And the main thing that annoys me is I’m the only one they play pranks on and all take the piss out of the most even though I’d say I’m fairly popular among our group 

Started uni a month ago and I’d say I’m fairly popular among my flatmates as individuals (always included in everything and invited to go out with just a few of us) and the other flat we hang out with a lot but it’s completely different when together as a group. 

One example (probably the worst one) was we were at the pub (all a bit drunk) and for some reason my flatmate just took a photo of me with a silly Snapchat filter on and sent it to our flat gc, but then this probably went on for 5 whole mins of everyone just making silly filter pics of me and editing them whilst I was just there trying to not feel that bad/embarrassed.

Individually I’m good friends with a most of them but when together as a group the 3 guys all switch up and take the piss out of me (and just me it’s not like they do this to anyone else really) by playing pranks on me (moving my food around) and making fun about me behind my back (these pranks and stuff are all nothing bad but just annoying and I feel a bit used as they’re all nice to me and like me 1 on 1 but when together they can be cunts to me)

Also the big problem I have with this is that due to a family death that happened a few years ago I was feeling really shitty for a few nights and didn’t come out to drink with them as I would usually, I then told them I was just going through some deep stuff and then a couple days later they returned to just playing these tiring silly pranks on me and taking the piss.

I’m not one to be overly sensitive or be hurt too easily by things like this but I just don’t really get why they’re all good friends and clearly like me but then when together as a group I’m mostly the one they take the piss out off and the only one they play pranks on.

It would be fine if they weren’t my flatmates or I could just go out or home a lot more but I really can’t as due to corona it’s tough to make loads of new friends I can start hanging out with more.",23Oct2020,1

He follows her in all social media platforms, news about her, remembers her birthdays, etc. What really hurt is that he could remember all these things about her when he doesn’t even find the time to get to know me better. He had a toe injury recently. I wasn’t allowed to go out but i still went to see him so that i could take care of him. But I saw his message with his friend telling him that ""name of celebrity crush"" was taking care of him. I feel really bad. All the efforts that i do for him, he just imagines me for another person. We were together but I felt like it was one sided love. Whenever i talk to him about it he brushes me off like it’s nothing. A lot of times he tells me i’m overreacting or worse, that i’m toxic, crazy, and obsessed.  All these things make me feel like maybe he just settled for me. We had a lot of fights about it. He told me he doesn’t feel anything about her but his actions tell me otherwise. There was also an issue about her and i saw the message he sent where it said “i’m so inlove with you” it hurt so much I don’t even want to think about it. Never once he told me he was inlove with me. Never once i felt like i’m the most beautiful girl around him. I always felt like there are a lot of things I don’t have and that I can’t give. Having celebrity crushes are okay. But I do believe there are boundaries. I know the fact that he loves me should be enough. But it somehow isn’t. He made it clear he will never give any of it up even though he loses me. I tried to give more attention to my looks, I tried things I never did before. But somehow he never notices the changes I made. I feel sad and angry at myself for being insecured about myself. I just want to be appreciated too like anyone else. I want to be adored and called pretty. I’m not his ideal type. But i do everything to make him think so. My best is somehow not enough for him. It’s about time to give up I guess. A lot of people have called me pretty before but it doesn’t really matter if I don’t hear it from him. He probably thinks I’m not worth his effort and time, I feel really bad for not being able to give the things he want. I’m in the point where I’m thinking of breaking up with him so that he could find a better partner for himself. He doesn’t deserve someone like me.",23Oct2020,1

73,"I still live with my parents and for the most part, I have to abide by their rules. they pay for my college, they pay for my medical. I'm still a dependent, mainly because I have autism and an ed. I'm slowly branching out and obtaining more and more independence. 

I finally got a job last August and I bought my own laptop for school and personal. I plan on moving out as soon as I finish my Bachelor's with the money I've saved up from my job. I thought about waiting until i move out to go to therapy so my parents wouldn't find out, but I cannot delay this any longer.

I am majorly depressed, my ed is getting worse, I feel so lonely, and i can't stand living with my family any more.

I've breached the subject of therapy with my parents many times over the years, and EVERY time, they fight back with excuses that I have them and therefore I don't need a therapist. here's a list of some of THEIR reasons that I don't need therapy.

\- I want a friend so bad I'm turning to therapy

\- I have my parents and several siblings to rely on

\- a therapist is only going to tell me what my parents would

\- i can talk to my parents if I need help

\- I'm ""healthy"" and ""mentally stable""

\- therapists are unreliable and useless

\- I won't find a therapist with the same religious beliefs that my family has and therefore, it's a gamble and most therapists are untrustworthy

\- the therapist might have a worldly/secular worldview

\- other family members have gone to therapy and it didn't work out and it was the therapist's fault

I found a therapist online that looks promising. she's had 22 years of experience and her price is affordable. but I don't want to spend my moving out money unless I have to. I know my insurance might pay for it, but that would require talking to my parents about it.

but I can't lie to my parents about where I am, they're too nosy and I have a decent relationship with them so it would kill me to lie. i love them too much.

I know I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions. I can take care of myself. I can go to therapy if I want to. but i'm so afraid of upsetting them and losing their respect or hurting them in any way.",23Oct2020,1

They said they do not because it is just a hobby for them, but they said they would sketch some things up for fun for me! I wasn’t necessarily planning or seeking a tattoo, but I have fallen in love with the initial sketch. Is it rude to ask this person if they would consider allowing someone to use the sketch? If not, how should I go about asking?

However, during our convo she told me she wasn’t looking for a relationship rn since she just broke up with her ex whom she had a 3-year relationship with. She tells me because she might be bi and that she had a crush on this girl, so she didn’t wanna catch feelings or pursue it since she was in a relationship. Eventually they broke up, and I think she still likes this girl but She doesn’t know if the girl likes her. So clearly my chances are low here. 

So my question is: is it worth to keep pursing? Should I keep my hopes up and see where the future takes us? I mean, we’re already talking to each other like we’ve been old friends for awhile, so I’ve got myself a friend at least.

(My mom wanted me to have a good relationship because she didn’t have a good relationship with her dad when she was my age and she knew how hard it was.) but as I got older I began to realize how narcissistic he was, he was always putting me down to put himself up, like saying u was manipulative, ungrateful, or a brat, or by saying my feelings such as sadness, anxiety, or my depression and adhd, were just lies is was told my my mom and therapist...

86,"This one is a little weird but stick with me. It’s gonna be kind of vague because I really don’t want this to be recognized seeing at the situation is pretty unique. Basically a very close friend of mine (21f) cut me (20f) out of her life about a year ago. We were both having a hard time and a lot of factors contributed to her cutting me out. Today she texted me and apologized. She said she is now on medication for mental health issues. I accepted her apology and offered one of my own. You see, one of the main reasons she stopped speaking was because she had repeatedly cheated on her boyfriend and I was hard on her about it. I don’t regret being harsh about what she did because it was wrong and she agrees. But the last time she cheated with her (now ex) boyfriend it was with someone she was related to. To be fair, they are distantly related but it is still biological and not just through marriage. Now, a year later, she says she is in a happy relationship with this person who she is related to. Honestly, I don’t care as much as I maybe should. The guy is a lot nicer than some of her past other boyfriend and she does have a good sense of humor about how weird the circumstances are. She’s had a lot of shitty relationships before including grown men who groomed her at a young age. I really do care about this friend and she seems a lot happier and healthier then when we last spoke. She was very relieved that I didn’t judge her relationship but my sister insists that I shouldn’t accept what she’s doing and that it’s unhealthy. What should I do?",23Oct2020,1

I made this username when I was 7 based on my love of Lego (which I don't collect anymore) and 2.

93,"So, probably going to be a long post. Basically, I was raised extremely sheltered and with pretty much no friends. For almost as long as I can remember I have felt extremely alone, which eventually led to a very long battle with depression. But besides being depressed, growing up sheltered and never experiencing anything kind of made me get very out of touch with my emotions and I have always struggled expressing myself emotionally. Or I would have/kinda still do have extreme mood swings without knowing why I feel the way I do.
But almost a year ago I met this girl online and we quickly became best friends and until yesterday we had talked pretty much all day every day since we became friends. But about 5 months ago we finally got to see each other in person and started dating. And then soon after, I flew half way across the country to spend 9 days with her. And this was my first time ever truly experiencing that kind of love and just a romantic/sexual connection with another person, and it made me so happy. I was the absolute happiest I have ever been in my life when I was with her. For once I finally had a real reason to live and something to work towards in life. But a few months after my trip/a few weeks ago, she said she wanted to take a break from the romantic stuff and just try again once we were in a better position to see each other more because her mental health wasn't very good and the stress of keeping things going long distance was making it worse. So we broke up but fully intended to get back together once I moved, which I was planning on doing in a few months. But really late on the night before last, she said she just isn't in a place where she can be thinking about a relationship and feels horrible for ""leading me on"" and said she thinks it's best to fully cut contact. Yesterday was the first time in almost a year she hasn't been a part of my daily life and I haven't been able to talk to her. After finally experiencing so much with her and just generally experiencing the world away from the place I have spent my whole life trapped, then to suddenly have all that ripped away from me and all the direction in my life to be gone now, it's like I'm finally truly experiencing all my emotions and I'm just so overwhelmed. I have been depressed before, but this feels different. I genuinely didn't know I could feel this sad about anything. It's inescapable. I feel so trapped, especially being stuck home after getting to do everything I did. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare and I have no idea how to get out. Now I dream about her and then wake up and suddenly realize she's not part of my life anymore and I have to try moving on from the girl that until recently was my whole world.

Maybe I'm being really overdramatic, but I guess I just needed to write it all and get that out there.

But basically, I feel like all direction in my life is gone. I feel like I am trapped. I have so many emotions and feelings that I have no idea what to do with. I just really need advice on how to stop feeling so hopeless and trapped and maybe some kind of outlet for my emotions.

I think one of the biggest factors that contributed to me bonding with him is that he reminds me a lot of my late father. It turns out that they actually worked together in the industry before my dad passed. Basically, this professor is just a crude version of my dad that I can talk shit with. I’ve had a class with him every semester for the past three years, but after last semester there were no more classes he taught that I hadn’t taken, so we haven’t met up much. I also worked as a typist for him, have been to his home for gatherings, and have been tended to his classes when he goes out of the country for vacation, so I’d say we’re pretty tight. 

Prof and his wife of over 20 years recently filed for divorce, and ever since then prof has been kind of weird with me. The first time I saw him when I returned to campus for the semester he told me about the divorce and expressed his frustrations with only having slept with two women in his whole life (both of his ex wives). He then offered to take me out to dinner. 

I haven’t seen much of prof since the beginning of the semester because of how hectic my class and work schedules have been, but after receiving an email from him regarding my schedule for next semester, I decided to text him and see how he has been. 

The conversation was normal until he offered to buy me dinner again. I didn’t want to be rude, and I genuinely have missed him, so I agreed. He seemed a bit too excited about this and said he’d been “craving ethnic.” He meant food, but it didn’t sit well with me. For context, I’m mixed race.

98,"Sorry if formatting sucks I'm typing on mobile.

First a little backstory.

My parents are kind of a mess. To sum it up quickly my mom has NPD (diagnosed) and my dad has very bad anger issues. They have been very abusive to me and my older sister, who I will call A, as we've grown up. A is the subject of this post.

My sister has asperger's, which means she is pretty socially awkward and doesn't like a lot of interaction. I love my sister with all of my heart and am very protective of her, even though she's older than me. She is 21 and I'm 16.  A always told me as we were growing up that she didn't ever see herself in a relationship as she's really awkward around people and has the mind of a twelve year old (her words not mine). When she was 14 she came out to my parents as a lesbian which, as you can imagine, was pretty hard for them to come to terms with. After all this time they are pretty supportive of her sexual orientation.

Okay just one more thing before we get into the story.

A has been studying Japanese since she was 12 and is completely fluent at this point in her life. She is studying Japanese at University currently and spent last year living in Japan. She promised my parents that when she graduated she would move to Japan and work there.

Okay here's the story.

This morning my sister texted me telling me that she has really big news and is scared to tell our parents. She asked me if she could tell me first for practice, and of course I accepted because I know how scary our parents can be. About an hour later she emailed me a word doc with a letter addressed to our parents. The letter explained that after College she wants to move to Australia and get married to A MAN that she has been secretly dating for over 7 YEARS. As you can imagine I was very very shocked. I called her and spoke to her for over 2 hours. She explained to me how they spent a month together when she was living in Japan and how she finally understood what love really feels like after spending time with him. I was very happy for her and told her so many times. She asked me for advice on what to do when she tells our parent and I felt like I couldn't give her good enough advice. So that's why I'm here.

Has anyone here ever had to drop a bomb this big on their parents? If so, what advice or tips do you wish you had had before doing so?

100,"Hi. I’m using a throwaway account here to remain anonymous, I heard this is a good place that offers help. I apologize if this is too long, you don’t have to read it. I’m not sure what to put for TL;DR so I’m sorry. 

Anyway. I [18F] need help trying to get away from my brother [13M], who is really abusive. I know this sounds silly, because I’m older than him. He’s about as tall as me but stronger than me. Anytime that he gets angry at me, he beats on me and throws things at me and destroys valuable things to me. He doesn’t only do this to me either, but my mom as well. My mom [45F] also has trouble trying to get him up to go to school. When she tries to, he calls her names and tries to fight her as well and even she can’t fight him back because he is stronger. Both me and her are scared that he will become truant and that she will go to jail. It’s so bad that we even have to watch what we say around him, or else he gets very physical with us.

All of us are currently staying at my cousins house because we just lost our home due to being evicted. We are also scared of losing our stuff we have put into storage in case of my mom having to go to jail over him becoming truant and not being able to pay on our storage unit. Also, I need help protecting my 3 dogs from him. Any chance he gets he will kick them and hurt them and try to throw them around (they are small jack russel/chihuahuas). They are like little babies to both me and my mom and we do all that we can to protect them, we don’t want to give them up. When my grandma was still alive, my brother acted this way towards her too. She had health problems, that’s why she is sadly no longer with us.

I have tried talking to my mom about this, but she tells me that there’s nothing I can do. I have tried calling the cops on him but when I have, she would take him in her car and leave. I have also tried showing them evidence of things before but they tell me to “take it up with the courts.” I have also suggested him going to a mental hospital, but when he comes back home he is still the same.

I’d also like to add on that, I cannot get my own place to live at the moment. Unfortunately I do not have a job, or any credit, not even a credit card or bank account at that, I do not have a car/license, and I do not know how to drive as I am still learning. Where I am staying at, there are also no places around that I can walk to and work at.

This has went on for so long and I am just at this point either done or ready to give up. I just want to be safe, and I want my mom and our dogs to be safe. I apologize if this is.... stupid or it sounds silly? I don’t know. But thank you for whoever does take the time to read this.",23Oct2020,1

Wondering if the community could help, as quite literally anybody could help me progress a step towards my scholarship.",23Oct2020,1
104,"So I've been working in ichd for around two years.  recently, I landed a job interview for in one of dialysis companies. One of our attending mds is a medical director there so he told me about the opening.

The first interview was via zoom with 4 interviewers. I had to use my nephews laptop and also never used zoom before. I was vigorously preparing for the interview, but never took a chance to figure out how zoom operates lol. So I went to my nephews zoom, connected to a meeting. and .. no video of me, only some silly pictures my nephew used. So I explained whats up to interviewers, I finally figured out how to switch video on and started interview. Interview was very light and kinda comfortable and lasted 1 hour, more than planned. The regional director also started talking (a lot) about the company and the things they offer to their employees and all. And that was that.

Coming this week I have another zoom interview with them + medical director (whom I know from my current job). And again - zoom- I opened the meeting and my video came out turned 90 degrees and with some strange roblox background lol. The interview was really short, the medical director said that he is very demanding about pt care and recommended me because I am always do what I am asked to (not verbatim but Smith of this sort). And no further questions to me, just a few words about the company and a job offer (yay?!)

I asked to come see the clinic and discuss few questions with regional director and nurse educator next week, so we arranged the time for that.

But now I am worried that I set up a bad first impression with all my zoom issues. And very nervous about that and whether I should take on an offer. I am not the ideal candidate, I've got a lot to learn but I also want to know that I won't be pushed around because of that and because of the first impression. 

What do you think about the whole experience?",23Oct2020,1

106," I'm 19F. I moved in with my dad &amp; brother when I was 15 after running away from my mom's house trying to commit suicide. 

When I moved in they noticed something drastic about me. I am not a clean person. Growing up with terrible anxiety - things being a mess has grown to be okay with me, because that's how my mind was - a mess. 

I do not pay any bills. Throughout the years we have gone back and forth about cleaning the house. I only do it when I'm asked to, or when I think to, or else I don't have a problem with the house being messy. 

He is upset and feels that since he and my brother are ""helping me"" by letting me live with them I should clean the house more.  I have no problem cleaning honestly it's just, I do not want to be a maid in order to ""earn my keep"". I would rather pay the bills/rent. 

He tells me no, he does not want money, he wants help around the house. I don't know if it's me being stubborn, but cleaning the house can just go fuck itself. 

I have 0 problem with moving out &amp; living by myself. Paying my own bills, etc. The only thing is, I just quit my full time job due to it forcing to be remote and am working a part time job. I am also going to college part time. 

I would just be scraping by with bills until I can get a new job that pays more, assuming full responsibility of bills.

I'm really just hoping from a 3rd view on this. Am I acting too spoiled? Am I really in a great position and I should just suck it up and clean the fucking house? Advice please? ;(",23Oct2020,1

108,"Almost every morning, I wake up from my sleep because of my Indian neighbors next door talking. It sounds like they're shouting! I can hear their conversation so clearly that if I record the sounds from my phone, you can hear them speaking their language. Their voices are even louder when they are on phone, and they speak on their phone for a long time! So in the end, I hear their conversation for the whole day. Not want to be racist or anything, but I don't like how their language sounds anymore, probably because my long sleep on weekends is ruined because of them. My neighbor is great, but I hate how they speak unnecessarily loud all the time. Like, I don't need to hear your conversation I can't understand! Sometimes, I can even hear their child having an online class, and I can hear her teacher talking.  Or on weekends, they watch movies and they turn it up super loud! (That also applies to my other neighbor, but thankfully both of them don't do it late at night so I am quite okay with that)

They are great, but I want to say that they speak way too loud and maybe tone down their voice. Is there any way to deal with them without speaking to them directly or something I can do?",23Oct2020,1
109,"I (20M) am a college junior majoring in computer science (meaning I have less than 2 years left before graduating college) and thanks to the quarantine, I have become very scared of the likelyhood of never being able to talk to attractive women ever again, because I will never be extremely rich enough to be able to talk to attractive women. And from what I heard, the quarantine could last up to 2022 (the year I graduate college) so I am even more scared about it. 

I was looking up what the age was that women who aren't rich (and I specifically said women who aren't rich because I know for a fact that I will never be wealthy enough to be able to talk to wealthy women) become uglier, and unfortunately, the most common answer range was between 23 and 25 (around typical college graduation age) with it being compounded by the statement that there are absolutely zero attractive women who aren't rich in the post-college world, meaning that I don't have much time left. So I also decided to look up how life after college was for men who aren't rich or handsome, and the vast majority of the answers said that it was  so boring, full of responsibilities, and devoid of any fun, friends, or attractive women, that it has essentially become a living hell for them.

I was panicking a lot ever since I found out about the reality of life after college, because I'm so afraid I will never have a chance to have any fun with friends nor talk to attractive women ever again. I have tried nearly everything I could prior to quarantine (including working out for muscles since I am technically of healthy weight, extreme skin care, and dating apps) but to no avail. 

The consensuses on the internet that there are no attractive women who aren't rich after graduating college and that life after college for men who aren't rich is bound to be hell on Earth scares me extremely about the future. I wish there was a way I could talk to attractive women online without paying them for the chance at talking to them, because since I know I'll never be rich, I will never be able to talk to attractive women in the post-college world.",23Oct2020,1
110,"This person was like a brother to me. I've been living with him for roughly 2 years, and I would have done a lot of things for him. The three of us got a home because we enjoyed living with each other. In the past, the three of us would have so much fun. But one day he went berserk. 

He likes to keep the the house spotless clean. In the past, he wasn't a clean freak. His girlfriend has OCD and she feels uncomfortable when the house is messy. So I've been the only one cleaning the house for his girlfriend whenever she came because I respected him as a friend. One day, his girlfriend came and saw a mess but he didn't tell us that she was going to stay. I'm not a clean person at all. I'll do it if required, but it's not in my personality to be spotless clean. Of course, I've left some stains behind occasionally, but I tried my best to meet his needs. 

It's been about a year later. Now, I come home and he's yelling and blaming me for not keeping the house clean...even though he hasn't done any cleaning for the past few months. When I confronted him about it, he said that he was testing me/us. His justification for not cleaning was to test our cleaning abilities and flipped out when there were some items on the coffee table (mug, coaster, marker, parchment paper) and some stains on the ledge of the fridge. Then, he said that it was just one of the many examples. Issue is that I KNOW that we've been keeping the house clean - not spotless - and he refuses to tell me. Instead, he just mentions, ""You're an adult and should recognize things past what your eye sees. "" I constantly asked him where in the house was filthy but he refuses to inform me and continued to yell. 

He claims that I always cleaned after he did, when I know is false because he just admitted to saying that he hasn't been cleaning. All the furniture and decorations in the house belonged to him, and he claims that we haven't been taking care of it. 

He states that he doesn't feel sorry for his need to be overly clean...even though he doesn't have OCD and he wasn't at all clean in the past. I know that it's because of his girlfriend, because that was the whole premise of his entire rant ""My girlfriend doesn't want to come because of how messy you guys are"". Later, I texted him saying that I wasn't responsible for making his girlfriend happy and if anything, it's his responsibility to keep her happy, not me. Told him that she was an amazing person and that I'm glad they're together, but I wasn't going to villainized because I didn't clean the entire first floor for her. 

Now, he says that we're no longer friends (I'm pretty sure it's because what I said) and postponed the discussion. He didn't feel the need to explain himself afterwards. He's contemplating about moving out and I hope that he's willing to pay till spring. Like an idiot, I didn't make them sign a roommate agreement because I trusted them so much. He's a smart guy, so I'm hoping that he's willing to negotiate. 

This whole situation is new to me so I could really use some advice on how to proceed from here. Also, was I insensitive? An honest perspective would be greatly appreciated as well. Thank you!",23Oct2020,1

116,"I want to know what to do until I’m fixed and how to stay positive about the following predicament

2 months ago, on 8/27, I tore a tendon in my wrist. I did not find out about my exact diagnosis until a week ago. I went to an urgent care center three days after I started to hurt (I never fell, I have no idea how I injured myself). They took an X-ray and said nothing was broken and gave me a wrist splint. This splint prevented me from bending my wrist, but the pain in my arm presents itself when I rotate my forearm, like turning your palm face down to face up. The brace they gave me did not prevent this action.

I saw an orthopedist on 9/10 and she took another set of X-rays that came back fine. I asked her to schedule an MRI because I *knew* it had to be something in my muscles. I did not get that MRI until 10/15. In between that time, on 9/21, I saw a neurologist. I told him what was wrong and he suggested a brace to keep my arm straight. He didn’t even give it to me, he just shoved my wrist brace up to my elbow. This helped, but I later found out that the only reason it helped was because I could no longer use my right hand to do things. I stopped using the elbow brace after my MRI, where I was told there was something wrong with my wrist. I was only told it could possibly be a cyst, something torn, or something else. When I stopped using my wrist, it stopped hurting. 

Finally, on 10/19, my MRI results were looked at by my orthopedist. This is only because of a cancellation. If not for the cancellation, I would’ve had to wait until 10/23. She said I had torn something, and that she would call a surgeon to schedule a consult. That consult was not supposed to be until 11/6, but I managed to get an appointment with someone else on 10/29. 

My left wrist is hurting now from overcompensation and there’s nothing I can do to occupy my time. As I type this, it has been 56 days since my injury and I have not been properly treated. As I wait to just talk to the surgeon, the damage to my arm could become irreversible and I could be in chronic pain for the rest of my life. If this had been a broken bone, it would’ve been fixed on day one. But since I tore my tendon enough for it to *dislocate* when I turn my arm, I have to wait months for it to be fixed. I’m scared, I don’t want to live the rest of my life with chronic pain in my arm just because I have to wait this long for it to be fixed. I live in America and am very thankful to have insurance to cover the surgery. I shouldn’t have to wait this long, it’s not brain surgery.

TL;DR: My wrist/ forearm is injured and I’ve had to wait two months (so far) in order for it to be fixed. I hate the American health system",23Oct2020,1

I don't have him for any classes this year, but I still go in to chat or visit every now and then, but I feel like he's changed. Even when I was in class, he was always just gone or preoccupied with someone or something else; it just never felt like he was really there, or truly cared like it seemed as though he used to- and now more than ever, it feels like he doesn't care as much anymore. This isn't really something that should concern me, but I genuinely look up to him more than anyone else in the world and I know that a lot of kids, myself included, just need someone to look up to like that. I know that it's a selfish thing to expect, because it's not his job to do that- but I know that a lot of kids look up to him, and sometimes when I go to his door in the morning or at lunch after a long day just to talk for a minute or smile and say hi, it's locked and empty because he's not there like he used to be- and that's when it hurts.

126,"It’s been about two months since my boyfriend almost died. While I wasn’t there when it happened, every day I still relive those phone calls from his friends and family, the absolute fear and confusion I felt, the way I could barely even recognize his face the first time I saw it, visiting him in the hospital and watching him cry and be a shell of himself, and everything else that happened during his recovery. 
Being faced with his morality really fucked me up. I’m obviously doing better now but I still don’t think I’m fully ok. I don’t let myself admit that often. I feel like I can’t talk to him about it because I don’t want to trigger his own feelings about the event, especially since all the meds he was on means he doesn’t have quite the same recollection of the whole thing as I do. But those memories stay with me. 
Along with reliving it, almost every day I force myself to imagine his death and mourn it, as if I’m preparing for it to actually happen. If he doesn’t respond to a text quickly, I start vividly envisioning the next “he’s not ok” phone call I’ll get, imagining his funeral, imagining myself crying and trying to cope with the loss. I’ll listen to sad music on purpose to get that feeling of painful emptiness and I’ll create scenes in my head that go along with it.
To an extent these thoughts are intrusive, but part of me feels the need to indulge in them, even if it’s really bad for me. I guess this is my way of preparing for what feels like the inevitable. It’s like there’s this constant conflict in my head between the logical side of myself that knows I’m being unrealistic, and the vulnerable/hurt part of myself that just can’t bear to deal with the shock of an unexpected almost-death again. I wish I could deal with this in a healthier way or something? It’s really difficult to keep going like this.",23Oct2020,1

ok so i[14f] have been struggling with my eating habits lately. I don't want to call it an eating disorder bc it's not too bad and I don't wanna self diagnose but I've been skipping meals, eating less, your standard teenage eating issues. I haven't lost any weight tho so idk if it's a problem

I eat breakfast and dinner with my family so I can't do much but limit my portion size but since I eat lunch at school i can not eat most of it. my parents pack my lunch which ig is kinda childish but they insist bc they want me to eat healthy. So everyday I come to school with a sandwich, some chips, a granola bar and some fruit. 

I never eat it all but I don't like wasting food. I can't keep the sandwich cause I'm never gonna eat it. So when I get home I either throw it out or feed half of it to the dog and gut down the other half. Stuff like an Apple or granola bar I just put back and no one notices.

Background: I meet my current friend group online about a year and half ago. At this point we’re all pretty close with each other and chat everyday despite our distances. I (19F) recently have been getting along very well with this guy (22M) in my friend group. We are both in similar points in our lives aka college students growing into independence, work well with each other, and make an effort to learn about each other’s silly interests/partake in them. He has seen me go through ups and downs in my life and always was around to support me just like I have with him. I really do consider him to be a great friend who I want to meet one day outside of video calls/texts. 

Problem: I really want to keep things platonic, but I just feel like with how well things are going that this means something. Like maybe this is the person for me and if that’s true then I would be missing out on the big opportunity if I didn’t bump us up in our relationship. I mean he is attractive, has solid plans for his future, is educated, and is very respectful which are the kind of traits in a boyfriend that my family constantly uphold as gold standard. Even if it’s long distance we could probably put something together because he’s dated long-distance before. However despite all of this and basically everything telling me that this is it, I don’t want to commit. It’s like if I do, I don’t think I could ever love him like I’m suppose to or expected to do so. I don’t know if I can picture myself even doing anything more romantic with him besides hugging or a peck on the cheek. 

It’s like being in high school all over again where every time I would get along with guys I would finding myself expected to eventually date them to the point where I myself would wait for romantic feelings to come, but they never do! I am this close to just tossing aside anything to do with love and be single forever because it would be so much easier. Yet here I am still with a desire to have a relationship with someone and hopefully gain those feelings, but I don’t want to be selfish and risk hurting my friend just for me to figure myself out. Losing our friendship would definitely crush me. So essentially, what should I do about this? Because for once I really don’t have a clue on what the answer is.",23Oct2020,1

Now she’s come over 2-4 times, and I’ve been to her place around the same amount and it was late like 8 or later, and she’d  sit at the end of the couch, kind’ve shy, and we’d just kick it watch netflix and shit. I haven’t made  a move, well because nothing is worse then making a move and getting shut down, its just awkward after, you know. I don’t know she’s casting a hard vibe to read when we hang out.

141,"I am recently divorced and I met this girl(25), she is an absolute bombshell of a woman. Everything about her drives me crazy in a good way. I’m so scared of fucking it up, or becoming to emotionally attached so I feel like there are parts of myself that I’m hiding or not showing. I want nothing more than to show this woman that I care about her and want to be with her. Why am I so scared, or nervous of opening myself up and being vulnerable? 

Back story: I got married in 2017 to the woman I thought I would be with for the rest of my life. I’m in the military and it’s struggle to always be there when I need to be. She cheated on me, and I forgave her. Then she cheated again the day after I took her out for her birthday. Invited me to the hotel room she cheated on me in and never told me a word. She was acting weird and I decided to look at her phone discovering things had been happening for awhile. So I decided I couldn’t be with her or trust her anymore. So we got divorced, I downloaded tinder and was being alittle bit of a man whore until I met her( new lady friend) we have begun to get serious and she’s a travel nurse and I’m in the military.

I’m very anxious about putting on my “big boy” pants and being the confident and charming person my girlfriend tells me I am. I know everything is worse in my head than in reality but my body feels extremely anxious and that travels to my brain. 

I feel like I’m juggling too much at once to handle anything in particular. Between adhd, clinical depression, and some other illnesses I don’t have the money to be properly diagnosed with, I feel stuck in my brain. I always feel a somber sadness inside of me but sometimes I can accept that and I feel much better. Other times my brain fights me and tells me that “You have to be happy or life isn’t worth living!” and that’s just not realistic for myself, or anyone else. I just want to be content. I can enjoy life without being happy all the time. 

It just feels like every category in my life is in a bad state. I know it’s all about how you frame things in your mind but why frame a picture you can’t see? Im afraid my brain has made neural connections that are so difficult to break, that I may not realistically be able to break them.

The job itself is pretty demanding...imo, they need to hire at least one more person for that department to make it manageable.

Anyway, with all that in mind, how do I quit my job the right way? I've never had to quit a job before, so I've been thinking quite a bit about it. If I leave, the workload will probably get a lot heavier for my team, but they won't get paid any more than they already are, so I feel a little guilty.

She said I was her first choice, but our cousin really has her heart set on it. I told her it was okay, as I didn't want to stir up any trouble or come across as petty.

However, a few minutes after that conversation, I got to thinking. Our cousin has three siblings. She's already been a bridesmaid at both of her brothers' weddings, and she'll more than likely be the maid of honor if her younger sister ever gets married. 

My sister is my one and only sibling. This is my first time being anyone's bridesmaid, and probably the only chance I'll have to be someone's maid of honor. I'm not sure I want to just give that up.

I called my sister back and asked her if I could have some more time to think about it. She said that was fine, and she still has awhile until she has to know for sure.

Like no that isn't how it works, this is how I feel no matter if you feel it or not and telling me not to stress out so much and to calm down isn't going to make it easier for me, in fact it is very offensive because you're being insensitive about how I feel and don't seem to care that I feel this way.

Here's the problem. 2 weeks ago, her brother, a missionary, &amp; his wife ran into me &amp; my husband at dinner. Her brother's fiancee straight up asked where my husband was from. He's Indian &amp; has an accent. He replied with New Delhi. His wife asked us what our religion was. I told her that we are Sikhs. She went off &amp; started telling us how our religion was wrong in the middle of the restaurant. Sarah's brother was clearly uncomfortable, but he did not do nor say anything.
It was so uncomfortable &amp; I felt like we (mostly hubby) were targeted because we are brown.

But I have this one friend who is very clingy and I don’t know how to stop this situation.

Everyday she’ll constantly texts me asking me to hangout. I don’t. I tell her no constantly all the time but she won’t stop. We used to hangout a lot in the past but I’m over that now. I want my space. I’ve repeatedly told her that I like my space/doing things alone and to not take it personally. She’ll tell me she understands (like always) but I guess it never really registers with her because she’ll keep asking everyday until I say yes. It’s gotten to the point where I’ll slowly text her or avoid texting her at all because once I start a conversation with her she’ll ask ‘wyd’ just to come hang out with her and when I tell her ‘No’ to hanging out , she’ll catch an attitude and ignore me for hours. It’s annoying and It hurts because I do enjoy her personality but I don’t want to always be around her anymore. I like to be alone and I honestly don’t find nothing wrong with that.

We just moved in with each other in September, and there was the expectation before hand that there wouldn’t be guests over often as we live in metro Boston and cases haven’t really ever gone away here. I informed them that I’m at moderate risk for complications from COVID if I catch it, I have asthma that gets worse with colds and in the winter months, as well as having older parents one of which who is high risk. They said they understood my concern and would be careful, and I said I would be alright with them having people over occasionally.

In September they had guests over, three times, twice with one staying the night. This month they’ve had guests over five different times, again with a guest staying over.

This evening I mentioned to one roommate that if cases continue to rise in our area and with flu season coming we’re probably gonna have to cut down on the number of guests we have over and how often. Because exposure. She said that would be something we’d have to negotiate, because it’s not easy for everyone’s mental health to just give up their social lives.

I’m feeling really unheard here. I’ve asked them to use an industrial health care cleaner my dad was able to get from a neighbor after their friends are over and I’ve never seen them pick it up. I’ve told them about my friend who is a chaplain in a nursing home and had to be the only person there while 32 people she cared for died preventable deaths.

It was so random because I forgot scp even existed. The scp was in this house where me and family were staying at and he was just somewhere in the house waiting for someone to look at him so he can attack. The house seemed like a vacation home and it to be honest it was pretty comfy. Then out of no where, my dad looked at the thing and he came out and attacked all of us. Me and my family were just dead on the ground. A few seconds later we were back alive like nothing even happened. The scp though was in the kitchen and the kitchen was very close to the living room where my family was talking and laughing and having a great time. I was in another room next to the living room when I walked into this other room where I just became nauseous and got a massive headache. I could feel the headache it wasn’t in the dream my head was hurting like hell when I woke up. Later when I went back to sleep because it was too early to do anything I came across the same dream. It just picked up where it ended. This part I couldn’t remember that much it’s just fuzzy. I just remember yelling at my mom to not open the kitchen door. She had a smirk on her face a menacing smirk and she looked like she was about to open it. This is where I woke up for real this time, I couldn’t go back to sleep no matter how much I tried.

My boss works really hard and was telling me today how hard it is to find reliable employees and that she was grateful the team now is reliable and opened up to me about work and all that.

Here's where I need advice: Everyone except the manager and 2IC is casual. Not only are we casual but we get 6 weeks off around Christmas, unpaid and the hours are pretty unreliable for the rest of the year. It's not that I get no work, but I may only get 15 hours one week or 10 hours then the next week I get 40.

161,"Hi, all! I just came across this sub, which is fantastic, because there's something I've been deliberating for a few months now. I'm using a throwaway since a relative knows my OG reddit account. This is going to be a bit long, so bear with me on this - 

For a bit of a background - I went to an early college high school (a high school program where you get an associate's degree and a high school diploma at the same time) and graduated, but I ended up going back to community college to get a few extra classes so that I can switch, only to switch to something else before my first class started at the insistence of my parents, who coerced me to try nursing. Ended up failing my classes, including college algebra (which I took around two or three times before finally passing). Eventually switched to education, and I'm almost finished with my requirements. If I manage to do things the right way and pass, I might be able to transfer to uni by the end of the summer semester so I can start in the fall.

However, staying under the same roof as my parents, particularly during the pandemic, I've had a lot of time to think. About what I want for myself, and for my future.

Ever since I was young, I've had very immersive daydreams. Daydreams that feel like a novel plot, with lots of characters and villains and such. It wasn't until around my junior year in high school that I learned that there was a term for what I had - maladaptive daydreaming. However, recently, after looking into this some more, I've begun to realize that my daydreaming was likely connected to undiagnosed ADHD (which would explain a lot - my social awkwardness, the fact that I hyperfixate on things a lot, the fact that I get distracted super easily along with my habit of spacing out very frequently, and constant procrastination, among other things). The problem is that my parents have never been too keen on the idea of therapy (and have scolded me multiple times for trying to consider that option when I bring it up with them in spite of the fact that they constantly scold me for doing the things mentioned above and have said very hurtful things to me in the past about those habits). 

Would therapy really help? While there have definitely been a lot of abusive ones out there, I feel like it's worth a shot anyways because I've tried fixing it myself and it never works out.

As a result, I've ultimately decided that as much as I love my parents and my siblings, I can't live under the same roof with them. I feel like my parents have been hindering my growth because they've been too overprotective of me (though part of that may have been because I've always been passive and never really took action, and I honestly should have been more proactive). I feel like the best way to do this is to move out of the house (like moving to a university with dorms and just living there).

The problem is, I'm very concerned about COVID, and the way universities have been treating COVID. I know getting an apartment to myself on campus might be possible, but even then, I doubt that that's a guarantee that I won't get the virus. Both my parents work in hospitals, and my father is diabetic and has Hepatitis B which makes him more susceptible to COVID. I don't want to get either of them infected.

Another thing is, while I did want to be a teacher initially, after seeing how my state's government has been treating teachers during the pandemic, I've ultimately decided against it. Maybe I will take up teaching at some point in the future, but the profession seems hellish right now, particularly in my state. I went into my degree hoping to teach computer science, though I've decided to change that to actually getting a degree in computer science, which was what I initially wanted to do before I switched to nursing. My parents have also been against the idea of student loans, so I'm trying to find scholarships. I'm also currently trying to learn web development so that I can stay ahead of the game and maybe use it to earn some money making apps or something like that.

On the good side, I've managed to snag a seasonal job at a nearby mall so that I can save money, and I've managed to find support in my younger brother, who has been supportive of me going to uni since he feels like I'll do better somewhere else instead of at home. But still, I feel uncertain about where life is heading and I don't know what I should do. I really don't know where to go from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm a college student that is in need of a therapist and I'm trying to take steps to get out of my parent's house so that I can grow on my own, but I don't know what to do now because of COVID. Unsure of where to go next. Any advice on what I can do from here or possible alternatives?",23Oct2020,1

Everyone tries to earn the most they can because its essentially a competition - no one needs millions/billions to survive but if you are born/raised competitive (like I am) and want to leave a legacy to say ""Thats what I did with my life"" like an athlete or CEO does. 

If i hopefully get one of these jobs once i get the balls to finish the application, i cant see myself reaching the heights that would satisfy me.

172,"I don’t know what to do. This has been going on for a year and a half. He isn’t physically abusive.. but he is mentally abusive and terrible. I’m pretty sure he’s a narcissist. He’s 19 and dating a 16-17 year old girl that also has narcissistic parents.. so naturally she just lets him abuse and use her. I chaperones a homecoming dance this last weekend. He took her after she begged him and then refused to dance with her. She left crying with him. He didn’t care. She comes over, he ignores her and plays video games or invites his friends over and leaves her alone in his room. When she needs to talk to someone, he isn’t there for her. He talks sh*t about her to his friends. Calls her crazy and emotional (he talks about everyone to everyone. He’s too faced). At his graduation party, he ignored her the whole time. I had to take her home and she cried the whole way. I told her to break up with him but she WON’T. This is my own blood and I can’t stand how he treats her. He’s just mean and uncaring. She makes him food, buys him clothes with the little money she has and he sticks his nose up and won’t say thank you or anything. I don’t even know why they’re in a relationship. And I’m stuck in the middle. She texts me and complains to me all the time but refuses to take my advice (LEAVE HIM). I have even tried talking to him. He shuts me down just like he does with her and tells me that “it isn’t your business”. It is when I have to drive a crying girl home all the time and be there for her hand HE ISNT. This relationship is taking a toll on ME. it’s so damn toxic that it’s hurting me!! What the hell am I supposed to do? This is insanity. Help.",23Oct2020,1
173,"I was just mulling over this recently, I [20F] find myself strangely attracted to villain characters in shows and movies. And I don't just mean the average - Jareth or - the Joker. No I mean real fucked up people. Mass murderers, rapists, serial killers, demons, monsters ect. 
Even if I'm not physically attracted to them just the thought that they're that fucked up gets me going. I had some issues when I was younger. Abuse. Psychological, physical. From end of elementary I was in intensive therapy for wanting to hurt kids. Even sent 2 to the hospital (choking with a scarf, and the other was jumping on his back profusely and stomping his head into the ground) either way. Fucked up shit. It got better but towards middle of hs it picked up again and I started fantasizing about murder and suicide. Was diagnosed BPD and manicdepressive.
About a 6 months ago I was pretty much cleared of these diagnoses; or more so wasn't required to go to therapy anymore as they had settled. I'm just concerned I might be relapsing. Wheres the line ya know? 

Either way, I can't tell if this is a relapse or not. Rebellious attraction towards evil characters isn't uncommon. Just rather safe than sorry ya know? I wanted a neutral opinion",23Oct2020,1
174,"My husband (40M) started at a new job about a year ago and very quickly realized that his co-worker and his boss don’t get along. They are always pitting people against the other and hardly ever agree on anything. There have even been slammed doors, walking out of meetings, and threats over job security. For the most part my husband was able to keep neutral and keep to his work, but over the last couple of months his co-worker started to strike up a friendship with him, and my husband sort of relaxed into it. 

Before long, they were venting to each other about their days, and my husband felt he had someone who understood what he was dealing with when he had a bad day, and well... he ended up saying (through text messaging) a couple of not very nice things about their boss after one particularly hard day. He said he got it off his chest and felt better and forgot about it. The co-worker not only kept those texts, but made an entry about them in his notebook. 

Fast forward to Monday this week, and the co-worker tipped him off that if their boss seemed to be in a bad mood it was because the boss found his notebook where the co-worker was keeping track of their venting sessions including what was said and when. The boss doesn’t know he was seen perusing the notebook... the co-worker was on his way back into his office when he saw his boss sitting at his desk with the notebook. He said he froze and didn’t know what to do so he waited down the hall until his boss went back to his own office. 

The co-worker apologized for not telling my husband what he was doing, but said when the boss started threatening his job, he felt he had to keep track that he wasn’t the only one who was disgruntled and he wanted someone in his corner if things took a turn. 

Now, they are unionized so he knows he can’t be fired for venting, but his boss has been on the warpath all week, looking for reasons to write them up on petty mistakes. My husband feels he is trying to build a case to fire them. 

Is there anything he can do? He feels sick over it because he actually really likes his job and doesn’t have any ill will towards his boss. He was just venting about his bad days, as we all do. I don’t know how I can help him to calm down. It seems that nothing I say reassures him, and I was hoping someone here might have some advice?

175,"Basically I wanna call the cops tonight, and I'd say exactly this:

""hey I'm stayin with my friend right now, he's spent days now screaming and breaking stuff around the house and cutting himself and tried to kill himself on the highway earlier today""

Which is ENTIRELY true. He tried swinging on his dad when his dad first got home and kept screaming rapist. His dad had to call the cops twice today, and both times my friend ran from them and hid. Forced me to not let em inside the house this morning. After he ran out on the highway stopping traffic he ran away for a couple hours cuz he knew his dad called the cops.

I'm only staying here bc I have recently became homeless and I've just been here a couple weeks and am trying to figure out a healthier place to stay at while I try getting a job and getting on my feet.

Anyway, I wouldn't call the cops expecting them to send him to jail. I'd expect them to send him to a suicide ward for 4-5 days minimum. He NEEDS the help. He's gone off the deep end for real. Screaming endlessly for days now, breaking shit all around the house (which has given me numerous anxiety attacks now) and his dad bought a night at a motel just to not be here tonight.

He'd probably view it as me betraying him but seriously it's gone wayyyy past the point of things being ""okay"" and he has fresh cuts on both his arms. He said he tried cutting off his penis earlier?????

Am I in the wrong for wanting to call 911 to help him get to a safe place??? He's NOT okay. And I CANNOT put up with this shit while I'm recovering from my traumas, addiction, and rock bottom. He needs help but he refuses to ever get it. Even running from the cops...",23Oct2020,1
176,"Nothing in my life seems right. I (M17) have anxiety, PTSD from past childhood trauma and also current trauma, I hate myself and the things I do and have done. I hate my life. I hate everything about it. 

My appearance is horrible. Ok its not horrible but there’s so much wrong with it that I want to fix but don’t have the motivation to or physical cannot fix. My face is asymmetrical. I like one half of my entire body better than the other half lmao. My eyes aren’t symmetrical, my nose is too big, I can barely move my face that much to express myself idk? 

I like my eyes by themselves but together? They’re too different. I hate it. One of my ears is bigger than the other? Not a lot bigger but enough for me to notice. I’m skinny, probably underweight but too scared to work out. My hair is long and although I like it most days and don’t want to change it, the reason I’ve kept it long for so many years is because I’m so fucking terrified of change. I’m terrified of how people react. Of what people will say. It doesn’t matter what the change is, whether they like it or not I hate people focusing on me. 

My hairline is fucked up I think. It’s not a good shape at all but it’s easy to cover up and hide but I want more than that I jsut can’t afford it. 

My family situations are awful. My mum is emotionally and verbally abused by my brother who has OCD and autism. Growing up I was horrible to him and blame myself for how bad he’s gotten. My whole life I’ve been told to shut up and to be quiet and to not interrupt him to the point where I can’t even scream someone’s name anymore. I try to raise my voice so much but I just can’t seem to do it. People now complain that I speak too softly. 

Anytime I hear a yell or a scream I panic and get reminded of my brother screaming at my mum and making her cry and him sobbing and hitting himself. Anytime I’m laying in bed in silence I think I hear shouting and when I go to listen I find out everyone’s asleep. I feel so ducking helpless. 

I put myself out there to help my friends and tell them it’s okay for them to dump their shit on me because I understand people need someone to listen and I want to be that person but it’s so fucking hard. I’m so exhausted of helping people. 

I’m also bisexual which adds a whole lot of other problems to my life. People mock me. People give me looks. They hate me because I don’t speak to them when in reality I’m jsut terrified. When I speak to new people I really do try but even with my friends when all their attention goes on me, when a room is quiet and the way not voice heard is mine I panic. I slur my words and rush thru my sentences to get it done. The pressure is too much. 

I have no skills. No special or unique talents. I’m just there. Just existing but idk what for. The only good I do is helping my friends and I don’t want to do that. I want to do more but I’m so fucking scared of change. So fucking scared to just put myself out there. 

I also have recently found out that I need to decide if I want surgery that could make me infertile and in lifelong pain. Not getting the surgery can also mean I end up infertile and in constant pain. 

Any girl I’ve ever been interested in has completely lost interest or left me when they find out I’m bisexual because they can’t stand the thought that I might get with a man after we break up. 

I know I’m just feeling sorry for myself but I rlly can’t do it anymore and I have no one to talk to. I  want to just end things but I’m so fucking shitty that I can’t even end things. I think about others too much. Think about their feelings too much and I hate it. I want to stop caring but at the same time I love that part of me. I love how open minded I am, I love how much I care for people. But it brings me down so much because I don’t care about myself. I know others do. My friends love me. My family loves me. I feel that love but it’s not enough. I want more but I can’t get more. 

I’m sorry this was long, and ik people won’t read this but if you do thank you? Lol. Idk. I guess me doing this is hoping some fucking magic happens and all my problems go away but ik that’s not how it works. I need to work and put in some fucking effort to make things better but I can’t bring myself to do it. Sometimes I get really close and then I just shut down. I get flooded with memories and thoughts of all the horrible shit that’s happened and all the horrible shit I’ve done. 

I’m sorry again.",23Oct2020,1
177,"TLDR; My work ethic has always been a point of pride and it’s starting to tank from burnout. What do. 

I’m 23 and have been working since I was about 14, working cutting grass with my dad. Dropped out at 17 to work full time and have had two jobs consistently since then. I worked cutting grass with my dad until he moved, I bought a portion of his business when I was 20. 

On the days I’m not cutting, I have a second job. I usually end up in food service. Delivered pizza, ran shifts, cooked in restaurants, things like that. 

I usually allow myself 1-2 days off and take a weekend to myself once in a blue moon if family or friends have something going on. 

Recently (about three months ago) I got out of a toxic toxic kitchen and took up a new line of work at a plant nursery that my friends parents own. Thought it’d be a good change of pace and would help compliment my lawn maintenance business. 

But really it’s just... disheartening. It’s just as toxic as the kitchen I left. Alleviated somewhat by the fact it’s not directed at me but everyone’s sexist, racist and just miserable. Owners included. And while I haven’t talked with my friend about it, it’s straining our friendship on my end because he just seems okay with that environment. I’m not. 

On top of that I feel underpaid and under appreciated. It makes me not want to work. And I’ve always been a hard worker. I pride myself on it. I take SO much pride in the fact that I learned how to work hard from a young age. 

You know I’ve never called out sick? I’m almost positive I had COVID earlier in the year. But when my boss told me he needed me to come in, what did I do? Came in.  That’s been the story ever since my first job. 

Today, I went home early per my request because for whatever reason my stomach is in knots. I think it’s food poisoning. Probably something I could’ve toughed out. But I just... didn’t want to. The mental strain and my stomach acting up, I just tapped out. 

I realize the nursery isn’t for me. So I’m looking for jobs online with my day to myself and I’m realizing... there’s nothing I want. Do I want to work and earn my keep, provide for me and my girl? Absolutely. But the jobs around me? I’m just not interested. None are anything to better myself. It’s more of the same. And it’s fucking depressing. I just want a job that doesn’t make me miserable. I don’t expect to be glowing and happy to go to work everyday. But I’d like my work to not beat me and my mental health into the ground. 

I know there’s no magic answer to solve this, I’m just putting my thoughts somewhere. Anything helps. Thanks.",23Oct2020,1

179,"Tl dr at bottom 

So I have college tomorrow and I can't fall asleep because I have taken 400 mg of modifinil. My head feels awake, but my body feels dried out and my resting heartbeat is around 90-100. Wich isn't too crazy, but it hasnt gone down lower than 87,wich is a bit worrying. I don't feel in danger, but I am starting to worry about my health. 

I never had these symptoms at 200 mg, 

Should I wait it out? Or should I do something about it? Ehat should I do? 




Here is a bit of context about how it happend:
I wasn't sure if I took my pill yesterday, because I number the strips on my pills to figure out wich one to take. I tend to be unfocused in the morning and I had a brainfart and took a second pill not realizing I already took one before brushing my teeth. I forgot to check the date on the strips, because I was in this morning routine zone.

So context
I have a tendency to be a everyone’s go to for emotional support. Venting, ranting, in a crisis etc etc I always do my best to try and help people however I can. I’m not a professional and I never claim to be. Any advice I give is always encouragement to see a therapist or the hotline or just offering to sit with them until a crisis passes.

I, myself, struggle with mental illness. I see a therapist and while I don’t know exactly how others feel, I know the pain I go through and don’t want people to go through that. So I do what I can. Especially for friends. 

But the issue I’ve run into is that every time i become close with someone, they start to become suicidal. This has happened multiple times with multiple people. I’ve gotten very good at talking people down over the years... however, when they start to feel better, these people I thought were my friends forget I exist. Some just say I’m easy to forget about and others I’m not sure, but I have started to talk to few as acquaintances. And that’s all fine and dandy people grow apart so such and whatever

But there’s one person...
Me and this person became very close. We would talk everyday online for hours. We’d play games, help each other with course work etc. but they started to hurt themselves... I was the only one in our friend group that noticed and I confronted them about it. And since then they would come to me for emotional help... but they got to the point of suicidal ideation. Multiple times a week I would sit with them, talk to them, encourage them and try to build them up. It worked for awhile but they just kept getting worse and I encouraged them to see a professional, even giving them resources for cheap/ no cost options. But they wouldn’t do it...

One night, we were talking about nothing serious and they just went quite. I thought they fell asleep but the next day they told me that they had tried to hang themselves.
They tried to kill themself WHILE we where talking
How does someone tell you, you mean the world to them, tell you they don’t want to lose you 
AND THEN DO THAT. 
I stayed with them. Maybe it was heat of the moment i don’t know. 
But then they did it again. Messaging me pleasantries while bleeding out. Telling me they’ll wake up tomorrow when they don’t know that.
I just. I don’t understand. I don’t understand what would make someone do that. 

The last time they tried, they got caught and were taken to get help. They got meds and scheduled an appointment with a therapist.
But... how am I suppose to trust that? How do I know they aren’t just lying again? 

I asked for space to clear my head but I just can’t get rid of the mental images of them hurting themselves. They are a good person going through a hard time and I want to encourage their healing but... it just hurts to talk to them. Part of me wants to give them a second chance... but part of me believes that it’s just going to end like the others. 

I’m sorry that was rather depressing but I could really use some advice...",23Oct2020,1

So I (19F) just got into a relationship with my boyfriend(25M) and we are LD and haven’t met IRL yet, but we know what the other person look like and VC every day. 

we met on a gaming server, and when I joined I just said I was 20 because of two reasons:
1. My mom lied to me about my birthday for 8 years. Now this may seem strange but apparently I was so mad my birthday wasn’t the same month as my sister when I was like 3 or something, so she “changed” it by just celebrating mine a few days before hers. This has caused me to think automatically that I’m two months older than I am, because I haven’t celebrated my FAKE birthday or my real one in like 4 years (not important why just personal choice).

2. I straight up forgot about it

So my question is how I’m supposed to go about this?? I’m OBVIOUSLY gonna tell him, but I kinda wanna wait til my birthday which is in less than a month and explain it to him, that way it might be less weird and easier to explain because I told him the truth about the year Im born (2000) I just never said month, but I also really care about him and wanna tell him, especially now that I realized I basically lied about my age even though I didn’t realize I did. But like I don’t wanna weird him out or make him feel uncomfortable if I can prevent it as much as possible, so I wanna just try and do this in the best way possible... but I’m not sure how, or when, I would appreciate some advice.",23Oct2020,1

Sorry if this account seems fake I decided to make a new account because weird people kept messaging me on my old account but you could check it out if you want at r/sailingthebay. I (16M) am struggling with POCD. To anyone who is wondering, POCD is a form of OCD that consists of a person fearing they are a pedophile. Let me start off by saying I have no type of attraction to little children at all. When I smaller I was raped by a family member multiple times then another time by a family friend. All this happened before I was 13 so it took an emotional toll on me. When trying to get treatment online I ran into an article that explained that most sexual assualt victims become pedophiles. This freaked me out. While I have no sexual attraction to young kids I fear that as I get older I'll develop one. I fear I'm a ticking time bomb and that I just don't know it yet. Sounds silly but sometimes this really hurts me and I even feel like killing myself when this idea comes to me. I also fear that when I get older, I'll be attracted to 16 yr olds because I am attracted to them rn. I mean I know its normal rn cause I'm 16 but I fear that I won't be able to like my age group when I get older. I opened up to my aunt and mom about this and my aunt has been through my same situation as well and knows where I'm coming from. She says that I'll get better overtime and my mom says I shouldn't worry about my future self because I'm not even at that stage of my life yet.

194,"I don't exactly know what it is or why, but I just feel stuck in life, like I'm not growing as a person. I'm a 20 year old female, but I'm the same as how I was in high school and I have the same problems. I look at all my high school friends and how they are now, and they've all grown and overcame their struggles and problems and they're doing A LOT better now in many different areas of life. On the other hand, I'm still the same. Also, after high school my friends and I drifted apart so we don't really talk anymore. We just have other on social media, so I don't really have any friends right now either. I only have one real friend that I talk to. She's younger than me by 3 years, but I still consider her my best friend. The thing is though, I don't think she considers me her best friend. I feel like I'm annoying her by being so clingy because of my loneliness. It also kinda hurts too that I'm willing to do all these things for her, but she doesn't do anything for me. I do really want to make other friends, but whenever someone tries to befriend me, I don't put any effort into maintain that friendship. It's like I can't accept new people in my life or something. And when I do try to put effort, I come off as a try-hard according to my sister and then it scares them away. 

I'm also in community college right now. I'm in my 2nd year. I've been feeling this way ever since I started college and I let this feeling of being stuck affect my studies. I barely study and I used to care so much about my grades in high school, but now I basically don't give a fuck even though I really do want to succeed. I also want to make my parents proud, so I don't tell them about what's really going on in my studies and I keep telling myself that I'll do better but I just can't bring myself to actually do it. I'm still not doing too well academically this semester, and I know that this is going to hurt me in the future but that still doesn't get me to do better. 

This is also affecting my hobbies and interests. I like playing piano and art and I want  to learn more about them and be better at both, but I just feel so lazy and don't do that. 

As for what I feel stuck in, I just feel stuck in life in general. I don't have any real friends that I could hang out with that don't find me annoying or friends that would actually care and do things for me. I don't have a boyfriend, which I feel like would make my life better since I never had one before but idk. I'm doing so bad in college and I don't see my purpose. I know I said I feel the same as how I was in high school, but thinking about it more, I actually feel worse. I had motivation in high school. I had good friends in high school.  Guys actually talked to me in high school. I was excited for the future back then too. Now, I just feel like my self-esteem went down more and I just feel more angry at the world.

Today I  woke up and the right side of my face is like not working completely. I can’t shut my right eye as tight as my left and when I try to blow air out of my mouth, my right side of my lip opens and lets air out even if I try not to open it. Also taste is different.

196,"
First, some background. I've known her (we'll call her A) for my entire life because our parents met at work a couple of years before we were born. Our families have been extremely close throughout our lives, and we go on a ""family trip"" every year (even though there's no actual blood relation). I was always comfortable and close to A and her sister \[15f\], but a couple of years ago A got a cell phone and we became close friends and started texting or talking to each other every day. We've continued that ever since, and it's always been extremely platonic and essentially the definition of a mutual friend zone. A is also bi (and leans towards liking other girls more). 

This is a lot of info, you could probably skim this. Earlier this past summer (June), our families went on a trip to Montana for almost a week and did what we could while staying covid safe. It was super fun and we did a lot of stuff every day, and on the last 2 nights we had a sleepover (me, A, her sister). I ended up with my own hotel room so they asked if they could get away from their parents and sleep on the king bed in my room (and I agreed to sleep on the couch bed). Well, after all three of us watched tv and stayed up until about 1, A's sister fell asleep, and A came over to the couch bed because she wasn't tired yet. We did random stuff on my phone when eventually she put her arm around me and became a lot more touchy than usual (neither of us are touchy people at all, we've wrestled and playfully hit each other before but we're physical in a playfully mean way if that makes sense). Eventually when she was trying to grab my phone I pulled it away and she ended up lying on top of me with her head on my chest. I didn't resist at all and I just kept swiping through my phone and we kept looking at things like we were before, except for the fact that she was lying on my side. Eventually we went to bed, barely slept, and in the early morning before her sister woke up she came back to the couch bed and we just laid next to each other for a while (on a very small bed so it was also unusual). The next night the same scenario played out, and she put her head on my shoulder and played with my hair before getting tired and we ended up lying next to each other for a while before she eventually went back to her bed to sleep.

Anyways, last week I went to visit her and her family at their house for 5 days because we are both in online school and figured that we should plan something. A and I had talked about various things that we would do, including staying up all night one night, so I was fairly excited for the trip. Well, I went and... basically nothing happened. Parts of it were fun, for sure, but those parts were all with her whole family and we didn't really do anything with just the two of us. She wasn't exactly ignoring/avoiding me, she was just going about her normal routine, but I guess I expected us to do some stuff together or something. The night where we were supposed to stay up came and went, and the next night I asked if she wanted to stay up that night and she said she was too tired. The night after she even came to my room at like 1 AM and said she didn't know what to do and was bored, but before I could really understand what she said (because I was pretty tired) she said she was just going to go to bed... we did talk about some stuff at times (whenever we were near each other in the house or ran into each other or whatever) and had normal conversations (we also texted almost like we normally would on some days), so it wasn't necessarily awkward or anything, but I didn't talk to her any more than I did to her sister for example. Anyways, on the last night she initiated a goodbye hug and that was basically all of the physical contact that we had. So I'm pretty confused about what happened and what I should do now. I don't really want to confront her directly or ask her about it because I may be wildly overthinking it and she just wanted to go about her normal routine considering it's the school year. We have also resumed texting just as much as before and she’s initiating a lot of the conversation (and even apologized for being mean on the trip). I have nothing to compare this to since I've never seen her in person during the school year before, but I will note that we tend to talk/text less when school is in session (even though it's all online this year).

tl;dr: went to visit my friend and her family, we didn't really do anything together and although some parts were fun, I feel confused about what happened and what she may have been thinking.",23Oct2020,1

204,"I (18f) have always lived with my mom. My dad passed away when I was a kid so it’s only ever been her me and my older and younger brother. 

At the end of august my grandma fell and broke her ribs while my family was staying at a family friends lake. Ever since then everything in our lives has been overturned. 

My older brother moved out. My grandma came to live with us. I was kicked out of my bedroom and am sleeping on an air mattress as I try to paint and redo the floors in my new room( all of my stuff is in piles in the basement). We have bed bugs because my grandma had an insane bed bug problem so now we do too. There’s an ever looming threat of my druggie homeless kleptomaniac uncle whom we had to kick out of my grandmas house coming over unannounced at any time. And my grandma will let him in because she feels bad for him. Everyone I know including my bf is in university but I took a year off so I am almost constantly lonely. We have to fix my grandmas house because of all the damage that that uncle did to it (the house belongs to my mom). I am working a lot. I had a concussion. The bed bugs are biting us almost every night. And I am struggling with sexuality and stuff. 

Needless to say I am extremely depressed and can’t take it anymore. I have a collection of pills in my “new room” in case one day I decide I’ve had enough. I’ve got about 2500 in my bank account that is supposed to go towards a car (I have 7000 that was put in a fund when my dad passed and I can now go collect it I just have to get a notary and all this stuff to get it)

I understand that my mom has way way wayyyyy too much to deal with right now and it is really really hard. I’ve been trying to help her, and keep quiet about how much it has all been affecting me but every now and then I’ll mention something about it and she’ll snap at me about not being able to deal with me. 

Tonight I read an article about how having bed bugs affects you psychologically and honestly, im worried about my sanity. I constantly feel itchy, I can’t sleep, I’m always thinking about them, I don’t feel safe anywhere, it doesn’t feel like home to me at all anymore. I got back from an 8 hour shift where I spent the whole time scratching at nothing and i said one thing about how having bed bugs can affect you psychologically and she said “why don’t you look up the negative psychological effects of having a daughter” 

I want to move out. But I’m like partially done painting my room and I got paint all over the carpet because I knew I was going to rip it out anyway. I can’t just leave it like this and I don’t want to leave her and my 12 year old brother to deal with it alone. 

I don’t think I’m financially independent enough to do it either, especially since I’ve been getting less shifts at work. And I don’t even know what is required to rent an apartment document wise.

205,"I am seeing a theme in my adult life that I place a lot of emphasis on my romantic relationships and don't really know who I am without one. Since I turned 19 I've been in three relationships, one lasting a couple months, and the other two lasting 3 years each. Being post breakup I moved across states back to my home city where I haven't lived in 10 years. I made a vow to myself to stay single for a year, gain some work experience in the field I want to work in, and move in one year to another city. At the end of the day I worry that sometimes I just make these check box goals and think everything is just going to work out if I do A, B, and C.

But it's hard, the city I'm in is only like 200k population wise, and all most of my old friends are still here. They all seem to know everyone the few times I allow myself to go out, Covid/money, and seeing them in relationships and getting contact info from women they know seems to be sucking me back in. I love loving someone, but I feel like I need to learn how to love myself and learn who I am as an adult that is not in a relationship. 

I do zoom therapy sessions, and try my best to go get coffee/study and meet new people like workers and such by myself weekly. I'm living alone for the first time in forever and I find I just sit glued to a book, my phone, or laptop and don't really enjoy being completely alone and it annoys the hell out of me. I'm not a super social person, but I really enjoy the company and getting to know others. I worry that I have developed some weird codependency where I feel the need to have others around me and for them to want me around, romantically anyways. Half my friends like the idea of me taking a year to myself, and the other half think that it is okay for me to get back out there and all that.

I think this is because I placed two seperate orders at different times but they both shipped at the same time because one of the products (the considerably cheaper one) was marked as delivered (the delivery person only scanned the top package because they maybe thought it was. the one order?)

Is the order not being marked as delivered likely going to cause conflict or Amazon penalising the delivery company/seller because I do not want to cause any conflict between amazon and the seller or delivery company if that were to happen.

I asked my then fiance to chip in for renovations since I assumed this house would be both of ours. However, he refused to contribute any money to the renovations. When we got married, I asked him to sign a pre-nup solely for the purpose of retaining ownership of the apartment (now worth $500k) since I put my life savings into the apartment and he decided not to contribute.

He refuses to fix anything if it breaks, barely does any chores, and calls me ""his landlord"".

I never initiated anything because of my anxiety. 

I don’t speak to people outside of my friendgroup much. About 3 years ago we got put in a class together. He sat at my table with a friend of mine and people I don’t speak to. I started to notice how he was like me during those two years. He didn’t talk much to the others he wasn’t friends with. But he made an effort to speak to him, maybe he noticed I did the same. I spoke to him too. I never initiated anything but everyday he’d make an effort to talk to me. To pass a joke or ask a question. He just showed interest.

222,"I need some advice on how to deal union reps at my place of work.

To clarify I will not be using the real names of the people or the company involved as I want to protect myself and others anonymity. 

I work as a machine operator in the UK for a large food manufacturer.  Due to the line of work and the hours we work many English workers don’t tend to stay long as it’s very physical and mentally stressful job, to put it bluntly, the English are not suited for this line of work. In my department there are 5 English (including myself)  thirteen Poles , seven Romanians, two Spaniards and two Kurds. I get on with all of them except with one of the poles as we tend clash over stupid things which is quite comedic to be honest.

Anyway to get to the topic at hand we have a Trade Union onsite which to be honest is a force for good as they have in the past been there for many of the workers in need as the company have a tendency to screw most the workers over most things like Overtime Pay, Sickness and disciplinary actions. 

My best work mate James has become a Union Rep for our department which I thought at first would be great as he has no filter and is not scared to but heads with management. As union rep you do it coinciding with your normal job role, so you may have to go to the odd training, disciplinary and meeting. But recently he’s been abusing his role as a rep. I found out for myself why he is never on the shop floor, he tells us and the shift leads that he’s got Union business to deal with when he’s really in the canteen or in the union office watching football, whilst myself and others are having to do his work for him and when he’s on a machine he always leaves at 10pm as he doesn’t do overtime as he has doctors note.

Now for the last month James became a bit of a bully, we have two new Romanians in our department Bogdan and Igor. Personally I didn’t get on with them at first due their work ethic at the start, basically refusing to help others and would cry about overtime, which I understand to some but the overtime is not as bad as it once was, especially during the start of COVID.

James started to slag off and belittle them because it took him longer than most to learn the machines we use. Then started slagging off Bogdan and Igors  English, then going on a racist rant saying that brexit meant exit so they should be kicked out the country same as the rest in our department as it should be English work for English workers.

It’s got to the point we’re he’s started messing with Bogdans and Igors  machines don’t that they would break so he can get them trouble.  They’ve sacked Igor and put Bogdan on Probation.

It doesn’t stop with them, one of the lady’s in another department is an recovering alcoholic(doesn’t work on machines) she complained about him over a severe mistake he made, which caused a major disruption during production. He called her and Alcoholic Bitch and if she complained about him again he would make sure she’d be sacked, I know this because he openly bragged about to me afterwards.  

My friendship with James is over as of last week as he knew I took the blame for a mistake Bogdan made on a machine and Damaged it, If didn’t take the blame he could of Been sacked as he’s on probation. I got a slap on the wrist for it.

People have reported him over his actions to the sites union rep Keith, but he refuses to anything and gets buried, as James is his drinking buddy. The managers don’t believe people’s claims or grievances as James is a model employee and knows a lot about the machines. 

There’s much more he’s done but Im scared to report his actions as the Union has way too much influence in the company now. I’m not the perfect employee due to my behaviour in the past by coming into work intoxicated and going AWOL, if I report him no one will believe me and it will put a target on my back.

227,"This is targeted more towards people past their twenties. Hi, I'm only a high school student, I try to hard to get good grades, aim for a good college, and hopefully get a successful job one day. During this pandemic where I've had time to think about myself and my future, I've really been wondering if its all worth it. It's likely I'll never be rich, famous, or really have that movie-like type of life, and that goes for the majority of us.

228,"It has always felt extremely difficult for me to connect with people. I grew up as an only child so I’ve always been on my own, I learned to do things on my own. I am naturally an introverted person. I enjoy my own company and keeping to myself. I find comfort in solitude and being socially independent. It doesn’t bother me to spend time alone or go out in public by myself. 

However, it does get lonely.

I’m in my early 20s and sometimes I fear that I am going to one day wake up and realize I have missed out on so much. And no, I am not just speaking strictly on a “I want to go out and have fun” perspective. Of course I want to go out, but sometimes I also just want friends. That’s not to say I don’t have any friends at all, but I don’t have many. Not many that I’m even close with. It’s just hard and I don’t know how to explain it. 

I’ll see people with all their friends and it makes me wonder if something is wrong with me? I’ll become acquainted with someone but it’ll never go further than that. I feel as though majority of that is my fault. I’ve been told I am a quiet person, which I am aware of. Although I don’t mean to be, I just am. I have moments where I am extroverted but I don’t know how to maintain that. I feel like I close myself off, but I also feel like when I open myself up I become judged by others.

237,"I have always been quite vocal with my beliefs and views. Of course, I'm respectful of other views and I try to keep an open mind, so I can continue growing and learning. 

The events we've witnessed this year have led to me being vocal about subjects that make some people very uncomfortable. I'm from a rural area where 95% of the population is white and most people never leave their town, let alone the state. It goes without saying that many of the people there are bigoted. I left the state and couldn't be happier about that decision. 

I have had very difficult conversations with various people regarding race relations, criminal justice, civil rights, and other political issues this year. It's led me to determine that many of the people I once respected are very bigoted, and some outright racist and filled with hate. It's very overwhelming and I don't know how to reconcile these perspectives. It also has taken a toll on my mental health to keep caring and speaking about these issues, to the point where I tune out anytime politics come up. 

It sucks, because I really do care. I want to help. Hence why I chose the career I did, which also makes it very difficult to ignore these things. My career is intertwined with all of these issues. And I know this post sounds very privileged, because as a white male, I can easily ""ignore"" these issues.

I did not have friends. I did not feel supported by my family and what’s worse was because it’s during lockdown I felt even more isolated and lonely so I made a rash decision to do camming to do something different and exciting. It was all solo stuff but for some stupid reason I put my face into the screen. 

My school work completely uninterested me and I just wanted to earn money to spend on clothes and useless things (stupid as fuck I know!!!)

Months after people have still been requesting to follow me on my social media’s and I appear on several camming sites. The worst part of all of this is that now I have a boyfriend.

As of this year prior to Covid I moved back my my mother as she is legally blind in one eye and helping her I was able to get treatment for my opioid addiction. Now taking methadone which is much better than spending a ridiculous amount on the actual drugs. I am in my 30's now with not much call my own. I own a car that was paid off when I had a great tech job with a big name company but the drugs came back into my life and ruined my potential future with the company and a beautiful woman whom I almost married. So now I am working a labour job well a logistic coodinator but do not make enough and live check by check. My drug problem came during my 20s in college when I was scammed by a company posing as a top 100 firm in my city which eventually turned out to be a pyramid scam. I lost the investment they required during recruitment the checks they paid me eventually came back as fraudulent and my bank almost sued me if I didn't pay back the money. Baiscally this ruined me and I haven't been the same since. I had to drop out of my 3rd year of College which at the time I had a 2.74 GPA which to me was pretty good for working and studying. Now I feel hopeless trying to save what I could but I want to invest or at the very least gain insights to earning freedom with income so I can support my ailing mother and fix the regrets and mistakes in my life.

Hopefully this isn't just some crazy guys rant. I'm not asking for pity but I'm hoping some good souls would point me in the right direction. I want to become sober and get off methadone but at the current rate I need these opioids to function when my job becomes very laborious . I let myself go and gained a bunch of wieght as I don't eat healthy or right and the food I try and save the good one's for my mother as I tend to eat microwave food or cheap take outs.

Thanks you for listening. Sometimes I feel lost. The friends I still hold dear to me do not know my full situation as I keep a facade and since moving back with my mother I do not have much time for any socializing. It's just working a mundane job, taking care of mum and my dog.

My Senior year I was in a dark place and I had no one to give me any type of hope or confidence. I was suffering through a lot of loss and from depression. During a school trip, she would always check in on me and make me feel not just heard but listened to. I grew feelings for her but didn't do anything because she had a boyfriend. I stayed silent for so long and just left it because I didnt wanna ruin out friendship. Few years pass by and one day I told her I told her how I truly felt. She was still with him but wanted out because she didn't see herself happy with him anymore. Few weeks had passed and we talked about it. She was shocked still and them asked my I didn't tell her sooner. I told her why and then she began falling for me. We stayed up all the way till 5 am talking about how happy we could be together and that i wanter to be with her. 

That same day, she talked with him but didn't end it. They wanted to work it out. I was hurt. I let time do it's thing to try and heal me just to find out they finally split about 2 weeks after. Few weeks after, she said she wanted to try again and we tried. That lasted two days and then she called it quits again I felt used and hurt and yet, I can't leave those feelings alone. 

That 5 Am night session made me feel special and loved for the first time in my life. Ive only been in 2 relationships in my life and they were both toxic and abusive. To have someone different and someone who wanted to know how I truly was and that they cared about felt amazing. But now it sucks. We still talk as best friends but I can't get over it. That night replays in my head a lot and she means a lot to me. Recently I brought it up to her again and she said she didnt like me that way anymore and now, I feel broken.

246,"sooo long story short

There was this opportunity that I had to go with a friend for just a day to a very nice and isolated town an hour and a half from the city. My friend and I both take extremely good care of ourselves and we are really cautious when it comes to COVID. Of course there were risks but they were so small if we took all the precautions necessary

My parents were so bipolar about it. One hour they would tell me that they would allow me to go but they would just change their mind. Until they finally decide that I should not go.

Also, today I was suppose to meet with a friend to finish watching a TV show that we have been watching together and well it got kinda late so we postponed it to Saturday, but Saturday was the day I was suppose to go the trip with my friend. The thing is that my parents won’t even let me go to that friends house to watch the show.

Look, I know that COVID is a serious problem rn and I do take it seriously. And I mean it, I take all the precautions, wear a mask, I’m never physically close to anyone, not even my friends. And I know that my parents are just trying to protect out health but heck, I’m really angry and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not really asking for advice or anything lol, I just needed somewhere to write 

I had an opportunity to SAFELY get away from the stress and negativity for a couple of hours and it just went away

248," 

Some people go by ""gut"" feelings, I prefer not to. It's too superficial and too subjective.

I prefer to put thought into the decision before I decide to split with someone, but sometimes even I feel that I'm not intelligent enough about this.

The specific case that I am hesitating with at the moment is a person who I've considered my friend, she considers me her friend (both 24F), we had great conversations together and we spent also a decent period of time together and we are also colleagues. The thing is that she turned down a casual meeting we had planned a week ago for her birthday for a surprise party that a group of friends threw for her. She told me she feels bad about it and she's going to make up for it, but I'm just not cool with it. I'm not jealous or something, I just got disturbed by it and I'm still disturbed by it because in the past I did the mistake of not taking a small detail seriously and I've realized later that it was an early sign of a dysfunctional friendship and since then I decided to pay more attention even to little things.

From the way I see it, she didn't give importance to the fact that I lost half a day because she cancelled on me on the last second. She also didn't consider that it is quite unelegant to tell someone ""hey, can we cancel our meeting because my other friends told me in the last minute that they have a surprise party for me"" - I mean, she could have just said that ""something came along"" or whatever, but telling me what she told me I just felt exchanged for something that is for her a better option and I don't like feeling that I'm the second option.

Also , I do realize I'm not completely fair. After all, aren't we all second options for someone ?

But still, it's very difficult to make up my mind about it. I don't plan to end our friendship entirely, but I have trouble seeing her the way I did before, it's somehow like I just want her as a colleague now and nothing more.

Damn...i dont even know where to start.

There's this girl who wants to see me tomorrow night.  Based on our text history, its pretty evident whats about to go down. 

We've been talking for a little, and for a guy with anxiety...it's feels like it's been months, I don't remember what I ate for dinner yesterday but I remember meeting her. 

I was at work and she came in to pay a bill(its a phone store that rhymes with P-mobile. While she was paying the bill at my coworker desk, I was watching a school assignment. she asked what I was watching. I didn't really focus on her that much because I was trying to do my assignment( I know, imma nerd). anyways she asks what im working on and what school i go to. I did notice that her interest level was pretty high and when she asked for my number, I hesitantly gave it to her after the 3rd time she asked(nicely,  not rudely).

Fast forward the next day and she sent me a text asking me out for coffee. 
I though ""yea right, coffee at 8pm"". I knew wassup.

So immediately I knew what the deal was and i was sort of backing out. I gave her one word answers and bored responses but this girl wouldn't quit. She keeps texting  and texting. 

I tell her I'm with somebody because I was anxious and couldn't bring myself to say no.



Ok, a little back story. Im a college kid who is a virgin partly because of anxiety and my culture (who strongly believes we should wait till marriage to have sex). Whenever im around girls, Im  always constantly thinking about sex and what I would do to them.(yea...I know I don't have shame) and that's all I could think about. The only time i can focus is when im by myself or a group of close friends.
 As you can tell thats not a lifestyle for someone who is a salesman and goes to school where half the people are women. All I could think  about was that. Work: yep, the gym:you betcha! religious houses: why not?



I'm tired of this feeling and just want to get rid of (or try something). But my culture and anxiety issues cause me to always back out of just asking girls out.

And  I don't wanna sound like I'm bragging but I've had many opportunities to do this before before. 

Ok, now back to the story.
A couple days after she asked me out and I wussed out. Then she texts me. 
She may not be a super model or have einstiens  smarts but she knew how to text. She stars with small questions like my hight and what I do.

Then she goes to asking just  to meet up. I tell her maybe. She gets super excited.

The I became fearless behind my Samsung phone and asked her for nudes. She says ok and 10 mins later she sends me these incredible nudes of her tits and vaginal area with clear views 

We teased back and forth for a while saying what we would to each others body parts and how dirty we were.

She throws out the idea of meeting in person to do these said things.  My plan was to start easy by messing around( non vaginas stuff) and we would do it in my car(this is for tonight October 23)

Now at 1:25,  I come to you(smartest people on reddit). should I just rent a cheap hotel and go all the way. I dont want to keep having to fight my thoughts evey time a mildly attacive women walks by. 

Should I just go all the way or stick to my original plan?",23Oct2020,1

259,"I have OCD so I tend to over-analyze, reflect on past situations and obsess over whether or not they were ethical. So I propose a situation of behaviors that I hope someone can help me navigate.

Say you’ve been planning on proposing a specific question (I’ll call it a direct question) to someone but due to its intensity / it coming a bit out of left field you feel like you must first test the waters/ interest level in order to gauge if asking the question will be received well or not/is appropriate. You’d rather not prompt the question right off the bat as It may be jarring. So you go in with the intent of measuring wether asking the direct question will be acceptable or not rather than eliciting a specific answer/result (though you may hope for one).

You nervously go in anticipating you MAY (emphasis on may) ask the question if the situation feels acceptable/comfortable. As you beginning to ask questions/ make conversation that is within an adjacent realm/ the same realm as the direct question the individual notes that they have to get ready for an optional event they are attending that but also note they don’t really desire going to.

You suggest lightheartedly “You don’t have to go if you don’t want to especially if its optional” with the semi-intention to better increase the chances of the person staying so you can ask the deeper question while still allowing them to make the decision for themselves. Can this be considered: deception, nudging, coercion, covert manipulation, influence, persuasion? As the person is unaware that you are suggesting the stay so you can potentially ask a larger question later on. Or just natural linguistic conversation?

They consider but continue to get ready and you don’t saying anything further (you allow them to make their own opinion/movement on the decision to stay or go and make no further mentions/suggestions). As you continue to ask more questions that are being received and reciprocated well the person ultimately chooses to stay (announcing such of their own accord). You anticipate a level of positive tension rising as it seems they understand you have a bigger question to ask and make it apparent that directness at this point is good.

You ask your question “Would you like to\_\_\_\_\_\_” they pause and thoughtfully consider for a moment as the question makes sense in context but had the build up and answering saying that they would. You ask another follow up question to confirm again and they agree. Even though this person could change their mind and go to their event would they feel obligation to stay as they had already said they weren't going/ choosing to stay. And you both mutually benefit from the experience that is had leaving you both feeling good.

this dictates my thoughts more clearly: My worry spans from the fear that I think my suggestion could potentially fall under: ""covertly influence someone with indirect, deceptive tactics-- it may seem benign or even friendly or flattering, as if the person has your highest concern in mind, but in reality it's to achieve an ulterior motive."" with the covert influence being my statements / lead up questions and the ulterior motive being me wanting to ask him to hook up?

Can the lead up questions with the intent to potentially later ask a larger question that the individual is not anticipating / the small suggestion of choice to stay be considered manipulation/ under-handed tactic, coercive, etc. of the individual/situation and revoking authentic consent? (To contextualize this is a situation leading up to ask for affirmative consent to a sexual encounter, the lead up questions are of a sexual nature)",23Oct2020,1
260,"About a month ago, I made a post asking what I should do to help my partner, who said they were having suicidal thoughts. Most of the replies said to get them therapy, or the school counseler; but what should I do if it doesnt look like thats going to happen? 

Recently, I think theyve been starting to get worse; and their parents (mainly their dad) has been the root cause for it. Hes been berating them about their grades, getting mad at them for going home sick a lot, and being really fucking stupid about whether or not we could have sleepovers at eachothers house,  because they apperently need a B or higher in each class for us to be alowed to have a sleepover, and despite the fact that they meet that criteria, hes saying we cant bc one teacher hasnt put grades in yet, so techecly not a B. When they used reason and stood up for themslves, he went on and on about it until they started crying. (To which he didnt react much)  

And in the past, when theyve opened up to their dad about stuff, hes just made it worse, and told them to ""suck it up."" And because of all that, they wont open up to their parents about anything, and they said if they were to tell their mom she would most likely tell their dad, which would be bad. 

Ive also given them links to the school counselor, but I dont think they want to do that, bc they havent really used it, and they've said that going to therapy scares them. Also, after covid happened, my mom signed me up for purely online school, while they have to go in campus. So weve been seeing eachother a lot less. And were both not old enough to even start learning to drive, so we can't drive anywhere we want or anything to see each other. And on top of that, both their parents are being really unecessarily restrictive on how long we can hang out over weekends. So, i dont know if they're gonna be able to get help anytime soon considering their parents arent going to be any help. 

Today, theyve also told me that im pretty much their only reason for living, which really really scares me. Its gonna be like three years plus 6 months before were 18 and can move out, so theyre gonna have to be with their parents and deal with all of this for a long time, and im scared they might hurt themselves before then. I know they need help, but what can I do to help if it turns out they cant get it?",23Oct2020,1
261,"Back story: at the beginning of the pandemic, my mom and I 100% agreed on social distancing. We were only going out to get groceries. She even went as far as to clean off her groceries with Clorox wipes. 

The months went by, and my boyfriend and I (we live together), have not changed how we’ve done things since the beginning of the pandemic because it’s continuing to get worse where we live. People we love have gotten very sick, and we decided not to risk it. My mom, on the other hand, has gotten tired of staying home and has decided that having friends over, eating outside (and a few times inside) at restaurants or bars, and going on vacation is OK now. I have told her that I think that’s risky and is putting people like my grandparents in a vulnerable spot, but she disagrees. 

Now for the situation in which I need advice: today, she told me that she is planning to go to Florida in December with my sister and Dad and mentioned they were driving. I, still being sad about having to cancel my trip to Hawaii for December, said that I would like to go as long as we got our food to-go, wore masks in public, etc. She said that she refuses to get take-out food because she enjoys eating at restaurants. I asked her if she’d rather have me on the vacation with them or eat out, and she said “eat out”. Our conversation ended very shortly after that.

I’m feeling very angry, hurt, and alone in how social distancing is being handled in my family and all over the country. I am saddened to learn that my mom would rather eat at a restaurant on vacation than have me go with her to Florida. I feel like I am the only one still taking the virus seriously. Am I being too careful? Should I risk it a little more to better my relationships?

I’m stuck between wanting to cut these people out of my life permanently or feel so horrible because it must be all my fault. And it’s turning into a very unhealthy storm mentally that I’m trying to overcome. I probably need a therapist, but hey, who’s has the money for that?",23Oct2020,1

I am feeling super burned out, fed up, and ready to jump ship. I always wanted to leave the state of CA and literally move anywhere else that is not as expensive, but I told myself to wait until I get a supervisor promotion, wait until I save 5k wait until etc. I'm sick of this shit and I am ready to jump ship.

I hate my job. My supervisor is awful and makes me feel so incompetent when I know I have the skills. I went from having high evals before COVID to low eval scores. I thought it was just a me thing, but I am beginning to realize it has little to do with me and more to do with the support I have never received with this particular supervisor (and the only sup in my area) since I began working with this company over a year ago.

Now I go to work and fucking hate it. I don't care about the kids anymore because the parents think I'm not good at my job because my supervisor pretty much shut down everything I do with the kiddo in earshot of the parents and I am sick of it.

I don't talk to my family in the house because of their toxicity. My boyfriend of 1yr 8m broke up with me on our anniversary last month, and now I am officially over this company. I am ready to go. I just want to drop my job, take my 3-4k in savings and move to a state with no job in line, and no family.

264,"As the title states yesterday afternoon I caused a car accident. I had just gotten off of work (preschool teacher) and had a terrible day. I’ve been having the worst week of my life starting with my first seizure in two years; anyways, I’m driving home and I usually take one way home but someone was swerving and acting strange so I took another route home instead, I’m going down the road about 35-40mph and usually where I turn to head up the street to my house I decide because it’s a blind spot and hard to see to just go on down the street and through the neighborhood. 

As I’m going through the intersection at what I swore to be a green light another car comes from my left and T-Bones me, I swerved and went over the median and hit another car before pulling into a parking lot. I hit my head pretty hard etc. After everything was said and done talking to the police and me swearing it was a green light he explains that the car I hit was turning on a green arrow meaning I had to have run a red light. My car is undriveable, the door is sealed shut, and the other car that hit me is totaled. After being checked out by paramedics I get home, call my insurance company to find out my insurance had lapsed the day before because of insufficient funds (which was a accident because somewhere else took out too much money mistakenly) so now I have no auto insurance. I feel like garbage. I’m in pain and had to call into work, I can’t help but feel like a piece of shit for being so distracted and almost hurting someone else so badly, and I kept having nightmares and can’t stop thinking about the crash and feel so depressed, but I feel like a asshole that shouldn’t be sad because I caused it. 

I have no adult guidance and I have no idea how this all works or what can happen next. 

Can anyone give me advice on what to do next? or even if it’s okay for me to feel so awful and depressed about all this? I feel like a joke for having such anxious thoughts reliving the crash and I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience or can help me understand what to do next.

266,"I know how weird it sounds. You’re probably asking yourself “wouldn’t he be happy for you?” But here’s a quick background story: my dad was kind of absent. He wasn’t easy to deal with. He was the kind of person you had to be careful around. So I was never able to be fully myself around him. I’ve always felt like I had to walk on eggshells. I’ve never talked to him about relationships (he’s never asked). He was there, but it was hard to talk to him. He started changing ever since my mom told him she wanted a divorce. He lives in a different state now. But he has never been really supportive. A couple months ago, he overheard a conversation between me and my mom (when I said I was looking for a job) and it turned into a lecture. It was like he didn’t want me to have a job which is so weird. So I got my first job, and I have no idea how to tell him. It’s not easy for me to be just like “hey, I got a job”. I can’t. I also got accepted into college and got a scholarship but idk how to tell him that either. I can’t even allow myself to be as happy as I should be because I’m afraid someone might ruin it. Most of my fear is gone, but part of it is still there. I don’t know how to talk to him about my life. My mom told me that I had to tell him about it, because if I didn’t, he would get mad at her for not telling him I was looking for a job. I’ll be babysitting 2 girls and I’ll also be their tutor! It’s my first job. I just want to be happy and I wish I could talk more. I feel so weird as I write this, because I think a lot of people won’t understand my fear.

267,"I've had an idea for a story in my mind for multiple years now. It has been through a lot of mayor changes through the years until it became something completely different from the original idea. However about a year ago I really started to give it a structure, a world, characters, etc.

Even girls that have been in my class for at least a year now I get nervous and awkward when they even ask me a question about the work. 

And it's not that I want to be awkward it's like my bodies natural reaction is to get nervous.

271,"It's 7am and I haven't slept. I've also been told a few hours ago I was in contact with people who are infected from Covid, I'm now waiting for their results to come back and if any of them checks positive I'm in for a treat, so this hasn't been a fun night. I also don't know how to exactly explain what I feel, I'll try to be clear though. Also I'll probably sound more like an asshole than I'd wish.

The thing is, I just hate being around arrogant people.

I'd assume most people would know at least someone like this. They always feel the need to show off, to talk about how much they know, to constantly give their opinion, whatever.

For some reason these people trigger me and bring out the darkest of sides on me. I'm 24 and I've been described by others as a calm, simple, relaxing kind of person... EXCEPT when I'm around these people.

I'm remembering one person right now who I used to hang around who was like this. He would just spend all the time spilling random facts (""Oh do you know why restaurants arrange their chairs and tables like this? It's because X and Y and Z"") but then when somebody else shared a random fact he would just interrupt and go ""Who the fuck cares about that?"". So this triggered the part in me that wants to compete back and ""put these people in their place"" or whatever. I'd start fact-checking him and engage in discussions on why he was wrong. Even if I knew he was mostly right I'd still raise my voice and engage him in argument just because I could. 

Eventually I grew up and cut contact with those kind of people. Regarding this person in particular we shared a group of friends and eventually I realized that whoever wanted to be friends with that person wouldn't be someone I wanted to be friends with since toxicity and negativity became mainstream and the group split and I'm much better off with the people that left the group with me I reckon.

The thing is, I'm still in college and now there's someone like that in my classes and it makes them an insufferable experience. As in, the teacher will be talking about X and he interrupts and go ""Yes, but that also happens with Y doesn't it?"". Or if I (or any other student) ask a question or make a mistake, he will interrupt and step in before the teacher to correct it. And when he makes a mistake, he just can't accept it. Say he answers X is bigger than Y and the teacher says actually Y is bigger than X. He'll just keep asking the teacher ""What do you mean Y is bigger than X? Are you sure X isn't bigger than Y? Y is bigger than X are you sure about that?"" or whatever for 5 straight minutes.

It really does infuriate me. I enter hard competition mode, by which I mean my goal in that class isn't to learn, it's now to beat him and get more answers right. If I get an answer right I feel amazing. If I get an answer wrong I beat myself up. Even hours after the class is over I'm still beating myself up, and this usually lasts until I sleep on it.

And it's not like I want to prove I'm the smartest one in the class. If I get an answer wrong and somebody, anybody else gets it right, then I don't feel like I need to prove anything, I just accept it and let it go. If I'm in good terms with the person and I see she is proud about having got the right answer I will be happy for her and congragulate her or whatever. But as soon as this guy opens his mouth then we're back in competition mode.

I hope I was clear, I don't know. Can anyone relate? How did you escape this? Because the truth is I can never win. He probably doesn't give a damn about whether or not I'm giving the right or wrong answer, and if he gives a wrong answer he probably doesn't care either. And this is just a childish way to approach things and I'm fully aware of that but I don't know why I do it or how to escape it. 

Maybe there's a component of wanting to impress other people? As in wanting to show off myself because I'm feeling threatned? That's probably it. Wouldn't make much sense because my friends inside the class don't really get along with him and his friends very much but still I think that may be part of this. So whenever I get an answer wrong I don't personally feel like I'm dumb, I just feel like everyone else perceives me as dumb (or at least dumber than that guy) and that gets to me. That could be a part of it, I don't know. Thoughts?",23Oct2020,1

TW: suicide/self harm/alcohol

How do I (15f) cope with a heavily alcoholic mother (55f)? 

My mom has struggled with alcohol around me since summer 2018, but I know that she had problems with it as a teenager. 

At first, she would be very irritable. She would blow up at me for what I thought were strange reasons. I had no reason to suspect alcoholism as a 13 y/o. Looking back, I think she drove drunk with me in the car at least once. 

Family got involved, she stopped drinking briefly, but refused to go to rehab. Over the years, she's had issues on and off, ranging anywhere from two weeks to two months. 

I don't want to get too into the past, but I will provide a little timeline.

November/December 2018- My mom tells me that she's suicidal. She uses me as a therapist, constantly detailing how she wanted to kill herself, how she was depressed, and asked how I would cope with her suicide. This is what provoked me to tell someone else in my family. I am 13/14 years old at the time. 

January 2019- My grandma takes my mom to the ER. The alcohol had a very large effect on her liver.

February 2019- My mom ""recovers"", returns to work.

June 2019- A friend of my mom visits from out of state. The two go to a bar, despite me begging my mom not to drink. She does, and a new cycle starts.

July/August 2019- My grandparents and I go on a road trip out of state. My mom is supposed to fly up and meet us when we're one state away. Instead, she drives drunk to my dad's place, who was supposed to drive her to the airport. She tells him that I ""fear that he will stop loving me if I gain weight"" and that I'm gay. Neither are entirely true, but I couldn't bring myself to correct my dad whenever he brought up the latter. My mom still refuses rehab. 

January 2020- My mom travels to Costa Rica with the aforementioned friend. Once again, she drinks. I stay at my dad's house while my grandma takes care of her. I begin seeing a therapist for various reasons, including this. 

March/April 2020- My mom tells me that she's depressed. I suggest seeing a doctor, she refuses. I let family know about this.

This brings me to five days ago. My mom decided to have friends over with no distancing or masks. I am against this, but I have no say in the matter. It was unknown to me that these friends of hers were unaware of the alcohol problem at the time. They brought a lot of alcohol, and I assume my mom had some then. Over the next few days, she began acting strange again. I contacted family, and my grandma came to check in. My mom confessed to drinking, and was willing to work with my grandma.

She had one better day, which ended up with her going to bed at 6:30pm. She slept until my grandma came to check in at around 6pm today. I did not speak to hear until 10pm. She had been drinking a lot, and was unconscious for most of the day. I had no idea how to approach her, so I didn't. My grandma began to try to wake her up while I was in another room, and she started sobbing. She was yelling out, but I couldn't really understand anything. My grandma closed her bedroom door, but I could still hear her screaming and throwing things? Or maybe knocking them over?

Her boss stopped by our house, because he had called many times to receive no answer. My grandma said that my mom was sick, and her boss asked if it was the same ""blood thing"" from a little over a year ago. Nobody in my family knows what this means, and we assume she lied about why she was missing work.

My grandma decided to leave her alone, so she had me help her look for my mom's car keys. While looking for them, I ended up finding an empty bottle of vodka. I think she bought it two days ago. My grandma found a purse with some empty bottles in it. (This may be a bit of a stretch, but there was an item with a sticker from a neighbor town's thrift store on it. Our town doesn't sell alcohol on Sundays, so I assume she bought the other bottles in the other town on Sunday (four days ago) . (After the friends came over, I messed up my sleep schedule really badly. I was asleep during the day, so I wouldn't know if she had left or not.) ) My grandma and I ended up leaving, because she wanted to watch the debate, and my mom refused to get up,  as she was unconscious on her bathroom floor at this point. 

We came back a few hours later, and my mom was able to walk and talk to us. Her speech is really messed  up, and she has wordfinding problems. She went to bed, my grandma and I are both currently up.

Here's what I need help with:

She works for the same district that I attend school in. It's a small set of towns, and many of my teachers know her. I worry that if I reach out to anybody, word will travel quickly. I know this is already taking a toll on my grades, but I can worry about that later.

My grandma does not want to bring her to the ER, as covid is especially bad in our state. We are trying to make an appointment with my current therapist, but we have not heard back from her. My doctor's office is not currently taking new patients, and I don't know if my mom is with them. Is there anywhere else we could take her?

I cannot look my mom in the eyes without feeling terrible emotions. I am so filled with thoughts that should not be directed towards another human being. I can't bring myself to talk to her, and I refuse to be in a room alone with her. I feel so much resentment, and I want to know if I'm just being dramatic. If I am, I want to know how to overcome these feelings. I don't know that I can, as I don't think I can ever see my mom the same way after today. I feel so strongly that my relationship with her is ruined.

A few days ago, I fell back into old habits of self harm. I have no intentions of committing suicide or badly injuring myself, I guess I just didn't know what else to do. I have never mentioned a self harm habit to anybody, as I don't want my family to know about it. I tend to cut for several days in a row, and then the desire fades. I don't feel that this is an addiction, but that seems like someone with an addiction would say.

There's probably more to this, but hopefully I can see my therapist soon. If you've read this far, thank you so much. I am really really sorry if I've made your day worse, please take care of yourself.",23Oct2020,1

280,"So when I was 4 years old, my parents divorced and for about 3 years, my mom was in this constant state of stress, trying to maintain a life for both of us. Everytime I did something remotely wrong, she'd absolutely blow up at me, punishing me in some way. After the 3 years it started to get better cause she met my current stepdad, who can be a pretty chill person, but my God is he a control freak. 
Like any normal family, arguments are bound to happen, however one punishment which particularly stuck out was confiscation of an electronic. It was normally my phone, and I'm about 99% sure they'd find something slightly wrong doing to take it away. A couple years ago, they took my phone that I had recently got, because I went onto the Wifi. This went on till I was about 15. At 16, they didn't seem bothered doing it at all. Now I'm 17, and everyone went tits up with me now. So they were those huge teachers pets back in their day. Not that I'm criticizing, but I'm not a teachers pet at all. So already there's a lot of tension going around. I see school none other than 5 years of my life wasted on knowledge that I'm probably never gonna use, just so that I can get a piece of paper that says I did high school. (This is my opinion, so don't take it personally). 
Anyways, now getting to the point. So my high school started up again, and to keep it safe due to Covid, what they do is, they split all the classes in half and one half goes to school while the other stays at home and do classes online. After every week, the halves swap roles. So this week I'm at home. First red flags started showing up when my stepdad started saying I needed to raise the volume, because ""he needed to hear them"". Fuck it. Fine. Then he proceeds to leave the doors open. It is absolutely freezing in our house. So I bring this little space heater into my room so that I can stay warm. Leaving doors open is a waste of energy. Breaktime comes and so teachers aren't in yet. I go into my phone to go talk to my gf. He then proceeds to go and take my phone away, as always. I talked about it with my mom last night. And whenever I brought up anything, she just laughed at me or would say I was entitled and ungrateful. 
Because of this, I almost never talk about this with anyone. I've tried talking to my dad. But then she gets mad at me for saying stuff to him.

Ever since I started dating her, life has been very very nice. And the phone was some what an extension of that relationship, because it allowed us to keep in touch during the online week. Yes she is in my class, but she isn't the type of affectionate person, so we keep it friendly in front of our friends (we wait till we're alone to be affectionate).

I don't know what is wrong with me, I have absolutely no internal motivation to do well at school or work, everything just feels like a massive waste of time. My family all thinks I'm going to go on to be an inventor or a CEO or something simply because I was gifted as a child and scored in the top 2% for IQ. I want to do these things and I want to make something of myself but I just don't have the drive or motivation to do it, anytime I try to do classwork for an extended period of time I just get in a bad mood and can't focus even when I know it's something I have to do at some point. I'm 22 and have already wasted 2 years of my life between jumping majors and taking things slow.

I just want to find a way to live up to what I can be, make them proud and if at all possible at least be a little bit happy with my life, either that or get hit by a bus and die so they can't blame themself for my death.

I disagree with so many things in the world, it's an unfair and cruel place, and I believe that most of the people in it have just convinced themself that their current circumstance is better than being dead and that there are only a handful of people who are genuinely happy.

287,"Hi everyone!

 I'm needing a bit of advice considering a cat I got 2 days ago. 
Also I'm a first time cat owner. I tried to post this on   /adviceanimals but apparently we can't post text there so I came here.

This cat was discovered abandoned and was gifted to a friend of mine. This friend didn't had conditions to keep the cat so, after a month, gave it to me as a ""trial week"" (if everything goes okay with the cat during this week we will adopt him) .

A bit of background is that the cat, after being found abandoned on the street, was kept in a studio, all blinds down so in the dark all day with some other animals.  They never took the cat to the vets as they didn't had means for it so no vaccines, identification (its mandatory in our country) or stérilisation. Also, the cat had a tendency to hide eveytime she/he (haven't managed to check that part yet) was scared and my friend would just... take him our of the hiding grabbing by the neck skin like mama cat does...

The day we went to grab the cat she did this, the cat was hiding and she just yanked him out of the hiding spot by the neck and gave him to me, tail completely between the legs. 

I honestly don't want to think in what this cat passed before. 

Me and my boyfriend we said that we would give time to the cat, so when we got home the cat went straight to a hiding spot we let him stay there. 
Eventually he came out to eat something and actually let us pet him on the belly (the cat cake to us, layed down on the flor belly up and was purring); we didn't forced the interaction. 

The day after (yesterday), the cat spent the entire morning hiding on our spare bedroom behind the couch, we let him stay. In the afternoon he came to ask again for cuddles (I was laying down on the couch and he came to lay next to me purring). 
Everytime we try to approach him, or even if we approach where he is, he just runs away scared. 

This morning he asked again for pets. We gave him (although the cat so far is more confortable with me than with my bf so far). 

I honestly just want to give him the best life possible and that he can understands he can trust us. 

My question is:

Sometimes when he asks that we pet him, he purrs really loud, pushes his head against our hands, but then when we actually cuddle him his tail starts going back and forth really fast ? (I thought this meant he was getting pissed?) 

Also when it's play time usually he's okay only playing with his toys, but today he tried to play directly with my hands, giving it a little bite  I told him slowly no and directed him to his toys. Is this normal behaviour attacking the hands ?  

So far I try to only interact in cuddles if he comes next to us purring and asking and giving him his space, but I'm scared he won't enjoy us and try to attack us. 


Thanks in advance for all advice!",23Oct2020,1

291,"When I was with my ex wife I let her manipulate me into giving up all my dreams to pay for her to have a life. We got together young, 18. We didn't get married until I was 24 but we lived together and shared finances from early on.
  She did things like lied that she was going to school for a year while I supported us financially, constantly lied about money and dug us into deep debt. She emotionally abused me and made it hard for me to seek medical help when my jaw disorder caused my teeth to crack. I never got a driver's license. I never got to finish college. I spent nearly a decade working jobs I hated, in pain, so she could afford expensive larp gear and to eat out every meal. She would take a lunch to work, ""forget about it"" and go spend $40 on food. I had to live off food stamps. At one point she bought a $200 Japanese samurai outfit and I didn't even have a pair of shoes without holes in them or a jacket and it was rainy season.  She had me convinced that I was the bad guy for so long that even now I try to justify her actions. She told her friends I was abusive and a lot of people still believe that. And she cheated of course but that I can get over. 

Now I'm 27, divorced, I live with my mom and disabled sister who needs me to help her pay rent (she was homeless when I left my wife). I have such bad teeth that it will cost thousands to fix and I have shit credit because my ex kept the apartment in my name and I was stupid enough to believe her when she said she would stay and get a roommate. Instead she just abandoned it in the middle of the lease. I have no other debts, never even had a credit card but I can't get one approved now.  I have no local friends here. I made a little savings before we got here doing a stint where I was homeless but worked in an amazon warehouse but I had to quit that to move here and have a house to live in. I can't reapply to amazon again for a year and all that seems to be available to me locally are part time jobs that will pay my rent and nothing more. So my chances of saving up and moving away are slim to none.  

This is it. I have no local friends. I have no way out of working minimum wage bottom of the barrel jobs (with bad teeth and social anxiety I don't get hired for customer facing jobs or office jobs). I have nightmares about my ex reminding me how useless I am. And by the time I'll be able to live on my own my father who has cancer will be dead and my mother whose showing signs of alzhiemers will nees care and my disabled sister will need me.

297,"I have scoured reddit looking for good advice on work at home jobs that pays well and is basically full time if not semi-passive like selling products online but what I’m finding is copy pasted advertisement for online stuff like telemarketing that looks sketchy and scammy and the ones i google do turn out to be scams.

A little about myself and my current job: 
I’m 29, I am extremely introverted with people in person and on the phone. I have very low energy even tho i’m physically in good shape and just don’t want to go outside much. I have a horrible back from 3 distinctly horrible muscle pulls when I was younger and have a high chance of developing arthritis if not already in early stages since it’s very common in my moms side of the family.
I work in warehousing lifting boxes all day it’s destroying my back and wrists further to a point where just taking a really deep breath once pulled my back out for a few days. 

I moved a block away from the building so not have to walk much or commute and don’t have a car/can’t afford it ontop of rent anyways. 

I need a job where I can work at home 100% of the time with no video or voice interactions for the most part. Ideally, something semi-passive like selling a product online. I have basically no special skills besides enthusiast knowledge of pc building, video games and tv/movie collectibles. I just have basic high school done and then it was more important at the time to get a job and move out so I have been working ever since. I’m by no means a book smart guy I can’t get myself to retain knowledge on topics i’m not interested enough in so getting a job that requires any college or university courses completed is not an option for me. 
I looked into selling on amazon since they cover so much of the process for you, you mostly just monitor stock and watch the market for opportunities but it’s an over saturated mess it seems. I looked into making youtube videos but i’m just not upbeat enough to hold an audience i’d have to be streaming a game or making videos with a group to keep entertainment going.

What i specifically need from you good people are legitimate jobs you or a friend has actually done that can pay at least around $20CAD an hour or more from home and good explanation of the job with a link to their site if possible. Thank you! You’d really be saving my life i’m growing more and more nervous and anxious about this having no experience on paper to get me started anywhere.",23Oct2020,1
298,"Hey guys. I'm currently 18 and am taking a gap year. Next year I will be studying in university so I want to use this time to make as much money as possible, learn as much as possible, and develop side-hustles to gain experience in different areas so I always have something to fall back in case something doesn't work in the future. The problem however is that I find it hard to keep myself on pace when I don't have a like-minded partner or group of people to work with. See, I used to have a best friend in elementary school and we would have the same goals and the same hard work ethic. Unfortunately, we drifted apart, and we became two different people because of the different people we were surrounded with. Now I have another best friend which also has very similar goals to mine but he has a very, very, poor work ethic. He LOVES to talk about these goals but doesn't seem to put the work in. It's always something he'll do in the future instead of now. And I've told him that multiple times already but he just seems ignorant to that idea. So I guess I'm just trying to find a way to meet like-minded people. People who wish to develop the same skills, and people who are willing to put in all the required work for it to happen. Again, I'm taking a gap year so it's not like I have the opportunity to meet new people at school, but I am however looking for a job to take care of student loans, while I develop the skills I wish to develop. Yes, I'll meet new people but I feel like the odds of meeting someone like myself at a near-minimum wage job is slim. 

Do any of you have any stories of how you met a very good, passionate business partner? Any suggestions on how to get out there especially in these times of COVID? I know that these next few years, I will no longer have an age restriction for certain events and what not, so I'm really looking for any advice on how I can meet like-minded people and get started on my ambitions as early as possible.",23Oct2020,1
299,"So. I'll just start with today. Today, my girlfriend told me that she got a call (FaceTime) from an unknown caller who wanted to ""tell her what he feels she's like."" This was, as will become evident, a facade. The man goes on to describe my girlfriend's past, including her stained relationship with her dad and her struggles with depression. 

I was prepared to tell her he could have been guessing, but he continued:  he goes on to say that she has two cats, takes solace only in them and her boyfriend (as she frequently tells me on discord), and then he *describes what she's wearing.* 

He then goes on to reveal intimate details about her private activities, saying that she ""is too poor to buy toys so she uses the handle of a blue and black makeup brush,"" with a comment about ""you know the one.""

This is all true, even specifics on the last item. She's using an iPhone, and says nobody could have known this except for me.  What the fuck could be happening and what can I do about it?

The person says that he lives in a different state and has been friends with her on Snapchat for a few years, but I've no reason to trust that at the moment.  What can I do? Is it spyware, on an iPhone?! She can't afford a lawyer, and neither can I - we're both dependants of our parents, with her parents being very rough off financially.

Now they aren't doing this on purpose, it's just something they are doing seemingly on auto pilot without really realizing what they are doing. I just...I am kind of repulsed by it, quite frankly. I have tried bringing it up but they are almost outraged at how 'anti social' I am being.

Just today, we were talking and I jokingly called him a pedophile after he insisted this particular woman (in her late 20’s or early 30’s) was pretty and the type he’d like to get to know more. The woman was petite and cute, so I jokingly said that she was a child and that he’s a pedophile.

He immediately told me very seriously to never call him that.

I was shocked at his reaction and I immediately said I’m sorry. He ignored me after that.

Now, I usually don’t name call but the other night, he called me an asshole and gave me the finger (all in jest) - I was quite offended because it was the first time somebody did that to me, but didn’t think too much of it. Not an excuse but this made me think that if he was comfortable enough with me to do that, then he isn’t the sensitive type.

322,"I am 22, and recently moved back to uni after taking a gap year off to look after my elderly Granddad while he was dying. Throughout my childhood my mother used silent treatment, it would only end when I apologized, even if I didn't know what I had done wrong. She would then give me a forty minute lecture about how horrid I am and would compare me to people she dissaproves of.

I moved back up to uni after my Granddad passed away and I was due to become a Godparent to my best friends soon expected baby. It was first thought that Baby would have to be induced because of my best friends diabetes. I moved up earlier just in case this would happen. My Mum dropped me off at the train station and hugged and kissed me. However, when my best friend wasn't induced and was luckily left until full term to be induced, my Mum stopped talking to me. I had to find out from one of her friends why she wasn't talking to me, all I got was my Mum was unhappy my friend wasn't induced 'on time' and that I came up early for it. In two weeks of being up here again, I got a job caring for children with disabilities- my mum said I wouldn't get a job. She did not call me to say congrats or anything like that. Then my younger sister left a suicide note (luckily did not attempt) and I only got told by my dad two weeks later (mum didn't even put aside whatever her grudge was to talk to me about my sister). I have tried to contact her but get nowhere. She has now unfriended and blocked me on facebook and is telling her friends that I am the one not contacting her.

The silent treatment hurts so much- it is almost physical pain (I know that sounds dramatic). It has now been two and a half months since she last spoke to me. I am absolutely exhausted with this walking on egg shells thing. If it wasn't me in trouble, one of my siblings or my dad would be in trouble. My dad is still talking to me fine, we chat nearly everyday, he doesn't even get why mum is angry at me.

In January (2020), my mum asked me why I was taking anti depressents. I said, so I don't jump off a bridge (please note this wasn't said in anger, I was just trying to be honest), then mum said back to me 'well, how do you think I felt on Christmas day'. On christmas day, she had been shouting at dad about the hoover not working and dad was crying because he was stressed, so I stepped in (for the first time in my life) to try and calm them both down. She stormed off an said I had ruined her day.

There are so many more stories I could give about the times she has given silent treatment, but I honestly just am too tired to write it. I don't know what to do- so much of me just wants to give in and call her and listen to her rant, just so it can go back to normal until the next time. But the adult part of me says that if I don't stand up for myself now, she will never respect me. Any advice?",23Oct2020,1
323,"So a little story

Friend A let's call him ""George"" lost his job as a fabric engineer and friend B let's call him ""Jim"" offered to hire him as a assistant on his machinery shop. After 9 months of everyday friction they go offended with each other for stupid reasons ( they couldn't separate work from friendship).

We are all in the same group for over 6 years.

So George decided to leave and I guess Jim got offended by that because as most business men thinks he has the best workplace around.

I have talked with both of them separately and they both seem to want to solve their differences but they both want the other person to come and kneel before them . 

So the problem is boths EGO. 

All this time I have chosen to separate myself from their drama and asked them to not tell me those idiotic reasons each other thinks the other was wrong.

I am thinking of getting them together in a neutral place and try to resolve this conflict.

I am thinking of taking this steps.

1.getting them a bit tipsy not too much 2. Asking each other to let go of his ego (if its possible) and think of some situation that he was wrong at those 9 months 3. Asking each other to think of some situation the other person in their opinion was in the wrong. 4. ???

And here are the questions

In case things escalate physically how do I difuse it, ( I am thinking of tazzing both of them) 😛

How else can I make this situation easier for them to accept it and back down?",23Oct2020,1

327,"Me (18F) used to be the typical shy girl with a lot of insecuirities and stuff. 

Few years ago realised that I didn't liked the way I was and have been trying to change for better since then, it's been hard but already achieved lots of little things I'm proud of ( small but close group of friends, improved my selfesteem etc..)

Even thought I'm more sociable now, is still difficult for me opening up to others and making new friendships, plus the fact that having to interact with many people drains my energy and left me super tired so I wouldn't be able even if I wanted (I'm good with this part of my personality and not trying to change it, not everybody can be the soul of the party and it's okay)

Having put everyone in context I'm gonna explain the main issue because of my mom thinks I'm an ashole.

Last month I started school, my class was a small one because of the covid ( just fourteen people) but didn't knew anyone anyway.

First days everyone was pretty nice, trying to made friends and gave good impressions, me too, but already noticed that they just weren't my kind of people, even thought still tried.

Later like the half of the class resulted to be, as I feared before, the kind of people with who I just can't get along, so I decided to stop trying to reach out to them because I wasn't really comfortable.

Then one day they stopped being nice and started to more less ignore the rest of us.

I found this a little bit rude because even if you are not friends with someone still can have a good relatioship, more reason to if you are gonna see them like every day of the week for a long time.

Anyway I've made one friend, another girl who didn't fit well with the others and actually I'm better with her than with the others, and not feeling like I should still try to reach out to the other group.

I'm pretty happy with my current situation, don't feel like a weirdo or anything but my mom thinks I'm doing wrong, that I'm returning to be an antisocial and that I should try to be friends with the guys of the other group cause they are more normal and will make me good.",23Oct2020,1
328,"This is a throw away account cause tbh I’m quite embarrassed. 

Now I feel really dumb for this. I’m (17f) and I only have a permit. I feel as if my permit test and the (very little) preparation for it did not prepare me for operating a car. Now here’s the thing, I was driving with my dad. It was a more busy street then I had been use to and so I asked my dad to let me take a turn on a side road. He let me, I made two wide a turn and hit someone on their driver side door who was attempting to make a left. They were at a complete stop and the accident is completely my fault.  I wasn’t going any faster then 5 MPH and the airbags didn’t deploy. Everyone was okay and the car was of very little value In her words. She said she was about to get a new car anyway, and it happened that her family owned an auto collision business. Our car winded up with little damage and we were able to zip tie the bumper back on fine. Her car had the most damage. the claim was made and resolved quickly cause I’m not an asshole and of course I’m gonna tell them it was my fault and own up to it. 

The issue is I have crippling anxiety over the situation. It was a few weeks ago, but as effected my sleeping (I can’t sleep and I have nightmares about car accidents when I do sleep usually involving pedestrians or accidentally seriously injuring someone even though nobody was Injured in the accident I was involved in), sometimes my dad helps me with math homework but I feel random surges of panic as sometimes I will have minor  Ig flashbacks(idk if that’s the right word) to it, I try to avoid getting in the car and if I do I usually keep my eyes closed as to avoid anxiety about being in a car, I had driving lessons (with a formal driving school in a formal driving school car with a passenger side break. The car I had crashed was just my dads car with no passenger side break) but as soon as I was out behind the wheel I had a breakdown and couldn’t drive. I keep asking my mom to cancel lessons although they aren’t very understanding to how this has effected me, as I feel it is wasting money at this point to keep me going through the same cycle of breaking down behind the wheel and not driving at all during the lesson. 

Basically I’m asking if a there is any services that teach me how to drive before actually getting into the car. Drivers Ed isn’t an option as I am home schooled and they are only provided around the public schools here for some reason. 


Two is there anyway to get over the guilt and anxiety or any therapies that anyone else have used to get over drivers anxiety? I have GAD already  which I receive treatment for so this situation didn’t really help that. I just want to get back to normal but it’s harder then I thought it would be.

329,"The obligatory you cannot use or copy my post in any form. 

Okay, so some background to explain things a little.I (24) had really really crowded teeth until recently. My parents had a very nasty divorce during my sophomore year of high school. My dad is a very petty person and our relationship suffered from the divorce. He left my mom with nothing to raise us yet did the whole poor me routine. Now they talked about me getting braces then the divorce happened and neither could afford it alone. Flash forward a couple years, my mom met a great guy who treats my sisters and I as his own. As in helping paying for our education and getting to know us as us. All three decide a year ago to pay for my braces since they always said they would do it when I was younger. Now my dad talked bad about my mom even though at that point my stepdad and mom was paying it all. My mom got fed up and said you need to pay your half. Thing is my dad would always try to take credit of paying things that my mom and Sd did with his family.  He said fine and signed a contract with my orthodontist. Well a couple months ago my orthodontist called saying that they haven't recieved any thing.  Turns out he never made a single payment. I want to just say forget it and pay the 1000 even though it would hurt my budget but it's not fair to my mom. She has always done everything and I know she would feel hurt if I let him get away with it.  How do I talk to my dad about him not making the payments like he promised?",23Oct2020,1

I (20F) live in Texas and pepper spray is legal here. However,  it is illegal to posses it at my workplace. I’ve gotten harassed (includes but not limited to: threatening me at register after I don’t flirt back with them, stalking me around the store, waiting for me in the parking lot to get off work and following me home, making extreme sexual remarks at me several times and becoming aggressive when I tell them to leave, etc), several times by customers and I’m made to work shifts alone late night, even though I’ve asked repeatedly to work morning shifts. Out of all these times I’ve been harassed, I’ve called the cops for all
Those times but I’ve always been told there’s nothing they can do and they never send anyone to the store (except for one time. When a man was literally waiting for me to get off work in the parking lot and he’d come into the store to harass me 4 times already in 1 hour and he ended up getting arrested after my third call
To the cops). 
I want to start carrying pepper spray in my bag in case I need to defend myself. I figured it’s better than nothing. My question is, if I end up having to use it on someone as self defense, how much trouble can I get in, considering that I shouldn’t have even had it in the first place? 

I would quit my job but I have bills and school to pay for and this is the only job I’ve been able to find. I’ve tried looking for other jobs already but no one is hiring because of everything being shut down.

I struggle to focus at most things in life and I can't apply myself the way I want to in gaming. The only game I can try at is the gun game on call of duty. Whenever I play that game my mind clicks with it. I'll call this (competitive instinct) I'm able to aim good I can take people out with ease and I would say I'm above average at it. However, I cannot put this competitive instinct into literally anything. Let's say I switch to team death match now.

346," I don't know where I should put this, so I'm going to put it here. This is my first reddit post so please bear with.

Before lockdown (march, where i am) I was training for a job. I don't want to be too specific because I don't know if anyone I'm close to has a reddit account or not, but it's a job that requires interacting with other people and right now, I don't know how comfortable I am with doing that.

(I also didn't get to finish the training, and this point, I don't know when I will, or even if I will.)

My parents have been bugging me to get a job for a while now and I was trying before everything went to shit, and I am still trying, but every time I apply I either get an email back saying something along the lines of 'you aren't the right fit but we wish you the best, blah blah blah' or I just get radio silence. I never get to the interview stage. (Sidenote: they always compare me to my sibling, who's had two jobs in their life and has never been rejected. It irks me greatly.)

I have done one shift of this job i trained for, and needless to say I HATED it. It was mortifying. I was shitting bricks the whole time, I could feel everyone's eyes watching me as I did it, and I walked away from that shift with about TEN FUCKING POUNDS. I hated it, and I never wanted to do it again.

I have been asked to do another shift of this job (the shifts are irregular) and I really do not want to. Every time I think about it I feel like I'm going to vomit, and given that I'm panicking about it so much, it's all i think about. (I'm literally shakingvas i write this, which i know sounds ridiculous but please believe me.)

Despite the fact that I found the first experience so honestly horrifying, there are other reasons as to why I'm not so comfortable with doing it right now. As I have previously mentioned, it involves interacting with a group of people and given the current situation regarding COVID, I'm not very comfortable with doing that. (For context, I live in an area classified as Tier 2, which for those outside of the UK, is how our prime minister has decided to classify COVID-19 effected areas.)

I have also had a wheezy chest as of late (since late August, as far as I am aware) mainly when I'm doing exercise. This job requires varying amounts of exercise, but I feel like my parents won't see this as a good enough reason not to do this job.

They probably won't see my COVID worry as a good enough reason either, since I am a young person and (according to them) 'won't suffer as badly if I get it'. I have repeatedly made the point that, whilst yes, statistically that may be true, I still don't WANT TO GET IT AT ALL!!! I don't want to even put myself at RISK of getting it. I could also bring it back to them, and that seems to be their only worry about me getting it.

348,"I know the title seems weird but hear me out. I've had many moments in my life where I've kept quiet even when I've wanted to voice my feeling. For example, this one situation that has lead me here. 

So I've a best friend who i love to the moon and back and she does too, i know. We used to go to the same school but almost 2 years back we changed schools and now we go to different ones. Even then we are really close and used to hangout and talk every single day. She has a bf (also my good friend) who she's really attached with and who also went to our school but now goes to a different one which is a little far away. He stays at his school hostel and they have some strict rules about cell phones and all, so they didn't get to talk a lot.But since covid, he's been home (since march) and they do talk a lot now and I'm very happy for her cause i know how much she misses him when he's not around.

As i said we used to talk every single day(she was the one who called me most of the times) and we always used to joke about how ours days wouldn't end peacefully if we both haven't once called eachother and laughed our asses off. But recently with we both have almost stopped talking. She told me how she's stressed for exams and classes so she doesn't get much time, which i totally understand bc I've been going thru the same. But then i see she's online most of the time and her bf is also online at the same time (ik it's pathetic of me for even checking) and when i call her, her phones busy most of the times. The only time she calls me now is to ask doubts about studies. And even when we get to talk, she would say she has to go or that her bf is calling.
 Also apart from school and covid these few months have been very hard on me for personal issues. There have been frequent times where i feel really low. She has always been the kinda person that would not leave me alone unless i tell her what's wrong and even after that she would call me frequently to ask if I'm okay. So even now when she calls me, my first thought is that now I've explain everything to her. But she doesn't even ask now, she just says like oh you're upset and that's it. Idk it just stings.
(Previously also there has been moments like this but i always thought that was justifiable cause she used to spend time with us too.) 

She has always told me that if she does something then i should simply tell her. But I don't know how  to tell her this or if i should even tell her. I know she's really attached to her bf and I really don't want her to be upset or feel bad for talking to her bf. I really don't know what to do.

I'm worried because I know if we stay here our lives will be kind of boring here, the best form of local entertainment is literally going for a walk in the park. But living in a huge city like Shanghai or tienjin would be so exciting. 

I know no one can make this decision for me and I have to make it myself but I'm a bit lost and scared of suddenly permanently moving to China.

355,"I’ve been really depressed for a long time maybe since March. I got out of a really toxic relationship in March and I also lost my job in March due to the virus.

All I want to do is sleep, I have no appetite which is bad because I also have gastritis, so prolonged starvation can cause an ulcer. At this point I feel like I have no will to live.

I thought I was a good person but I don’t know why life is just testing me so much. It’s like I have to force myself to wake up , to eat, to shower.

356,"CONTEXT: I am the eldest daughter in a family of five. I have a younger brother and a younger sister, both of whom I love so much. They are good and nice. I have a stay-at-home mom who is kind and caring. My father is a piece of shit.

I graduated in 2019 and since then I have been supporting my family by giving them half of my salary. When I graduated, I thought I would just have to help out the family. But before I knew it, I have become the breadwinner. My father does not have a stable income. He's a driver for a ride-hailing company but their work hours is completely up to them. If he doesn't feel like driving, he doesn't and he is left with no income for the day. If my mom even tries to talk to him about it, he would get mad and yell for all the neighbors to hear.

Despite being a good person, this, of course, causes my mother so much pain and stress. She does not have her own money. All the money I give goes to bills and sometimes for food when my father does not give her any. So she self-pities, complains, and breaks down often.

It makes me feel so bad that I cannot give her an easier life, but I know that that should not be my responsibility. That is also why I set boundaries such as not to give any more money than I usually give. I have to have some left for my savings and personal allowance, because there is literally no one else I can lean on for financial assistance.

Every time I hear her self-pity, complain, or break down, I feel so bad because it has been so hard and it is not a situation I can easily get out of. It makes me feel guilty that I can't make it better for her. I don't know what to do. I want to leave home and live independently, but I can't leave my siblings. We can't leave our father because I can't support the entire family by myself. My mother did not finish college nor does she have any skill that might get her a job.

I have spoken to my father multiple times over the years. He doesn't say anything whenever I do. I have stopped talking to him. He tries to talk to me when he needs to borrow money, which he doesn't pay back so I've also stopped lending him.

TO ADD, this has not always been our situation. My father used to be a salesman and we owned a business. He had a mistress whom he got pregnant. In 2016, the woman demanded that he take the child and my father was all too willing to oblige. We were accepting but we did not want the child to live with us, so the only choice left was my grandparents. When even my grandparents didn't want to, my father rebelled by spending all our money on gambling. He would spend 4-5 figures each night. We only had our business then because he lost his job as a salesman. He scammed a lot of people and nobody would trust him anymore. So we fell into debt. He had to sell our car to pay for our tuition fee. We had to move from a three-storey house to a studio unit. Our one bed now lies just infront of the kitchen sink.

I don't know what to do. I can't live like this anymore. If I didn't have to pay bills at home, I do well enough to live on my own.

TL;DR I am the eldest daughter and family breadwinner, because my father is too lazy to support the family. I want to leave home because living with my family has been so bad for my mental health, but I can't leave my mother and two siblings with no financial support.",23Oct2020,1

358,"Preface: all names have been changed.

My (29F) Mom is one of 6 children. Last week my grandparent (Sam) died and they’ve now read the will. The money was split 6 ways. 4 of the children are getting their share. But for 2 of the children, the money has been left to their children (the grandchildren) instead of them. I’m one of those grandchildren. There are other Grandchildren who got nothing. There’s no gambling, or drug addiction issues, so it’s confusing. My Mom is really upset and grieving. She thought her and Sam had a good relationship. She took Sam on international vacations. She made frequent visits back east after we moved away 15 years ago. As far as I know, Mom hasn’t done anything wrong. 

It’s not a huge amount of money in the long run, but for me, a 29 year old, in between jobs (because of COVID-19) it would really make a difference in my life. I’ve got my wedding coming up in 2021. 

I’m feeling really pressured to send the entire amount to my Mom. She views it as her inheritance and is not going to split it 50/50 with me. She’s financially stable, and she isn’t struggling.

I loved Sam. We got on really well. We don’t know what Sam's intentions were with the will. I guess I’m also confused because I don’t know if Sam really wanted me to have the money, or wanted to punish my Mom for something. 

Three of my cousins, David (35M), Lawrence (28M), and Michael (36M), are going to transfer the money straight back to their Mom.  They are all established in their careers, and the money wouldn’t make a huge impact in their lives.

I don’t want to cause family drama, but I need this money a lot more than they do. I feel like they can’t empathise with how much this money could help.  David’s messaging me and putting the pressure on. Saying the money isn’t mine. Telling me to look at how upset my Mom is and just do the ""right thing” by sending it to my Mom. 

Should I give my Mom all the inheritance? Half? Less?

TLDR; I have been left money in my Grandparents will, Mom was left out. I need this money. I don’t want her to hate me. ",23Oct2020,1
359,"I'll try to keep it short as possible. I had a run-in with a textbook narcissist guy on Discord who turned out to be a nasty piece of work, not only collecting and sharing sexually-charged gore images of underage anime characters (still against Discord ToS even if it's just drawings), but also a serial emotional abuser/manipulator who has hurt many already-vulnerable people to the point where they eventually couldn't take it anymore and thankfully broke free (most of them, anyway). I had met and spoken with many of these individuals, gotten their testimonies, and plenty of evidence, both of the abuse and the images.

First, I took the non-confrontational approach and quietly reported him to Discord. Nothing came of it. I reported him again with even more evidence than last time, plus with other people joining in reporting. Again, silence from the Discord Team. I had thought about reporting to the police, but figured nothing could come of it since his images are drawings, not real children.

This guy is being allowed to roam free on the platform, where he's engaging with several vulnerable people (including minors) daily. I couldn't stand by that. So, I issued a detailed PSA on social media with evidence urging people to stay away. He eventually discovered my post and went ballistic, claiming that all the evidence was ""taken out of context,"" ""all from 2018-2019,"" anything to make it sound less bad than it really is (he was lying, as I had included recent evidence). He also tried to twist it and turn me into the bad guy by claiming that my post caused him to have a panic attack so bad that an ambulance was called.

My goal isn't to hurt the guy. It's to keep vulnerable people away from him. Because I don't want other people seeing his reply and falling for his gaslighting, I have plenty of additional evidence to respond with that he won't have plausible excuses to (very recent stuff less than a month old, stuff that is inexcusable no matter the context, etc). People deserve to know the truth so they can stay safe. But if this guy is really this unstable, I don't want him hurting himself or worse because he couldn't stand being held accountable for his abuse. All of the people I've talked to (including those who were in abusive relationships with him for years) have said he's the kind of person to talk big about hurting himself but never actually follows through with it, but it's still something that makes me uneasy.

365,"To give some background, my (20F) boyfriend (22M) and I have been dating for about 9 months. At the beginning of the relationship, we had “the talk” about if we’ve been tested for STIs, if I’m on birth control (yes to both of those - I’m very meticulous about taking the pill each day), etc. Well, I have a rule for myself that I won’t have sex with someone who is not pro-choice because I need to know that if I accidentally got pregnant (as contraceptives are not 100% effective), I would be supported in choosing an abortion. I made it crystal clear that I would very likely have an abortion in that situation, and he told me that he is pro-choice and would support what I wanted. So I covered all my bases! We were good to go and have been for the last 9 months.  

I have multiple reasons why I would likely choose an abortion, which he has learned over time. First of all, I have body dysmorphia (and OCD, anxiety, and depression — and have been in therapy and on medication for 7 years). I have deeply internalized fatphobia and am scared to death of gaining weight. It’s a struggle that has consumed my life since I was a preteen. As you can see, pregnancy would be my worst nightmare. I hope to reach a point in my life where I am strong enough to experience it, but I know with absolute certainty that it would destroy my mental health right now (or any time soon). Second, as I stated above, I take multiple antidepressants that are not safe to take during pregnancy, so I would have to stop taking them. Once again, I hope to reach a point in my life where I don’t depend on medication, but right now it is a vital part of managing my mental health. Additionally, I’m still an undergrad and want to go to grad school. I have career plans, and I’m excited for them. Finally, I am passionate, if not obsessive (good ole OCD), about maintaining my bodily autonomy because I haven’t always had it.  I was sexually assaulted many times (by the same person) when I was in high school. Thus, having all options open to me is very important. Although I think I would likely have an abortion, I recognize that I wouldn’t truly know what I wanted unless I was actually in that situation. 

Today, my bf and I were talking about the election and I expressed my concerns about the Supreme Court Nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, considering her stance on abortion. I told him that if she were to be appointed and hypothetically reverse Roe v Wade, I couldn’t have sex anymore. One might think that, if anything, he would be upset about (hypothetically) not getting laid anymore, but he was upset that I am only having sex with him because I can (and probably would) get an abortion. He said that’s immoral to him. He believes people should have access to abortion, but that you shouldn’t have sex just because you can one. I don’t think anyone would disagree with the latter, but I personally don’t think that’s what I’m doing. We always use contraception, so I am not banking on the fact that I can get an abortion as a form of birth control. Chances are we won’t ever be put in this hypothetical situation (knock on wood), but he has known since day one that abortion is something I would strongly consider if it were to happen. His opinion is that he has sex with me because he loves me while I have sex with him only because I can get an abortion, and that is extremely concerning and immoral to him. In my opinion, I have sex with him because I love him, but I am comfortable doing so because I know no matter what happens I will have bodily autonomy and can decide what’s best for me. If Roe v Wade was to be overturned, I would lose that certainty of bodily autonomy. Every time we would have sex, I would think about how it could cost me the right to make decisions about my body and force me to go through pregnancy - my own personal hell. That’s why I wouldn’t want to have sex anymore. He interprets it as me banking on having an abortion, without discussing it with him at all, even if he wanted to keep the baby. I was very confused about all of this because he has told me since day one that he’s pro-choice and wouldn’t want a baby any time soon either, and he has reiterated this a few times throughout our relationship. He has always known the decision I would likely make, and how my bodily autonomy is incredibly important to me. 

He says I have ignored everything he has said and that he can’t get over the fact that I’m only having sex with him because I could get an abortion. I’m still very confused. Am I not thinking clearly? Am I ignoring the point he’s trying to make without realizing it? What am I missing?",23Oct2020,1

 As the title implies, I have hysterical laughter ""attacks"" from time to time. I've been having this issue for a long time, but it never was a big problem. I spend most of my time alone, I'm always muted when VC, etc. It's been pretty easy to deal with. 
I am planning on going unmuted to chat with my internet friend more easily. I would like to keep the issue private and not to tell him, because I'm ashamed of it. But I'm also afraid of an sudden attack hitting me while we are in VC. We have already slightly covered the topic without me telling what the exact problem is. As the result, I had a heavy attack in the middle of the night.
 My attacks are random and usually not triggered by anything particular, uncontrollable and can last from 5 minutes to 40\~ at worse. I have trouble talking because of throat pain afterwards. I did a small research already, I have not had any brain trauma, I do not suffer from depression and overall I have no major issues that can be the cause of it. I do have an emotion surpression issue and insomnia, but not sure if it's related. Here where I live, an attempt to seek professional help will raise eyebrows, plus covid is still a problem.

A few days ago i got caught shoplifting and my parents were devastated and lost all trust in me, rightfully so. They took away every communication or electronic device i have until ""ive learned my lesson"". I talked to them a day after about what i was feeling, how bad i felt, and what i was thinking. Our bond got better after that and i felt like we both felt better about everything. Without any way to contact my friends, I needed to talk to them about what was going on and started using an old phone as best as i could. Regardless of the rules my parents set of no electronics. (Which i think doesnt make sense but moving on) And my dad caught me tonight using it, the humiliating thing for me (but kinda funny at the same time) is that i was watching gay porn. My dad, being angry and stubborn, wouldnt let it go when i said no to telling him the password. I honestly dont have a single clue how he got in as i locked it and didnt tell him the password. He showed me the porn and i starting crying. It was so embarrassing and humiliating as this is how my dad had to find out. And i am nowhere near ready to come out, im still in denial and shame. He asked me all these questions and i basically said im bisexual, to which he basically responded with i love you but i dont agree with it at all. He said he doesnt know me anymore which is understandable but it feels like he doesnt accept me. He left and my mom came in a few moments later. She asked why i was crying so much and i told her what my dad caught me doing. I kind of switched the story that i told my mom as i was in a panic during all of it. And told her im still not sure but considering that im ""bi."" She reassured me that no matter what she loves me and will support me.

382,"hi everyone, so i am 20 years old and have been struggling with drinking since i was around 18. i stopped in July but these past two weeks have just triggered my drinking and ive only been sober since Wednesday morning. i struggle with depression, anxiety and ptsd. but since i got out the mental hospital in July i stopped drinking. i did have issues again but not as bad because i felt like i had really good friends at work that understood what i was going through and some of them claimed to have other mental disorders or have grown up in the same childhood. needless to say, i got attached. but almost two weeks ago, my ex boyfriend broke up with me in a pretty shitty way, i tried to talk to my friends about it and they kinda pushed me off. i totally get it, we all have our problems! but i started drinking and this time i did some stupid stuff that i really regret and can’t get off my mind. i tried calling them and reaching out for help for the first time. i was was drinking so much i was blacking out, i had suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. my only way of knowing how to get through was of course to kill myself. i tried reaching out for help one more time to them, i even tried the suicide hotline 3 times and they were no help, they almost seemed mad at me. but i went home that night and just drank some more and tried to take some pills and slit my wrists. the only person to help me was the girl i was in the hospital with. she’s a blessing, i told her all the stupid things i have done and she is trying to get me help. i guess i just wanted to know has anyone else done stupid regretful shit while going through what i am? and if so, could you please leave a comment? i am just so disgusted with myself and i hope i am not alone. thank you everyone.",23Oct2020,1

Every time I have to comment on something, it costs me.  Maybe it is because there are no bases on which to decide.  Normally if someone decides something then I keep the opinion of that person, but then if someone else comes then I would be confused and accept their opinion and thus I am constantly unable to have an opinion, believe and fight for it.  Maybe it's because I don't usually investigate what I have to say.  I don't know, my parents and others have always reminded me that I am insecure.  I don't want to be like this anymore.  What I do?

387,"In short I've been fucked over. I'm 16 and started college back in September which was great except it just really wasn't for me, and I realised I didn't actually want to go to this fancy school with hour long bus journeys and a 15 minute hike up a hill to get there, along with the strenuous workload and all the extra baggage that comes with going to a sixth form college. 

On a particularly bad day I got home and was completely fed up with it, so me and my mum went online to apply to a college a lot closer and a lot more relaxed and choose subjects tailored more to where I want to go in life, I have a friend in one of those classes and he said it was pretty empty so it gave me hope that I'd have a chance of getting in, fatal mistake. Over a week later my mum calls up to check how my application is going as we hadn't heard anything since we applied. In short, the lady on the phone thought I was applying to start next September as all the courses were full due to having to cut down class sizes from covid - fantastic.

So now I have about a week left until half term is over and I have no clue what to do. I live in a rural area in the UK so colleges are scarce and there aren't many opportunities at all for higher education. I don't want to choose any random vacant subjects and throw my life into something I have no passion for but at the same time I don't have many other options.

393,"TL:DR AT BOTTOM

Hi, I (17M) have a hard time believing my (18F) girlfriend on a lot of things she says, and I also have a hard time separating regular thoughts from anxious thoughts. (We've been dating for a year by the way) 

Firstly, let me just start by saying, my girlfriend hasn't done anything too serious to make me have trust issues, and I've had them before her. Also, she's a really good girlfriend and outside of this, we have a good, fun, loving relationship and our communication is pretty good, too.

She has lied to me about things, but all of them included her not telling me about how she feels about certain things. For example, one time she basically felt like our relationship was always up and down and she lied and said she never said this. I feel like it's because she's not the best at expressing her emotions, but she's gotten better recently.

However, this adds to my trust issues and while I understand why she may not have wanted to tell me about her feelings, it did end up being worse for me. 
I just have a genuinely hard time trusting her on certain things, and that sucks because I don't want to break up with her and I want to spend my life with her. 

I'm a very anxious person, and I tend to worry about everything one can worry about in a relationship. I worry about:
-If I love her
-If she loves me
-If shes cheating
-If I will cheat in the future (which I don't plan on doing)
-If we will last

I also take things she says and I blow it out of proportion, if she sends me a text that I feel sounds weird, I'll just assume its because she's uninterested, she doesn't love me, and she wants to break up. 

Even if she tells me otherwise, it's still hard to believe. She straight up told me ""...you are the only one so yeah you're wrong"" and that just made me feel weird? She's pretty understanding, but sometimes I feel like a burden and that I just do more harm than good. 

Sometimes, I don't even understand my own feelings. If I don't smile, laugh, be happy, or feel that ""spark"" while talking to her, I get worried that it's because I don't love her. That also makes me confused about which things I feel are genuine and which things are me forcing myself to smile. It's all just so confusing. Even if I can rationally disprove these thoughts, it doesn't make them go away.

Also, please don't suggest I break up with her, because that's the last thing I want. She's really nice, caring, funny, smart, and beautiful. I feel I just have a problem that I need help dealing with. Also, please if you could, give a suggestion besides ""go to therapy"" because I've heard that one and I'm working on it. If you have any personal experiences, that would help a lot. Sorry if I sound picky, thank you.

TLDR: I have a hard time believing things my girlfriend says due to my trust issues that I've been dealing with for a long time, and I also have been dealing with a lot of intrusive thoughts and relationship anxiety.",23Oct2020,1

395,"So I'm currently in my first semester of college. My college makes you declare your major before you even start (i.e. you apply to your major rather than the school as a whole). I'm currently a chemical engineering major. I also plan on taking a minor in German Studies because I love the German language age (until now) have been learning it for 5 years.

Last night, though, I had a bit of a crisis after waking up at midnight. I took a look at the degree pathway for my current major and took a look at the pathway for my planned minor. When I looked at the path for my major (chemical engineering), I didn't really feel all that inspired. I just saw ""Chemistry II"", ""Physics I"", ""Principles of Engineering"" and so on and so forth. But when I looked at the German studies minor and saw ""Northern Renaissance Art"", ""The Holocaust"", ""Old English"", ""From Beowulf to Tolkien"", I got excited. Like, really excited. I thought those things were so much more exciting and interesting than the courses dictated by my major. It got me thinking, why am I studying something I don't necessarily enjoy? Of course, the answer is because there's a lot of money in it, but I'm not sure that's a reason I like. 

So, while I'm not sure what major I'd change to (probably History or Theater Arts), my question is: should I be studying something that I enjoy and that excites me or should I keep studying something that I'm not as invested in, but will provide a very solid and lucrative future?",23Oct2020,1
396,"So, last month I lost my grandma and I’m still dealing with the grief; I’m not constantly crying anymore, but there’s still this hollow aching in my chest.

My mom and her boyfriend are out of town and my sister has been staying at my grandpa’s house to take care of him (he’s on oxygen and probably doesn’t have much time left).

397,"I’m thinking of quitting my job in December. 

My boss always been notoriously difficult to work with, but it’s been worse since WFH and he’s driving me crazy. Everything he says is an insult or criticism (often in front of others) when I’m often working more than the hours I’m paid for (at a rate lower than others in my field) and trying my best. 

I’ve asked him to approach me directly if he has issues with my performance, but in that conversation he said he had no issue with my performance. I’m pretty sure this job is what has contributed most to my severe anxiety over the past few years and I’m over it. 

My plan is to focus on finishing my masters in time to get a position in a new city I’m very very likely to land. Quitting my job will allow me to work full time and have time for interviews/recruitment/moving out of state. My resume is great, but I feel a lot of guilt because I’ve been an integral part of this project for years and it’s likely it will be disbanded or significantly changed when I leave. I’ll be leaving a few people in difficult positions, including my boss. 

This plan will also mean I won’t be able to save for a down payment to get a home this year, but I’ll be able to stay with family for a year or two to save back up. I’ll take out student loans as well, which will bring my balance back up to the amount I borrowed in undergrad (25k). I’m not too worried about paying it back, but it wipes out all of my repayments from the past year. 

I was planning on sticking it out to save money and get my degree paid for, but this is seriously impacting my mental health and I’ve had urges to self harm after his latest “call out” in front of 50 people where he called my work pointless. I’ve stayed so long because I believe in the project we created, but at this point I just want a fresh start.

I recently left my job and knew a position was coming available with a different branch of the same organization, so I spoke to her about being a reference. She agreed to give me a glowing review, but reiterated that she wanted me for herself and they had a position coming open soon. I don't know why I never heard about the first job (that's a separate story), but I just turned in the application for the job at her branch a few days ago and I'm afraid it may stop at HR before making its way to her.

404,"I’ve normally been pretty good at being able to see where people’s opinions and choices come from. 

I debated as part of a team throughout my university years and from abortion to Trump to religion, I’ve almost alway been able to recognise the humanity behind the opinion, even when the opinions were wildly, *wildly* different to my own. I could at least see parts of their views I could understand or recognise. 

I am Irish and, as of two days ago, my country is in a complete lockdown again (apart from schools). This is because our numbers are pretty high and our health service, while decent, is small since we are a small country. It will become overwhelmed quite easily. 

I’ve been really, really struggling with feeling bitter and angry towards the many people I know who are ignoring lockdown rules, or only choosing to follow the ones that don’t inconvenience them. I am by no means perfect, that’s not what I’m trying to imply. But I have watched so many people I know, and people I don’t know, fail to even try. Everybody fails sometimes but I’m finding it hard to be open-minded towards those who fail to even try. 

These are people I went to school with, people from my university, who I otherwise felt no bad feelings towards. And now, suddenly, I am feeling really hostile and angry towards them. I don’t express it of course but, I still feel it and feel not only unhappy, but guilty. 

I’m finding it really difficult to understand their points of view or understand the logic they are using in order to ignore the pandemic that is happening right now. It’s not healthy for my own mental health which is already compromised, since I am living with two parents over the age of sixty with (minor) health conditions and one who is forced to work throughout lockdown, and I have not socialised since March (except for two coffees with a friend, which were allowed at the time). 

How are people who are believers in Covid-19/follow lockdown guidelines coping with this? I don’t want to feel so much anger and hostility towards people who are, otherwise, decent people. But I just can’t seem to find the common ground or even begin to understand their logic. It’s really getting me down and making me feel guilty for feeling so bitter. 

I understand in theory that I can’t control other people’s actions and shouldn’t become upset over things I can’t control, but it’s like I forget that the moment I see an Instagram story of somebody I went to school with at a house party etc.

At first I thought it might be a commonality or coincidence but since it has happened several times I can't overlook it anymore. She's also great at criticizing stuff that she has no actual knowledge of practice in and has to assert herself in being right. I don't know if I should tell her that she gets offended too easily and should stop seeking validation. Even when I treat her food I don't expect anything back but she does and it's kind of awkward. I'm not sure if it's worth keeping in touch with her anymore because I feel that she is playing some games and I don't deal with people who do that anymore. Also why is she copying the way I talk?They say imitation is flattery but I'd rather talk to another individual than another version of me.

408,"Hi Guys,

This is my first post here, and I'm stuck in a load of crap figuratively, any advice will be much appreciated.

I'm an Indian guy, met an Indian girl through arranged marriage services with the approval of my parents. I'm an inexperienced guy in terms of relationships and I was very shy. I had met with a lot of women before through this app but my interactions with them fizzled out in days. So this girl I met, she's funny, we share some same distant friends she's adorable and all, We started texting each other for a month and I realized she shares some quirks with me, she is funny, she is cute she says the right things, she is liberal and progressive minded, good at her job. I started getting fond of her and one day she opened up to me about a slight physical disability which was also not told to me initially I also discover she's a bit shorter than me which wasn't properly conveyed to me when I came across her profile. I'm 5'7 but she is less than 4'11 which she put in her profile as 5'0. I didnt mind this at first because I fell hard for her. I told her about my interests in being a musician, how much I love to start my own band and all, she is very supportive of the same. Soon enough, like how it is in India, I went with my family and met her and I realized she isn't as financially ahead as I thought she was. Which as well I didn't mind. My parents weren't that impressed but I fought for her and made them move forward with the relationship.

That's when I started over analysing the relationship and her in general, which I am very guilty about. I realise that if I say something that she doesn't like or agree with she just stops interacting with me completely, she withdraws and doesn't participate in any conversation, she gets sad very fast and since I hate making her feel sad I give up and compromise with her. At the same time if I don't reply for hours long due to work she gets all sad as well and paranoid thinking that something is wrong, which annoys the heck out of me. Another thing that worries me is that she always assumes I'm angry or upset with her if I'm silent for a while.

She is very vocal about crimes against women, is a staunch supporter of women's rights which I too am a supporter off, but at times I feel like she doesn't understand that men's rights are also a thing. I don't know if she is an equalist or only cares about women's rights.

It's our engagement in December and the days are passing by very fast. And I am scared if I'm making a mistake, these communication issues between me and her are getting a lot complicated, and we are having a lot of fights our families are also having some issues communicating between each other. At the same time we are having some beautiful moments in between as well where we have genuine fun and heart to heart communication with each other. She knows about my depression and anxiety. She knows I've been bullied, she knows I never had any relationship or any hookups in my life till now. She knows I drink, she knows I smoke. What she doesn't know is that I'm scared, my fear is this, and I need an advice for this: if I leave her, she'll be hurt, and I don't know how long she will carry that with her, I love her and I want the best for her. If I marry her I'm afraid one day I'll hate or resent her. I can't imagine that. She is a pure soul but I don't know if that's what I want. I don't know what I should do. I know I'm a monster, I don't need anyone to say that, but some of you may say it...and I will agree with it. But I want to make the right choice for me and her. I want her to be happy forever.

***(Also I'm bi haha..)***

So about a year and a half ago, my best friend told me she was in love with the same girl as I was (let's call my best friend Harley and our crush Milla).

I ended up not telling Harley this though and supported her while trying to be a wingman no matter how much it hurt.

So time skip to about 2 months later, and the two got together.

My best friend confessed to her at a party and she kind of answered 'sure, why not'.

So they're together now right? About a day later, after being completely heartbroken, another friend of mine (let's call her Evie) confessed to liking me and I didn't want to hurt her by rejection, so I said yes to going on a date and we ended up rushing into a relationship.

I have problems falling in love, in a way in which it's only really happened once and it was a pretty rocky rollercoaster of painful and unfamiliar emotions.

Anyways, because of truth or dare, both Harley and mines partners agreed that they didn't care if we kissed other people (though I still didn't since I just felt weird about it).

Milla and I play volleyball together btw and I stay over at hers every Thursday as I can't travel so far back to mine in the dark.

So we ended up on the subject of crushes, late at night, sitting around just talking right?

We were having such a great time when I accidentally (I was pretty tired, and I regret it a lot) blurted out the whole thing about liking her while Harley did and stuff.

Milla then started laughing and said that she liked both of us and would've dated either if I had asked first or anything (though I wouldn't have cause I really wanted Harley to be happy).

I sear I felt like dying right then and there.

We ended up cuddling (she's still my best friend so it's not really weird) and just talking (when I wasn't hiding my face in a pillow or hitting her over the head with it when she tried flirting) and at point, it was nearing 4 am and neither of us had slept a wink

And that's when she kissed me (just a hesitant peck though cause she knows I'm weird with this stuff), and then it hit me like a bus how horrible I was.

When I was panicking and Milla was completely chill, like normal (our personalities are pretty opposing, to say the least) I asked what she would like to get out of this, and she said that she wanted to try being in a relationship with two people.

This wouldn't work for two reasons.

One being Harley's like a sister to me, two being I know Harley's not poly, and neither am I.

And so I turned away from Milla telling her it wasn't going to work and that I didn't want to hurt anyone, kind of just shutting her off.

*SORRY, THIS IS SO LONG BTW BUT THANKS FOR STICKING WITH ME!*

The next day, I kept asking her to just turn me down (like asking her just to say she doesn't like me so I could start trying to get over her, but she said she didn't want to lie about not liking me which just made me annoyed and confused.

My girlfriend was really confused too, and kind of just stood watching us from nearby (there's another girl, let's call her tuba, who likes my GF btw but didn't make any moves cause she knew we were together and respected that).

So here I am, completely lost. I begged her to just break my heart so I could begin to heal but she said she didn't want me to get over it cause she wanted to be with me. And then when I told her that Harley wasn't poly, she just said 'awwww' or something and then needed to sleep which brings us to now.

I understand that I sound selfish and horrible I'm sorry..

412,"Okay so for some context on this one. He 'dated' a woman for a short space of time(less than a month) before she started to distance herself, then call it off amicably. 
She stated she wasn't ready for long term commitment (something she knew this guy wanted) and had some things she wanted to sort out. But stressed he was a really wonderful guy and she enjoyed her time with him etc etc

I'm woman myself, and I'm not an expert but I've been in a similar position before where I think I'm ready to commit to something but I get cold feet and put a hard stop to it, I have a feeling she was in the same boat. She seems like the kind of woman who craves new experiences and hasn't had the life experience she needs to commit to something long term yet. Just a guess. 


Naturally housemate is upset, to clarify he's not an 'incel' by any stretch, he's actually what many women would see as their 'dream man' but for some reason he has trouble with relationships (probably because he's a huge introvert)

Anyway he's been ranting to me recently about how 'it was going so well' and, at first kept trying to find ways to make it his fault. And you know, I was ready to support him and be there for him if needed, and provide perspective from a woman's point of view 

Now, however, he's just openly sitting there professing how much he hates women, because they always think they know best (referring to her not being comfortable committing and calling it off) and also how they just run away without trying to solve the problem. 

Suffice to say, while I'm not exactly what you would call a feminist, I'm not exactly comfortable with this woman-hate right in front of me when all I've tried to do is help and console him. All because of a relationship that lasted less than a month. 

What do I do in this scenario? 

I share a kitchen and bathroom with this dude, so it's not like I can just distance myself from him.

414,"Background story i am a highschooler I have a friend who i was not talking for a while and her uncle got sick with covid. Through her quarantine her and i messaged each other every day checked if she is okay is she feeling fine and how was her day and we talked a lot. Now her uncle is fine and she is back from quarantine. She told me she was cooking food and was nice enough to cook me some desserts! Yey i am happy that i got close with a new friend.

 Well the problem is that since she is back from quarantine we haven't been talking irl or over the internet much. She actually tried to talk to me twice but she was together with someone i didn't know so as you might have guessed cause of social anxiety i couldn't socialise.

417,"I am grateful to have a roof over my head, but I am having trouble sleeping at night these past years. My brothers have their own room and my parents don’t check on them. My mom coughs loud and a lot of times because her throat is just like that and I cried a lot of times at night because of the coughing of both of them, watching Netflix, and arguing and talking. They take my phone away because they say I am always tired and I wake up late but regardless if they took my phone away, it was always the same. I wonder if they think it’s working. They said if I kept my phone by me when I slept it would explode on my face. I am always anxious whenever I want to ask them something or talk to them because I know they would always have a good comeback that will affect me emotionally because I get sensitive and I feel so inferior. I really just want privacy and silence. Whenever my friends came over without telling me I would be so embarrassed and I would always feel like they are judging me because I am the only one who doesn’t have my own room and we have no where to go because they are probably uncomfortable in my parents room. My parents won’t even let me have sleepovers and I miss out on plans my friends make. I don’t feel like I have privacy whatsoever and my parents think I have enough privacy since they leave me home alone whenever they go to work or my mom stays home sometimes. I feel if I tell them how I feel it would be the same thing that will happen when a certain fight happened that I will always remember.

This happened:
My parents had a rough day at work and it was dinner. They were in a really bad mood and it was pressuring because my dad angrily pointed out every mistake my brother did and said “it’s because of your phones, from now on i’m going to take your phones away when you sleep, all of you.” because of mistakes my brother did because he was in pressure. he started crying and my mom asked him why he’s crying in a loud voice, kind of like yelling, and her voice was intense. I felt so bad because there was so much pressure and everyone had a bad day and my mom kept asking him why he is crying. It was the first time in a long time seeing my brother in that state. I finally spoke up, it one of my first times speaking up, and I told her he was crying because of pressure. Then the pressure turned to me, they asked me how what was pressuring and then they started saying things in their intense voices that I started to cry. My mom banged the tabled loud once and started yelling at us really loud and started crying. Then my mom got really mad, she said she didn’t love me anymore and she wanted to run away. She said we should of got used to her loud voice because she has been doing it her whole life and that yelling at us was discipline. I was really hurt because she said she didn’t love me anymore and that I wasn’t her daughter anymore and that she wanted to run away from here. It really hurt. I was saying sorry a lot of times and then after that day my mom ignored me and my brother and I had to go to school and I had a breakdown and the counselor talked to me and I begged her to not tell my parents. I was really down for the rest of the school week because I blamed myself for making her cry and I shouldn’t of spoke. until it was my moms birthday and we gave her presents and acted like nothing happened as usual. I know she loves me, but her words still affect me to this very day.

Theres probably a lot more I missed but it’s okay.
I don’t know what to do. My feelings and emotions are always a mess I tend to cry every night. I don’t want to sleep in their room anymore. What do you guys think I should do?

422,"So I have a friend that I love dearly, but they seem to have this habit of being pretentious I guess? I’ve been friends with them for seven years.

We have taken a break before from our friendship a year ago and this lasted abt 8 months. I did this because they had become extremely self absorbed and they were not making the best choices. She was constantly skipping class and drinking with her new cegep friends.

I know it’s shitty but they kept lying to me and the worst thing was that she kept playing the victim. I’ve had to deal with a friend like this before and all her lies were giving me nightmares. I just could not stay if she started becoming like that old exfriend of mine. 

She ended up going to therapy and getting much better so the break from the friendship ended.

However, since then, she has won many awards academically and became the head of her newspaper in cegep. She also has one of the highest grades. I’m definitely happy for her. Just every time I talk to her now that’s the only thing she talks about. It’s been over 6 months that she has gotten all these awards.

When, I had gotten into uni (in a pretty tough program they only accept 48 students a year), she would switch the conversation to her grades or her awards. I don’t even think she was happy for me.

Now that she herself is planning to apply to uni, she is asking me for help with doing her letter of intents etc. Which I don’t mind. Its just that every time im finished helping her she leaves me on read and never really says thank u. But all she does is talk abt her awards, grades and how university are all elitist pieces of crap. 

She hates ESPECIALLY on a science/doctor oriented school. She even hates on my more artistic oriented school. Idk. Ik university always want money. That’s just life. But if she’s always complaining about it now Idk what will happen once she starts going to uni. 

I also know she has extremist views on a lot of stuff that I really don’t agree with. (Ex: Remembrance day she doesn’t celebrate it bc soldiers were forced to go to war-Canada Day: it’s stupid and promotes the british dominion etc.)

I just don’t know how to be friends with her anymore sometimes or even if she cares about me.

423,"Hello! Sorry for the long content in advance!
To get things started without any dilly dallying, I would like to explain my current situation. I am 18 yo, and have always had an interest in computers ever since my sixth grade. I passed my high school few months ago in this pandemic. As an indian citizen there was a lot of pressure on me due to the entrance exams if I was supposed to do engineering in computer science and I used to take coaching alongside my school in my final grade. I never liked the environment the coaching institutes in my country have had (not caring about whether the student had the aptitude or attitude of preparation or not and how the teachers there go on and on expecting the students to understand whatsoever they mean to say despite the poor delivery, and I don't need to further go into how the majority of the Asians would have their children become engineers or doctors which was fortunately, not forced upon me as it was my own choice) and as a result of this, my grades which had already fallen so low that I barely reached my final grade somehow which was caused upon me by myself and some private reasons. I quit my coaching after my mid term and somehow managed to score a 3.4 gpa. I have always had an interest in settling in abroad and my single mother also agreed upon this despite suffering the costs of my elder sister's studies who also wanted to become a doctor in abroad. Unfortunately the pandemic hit us quite hard and my mother's business was driven to extinction before it could have started(she owns an ngo/company-- but hasn't been able to figure out how to get things working )and the flights to other countries haven't started either which would have enabled me to carry on the costs of my studies alone and maybe help out my mother too all the while I'm studying for my bachelor's in abroad. Apologies if I am sounding quite stupid since this far no one has ever either tried to understand what I have had in my mind. So I haven't been able to apply to a college either since my mom will only be able to endure the costs of my first year of studies with the help of loans and half of the fees being paid by my ex dad and this pandemic doesn't seems like it will allow the flights anytime soon so the only medium of study will be through online classes and I won't be able to pay for the rest of my course since I won't be able to work part time. Time is running out and mother advised me to study in my home country as long as the covid is up and running and this will give her time to start a new source of income but the issue is that I didnt give any entrance examinations(except one where I scored horrible marks) for admission to reputed colleges or the nearby ones and the other ones are just too far away from me and the rest are asking for ""donations"". I would also like to add in that I'll have to wait one more year if I'm to give the entrance exams.
So now I'm wondering as to what should I do in this pandemic?
• get an admission in any college in here?
• keep working hard to get an admission in a western country/europe?
• just learn coding from scratch and apply to MNCs after few months?
• more suggestions are welcome

424,"Ok, so a little explanation - I had to pick between two ""courses"" in school, both with different classes. It took a lot of willpower in me to come to a decision, changing my mind like every single day but I came to a conclusion, sent in my decision very happy.

No going back now. So I'm now in a constant cycle of ""you are so dumb why did you do that?"" and beating myself up.

January this year i gave it a last shot but he again of course turned me down... so i gave up... after a week his friend confessed to me... i said yes and we are now currently dating for 10 months... what bothers me now is that i just found out my boyfriend likes me since last year but didnt say anything because me crush told everyone that i was his girlfriend... and my crush now told everyone that my boyfriend stole me from him... the thing is he told everyone that I'm his girlfriend since the day he rejected me... and now he calls me his ex? the audacity of this dude... so should i expose him because I've never had a boyfriend before...

430,"Alright boys this might take a while. So bear with me.

Damn...i dont even know where to start.

There's this girl who wants to see me tomorrow night.  Based on our text history, its pretty evident whats about to go down. 

We've been talking for a little, and for a guy with anxiety...it's feels like it's been months, I don't remember what I ate for dinner yesterday but I remember meeting her. 

I was at work and she came in to pay a bill(its a phone store that rhymes with P-mobile. While she was paying the bill at my coworker desk, I was watching a school assignment. she asked what I was watching. I didn't really focus on her that much because I was trying to do my assignment( I know, imma nerd). anyways she asks what im working on and what school i go to. I did notice that her interest level was pretty high and when she asked for my number, I hesitantly gave it to her after the 3rd time she asked(nicely,  not rudely).

Fast forward the next day and she sent me a text asking me out for coffee. 
I though ""yea right, coffee at 8pm"". I knew wassup.

So immediately I knew what the deal was and i was sort of backing out. I gave her one word answers and bored responses but this girl wouldn't quit. She keeps texting  and texting. 

I tell her I'm with somebody because I was anxious and couldn't bring myself to say no.



Ok, a little back story. Im a college kid who is a virgin partly because of anxiety and my culture (who strongly believes we should wait till marriage to have sex). Whenever im around girls, Im  always constantly thinking about sex and what I would do to them.(yea...I know I don't have shame) and that's all I could think about. The only time i can focus is when im by myself or a group of close friends.
 As you can tell thats not a lifestyle for someone who is a salesman and goes to school where half the people are women. All I could think  about was that. Work: yep, the gym:you betcha! religious houses: why not?



I'm tired of this feeling and just want to get rid of (or try something). But my culture and anxiety issues cause me to always back out of just asking girls out.

And  I don't wanna sound like I'm bragging but I've had many opportunities to do this before before. 

Ok, now back to the story.
A couple days after she asked me out and I wussed out. Then she texts me. 
She may not be a super model or have einstiens  smarts but she knew how to text. She stars with small questions like my hight and what I do.

Then she goes to asking just  to meet up. I tell her maybe. She gets super excited.

The I became fearless behind my Samsung phone and asked her for nudes. She says ok and 10 mins later she sends me these incredible nudes of her tits and vaginal area with clear views 

We teased back and forth for a while saying what we would to each others body parts and how dirty we were.

She throws out the idea of meeting in person to do these said things.  My plan was to start easy by messing around( non vaginas stuff) and we would do it in my car(this is for tonight October 23)

Now at 1:25,  I come to you(smartest people on reddit). should I just rent a cheap hotel and go all the way. I dont want to keep having to fight my thoughts evey time a mildly attacive women walks by. 

Should I just go all the way or stick to my original plan?",23Oct2020,1

So I've been with my BF for almost four years and we've spent every thanksgiving with his family, aside from one where I just didn't go with him and just stayed home. Just recently, my grandma passed to COVID so my family is grieving. I asked him if we could spent this thanksgiving with my mom and he kept coming up with excuses. ""I thought your family didn't celebrate thanksgiving,"" ""Well I always spend it with my family."" ""Is it going to be on the same day?"" Etc. I just felt so hurt about how unsupportive he was, I mentioned that we've been with his family for most holidays and my family is grieving but he didn't really seem like he wanted to commit. It turned into a really ugly argument. Would anyone else under these circumstances, expect your partner to be more supportive right away? I felt like I was forcing him to.",23Oct2020,1

My sister is currently in 6th grade and is going through a bullying situation for a while now. I was hoping that it would clear itself but the school doesn't seem to want to fix this. She tried asking the teacher yesterday to help and the teacher just told everyone to ""play nice"".

It started last year with someone who would seize opportunities when they where alone to hit her and insult her. This person was what we first thought of as a friend during the summer, but definitely not now. He has driven my sister to thought of suicide as well as scratching her own are to the point scabs are left. She told us about this quite late, keeping it a secret because she was worried about being a ""bother"", ""waste"" and other things that the bully has said to her. She was also scared to tell the teachers to. But she opened up to me eventually and now comes to me to talk about more resent events and I'll do my best to comfort her, calm her down, and give her some advice. She does talk about it to our parents a bit but not as much as me.

This year a small friend group of kids is bullying her during PE class and one of them tends to quietly say insults to her during class. Things like stealing gym equipment, aggressively throwing the ball at her, calling her names etc. and the teacher has yet to do anything other than ask them to play nicely. Fortunately, the first bully is taking online classes so we aren't dealing with him too.

I've tried to give her advice like sticking near her closes friends, staying near teachers, immediately reporting incidents, using a breathing technique so she can calm down because she can easily get overwhelmed with her emotions which probably prevents her from thinking straight since she's crying. I tell that we all care for her, her family and her friends, and that she needs to be strong because she can't let the bullies win by getting in her head. I always make sure to end our talks by going over what I said then making her laugh to lighten the mood, but I don't know what to do now. We've even called the school about the first bully when it was happening and all he got was a slap on the wrist basically.

I probably should have come here sooner, I just hoped it would get too serious. I would like some help on how to deal with this situation. My sister has trouble standing up to them properly and the school doesn't seem like they're going to help. I'm really worried since everyday the bullying gets a little bit worse and I don't want my sister to go through this anymore. I've never been bullied before so I'm not sure how it feels, but I try my best for her. Thank you for reading and thank you in advance for any advice you can give.",23Oct2020,1

446,"Alright to start off I am a senior at college X. I transferred here a year and a half ago and have been studying International Studies. When I was applying to transfer, I got told I could get my degree at college X. I was the last person allowed into that field, but I could get it. So now I am just 2 semesters away from graduation (I have to take an extra semester because sometimes credits don't transfer the best). I get an email from my advisor letting me know our appointment is coming up soon and to have a list of the classes I want to take ready. Great so I got look at my transcripts to see what I still need to take and it's mostly elective courses in my field left. So I look at the list of International Studies electives that my advisor gave me and start looking through the course singup page to see what they are offering this semester. Out of probably 50 courses on that list, THREE are being taught. I then start to realize that these courses just aren't coming back. I emailed my advisor asking pretty much what courses am I supposed to take? She told me to call the registrar, who told me to talk to the chair of my department, who told me to talk to my advisor. So I email my advisor again and she said to wait and we'll talk about it at our appointment. A bit later, she forwards me an email from the registrar saying that I could transfer 9 credits of my last 32, but the other 23 have to be from college X. I need 27 more credits and am already transfer in language courses because this school didn't offer Korean. So my advisor tells me to pick out courses unrelated to my major just to get the 27 credits. I'm not paying thousands of dollars a year to take unrelated courses. I'm planning on going to grad school, how will I know what's going on if I didn't learn anything I need to? If I transferred at this point it would be a ton of money that I don't have and probably at least an extra year in school. They told me 2 years ago I could get this degree. I don't understand how they can tell me now that the classes just aren't available. Is there anything I can do about this? I know I cant make them create classes just for me, but could I get them to pay for classes from elsewhere? Do I need a lawyer or something?",23Oct2020,1

I later told her the truth about all of it, when it happened, that the person and I were really good friends but she didn't notice that I lied in the first place and just misunderstood me when I did lie and thought I meant something else (has been corrected to) I still feel like an ass for lying even if she didn't notice, should I own up to mt actions of trying to self preserve or is it enough that I told her the truth later and bringing it up would just be dumb?

448,"In all of my core classes is this piece of garbage named Nate. He's incredibly ugly: Tall yet fat as fuck; long brown hair extended down to his waist, a gross beard, and a total pizza faced freak. You can basically ask him any question about history and he'll have the answer. I once heard him recite every single king of Denmark by heart to his friends (I have no clue how he has any friends).

He's so incredibly creepy. He's bisexual (which is fine) and preys on every kid with a pulse. Even his friends admit he's a pervert and creep. I'm legit scared that he might rape me, as so many other kids are. I heard a rumor from a boy who saw his penis in the bathroom that it's incredibly small (micropenis small) and covered in zits and pimples surrounded by grey pubic hair.

I've heard rumors that he has a diaper fetish, crossdressing fetish (which I do believe as the whole school has seen photos of him dressed in women's clothing), and a kink for black women.

And despite being a teacher's pet who answers literally every question in class (to the point where our math teacher refuses to answer him when he raises his hand because he needs to let other students speak), he constantly acts like a brat. When a black girl was giving a presentation in science class, he blasted this incredibly gross and racist song (since links aren't allowed here, look up ""Paulsego - You Got A Friend in Me parody), he's screamed during tests to annoy people, and once took a balloon to school, filled it fake blood, and pop it over a girl's desk on her birthday. He's only still allowed because he ""has ADD."" He and his friends constantly provoke food fights in lunch and blast metal music in the middle of class to annoy everyone.

He's also been arrested before. His dad is a rich lawyer in our area and seems to pamper him, telling him that's so much smarter and better than everyone else, and that we're all just jealous of him. And then his dad just bails him every time.

For whatever reason, he targets me especially. He spits on me, pours water in front of where I'm walking to make me slip, and insults me all the time. I remember this time in like spring 2019 where he and his friends were shouting nonsense in the middle of lunch, and I walked over telling him to stop. He just snickered saying I was on my period and had shit myself. What should I do about this asswipe?",23Oct2020,1

Griefing breaches rule 1 of our server (no griefing). I have my suspicions but I cannot prove anyone else has done the deed.

Would this not hold up since there are quite a few “Tim Smith’s” in ABC City, and its not even the dudes legal name?

472,"  

Hello, I (20f) am in my 3rd semester of Uni. I’m majoring in history and it took me until a few months ago to realize that I’m really not happy with this decision.

My mum and I have a really good relationship and under normal circumstances I would simply tell her the problem right away, but ever since my dad passed suddenly last year things have turned a little more difficult. Every time I start talking about how I’m not really 100% happy at Uni she doesn’t really react at all. I really don’t think she’s doing that on purpose and I see that she isn’t coping very well with her loss as neither of us does, but it’s making it very difficult to talk to her about this. 

I have taken to keeping my problems to myself because I don’t want to weigh anybody down with them and I’ve struggled my way through my graduation and getting into the Uni I wanted to. At first I was doing quite well, but then I started realizing that I was feeling so stressed and unhappy all the time and after only a few weeks I was thinking about dropping out. I thought that was normal and that I just needed some more time, but it only ever got worse and now I’m at a point where I feel like my mental health and my health in general are starting to take a toll. (like panic attacks, struggle breathing, trouble sleeping etc.) And not talking to anybody is just causing it all to get worse and worse. 

I already have a backup plan that I much prefer to Uni, which is to go into bookselling, which has always been something I wanted to try and I feel like I would feel much more comfortable. The alternative is working at a library, which I have already done previously and I enjoyed the work there immensely. 

Now I really don’t want to paint my family in the wrong light. I love them and when my sister struggled with her apprenticeship a few years ago they all were incredibly understanding with her decision of quitting. But it's always been a little different with me. First of all: my dad was usually the driving force behind this sort of change and normally he would have been the first person I would have talked to, but now that he’s gone I’m just so unsure.  I’ve always done things according to plan and the way everybody wanted me to, so this is the first time I feel like I really need to pull the emergency brakes on things before I regret this my entire life. 

Do you have any advice on how i should talk to my family, especially my mum about this??",23Oct2020,1

The only way to communicate with me is via Snapchat or iMessage but I deleted the Snapchat app and my phone is on Do Not Disturb 24/7.

I've noticed that I've been developing this sort of fear of public areas or just places with a lot of people like the grocery store or the post office, it feels like people are judging me, staring at me and it's so crazy but when someone is standing behind me I automatically think they're going to hurt me maybe it's some sort of reflex from hurtful people at school but I'm not quite sure. I googled my symptoms and it said I have nerve damage and I'm pretty sure I don't have nerve damage...

Usually, in school, they tell you to ""Brainstorm some ideas to cope with stress"" and you'd write down ""Reading and watching movies"" but I've always had an incredibly short attention span so things like that increased the stress more than anything. Music is really nice but I don't listen to music to destress but more to silence my thoughts so I end up listening to Heavy metal or Classical on full volume because those genres make it difficult to gather a single thought. 

*Currently, I just watch cute videos of animals. I've also found podcasts to be helpful because it's something you can have in the background and you can focus on the conversation at hand and audiobooks, but again my attention span is incredibly short so it can sometimes be difficult to give something my full attention or to go through with the whole episode/book.*

477,"hi all, a friend of mine recently got so stressed that she can’t even go to school anymore because she couldn’t catch up the work at school. she kept herself isolated on the last day i saw her at school and i don’t know how to help her as i can’t see her now...

the other day, she was telling me how bad the educational system is here, and she couldn’t learn stuff from school without worrying about everything. then later this week, i texted her, asked her how she was doing. she said she needed a therapist and had to go to another school...i didn’t think her problem could become so serious that her health is completely devastated...she didn’t even text me anymore as usual.

i got anxious when she told me she is leaving this school but i don’t think she has confirmed it yet. is there any way i can help her? i feel like telling her to stay at this school is a bad idea as she’ll probably keep suffering, but i really don’t want to see her leave this school.",23Oct2020,1

I tried watching a movie with her on netflix using Netflix Party, or Teleparty as it’s not called, but instead of putting us in a virtual room together so we can watch the movie, the extention would just open Netflix to whoever clicked the other’s link. No chat, seperate movies, so we can’t pause and unpause it, etc. Just normal netflix instead of what Teleparty promised. My question is: is there something wrong with the app, or my/her computer?

It wasn't hard physically or pshycologically, but I started noticing bad things about military, and started to question my decision. Soo... that feeling became so bad and unbearable that I left military academy yesterday. I know I made a good decision, but now I feel mostly the same.

I don't know if that tells you anything, but I no longer have any interest in the things I loved prior to joining military academy. I feel sad for no reason, sometimes happy, also nothing makes sence and I feel that nothing in life matters and that scares me. Also, I feel bad for my parents because they put all their hopes in me, and I dissapointed them.

I have no way to pay for anything without my parents knowing. I don't want to tie it to my real phone number. I do have a Gmail account already set up for this.

481,"
I’m (19 M)currently in my 2nd year of university and living with 4 girls and 1 guy (My best friend). Last night we all got drunk and the conversation got particularly deep. He opened up to us about his bisexuality and his non-gender conformism (I am rather under informed on the topic so anything I say in relation to this is not meant to offend anyone and yes I will be using he because it’s hard for me to know what his preferred pronouns are). In addition to this he opened up about his mental health issues and how he was struggling with mental heath. It’s at this point the conversation shifted and he kept saying that whenever he drank he always wanted to kill everyone in the house. He also started saying how he was super horny and wanted to fuck the girls. He also kept saying how he had nothing to live for and then forcefully demanded an answer as to what one of the girls was living for (she is a depressed anxious alcoholic who has just recovered from a particularly dark time) He was particularly drunk at this point and I tried to get him away from the girls as he was obviously making them uncomfortable. I managed to get him into the bathroom where he kept trying to throw up but couldn’t. He then started shouting at me if I’d played undertake which I hadn’t and he told me that I must play it but that I couldn’t kill some goat women (tarkeen?) or any of the other characters because they were the closest thing he had to a loving family. Naturally this broke my heart and I tried to tell him I would never but he was so drunk he didn’t listen or understand and thought I was going to kill them. He then started getting aggressive with me. I tried to hug it out with him but after he hugged me he kept punching my back and squeezing really hard as if trying to strangle me. I took the hits and tried to tell him I wanted him to go to bed now and eventually I got him into his bed where he passed out. The girls had called an ambulance/police as he was aggressive with me but they couldn’t do anything once he passed out. We all slept upstairs in one of the rooms furthest from him with the door locked. He’s now hungover and can’t remember anything and my flat mates what him out of the house and I kind of agree but he’s my best friend so I am also unsure if that makes me an asshole. I also don’t know how this’ll affect his already fragile mental health and if he has anywhere he could go. Any help would be appreciated.",23Oct2020,1

483,"First time posting. So don't really know about formatting or anything.

Diving right in, my (25m) MIL left my SO (25f) father two years ago. Now me and my MIL work in the same place. My MIL cheated on my FIL with my direct supervisor at work. I found out what was going on told my FIL what was going on and he told her to straighten up or get gone. Well MIL continued with the affair and promptly left one day without telling anyone. Nobody knew where she was for about a week. She said she done it because my FIL was mean and hurtful to her for 20 years (not abusive, but he could be a dick most of the time.) Meanwhile my wife spent that week with her father trying to console him and pretty much putting the pieces back together.

My wife and MIL haven't spoken to one another for over 22 months. Me and my wife are currently 21 weeks pregnant with our first child and my MIL has been trying to get back into contact but my wife is having none of it. My parents divorced when I was 12 due to my fathers infidelity. I couldn't stand him for the longest time. We have finally gotten back to a good place after 6 years of not speaking to one another. So I know the pain she is going through. But I also know the consequences could be bad if they don't talk.

484,"Today I woke up at 7:40am, I set my alarm for 5:00am. Got out of bed already wanting to cry after the dream I had and also wanted to cry about the fact that I never wake up on time. So I went outside for 20 minutes and laid on the grass looking at the clouds and started questioning everything again. I then went inside said hey to my mom and brother and went to take a freezing cold shower to punish myself.

After that I went to my room and started live-streaming call of duty, 20 minutes in my stream started lagging and skipping so I tried to fix it and started it again only for the same result. I told everyone watching I’m sorry and then I tried to see what was wrong with the internet. 

My dad came home from work and helped us fix the router after that we went outside and tried out a hoverboard he got for us. My little brother wouldn’t stop making these dumb noises and faces, he was also hitting himself on the head. There is nothing wrong with him some days he just does this to annoy me and it did. I threatened to delete his Minecraft worlds if he did not stop which did nothing. We all got into a argument and I made him cry by taking back the candy I bought for him.

I feel shit, this whole day has been terrible from the start. Nobody gives me advice and I have no idea what to do with each day given to me.

492,"Ill try to break down the situation as much a I can without too much of an essay.   
**My nephew:** freshly 18, functional aspergers. Never ""fit-in"" with normal kids, but is an amazing kid - kind, helpful, and  curious. He has suffered a lot from depression, and loves video games and history.  He is quite an introvert, with not a lot of real friends, and spends most of his days playing video games in his room. (which there is 0 judgement from me here - most of my friends are the same way still at 30+!)  
He has ALWAYS been fascinated with guns and violence growing up (even when he was like...4). So, the fact that he wants to join is no real surprise. He has been in and out of therapy, on and off medication, and has had some pretty serious incidents connected to his mental health, or so I am told.

**Me:** I am a 32 yo self proclaimed bleeding heart hippy. Am pretty anti-establishment, and I try not to let this lead into individuals, but am typically against the armed forces *(whether this be the army, the police, whatever .)* I am not anti- authority as a concept, but am against the way things are now and think that even if good people subscribe to these fields, it corrupts or kills them as those higher up do not have the general populations best interest at heart. I moved to socialist democratic country about 10 years ago and regret nothing.   
I have also always been very close to my nephew, being one of the only people who ""gets him"" and doesn't ask him to change to be loved. We have had a great relationship, and he looks up to me a lot.  


**My sister** *(his mom)***:** Oldest sibling, and inherited a strong mom streak in her since we were kids. She is the first to tell me that she feels overprotective of my nephew, and will wiggle between too much freedom and no freedom at times. Her and her husband (not the bio dad) are amazing people, but they can be really rough on him sometimes for not doing things right or making mistakes - but it is always from a point of love, that they want what is best for him, and their hindsight as being ""older and wiser"" can be a bit stiffling for him often.  


**The story:**   
So, he has passed his aptitude test, and the whole family is freaking out. Nobody really wants this for him but him - though we all agree that this was probably always in the cards for him, the way he loved history (he really digs WWI and WWII stories and whatnot) and guns. He isn't particularly skilled in anything, no big brain, no muscles, and no big interest in anything in particularly.   
So for us, all we are seeing is ""MEAT SHIELD"" spelled out in big letters watching him get on that plane in a few short months.

Is this him lashing out at an overprotective parenting? Is this him having a suicide wish, or not taking the risks serious? Is this just a normal reaction from a kid who doesn't have much going for him besides a shining personality and some social issues in 2020 where any option looks pretty shitty?

Im trying not to let my opinions, and inexperience, with what this all means get in the way of his first REAL choice as an adult, and something he is obviously passionate about.  I feel like my liberal attitude and Hollywood movies are getting in the way of supporting him, but I also don't want to sit by idly if he is making a mistake. 

So, I thought it would be smart to get some better insight into the situation from someone who knows more about what is about to happen from first hand experience, walk me through what it is like and give some advice for me and the rest of my family who are dramatically feeling like he is making a big mistake - one he might not be able to recover from.   


General questions afloating around are like: What can he expect? What amount of active duty is there involved these days? Do most people die / or come back ""broken"" from active duty? How long are people stationed away for, and where? Is there any insight you could give that may convince him NOT to go, if you agree he shouldn't? Etc etc etc etc etc....",23Oct2020,1

It's especially bad when he's gaming and talking through his mic, and when he's playing the guitar (electric). We've tried a couple of things to compromise between him being able to enjoy his hobbies and me being able to study and have some quiet time in general.

* Me using headphones: generally doesn't work because I can still hear him and headphones hurt my ears (tinnitus)
* Me using earbuds: generally doesn't work because I still need to hear the sound from my laptop (web lectures and all that)
* Asking him to quiet down: kinda works but he tends to get annoyed and doesn't listen, so either I have to let it slide or get my mom, which usually makes him even more angry.
* Asking him to turn down the sound on his amp/game/music: begrudgingly does it but he just turns it up again the next day
* Asking him to leave one ear free when using his headphones so he can hear himself and monitor his own volume: he doesn't want to do it
* Asking him to move to the attic: he gets angry and isn't always possible because that's where my dad does his work-from-home thing

He's already switched rooms so that there's more space between his and my room, and it's helped a little bit, but it's still not enough. 

I've asked my parents if we can maybe get some kind of soundproofing panels, but they say that my brother has to respect my boundaries and just listen when I tell him to quiet down. I'm tired of always having to go ask him to keep it down because he just ends up being pissed at me and the next day it's just as loud as before.

However, I didn’t tell my crush (25F) about this so she thinks I’m still thousands of miles away from her. We keep in contact by texting each other only so it’s manageable.

I don’t want to tell her because I know she would want to hang out but it makes me extremely anxious seeing her irl. I don’t have the guts to go, ‘hey I don’t want to hang out bc I’m literally in love with you’. In general it’ll just be harder to keep a distance from her when we’re in the same city.

On the other hand, I feel guilty for hiding such a big update from her because she seems to genuinely want to stay friends and she would share personal things from time to time. This is also the reason why it’d be weird for me to ghost her altogether. There’s also a lot of things that I can’t share with her because she thinks I’ve moved so our conversations are quite one-sided.

She’s in a happy, committed relationship with a guy so there’s no point in confessing. This is the first time that I’ve had romantic feelings for anyone and I think I’m on the ace spectrum so it’s been a really confusing journey. I’ve tried to distract myself from her but my mental health has been really bad recently so I’m really not capable of dealing with this.

Do I continue to lie about where I am so it would be easier for the friendship to fade itself out? Or is being truthful still worth it?

I messaged him the other day saying ""hi I think you are very cute, are you single?"" and he replied ""unfortunately not I'm afraid but thank you for calling me cute."" Of course I apologized and said I wished him and his partner well, and that she was very cute also (I went onto his Facebook profile again and although he has no pictures of her up, she has commented on a few of his posts so I found her profile that way. She has a few profile pictures of them together. He has none.) 
I would never disrespect another woman, nor would I ever disrespect someones relationship and thought that was the end of our conversation but he asked where I was based and turns out we live close to eachother so he said we should meet up for a drink sometime and I replied ""yes, the 3 of us, sounds lovely,"" to which he said we would arrange something soon.
Since then he has messaged me asking me what I do for a living etc so I asked him ""does your gf feel comfortable with us speaking?"" and he said she was fine with it but it still didn't sit right with me so I haven't spoken to him since. 
Since I first messaged him, he has liked my profile photos and has been liking / reacting to almost every single one of my Facebook posts (I post quite a lot as Facebook is my only social media and I am a well known poster). 
I always give people the benefit of doubt but I feel like he might be subtly flirting with me, but doing so in such a way that his gf doesn't see? And if thats the case I will probably delete him because I stand firmly by girl code and don't want his gf to feel upset or uncomfortable. Her feelings are my main priority.

Am I thinking too much into this? Does he just enjoy what I post? What do you guys think? 

Thank you so much friends :)

512,"Hi All,

Im just looking for some advice and ill try to keep this somewhat short.

A year and a half ago a guy sent me a message on Facebook to tell me my real father was his brother and told me that the family missed me and wanted to get to know my son as well. (I'm married and have a 5 year old son, I'm 28 if that matters)

I immediately forwarded this conversation to my mom and she called me in tears and told me to delete the message, which i thought was odd. A few minutes later my dad called and sounded really sad. He told me that him and my mother needed to talk to me and let me know the entire story which i agreed to. They told me my biological father was abusive and has a criminal background and my mom left him shortly after i was born and that my dad and her met and he adopted be when i was around 4 or 5. My dad also told me that he would fly with me to where he currently lives and bring me to him to meet him if that is what i wanted.

I don't believe i do. However, my mom told me that the last thing he said to her was that if i ever wanted to talk to him later in life he'd be happy to which was after he signed off on the adoption papers.

Something has been eating at me to know why he did the things he did (i couldn't fathom ever leaving my son and signing off on adoption paperwork for him) and what he has to say or has ever wanted say to me or to apologize. I've been feeling a lot of frustration towards my mom still for not telling me sooner, but also towards my biological father for never reaching out and it having to be my ""uncle*

After a year and a half im still caught in this whirlwind of emotion and i dont know that the right move is. Part of me wants answers to questions that will never be answered sufficient enough and the other part says let it go and pretend this didn't happen and keep moving on in life.

I will end this with, either way, my dad with always be the guy who raised me for almost 25 years, not the one who created me.",23Oct2020,1

Since my mom signed me up late for school I have over 100 late assignments to catch up on.

So catching up with assignments when I have no tutor or adult here to help me, makes it a lot more stressful.

535,"TL:DR AT BOTTOM

Hi, I (17M) have a hard time believing my (18F) girlfriend on a lot of things she says, and I also have a hard time separating regular thoughts from anxious thoughts. (We've been dating for a year by the way) 

Firstly, let me just start by saying, my girlfriend hasn't done anything too serious to make me have trust issues, and I've had them before her. Also, she's a really good girlfriend and outside of this, we have a good, fun, loving relationship and our communication is pretty good, too.

She has lied to me about things, but all of them included her not telling me about how she feels about certain things. For example, one time she basically felt like our relationship was always up and down and she lied and said she never said this. I then asked her about it, and she denied it but later came clean after an argument. She said it's because she's not the best at expressing her emotions, but she's gotten better recently.

However, this adds to my trust issues and while I understand why she may not have wanted to tell me about her feelings, it did end up being worse for me. 
I just have a genuinely hard time trusting her on certain things, and that sucks because I don't want to break up with her and I want to spend my life with her. 

I'm a very anxious person, and I tend to worry about everything one can worry about in a relationship. I worry about:
-If I love her
-If she loves me
-If shes cheating
-If I will cheat in the future (which I don't plan on doing)
-If we will last

I also take things she says and I blow it out of proportion, if she sends me a text that I feel sounds weird, I'll just assume its because she's uninterested, she doesn't love me, and she wants to break up. 

Even if she tells me otherwise, it's still hard to believe. She straight up told me ""...you are the only one so yeah you're wrong"" and that just made me feel weird? She's pretty understanding, but sometimes I feel like a burden and that I just do more harm than good. 

Sometimes, I don't even understand my own feelings. If I don't smile, laugh, be happy, or feel that ""spark"" while talking to her, I get worried that it's because I don't love her. That also makes me confused about which things I feel are genuine and which things are me forcing myself to smile. It's all just so confusing. Even if I can rationally disprove these thoughts, it doesn't make them go away.

Also, please don't suggest I break up with her, because that's the last thing I want. She's really nice, caring, funny, smart, and beautiful. I feel I just have a problem that I need help dealing with. Also, please if you could, give a suggestion besides ""go to therapy"" because I've heard that one and I'm working on it. If you have any personal experiences, that would help a lot. Sorry if I sound picky, thank you.

I also want to add-even though this may make me seem like an insecure kid or a bad boyfriend, I'd like to think I'm not. I'm just really anxious, and it affects me outside of my relationship, but this is the one that it affects the most right now.

TLDR: I have a hard time believing things my girlfriend says due to my trust issues that I've been dealing with for a long time, and I also have been dealing with a lot of intrusive thoughts and relationship anxiety.",23Oct2020,1
536,"After reading this once again I realize how I've diverted the topic a bit but please bear with it.

Hey guys,

For a bit of context I live in my home country for education and my parents are in a foreign country (MESA).

I'm going to be giving my 12th grade final exams in a few months and it's really occupying my mind right now but there are some things going in the family which I can't help out with.

My dad has been without a job for last 3 years. My mother has a pretty nice job and we live pretty well without spending too much on other things except food. The thing is after I'm done with my exams I'm going to have to apply for colleges for which there are going to be seperate exams. My aim or dream is to join the army and if I'm not able to do that I want to pursue engineering. The thing is I'm really worried about how I'm going to pay fees for my college. I agree I might not get the best college cause I'm not the best at studying but my father doesn't have any savings and is making purchases from my mom's account.

Don't get me wrong , he isn't a lavish spender, he spends frugally and only eats outside sometimes but it takes a toll on me knowing my father hasn't done anything for three years and my mother is working hard for me. I cannot get these thoughts out of my head. My mother is kind and stern but she forgets/leaves issues about things after a day which probably led to my father's lackadaisical lifestyle. It doesn't feel right.

I don't have any friends I can talk to about this because I have only 3 decently close friends and 2 of them are in another country. I also don't want someone to know what's happening in my personal life. I've really closed off myself with others , I've become alone and I think I'm becoming lonely.

I don't know what to do. I really don't want to be worrying about this during my exam times. I'm going to my parents country in the coming few weeks and I have no idea what to do to help out my mom. She talks to me about these family issues but I feel like these are things which are supposed to be discussed between those two. She doesn't have anyone to vent to so she doesn't it on me. I don't mind it but you know it feels like I'm an adult sometimes, I don't know how to feel about that.

I really love both my parents but I've become extremely numb to emotions over the last few months. I rarely feel happiness in my chest. It only  comes when I taste good food, I feel ashamed about that. You know the unknotting feeling in the chest. I've lost that feeling over the last 2 years. I've endured my intrusive thoughts alot of times and its really changed me.

How do I face my parents regarding this? My father will be coming back to homeland a month after I visit my parents place and I really want to feel secure. I don't know why I'm here I really want to belong somewhere and cry for once in many years.

Sincerely,
Demon.

542,"So... I came to reddit. Hope this works.

Hello everyone. So I'm having doubts about my GF, and questions about our relationship.

Backstory: We met 3 and a half years ago me ( 29) GF ( 25 ).

We met 3 and a half years ago in a foreign country. We clicked almost instantly after a few days of chatting. When we met we were both in a very bad relationship. So talking things out with a person that's in the same situation felt really good. We clicked, made out. At the end I escorted her to her bus and she left. I honestly thought at the time that nothing would come of it. We'd maybe chat but thats about it.

Well we chatted. And surprisingly we connected more. Soon enough she proposed that we go together for another foreign project, this time for a month, to see if we still have that "" it"" what ever it was. We had the best time of our lives. We even spent an extra week traveling across the country after our work project was over.
Afterwards, she spent a further month in another country, tuturing a little girl while living with the family.

Once she went home to her own country ( we're from different countries), we decided we wanted to try to make it work. For a good while I took trips to her country to be with her ( between 7-10 days each time). She eventually found a job with a 1 Year contract on my home country. Sure she was almost on the other side, but thats just and hour and 45 minutes by car ( small country). Everything was going super great, until it wasn't. She confessed that she cheated on me with another foreign guy. And the reason she gave was because she was nervous that we were becoming very serious. Let me make this clear. In all my relationships that ended because of cheating, I kicked them to the curb and never looked back. No hesitation.

Here I couldn't do it. Which eventually boiled down to me giving her another chance. Usually this is a mistake, but what do you know, it seemed like this time it wasn't.

After her contract was up, we moved to her country. I got a good job here, we have a nice place and its really great. So what's the problem?

Problem is, she is talking more and more about wanting to ""experiment"". As in having other partners, trying swing clubs, that sorta thing. Now I should have mentioned this before, but part of the reason she said she cheated, was because she was missing the ""crazy"" experiences in her life. I honestly never thought of that after, until now.

So my head obviiusly jumped back to the time she cheated. Is this really just her having a need to experiment? Is it another outburst of "" were getting too serious"" ( wtf we live together)? Does this kind of ""experiencing"" actually benefit a relationship ( her words)? My thoughts are all over the place... Help a guy out?


Thank you

548,"TW-mentions of abuse

&amp;#x200B;

So I am looking for advice on how to not tolerate abuse and clearly show with my actions, body language and words that I will not tolerate bullying. How can I do this if I have no friends, no one on my side, etc. I do not understand predatory men but i shared the same issues on quora a long time ago and i got two responses that I might look ""vulnerable"" whatever that means, what does vulnerable even mean, just not agressive, passive in general? Those girls who are loud and do not take anything seriously  do not have when it comes to brains but no one really touches them. Problem is that despite that I am ""intelligent"" I am not witty at all, I have almost no sense of humour besides memes and sexual jokes.  Those who are witty survived the banters but I remember that bullies did not leave me until they broke me and it did not matter if i cried in class or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have assertivenss classes in my area ( I live in a poor country) and i have had problems with abuse and social cues (DAMNED IF I AVOID SOCIAL CONTANCT SINCE I AM SOMEHOW MEEK AND EASY TARGET, DAMNED IF I LOOK FOR TOO LONG THEN I AM SOMEHOW CHALLANGING THE STUPID MALES) and I am just tired, I do not know if the way I was raised or my bad people pleasing behavior i developed but i kinda used to ask for permission for everything and since people used me and abused me i may have manipulated a bit but at least i did not harass the others, I do not understand how people who harass other people are more liked and respected than a people pleaser like me, I may not be honest but at least I do not tell to everyone I dislike to - ""get \*\*\*\*\* and die in \*\*\*\*"" I literally do not understand the logic of people and how they can trust someone cause they do the right things, don't you all have an instinct that something is not right and their smile is a bit too fake?

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know how to no longer tolerate abuse because since i was groomed by my bullies somehow even strangers and other people see that they can abuse me and jump on me, in school it was hard since it was a gang against one anorexic girl and the whole idiotic mob mentality where the kindest person in the class is somehow a common enemy for dumb boys who have nothing to do but harass, stalk and insult a girl they know nothing about daily. I have noticed in high school that creepy men tried their advances on me and I had a period in 8-9 grade where I could not in any way shape or form say no this is why i lied, my female bully also asked me personal questions, like if i have sex(even though boys hate me and bully me and throw things at me and harass me) and instuled my genitalia and called me a lesbian and also threw things at me, and talked to me as if being me was the worst thing that could happen. abuse made the extroveted me, an isolating introvert, i am afraid of going out since i am sometimes cheated and fucked over so my life as a child and a teen consisted of only buying clothes and going for food, no romantic teenage stories to keep. just hostile bullying, trying to be sane, my grades dropped and i cried my self to sleep, even sometimes in class to which the bullies were very pleased to see, i hated their smirks in middle school and just hoped for it in high school to end but nope. I hear of people being bullied at work and even later in life and somehow i am the perfect  target for abuse and I am already mentally unwell and recovering from PTSD so more abuse may make me do something even more drastic to end everything. I have thought about martial arts but only managed to go for a few months and stopped because I no longer have the money, I am struggling with college and saving money for food and paying my bills.

550,"So recently I thought I was having heart issues because I am having chest pain in that area. I've had to stop smoking nic/weed because the weed would make my heart rate jump and I'd like, feel really bad like I'd pass out or something. Had to leave work once cuz of this. This never happened before a month ago, I smoked to relax and have fun, now it makes things worse.

I've been to the doctors. Lungs and heart sound fine and healthy,  looks fine from xray, I'm too young to have real heart issues apparently. They say it sounds like 'general anxiety'. Still waiting to see a cardiologist to check a few more things.

Here's the thing: I dont know what's triggering this? I know I'm an anxious person but there isnt a bunch of stuff or any 1 thing I'm worrying about. Like I cannot pinpoint any issue. I also dunno how it works fully I guess. I feel like I've been doing fairly well recently. So what the heck.

Along with consistent chest pains which are bad enough and being aware of my heart beat, I wake up every morning multiple times, from 4am to 9am. I'm not getting enough sleep because of this. Generally my heart is beating fast and I feel bad the moment I wake up. I try and go back to sleep between all the times but I can never sleep enough. Its really starting to bother me. One of the docs I saw wanted me to go to a psychiatrist which I'm hesitant to, the other said a counselor of sorts. I just dont see how either will help.

Then I went back to work &amp; him immediately apologized saying that the reason he didnt respond was because people at work were saying that we were sleeping together. Completely untrue. I laughed it off &amp; said he didn't need to apologize forget about it. 
Things were awkward but still cordial. Then it got weird. One day he would go out of his way to talk to me &amp; be so nice then the next he would ignore me &amp; be a bit mean.

I have never said anything inappropriate to him or crossed the line in any way.

555,"So about a week ago, I (F/19) reconnected with an old acquaintance (M/20) through tinder. We had originally met when we were 16 because my best friend was dating his best friend, and we had talked briefly a few times at parties and such. Back then, I remember my best friend always telling me she wanted us to get together because she thought we would really work together, and I never opposed to it because I always thought he was really cute. I don't know if she told him this (she had known him for a few years by then) but she told me constantly, but back then, we were both very inexperienced and we are both a bit shy by nature so nothing happened. In the end, it never ended up working out because we both started seeing other people, and we finally lost contact about a year later at 17, because my best friend cheated on her boyfriend and they broke up. A few months after this happened, my friend and I also had a fight, that had honestly been a long time coming, and stopped being friends too, so I never really thought much about this guy anymore. This changed last week, that we matched on tinder and started talking. We had kinda talked before but for the first time we really started to get to know each other and I have been really liking what I've seen until now, not to mention that he has gotten HOT these last few years. I don't know if he feels the same way, but he's made an effort to keep the conversation going, so I guess he's at least curious about me. A few days ago he asked me if I wanted to meet up with him and I said yes, but due to current events, there are certain restrictions put in place in my country that doesn't allow us to meet up, but we have agreed that as soon as they are taken down we are going to go grab a coffee or something. What I'm concerned about here is that I know that he recently (about 2 months ago) broke up with his girlfriend (they dated for about 6 months), and I don't really wanna be the rebound. Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for a husband right now, I'm still young and I wanna leave to study abroad next year so it's not like I am going into this expecting the love story of a lifetime, but after so many years of having a thing for him, I wanna get to know him and just see where things go, but I don't wanna end up being just a rebound. So, what are your thoughts? Is being a rebound always a bad thing? Should I be concerned? 

TL;DR: at 19 I reconnected with an old crush I had at 16, and now we might have a possibility to get to know each other and see where things go, but he very recently broke up with a long time girlfriend and I'm scared of just being the rebound.",23Oct2020,1

I (M28) wife (F26). We have a child (2M). We both work, I cover all the bills and savings, her income is for fun money. 

I don’t really think my wife likes me that much. I know it sounds ridiculous. 

Here is my general schedule. I’m up at 4am every day. Get in a workout, clean the house a bit, work on some side projects (were remodeling our kitchen, need to build some furniture, and take some classes to finish my degree, stuff like that) and get ready for work. I hangout with her for a few minutes before I go, work til 4pm ish and head home. Hangout with my son while wife preps dinner (were big into crockpot meal) everyone eats together, then usually hangout with my sone some more until he goes to bed. 

Here is where the issue comes in. My wife has seemed tepid for the last 6 months or so. Very often on her phone, like all the time. Unless she’s doing something that she absolutely has to do, she on her phone. It’s the very first thing she does in the morning, the last thing she does at night, and is sometimes on it throughout the night. Even when my son and I play, she seldom engages and is usually on her phone. She’s around us, but totally impassive.  She is good with our son when she’s engaged with him, just doesn’t often do so. Real lack of enthusiasm revolving most parts of our relationship.

However, we’ve had frequent arguments about how I’m too busy and need to spend more time with her. Which is just so insanely confusing because when I do try to spend time with her, she seems totally distracted and bored. Then a few days into trying to spend more time with her she starts giving me crap about things not being done around the house. Cycle continues. 

To be fair, I’m a serial over extender. Sins of the father in a way. I grew up in an emotional neglectful family. Dad was an absolute workaholic and mom never seemed to have to time of day for me. So I make strides every day to make sure that I am emotionally available for my wife and son. But I have my dads work ethic and I am extremely goal oriented. When I miss workouts, don’t accomplish things or just have a generally unproductive day, I feel very distracted. I feel best when im being productive.

So maybe I’m over whelming my wife? She often makes comments about me being a perfectionist or obsessive. I used to talk to her about goals and different ideas to make money, build cool things, find cool experiences for our family. Just projects and things I want to accomplish. She used to be all about it, now she just seems annoyed by me.

I try to talk to her about it but she usually gets defensive, says she is tired a lot and needs time to relax. Which is fair, I get it. I just don’t feel like I’m getting the whole story. 

So, am I over whelming my wife? Does she not want to tell me how shes feeling to protect my feelings? 

Maybe I need to wrap up the loose ends on some open projects and tone it down for a while?",23Oct2020,1

I went to my parents to discuss insurance, and basically it’s either get the insurance company involved and pay consequences, or pay out of pocket. 

Of course paying out of pocket is the way to go for a person my age, as my parents don’t want insurance to go up and have my insurance go up as well later down the line.

564,"Obligatory on mobile, so apologies for formatting issues.

My boyfriend and I recently moved into his old family home. The neighborhood is great, it's where he grew up so most of the neighbors are known by him. 
However, there is one family on our street that has become a thorn in my side. 
They have 2 dogs (one small and one medium) that frequently get out of their house/yard. I'm talking bolting into the street, running into other people's yard. 
The first time this happened a month ago, my boyfriend and I helped the mother and 2 kids wrangle the dogs. The mother didn't even thank us, but the kids did and we thought that was that.

They get out once a week now. And this week, they got out now, 4 times. Twice yesterday. My issue is not just the dogs running in the street, but the fact that the parents just scream from their yard. The fact that they send the kids out into the street to run after the dogs (which the dogs see as playing). I work from home and take calls from clients and having someone shout ""get the fuck back here"" is not a good look.

Most of our neighbors have dogs as well and two of them are giant huskies who could probably very easily eat the small dog if they wanted (they're good boys tho so they would never). So far no fight has broken out, but I know it's a possibility. 

My boyfriend tried talking to the mother, asking if they leashed the dogs and what not and her response was to call him uppity and a loser. 

I just do not know what I should do, if we should call animal control or what. I don't want these people to start crap with us and I don't want the kids to be punished for their parents mistakes, but I feel like the dogs or kids are going to be hit by a car one of these days.

566,"

My friend, let’s call him P, is a first year med student. When choosing where to study, he rejected the offer from a high rank college because this particular school is founded on Catholic values, and considers abortions and euthanasia as crimes. P is pro choice and an atheist.

This school teaches conscientious objection (which means that doctors can refuse to perform an abortion/euthanasia if they are morally against it, even if the patient demands it). In the end he chose another college, not as prestigious as the other one, but still really good according to rankings.

Some days ago an article on conscientious objection popped up on my Facebook feed and it mentioned the school P goes to. According to the article, there was a document on the school’s website that explicitly said that the school views abortions and euthanasia as crimes; the document has been recently edited, and now it says that students should commit themselves to work according to the Catholic Church’s judgement.

I unexpectedly had a student pull out from my group as the parent wanted to put him back into a physical classroom. They did this without giving me any notice, and did not even directly let me know.

573,"So, some back story is needed. 2 years ago, I had a friend that was not close to me, but I would have liked it if we were, as I believed it would have been healthy for both of us. Also, I kind of liked this friend a bit more than as a friend, if you know what I mean. At this point I had asked her out 4-5 months prior and her response had been that it wasn’t a good time cause she wanted to focus on her studies. I was sad, but it was expected as we had spent 3 months apart. I understood this as I always wanted the best for her in life. However, I believed I could change her mind if she let me be close friends again and get her to warm up to me. At this time, we were both at Uni, so we had to see each other when we had labs or lectures. 

So, after some time (\~1.5 months) she warmed back up to me as I had hoped and predicted. We became close and good friends that sent memes and jokes a lot over messenger, sometimes go to town after Uni and/or on the weekend, even grocery shopping together once. We are both nerds so we would meet up regularly and play Pokémon GO as well. As the university term ended, I thought this could be the time to tell her I like her and I would like for us to be a couple. She turned me down for the same reasons as before and we continued being friends. After 2 weeks, we ended up sleeping with each other after studying at my place one evening. After that point her interest and contact with me went through the roof. We would constantly be messaging, sending memes, playing Pokémon Go, grocery shopping trips, studying around my place, etc. Basically all the things me and her liked doing. This continued for 3 weeks and it was the best days of my life, I would like to think she felt the same. 

Uni started up again and we were still close but unable to spend much time with each other due to Uni and her job. As the term went on things in my personal life started to get bad and my family were not in a good place so I had to focus my energy on that as well as my increasing load of coursework. All these things were getting too much for me. On top of that I was looking for a placement and that was not going well, I had around 5-10 rejections every week. Also, I had to take days away from Uni to do some of the company recruitment exercises, so that added to my stress level and time. I still talked to her as much as I could to check she was doing fine with her studies. Eventually, messaging had died down and came to a full stop. I didn’t let her know what was going on in my head and she continued to send me things, possibly to start a conversation. I would see the messages days later but I was so busy and stressed that I just wouldn’t get around to reply. I know in hindsight that I should have taken the time to explain what I was going through or just send a meme or anything but I didn’t. 

This continued until uni finished. I managed to get a placement just at the end of my year but it had a start time a week after term ended. I now had to look for a place to stay and prepare for the move and my family situation was unchanged - and it still is. At this point we had drifted apart and we were not talking anymore. I went on my placement year and had 1.5 hours to and from work and would start at 7:30, finishing just about 6 pm so I rarely had any time for myself. All my days, weekends and time off was filled with extra work, dealing with my family, personal life and living arrangements. I felt like I didn’t have time to think or breathe.

Through all this, I would think of her from time to time and I was looking forward to being a part of her life again. I knew that it wouldn’t go back to what it was but I wanted her in my life as a friend at least. 

This brings us to the present. About 2 months ago I left my placement to come back to uni. Because of lockdown and everything I wasn’t in the healthiest shape of my life but I’ve been working through it. As I got back, I started reconnecting with my friends (I didn’t speak to any of them during my year in industry) and all of them welcomed me back with open arms - but not her. She wasn’t interested in the slightest and said she had moved on and didn’t need any more friends and was content with her life and wanted no changes to it. She completely turned me down, saying it’s normal to lose friends over time, which I am not disagreeing with. She used the analogy of how in the sims, you won’t be friends any longer once the bar reaches its minimum. All I wanted was to get back to sending memes, maybe have some text conversations on occasions. I can’t see how that would change anything for her. After sensing her hostility, I sent a message apologising if I hurt her by drifting away but I was met with a “You’re overthinking it”. Am I though? None of my other friends showed me the same coldness. 

I know it might sound weird that being friends or not being friends could make or break someone but she’s so special to me. I’ve found it difficult to make friends my entire life, especially long-term friends. I’ve never found someone who’s like me before and I’ve always felt like the odd one out. I had no response from her for just over a month now. I send a meme every few days hoping she would eventually reply. She was last online 2 weeks ago and she doesn’t look at my messages, I know I’ve not been blocked but unsure if I’m muted on WhatsApp. I intend on continuing to send memes and funny pictures for now as it’s my only option. I keep hoping she will look at them someday soon. 

One possibility I have about her not having time for more friends and not looking at my messages is that she is working hard and generally has no time, kind of like me in my placement. As I've said we are very alike and hard works at are Job. this wouldn’t be the first time as in the holidays between Uni years she would work 60 hour weeks at her Job. 

My question is, how do I keep it together until I get a reply from her? Could I do anything else to try and get in touch with her again?

Note: I won’t give up on our friendship, it’s just not an option.",23Oct2020,1

I am off cast for about 5 or 6 weeks also off any bandage, I can use my hand but I cannot really lift anything heavy or push too much. I've been doing some excercises to gain the mobility of wrist back but I feel as if I hit a wall with 0 progress and I want to know if that's normal and expected or if something is wrong with my wrist.

I can move all my fingers without any problems, I can twist my arm so my palm is facing upwards but I feel a bit of a tension while doing so. But the mentioned wall is when I try to move my palm upwards or downwards, with my healthy hand I can do almost 90 degree angle up and down, but the broken one I can do only ~40 - 45 deg up and down and that's when I help with my healthy hand at these angles I hit the pain wall andtension, and cannot go further and I'm not sure whether this is normal/expected.",23Oct2020,1

580,"hi! forgive me in advance if the formatting is a little strange :)

ive looked forward to being able leave this house for years now.  im 17 years old, and almost an adult.  my home life is abusive to say the least i wont go into much detail.  but the way my mom and her boyfriend have treated me has been beyond awful.  when i was younger i used to blame myself for it, i used to try to stop the physical fights and arguments.  her boyfriend would come into my room and scream at a 13 year old girl to get her drugged out mom off the couch so that he could watch tv.  

i grew up thinking that that was what a family was. 
ive realized only recently that a child should never have the responsibilities i put on myself growing up. it was not my job to protect my mom, when she did nothing to protect me.  when the school mandated i go to therapy my parents told me that i was burden and completely gaslit me.  and i wholeheartedly believed them.  

when i hung out with my friends it was so weird to see that their parents were so nice to them.  i didn’t understand how a parent could love their child so much, it genuinely did make me jealous.  why wasn’t i worthy love? from that point on i craved to be wanted by someone, then by some stroke of luck i met someone who meant absolutely everything to me. but, i was so happy that someone cared about me that i grew completely codependent on them.  it felt as if when i was with them, the thoughts in my head weren’t so loud.  he consistently said and did things to hurt me, but i just justified his every action and defended him with rose covered glasses.  

when he left i felt completely shattered.  now im just bitter.  ive shaped myself into this codependent mess, constantly seeking the validation of others.  its just become so hard wired into my brain, that i dont know any other way to behave.  but i think im taking the first step by being self aware that something needs to change.  in order to move on, i really need to cope with losing my both my childhood and my identity.  i genuinely just dont know how to move on from here.  

any advice at all is appreciated.  again, sorry for strange formatting.",23Oct2020,1

Because I’m unhappy with myself, I find it difficult to justify even dating right now. I also feel alone, so that doesn’t help. I’m trying to think of areas in my life where I feel as though I’m lacking. 

-Job: love it but it doesn’t pay well at all. I can’t live on the money I’m making. I don’t have enough experience in one specific industry to up my pay though.
-School: I barely graduated college and was interested in grad school. I was considering getting an MFA in poetry so that I’m able to teach, but those jobs are few and far between.
-Body: I’m at a point where I’m not really able to hide my weight anymore. I hate how I look in pictures. I feel gross and ugly and hate when someone asks me to be in a pic with them. 
-Relationships: I have decent relationships with my family, but my only two romantic relationships were when I was 19 and 24. For reference, I’m 27 now. I don’t know what goes into a relationship and I’m wondering if I should just accept that one will probably not be coming my way for a while.

592,"So, I'm a 20 year old male, currently single, and, as you probably guessed from the title, a virgin. Now, I'm not the most socially adept person, but I like to think that I know my way around and am a pretty chill guy. However, I haven't really done much dating - I had one long-term relationship that lasted about a year, and one short-term, long-distance relationship that lasted maybe 2 months. Neither relationship was really intimate, and while I was fine with that, tbh I just really want to know what sex is like and have it. 

But, here's where I'm conflicted.

Today, I matched with a girl on Tinder kind of close to me, and she seemed nice, but then she kinda let me know her ""prices"" and I was a bit taken by surprise, but also kind of intrigued. Like, here's a no-strings attached, honestly kind of inexpensive (only $100) way to get what I've spent the last few years really wanting to explore. Plus, it might be good practice? Still, when I looked up relevant questions on the internet, the responses were a mixed bag, which just made me more conflicted. I know that there's this whole stigma about not keeping virginity until you're married, but I don't really care about that. The main issue I have is should I just go and have my first time with a sex worker, who's pretty much a perfect stranger, or save my first time until I'm in a relationship? 

This is eating me up a bit, because while I do really want to experience what sex is like and just have fun, I'm worried since many made it seem like there was a lot of regret involved with just giving virginity away. Thoughts?",23Oct2020,1

We had an excellent bonding and time together, and we had supported each other in many things. We made it very clear to each other from the beginning of this thing that it is temporary and someday we would let it go ( we cannot be together due to at least 3 different reasons the main being our cultural difference). We have had gotten possessive about each other in between and he then made me realize that I cannot be possessive about him and that we should just try to be happy for the time we have left together, which was thought to be till both of us remains in the same company.

Ever since COVID happened in March, we started to talk less and less, and its now gotten to the point where she usually doesn't respond to texts for a week or two on average, and never messages me.

I normally message her every week or so, just to make sure she's doing OK, but I don't want to burden her further if she just doesn't want to continue the friendship anymore.

I'm not really sure how to approach this situation, I don't know if I should keep checking up on her, or if I should just stop messaging her and let her be. I really worry about her sometimes, but I also don't want her to feel obligated to keep talking to me if she doesn't want to.

(This is talking to every resident, asking happiness levels of residents/patients/staff, activities, looking at my paperwork, my assessments/UDAs.) So much. Most people even certified, with years experience, can’t pull that off. Especially during covid-19 outbreaks in my facility. I Aced it. Not one other department could, or did. Again, I have been here over a year and am doing exceptionally well at my job. During the survey process, someone from corporate asked my pay, I told them, and they gasped and said “you need more, that’s degrading.”

I want to be an astronaut /sounds lame, but in a decade or two, I will be one I guarantee you/ My whole purpose in life is to help others, and I believe with science I can help an entire population or species.

Got into what ended as a 5/6 year long relationship. Wasn’t too hopeful on the last year, but kept with it, ended up breaking within the first few months of 2020.

I’m broken. Essentially that’s two breakups in ONE year. I did give it time before fully committing to actually deciding on getting into a relationship. Took it one step at a time.

So I posted on here recently asking for advice about my ex and someone in the fraternity I was pledging. I kept it short and sweet because I honestly did not want to relive a lot of what had happened. Here’s the full story. Me and this girl had been going out for around 10 months when we got into a fight about her hanging around older kids in the fraternity I was pledging at the time. This happened in the summer for context. We didn’t talk for a around a week after this then we met up and discussed what we should do. We both decided on a break even though I did not want this, I was trying to give in and allow for some space between us. The next day she was again hanging out with brothers in the fraternity and we fought really bad. I said some mean stuff to her (didn’t call her any names just said stuff such as “you wasted my time” etc). I apologized the next day and she did not answer. 2 days later I see all over social media that my “brothers” were at her house and they were all hanging out in a group. I saw this and immediately blocked her on everything and got extremely upset. She reached out and wanted to talk for “closure”. I was not so keen to the idea so I let it go for a couple days. We talked here and there and probably around a week later I see her again with them at her house. I bugged out on her and told her what she was doing was completely wrong. She told me “I didn’t want any of this to happen” and “I’d be stupid to take you back after what you said”. At this point, I was very upset and we finally met up to talk. She told me she doesn’t feel the same way anymore and there’s no chance of us getting back together which i accepted. Nothing good came of it and we ended up just fighting and both us got upset. I let more time pass and asked her to talk again. I opened my heart out to her and said I wanna just be friends and that I’m over what happened and I wish her the best. She responded by saying she “still likes me” and we ended up hooking up. I still had her blocked on social media and after this I added her back. 2 days after this I see all over her social media she’s in my hometown partying with people I knew for a while and also my frat brothers who were from my hometown as well (We met in college and she lives about 50 mins away from my town and it was strange honestly to see her with people from my town). I told her I hated her and she was a terrible person after this because I felt at this point that this all had to have some sort of bad intention behind it. She then told me she wanted to talk again, which I unfortunately agreed to. We met up in a park late at night on my birthday surprisingly and she came into my car crying and apologizing for the entire situation. I told her I could never forgive her and we can never be together again. She cried and yelled at me and brought up petty stuff I did wrong during the relationship stating stuff such ass “if I wasn’t a forgiving person we would have been done before we even started”. At this point I had known she was hooking up with a brother and had been since the beginning of this whole argument. That meeting ended again with us hooking up and  me left very confused. This happened around the end of the summer and we then went back to school. At school we did not talk and she was now best friends with all of the brothers in my grade and the grade above. I struggled to accept this and I’m honestly considering transferring or dropping the frat. There is no chance we reconcile anything and i wouldn’t even want to if she did. Also i have a strong hatred for a lot of the members of the frat. What do I do?",23Oct2020,1

But my parents sat me down and told me I could never be an actor or director because it requires a lot of luck.

My GPA isn’t great, I’m sitting at a 3.0 and I’m trying to raise it so I can do a Masters in Social Work. That would make me 24-25 when I finish, and I just feel really behind.

614,"I'm going through a very hard time right now. I was cheated on with someone my ex boyfriend kept telling me not to worry about... after a 7-month relationship (I know for some that's almost nothing, but for me those were the best months of my life). We had a great time together, made future plans, and then all of that suddenly ended. He said that he was going to be busy for an entire week, and I told him to leave me a ""Hello."" every day at least. I didn't ask for much, really. He didn't do that. He was too busy with that woman, and before it would even happen, I saw a connection between them, but I kept trying to ignore that thinking that my bf can't possibly love someone else when he told me so many times that I was the only one and will always be for him. 

It's been a week and I still feel torn and confused. I've been trying to keep my mind occupied with certain things, but I couldn't focus. I kept asking myself: ""What do I lack and that person has that is worth breaking up with me?"" Until I finally realised that it was physical contact, for the most part. It was a long distance relationship and the girl is a stewardess. She is able to visit him as many times as she wishes, I suppose. 

The day when I caught him cheating by tracing the woman's location and seeing that she was in the same place as he was, I left a couple of messages: ""Answer me. I want to talk."" 

I called him once and he declined it. Then I knew that it was definitely over. I knew that I was no longer a part of his life and that someone else was there to make him feel happy. Maybe the person he cheated on me with is better than me in many respects, and this thought simply kills me. 

I've always been a good person and I cared for him deeply. With a few days before the ghosting, we were in a call for hours, having fun, chatting. I guess he was really guilty at that point, so he decided to spend more time with me until he eventually stopped feeling guilty, resulting in him deciding to leave me, forever. 

Also, the person he cheated on me with talks and acts as if nothing had happened (she's from a server and so am I; there, we met my ex bf) and it genuinely pisses me off. I don't think she knows I caught her fucking my ex behind my back, but who knows? 

Besides all of this, I don't get along with my parents at all. They're both emotionally immature - it's awfully hard to communicate with them because they either refuse or cannot understand me. It's frustrating. I can't ever be right or express my opinion about certain things, because it only means that I'm misbehaving. 

Currently, I'm dating someone else... and I think that I've made a big mistake. I don't know if I decided to be in a relationship with this person just so I could forget about my ex bf, or because I actually like the guy. I feel so bad...

Everything is awful and I don't know how I can handle all of this. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, but in an incredibly bad mood, and I want to wake up from this bad dream. I want my happiness back...",23Oct2020,1

616,"My mother has been working for what I'm starting to suspect is a MLM scheme for the past... roughly two years. She started for a side job and just never stopped. She says she's making money off it, but I haven't seen or heard of a solid number of what she makes. To put it simply, she's an ""Independent Stylist"" Which means she buys product for like a 5-20% discount from the company and resells full price to people. She also has booths and such which she has to buy and pay for everything for said booths, like stands, decorations, etc. 

This wasn't a huge deal as our family has been fairly well off, even despite her being diagnosed with breast cancer, undergoing treatment, and beating it. It made her happy so I just supported her. But what's starting to get on my nerves is she's starting to get her friends into it as well. Friends that aren't as well off as us and cant afford all the high priced displays and booths that she has to make the money and sells all the things. I know this because she mentioned a family friend losing two of her jobs and becoming and Independent stylist as a new job and her quota being 300 things to sell by the end of the month. Well, its the 23rd and she had only sold 5. So my mother suddenly decided to take it upon herself to buy from the friend to help her reach the quota... Using my Email and our Dog's name. I got an order confirmation, for 90$! I feel so confused because she's leading her friend in a business that's obviously not meant for her because she cant afford it, and my mother is taking us down with it by spending all the money she's making on rebuying all the products to help her friend reach quota! And this isn't the first friend she's started doing this for.

617,"Hi. I guess I should start off with some background info. I’m in Utah, I work from home full time doing collections calls for a credit union and I am currently going to university as well. My doctor recently had to increase the dosage of one of my medications and he said it could take about a week for my body to adjust to it. Now, I’ve had some issues with my work in the past not being fair with sick leave (making me come in with migraines when I wasn’t even able to drive but allowing a coworker to stay home when she had a cough, etc) of course I may not know all the details of the coworkers situation, but it happened often enough that it did start to get on my nerves. Usually my managers are pretty good about letting us take sick leave if we have enough accrued. Especially now that I’m working from home, I’m not going into branches so they don’t need to find someone to cover my shift. So on Monday I texted my manager and informed her of the situation, letting her know I should be able to work once I was used to the meds. She replied and said that in order to excuse me, she would need a doctors note. That was odd to me considering I’ve never been asked for one in the year and a half I’ve worked there, but I got one anyways and got it to her. I had him write the note for the days I usually work (mon-fri) and got the note to my manager. The next morning I wake up to a text from her informing me that I’m scheduled to work on Saturday. Despite the fact that I was not previously scheduled to, and no one in my department even works on Saturdays. She then said if that didn’t work for me, that I would need to get her an updated doctors note. I’m really not sure what to do in this situation. I know I have plenty of sick leave, and my doctor provided them with a detailed note explaining why I needed the time off, but for some reason they’re adamant that I work at least once this week and I’m not sure what to do. I can’t just not work because I really need to money to pay tuition and rent, but I’m super out of it because of the medications so I can’t really work either and it won’t be a full week of taking the medication until Saturday (although til not sure if that even really matters either) so. I guess my question is this: what should I do? Should I work anyways and see how it goes? Should I call my doctors office and see what I can do about the medications? Or is there any other advice that anyone has? Any and all advice is appreciated. Also, please forgive me for any misspellings and grammar errors, as I said, I’m currently very out of it haha",23Oct2020,1

We didn't break up because of hate or anything, we just mutually decided it's for the best (there was a long distance and also a communication issue). 3 days after the breakup, she found another guy(18m). And a week after that, they started dating. Now this just felt like a massive ""fuck you"" in my face. We were together for 8 months. She says it was her first non-toxic relationship and she claims I was her first ""true love"". But if it takes you less then a week to get over a ""true love"" im not so sure...

we wanted to stay friends after the breakup, but we soon realised, it's not gonna work.
(I personally believe it's impossible to stay friends with someone you've genuinely loved)

We went back and forth after the breakup (arguments and whatever), which was a painful thing to experience, but then I expressed my feelings and she accepted that, apologized and we went our seperate ways. I had closure, which felt really good and really relieving.

Unfortunately, that closure only lasted for about a week and a half (to the present, basically). I'd get these random thoughts of what they could possibly be doing and then that would make me unbelievably depressed or even anxious. I also have some items (gifts) from the relationship hidden away in my room.

Today I've been feeling my worst :\ it feels like a cloud of negative energy around my heart and idk what to do about it. I know it's because of her and how she hurt me and me overthinking the way I am.

624,"Long story short, about 9 years ago I had a toxic relationship with a childhood friend that I thought it might work out with. It didn’t. He moved away for a few years and came back, and since that time we have been off and on talking. Our families love on same street, same highschool, etc. In my mind we are just normal friends, but sometimes it can be cruel and full of insults… about our weight or the new people we are seeing, etc.. I am NEVER friends with my exes but this has always been a gray area for me because what am I going to do when you literally have grown up together. 

Back in August, with the help of my S/O, I was able to recognize the toxicity in our conversations and I let my friend know that I shouldn’t talk to them anymore since we are still toxic. My boyfriend gave me some good reasoning here, it’s okay to be friends as long as you aren’t sending ill-will to each other / ill comments… but if not, it’s best to just cut contact and move on (Especially since I still harbored some hate from my past).

Fast forward to today, I have moved in with my S/O 3 months ago, but the circumstances around my move have been very stressful on both of us. Parents kicked me out / and my dad is dying from cancer, I have no family, 3 real “friends”/confidants, work has been harsh/critical on me, my foot is fractured, and I’m experiencing considerable financial difficulty. A lot of times I have panic attacks at all hours of the day and it’s super stressful on me emotionally. My head hurts a lot… like I’m running head first into a wall when I think.
Awkwardly, this past week I bumped into my “friend”/”ex” at the convenience store by where I work. Turns out he works down the street from my company’s location! (What a small world honestly….) I mentioned this to my S/O that night, though I didn’t delve deeper into it. 

This week at work it’s my fiscal year-end and I had to lead an extraneous/important financial audit at my company. My boss refused to stick up for me and I was experiencing a lot of conflict with my other supervising managers and had to deal with my shifts being rescheduled. At this time… I was experiencing a lot of work difficulty / emotional hardship that I didn’t feel comfortable expressing this near my coworkers. Wednesday night I had a panic attack and fell asleep crying after smoking an entire bowl just out of the amount of anxiety I have.


On Thursday, since I had no lunch, I’ll just call my “friend”/”ex” and have a small lunch near some shops on the other side the freeway. Other than the fact the restaurant had messed up my order, I didn’t realize how badly this would affect my S/O since I know I did all of this on some weird premise like “Oh it’s okay if I have no feelings it’s just friends and I just want to escape work right now and whatever”. 
When I got home that day I did mention to my S/O that I did go out to lunch with my “friend”/”ex” but in general, I normally tell him everything that goes on in my day anyways. To me, it wasn’t too big a deal because I honestly cannot care about my “friend”/”ex” theres just too much drama having to explain all of it to anyone. But again, after I noticed how my S/O reacted to it… I realized oh man I messed up … he didn’t really wanna hear this. No one does… and I just went on to the next topic. At dinner is when he confronted me about everything and its ... just not a good spot.


TLDR: 
Emotionally unstable mind made for terrible decisions.

I broke my partners trust by not letting him know I was going to talk / go to lunch with my “friend”/”ex” since the last time he knew about the situation… we “hated” each other.

Don’t know how to fix this. 
I’ve already blocked my “ex”/”friend”, I’m emotionally over this and I’m not sure what I can do to restore my S/O’s faith in me. All in all, I feel like a low P.O.S. 
I could of reached out to anyone or just had lunch by myself, but I didn’t.

626,"Hello there,

I am really not sure if this pertains to personal finance, but I believe it does considering what I'm about to say. To give you a little idea of my current life, here it goes.

I currently work for an insurance company that gives me $19.50/hr (which is around 40K a year), and I am a year away from graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting and MIS. Through my university I applied for several internships. I was blessed to get an internship offer for Spring of 2021, and right after I had accepted this one, another offer came for a bigger company (one of the big 4 in accounting) for Summer of 2021. Let's call the Spring company Company A, and let's call the bigger one Company B. Both internships pay really well (Company A pays $26/hr, and company B one pays $26.92/hr). Both companies did tell me that if they do happen to like me, they might be open to offer me a full time position after I graduate (December 2021). Company A did mention though that if they like me, they would be willing to extend my internship through the end of the year and then offer me a full time position once I graduate.

This is a little silly, but I don't know what to do. Considering that both internships don't interfere with each other, I accepted both; however, I don't know what I'd do if the internship with company A one goes well and they offer me an internship position for the long-term. Since I am about to move in with my significant other, I am a little worried because I need to make the right decision. I am not a selfish person by nature, so I don't know how I'd turn down the internship with company B if things go well; however, if things don't go well, at least I would have another option available for me.

Another thing to keep in mind is that while I was looking at benefits, both companies are quite similar, except for the fact that company A would let me keep working from home and while it is not a small company, they would not require me to travel to meet with clients. Company B would require me to travel 40-45% of the time, and they would require me to commute and go to the office.

I would love to get advice from anyone who has been faced with this same type of decision or maybe something similar. Should I just worry about my interests, or should I keep in mind the other companies? Now, I know that one way or the other this is a win-win situation for me because I will be getting experience in what I've studied for, and the compensation difference is not that crazy.

Thank you",23Oct2020,1

My friend took 30 min to get there. While I was ordering my coffee, the guy started talking to me. We talked about harry potter and he seemed cool. But then he asked for my number and I kinda felt uncomfortable. 

Now I have a hard time saying no to things. Like I feel really uncomfortable saying no especially when I already interacted with the person. We were already talking for about 30 minutes and I did find the conversation interesting. However, I wasnt really into the guy. Anyways he asked for my number right in front of my friend. Idk what to say. I felt uncomfortable because I was just talking to him for 30 min but like I didnt want his number or him to have my number. Anyways I gave him my number because I was really uncomfortable and anxious. 

Ever since then he text and talks to me. He mentioned how nobody ever really cares about him and how he doesnt have alot of friends. He also compliments me alot and makes sexual references (that make me uncomfortable). I tell him to stop but he is like ""Oh I no you secretly like it"" like no I dont. He always wants to hang out with me. Like the second day of talking to him I told him I didnt want anything more than a friend. Like im not attracted to him. Hes ten years older than me and he tends to put down people my age. Hes always talking about how I need to be open for new opportunities. Like no, I dont want to be open about an opportunity to be with him because I dont like him. Like ik what I like and its not him. But then again I feel bad because he doesnt have much friends. 

Idk what to do. I would feel like a bad person if I blocked him after so much time talking to him. The coffee shop is near where I live and Im scared that I might bump into him one day. Also my sister always advises me to never burn bridges with people. So what should I do about the situation?",23Oct2020,1

I don’t know if it’s just the fact that we’ve been together without jobs during quarantine for months or if i truly am getting over this relationship.

But the messed up part is they uprooted their whole life for me to come here. It would be such a pain for them to move back across the country where their family is.

I can take jokes but I think he over stepped the mark abit so I told him,
“That’s a bit far don’t you think” and now he’s saying that we shouldn’t be friends anymore because I’ve gone soft.

634,"Okay, so I was furloughed mid-March due to covid and shortly after, ended a 6 year relationship with my boyfriend and moved out of that house.  Since I wasn’t actively working at the time and things were very much unknown, I didn’t want to sign into a lease or anything and get myself into financial trouble on top of everything, and so I moved back into my parent’s basement temporarily.  

Well, I just received an email from my job reading that they’re going to begin transitioning people back.  They haven’t given a tentative return date as of yet, but I’d still like to get everything in order for when it actually happens.  The problem, is that for whatever unknown, bullshit reason, I went almost 2 months with no unemployment benefits sent to me, and I can’t speak to anyone to figure out what happened, and just started getting my $500/bi-weekly, minus anything additional that I was told would be included from the state.  So, I am still floating, but just barely, and I’m in no position still to look into signing a lease or contract.  Which is also kind of a problem....

My parents live in BFE.  They have no sewer lines, no cellular network connection, and no cable tv lines that run that far.  The ONLY options for wifi internet here is:  AT&amp;T, who is great, but only when they can offer faster speeds than 12 mbps (mind you, we usually only cap at about 5-6 mbps though), and satellite dish, which if you’ve had any experience with these, you know that a thunderstorm (which come often in spring/summer here) or even a light layer of snow can and will interrupt your satellite signal, therefore breaking your connection until.....whenever Mother Nature finishes her smoke break.  

Do I have ANY options??  I’ve looked into boosters and asked T-Mobile (my mobile carrier) if they had anything I could run through them.  Unfortunately the guy wasn’t sure it would work since I don’t get a data/cellular signal out at my parents house.  The boosters seem to just boost the signal already coming through, which I get a connection fine, it just can’t handle the workload and isn’t enough bandwidth.  Was wondering if an Ethernet connection would make much difference or not. 

I appreciate any help info or advice.  Thanks for taking the time to help.  

TLDR:  Need wifi boost options for very slow internet (12 mbps max but usually runs at 5-6 mbps).  Will be returning to work and need to accommodate high traffic online.",23Oct2020,1

636,"I had an internet friend for 2 years, we were so close. He had some personal issues, he was having a hard time finding a stable job and was preparing for an important exam that will help him get the job he wants. He still lives with his parents and they were a little too hard with him.. so he was stressed many times and was not meeting his friends much, so we were really close because i was the one to whom he talked about his problems with, we used to text everyday all day, and sometimes call for 2 hours.. it was just really a special friendship even tho we never met because he lives so far and for now we can't afford to travel..
That was the good part of the story... the bad part is that i started developping feelings for him and i started being so annoying.. it's like whenever i felt bad because he didn't give me the attention i wanted i started arguing with him and saying that i don't wanna talk to him anymore and that it was over.. my feelings took over and i was being selfish.. now i do regret it. I can't even count how many times I said that i dont wanna talk to him anymore but he never gave up on me, he always used to try to fix things and said that i was precious to him and he didnt want to lose me. I think i did my best most of the time because i cared for him so much, so i supportef him during hard times and i was always there for him.. but i can't deny that i was also a bad friend because i couldn't control my feelings.. 
A month ago, we had a fight again and i was so mad and said that it's over, he tried to make me change my mind but at the moment i was just so mad that i didnt listen to him, so we ended up saying ""have a good life and take of you"". 
We already did this before, we already said bye but ended up talking to each other again after like 2 or 3 days. 
But this it's different, he used his social medias for the next 2 days but suddenly disappeared. I texted him the 3rd day (it's been a month ago), but he never read my messages or answer them, he just completely stopped getting online, but he didnt delet his accounts tho..
I texted him on 2 different apps, but i didnt text him on instagram because i know he rarely use it, like he opens instagram once a month or something and he doesnt even know how to check DM's there. But i realized a week after the fight that he actually opened ig, but didnt open the apps he usually opens.. so i texted him there (been like 23 days i guess) and he didnt reopen it since then. At least i know that he is fine cuz he opened ig.. 
Now it's been a month of no contact.. I miss him so much.. he never disappeared like this before, a part of me wants to believe that he just wanted some time alone and he will come back.. and another part finds it so weird because he never acted like this before and he's maybe gone for good.. but why didn't he delet his social medias if he's not planning to come back? I have so many questions going on in my head..
I don't know if i should keep the little hope i have and keep waiting for his come back.. or i should just give up.. what do u guys think?

639,"Long story short, my mom is horrible and our family is literally broken apart and she had 4 boyfriends (i think even more when i wasnt alive)

She also had a tragic past blabla 
IM FREAKING OUT MAN
MY MOM IS HAVIN AN AFFAIRE WITH HER BOSS
and i even heard them having fun in moms bedroom.

aint going to tell the whole story how u found out but i found out and confronted my mom bout that and yes she even confirmed it. She said she would get fired if anyone knows

but lol ion care ❤

jk im just telling people who i REALLY trust.

I am kinda used to that mom has boyfriends.
There was a time when she was single for like 5/4 years. now she is doing it again but the thing is that i am NOT OKAY that
1. Its her boss
2. The boss has a healthy family.

The boss has 2 sons.


RIGHT NOW
im sitting in a train rn and my mom was asking me if it would be okay if she would come together with him.
i said that i dont care anymore cus honestly im sick of the family and now that shit is happening.
I am okay as long as he doesnt talk to me if we live together
but i think about the family he has.
The family is probably happy but..
What if the boss's wife and sons get all depressed.

I dont want them to feel sad cus my dumb mom.
but on the other hand.. my mom also had a shitty life and caused me mental illness. Im not that fucked up to let the boss's family suffer but i can also not help?
MAYBE i can help in saying that i wont let it slide that they gonna be a couple, so the boss is staying in his family.

gosh imagine cheating. Why do i feel like i need to watch over them, as if its my decision. And what if the boss feels unhappy???

And my mom made my life to hell. Never wanted me to see my biological father and always storms in my room and randomly yell at me for being lazy.
 depression doesnt exist for her. I try to help as much as i can in the house and im actually standard status in school.

My mom is very hard working, never had time for me and wants me to help in the household.
You know, after i found out that she was with the boss, she was happy.
I never saw her happy like that for ages and she wouldnt storm in my room to yell at me again.
She is REALLY calm and even was social with me. Yk like she asks me how my day was and suddenly hangs with me in the living room (i mostly kick her out of the living room for being annoying and always looking for a fight)

I texted a friend about it and she wasnt okay that i said ""i dont care. just do what you want with your life.""
Now i have too much on my mind and cant decide what i should do.

as you can see i cannot make up my mind.
Its either their family or my family.

Its not really a question for advice i guess

I got leep 10 days days ago to remove the warts and today the result of the test came in, they were genital warts. (Condyloma) 
I got shocked and i couldn't belive it, but well i gess i have to accept it and figure out a way to live with it..

Would it help if i get vaccinated now?

645,"TLDR:Union forbids strikes-but my boss knew about plans of it and did not do anything to prevent it and is punishing employees- do I inform HR?

I work somewhere where this a group of union workers and a bunch of non-union as well. I am not personally in the union so I’m not the most familiar with the terms- but it is clear that the union contract states employees are not allowed to strike. (ofc this is terrible, but employees are able to negotiate their terms)

A situation happened about an employee in the union wanted their wage to be raised, but was blocked by HR-even though my boss advocated for them. This employee thought about stepping down to a lower position just to make life less complicated and had told some coworkers about it-but plans changed and they applied to a higher position at a partner location. 

Somehow the latter did not spread as well-and almost all union workers called out sick (which is not technically striking) with the demotion in mind not the upgrade in position. 

It was a stressful day- but we still operated. My boss informed me that the above employee mentioned that people were starting to form plans to strike. This employee did not participate in the strike. But this means that both knew that it was going to occur-and neither took action to protect the union workers- who risk termination for breaking their contract/or at very least severe punishment. 

The above employee is struggling &amp; super emotional bc they do not want their coworkers to be terminated (and informed my boss prior to any action being taken) and my boss is also taking a stance of being intimidating and carrying through w punishment of employees (able to occur bc another union employee has now stated that strike was planned).

Of course all of these employees made their own decisions to call out/while knowing the terms of their contract-but my boss is taking the stance with HR that they knew nothing about it and honestly victimizing themself. 

Do I inform HR that boss was informed previously and did not tell them? This will most likely affect their position. This may also affect the above employee receiving higher paid position (maybe not bc they took the appropriate action by informing boss and did not participate). 

I do not want my boss to hate me or lose her job,I do not want to see my coworker struggle with this moral dilemma since she took the appropriate action, I do not want union workers to face punishment bc they work extremely hard, but I am now liable with the information of my boss knew it was planned and risk the safety of my own position.",23Oct2020,1

647,"For context, I made my coming out two years ago and got a girlfriend shortly after. We dated for a while, got engaged within a few months (she pressured me into it), and she was massively abusive while we dated, especially toward the end. She ghosted me, got mad that I didn’t text, then compared herself to my ex which made me instantly block her. 

It’s been a little over a year now. I can’t help but think about her, but only because the abuse she put me through gave me so many trust issues. 

Except, now I dream about her more and more often. I dream about other (shitty) exes too but most often her. It’s always a good dream, where we’re in love again... but everytime, I feel this fear and this dread even if the dream is good and loving. 

I wear her jacket sometimes, and I always excuse it on “it keeps me warm but it’s light enough to not be annoying”. But of course, everytime I wear it, I have to think of her. (Seriously tho, it’s so damn comfortable, it’s the only reason I haven’t burned it.)

I had a date last week, and it went well. Since I was a teenager it’s the first time I’ve been single for more than a year and I thought I was ready to get back in the game. However, while like I said it went well, I absolutely had no wish to persue anything. She’s nice, cute and funny, but I felt physical pain at the thought of dating someone again. 

I’m worried about it. I miss being in love, but I don’t know what’s stopping me. I know I’ll always love my ex despite all the abuse she put me through and the trauma it gave me, but I never even cried once about her, not even when we broke up. If anything, through the nostalgia, I feel relief. 

I worry that she’s what’s keeping me back from dating. Is it fear of commitment, fear of relationships? Or is it that I’m not over her and just can’t see myself with anyone else?",23Oct2020,1

The last 4 months of our relationship(we were long distance btw) I had this really weird feeling that he was cheating on me. The thing is I also suffer from anxiety, overthinking and I can also be a little insecure so I was never sure if I was being paranoid or if it was actually a gut feeling.

So lately I’ve been experiencing covid symptoms and have just been feeling terrible and last night when I was feeling just really sick and was actually afraid that I was dying, I got this urge to text my ex to ask him if he cheated on me during our relationship. To be honest I can’t tell you exactly what made me do this but I did and reading the text now that I feel a lot better, I’ve realized how dramatic I sounded.

“Hi, there’s a possibility that I have covid so just in case anything happens I have one last question that I want to ask you” was how I started it off 🤦‍♀️ and he did respond but he asked what does having covid have to do with my question and now that I’ve thought about it I really don’t know lol.

In response, i kind of freak out and dm the person saying that calling me a bad teacher is totally uncalled for considering I am taking my own free time to offer my help, and most of my other friends call me an ok teacher at least. Said person responds with saying that its a joke, and posts our dms in a group chat where i get ridiculed for not being able to take a joke. Keep in mind this person was one of the people I considered a dear friend. At first i request for him to apologize to me if he really meant it as a joke, i said if he apologized for hurting my feelings, i would apologize for overreacting. He simply replies with “eat my shit”. So i swallow my pride, and after cooling down, i message him apologizing. Asking to move past this incident, and not wanting this to affect our friendship, i apologize for overreacting, and he leaves me on read.

658,"So my neighbors kids are 5 and 6. They love my dogs and at least twice a day (sometimes more) they will knock on our glass sliding door to ask if the dogs can come out. This wouldnt be a problem if we didn't have to be out there with the dogs. They are sweet kids but it's getting excessive. They will tap and then start banging on the door until someone answers it. 
How can we ask their parents to get them to stop without sounding like we don't like their kids? Is there a way to get them to stop without hurting their feelings or telling their parents?

659," Hi All,

I've been a guest speaker for events or universities but I've always wanted to have a discussion/interview with a blogger or podcast. It is something helpful to the readers but obviously it is helpful for myself as well. As someone with a side-gig as a consultant, it's always helpful to be able to link to external sources.

This being said I have a couple of questions for the community.

1. Any thoughts on how someone who performs Business/Customer Success/IT services could position themselves to be a worthwhile interviewee without being a household name?
2. Any bloggers out there interested in interviewing someone with a background supporting huge brand names as a Global Technical Account Manager in the software/DCIM/Cloud verticals? I also have a background in Systems Engineering in Healthcare and Finance.
3. Do you prefer blog interviews, video interviews or PodCast interviews?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and perspective.",23Oct2020,1

661,"TW: descriptions of having Covid and discussion of being a rape survivor.

This is a complicated one, guys. I'm sorry.

I (22F) caught Covid-19 a few months ago while working as a waitress (in a very conservative state, I was so careful but customers wouldn't stop pulling down their masks to yell in my face and my managers were not following CDC protocol). I had a really bad case though I thankfully avoided the hospital. But it was really traumatic for me, I was completely alone, across the country from my family and my girlfriend, unsure of what was going to happen to me and, I've never really heard anybody talk about this, but seeing yourself while you're sick with Covid is really terrible. Your lips turn blue, your skin becomes grey, your face and body become somehow sunken and swollen at the same time. It makes you unrecognizable. I had never felt uglier. On top of that, I had no strength, I wasn't able to eat, I was completely confused the whole time, it was just really scary and there was nobody to take care of me.

So fast forward to now, I don't have hard symptoms anymore, but I still don't have my entire sense of smell back, I've become incredibly clumsy, I can't see or hear as well as I used to, it's so much harder to focus or do math in my head, I'm still coughing all of the time. I just feel like I've been robbed of so much. It's affected my schoolwork, my performance at my new job, everything. It also brought up some of the same emotions I had when I survived being raped, like the feelings of fearing for my livelihood and having no control over what happens to my body. Catching a brutal, deadly disease because of someone else's disregard for you feels violating. I'm just so desperate to feel a sense of dignity or pride over myself and my body again.

But the real thing I need advice about is what it has done to my relationship. My girlfriend (20F) has a really bright personality and a great sense of humor. She has a lovely silliness about her and she makes me laugh so much. Even though I'm a more serious person and our senses of humor sometimes clash, I've never been more in love with a woman or happier in a relationship. But lately, I've been so sensitive and short with her, especially when she teases me or notices anything sub-par about my appearance.

An example is that last night she kissed me and suck her tongue into my mouth as a joke. I told her to stop, but she did it a few more times and I got so upset I put on my shoes and walked out of the apartment and down the block, even though we were with friends. I just felt so disrespected and violated I couldn't stand to be around anyone. And this morning, I had to put on something that didn't look good and that I didn't feel comfortable wearing because I haven't had time to do laundry, and when she pointed it out, I snapped at her so fast and became really upset. I almost started to cry, and I behaved really aggressively and made her upset too. I've just become so sensitive and I don't know how to stop. We had a conversation about it over breakfast and forgave each other. She told me she feels like a punching bag for my frustrations sometimes, and I'm so ashamed of myself. I never want her to feel that way. I want her to feel loved and cherished and respected, just like I want to feel.

I guess what I'm asking is, what can I do to feel better, and heal from the feeling of being robbed of my dignity so I can keep from getting so reactive and upset with my girlfriend, who has only been trying to make me laugh?",23Oct2020,1

When we're having the food fights we tend to grab and hold onto one another while fighting over the food. He acts like a bit of a fuck boy but he's really nice deep down. He stays behind and works late shifts with me, drives me home afterwards if its really late at night and if its not too late he'll take me to the station. The other night we were working a late one and while walking up the hill to his car he linked arms with me cause i said i was too tired to walk. 

Once i dropped something on the floor at work and went ""ah fuck me"" and he shouted ""okay!"" 

But then when we're at work and i try to get past him sometimes ill put my hand on his waist. I did it today and he was like ""why do you always touch me? You're a lil creep"". This was in front of people. But when we're alone together he'll touch me and do something like link arms with me. We even hugged the other night when we were tired.

665,"Hi y'all, i literally made this accout just to ask this because i'm EXHAUSTED, a bit of info about the situation, i live with my mother, brother, aunt and cousins, not american so english isn't my first language, i think that's the only relevant info i guess, my problem is my 27 y/o brother, lately he's been a fucking  **p e s t.**  
He doesn't work at all and doesn't provide anything to the house, he's studying uni rn because he dropped out when he was younger, the problem is the fact that he acts fucking 12 instead of 27, never cleans anything, doesn't wash and leaves out everything after he cooks (dirty pans with leftover food stuck, dirty plates, fucking egg shells and old rotting chicken out that makes the whole house smell like utter shit), he also has a pitbull dog who's fucking aggresive with anyone but him and has bit me and my family, thing is, he doesn't take care of him or even checks on him, lives in the backyard because nobody can't even pet or get near him and barely feeds him at night. Oh but he keeps a stray cat full of fleas and ticks in his carpeted, small ass bedroom, did i mention he shits himself every other day wich makes the top floor of the house smell like an animal is dying? And also, my mother really hates cats because a childhood trauma, he says she's ""fucking insane"" and that ""whatever she says is bullishit"" (she also has fucking asthma and her throat fucking colapses at the sight of a cat)   


As i said, he doesn't work, so every weekend when he goes out to drink he asks my mom for **a lot of fucking money,** keep in mind he treats my mom like shit and makes her cry every other fucking day, and she just hands him the fcking money, also he """"""started"""""" (because he fucking dropped it a month later as i predicted) a diet that involves a lot of different foods from what the rest of the family normally eats, wich (where i live) is fucking expensive as shit, mom buys JUST HIM like 50$ dollars worth of food,  and like i said, he doesn't clean after himself, he also smokes inside, to add insult to injury

  
And to fucking top it ALL OF IT off, he's fucking pedantic and mean, he talks to my mom like she's fucking stupid and treats her and me like shit, he half assedly tries to be ""nice"" when he asks for money or expensive ass food, but he just treats everyone like they're stupid, he also has this big ass superiority complex because he has good grades and thinks he's like, refined, smart, elevated or some shit like that, he likes poetry and philosophy and all this bullshit and thinks he's like an erudite or some  Sasuke kind of guy shit. Truth is, he's also mysoginistic and has *discretely* and *nicely* called me a whore and a slut behind my back because of the way i dress, wich fucking mind you, isn't his fucking problem or business.   


I've talked to my mom about fucking **DOING SOMETHING** but she just says ""you're not his mother, you're just his sister, you're a fucking child, don't tell me what to do"" and shit like ""what can i do? kick him out? i'd be a bad mother"" and other shit like ""he treats me like i'm stupid, but i'm not stupid, some day my patience will run out"" **AND IT NEVER FUCKING RUNS OUT, she let's him fucking step on her and basically spit on her face**, It has gotten to the point where i feel phisically sick, my fucking head hurts and i just want him to fucking dissapear and stop being a fucking parasyte, obviously, communication is out of the fucking talk, because you just can't talk with him like a fucking person, so i've recurred to do *other childish shit* to ruin his day, while he's cooking i just put a shit ton of salt in his food without him noticing, drop beer on his shirts and make it look like it was the cat, breaking his earphones, smearing the rotted food he leaves out between his bed (i think there was maggots in his bed because of it) and now i'm thinking about breaking his expensive ass lights that he leaves all night on and skyrocket the lightbill, and **\*drumroll\*** taking the cat to an animal shelter, but, this isn't enough for me anymore, at all, i need him out of the fucking house, he's almost **FUCKING 30 AND ISN'T PLANNING ON DOING AAAAAAANYTHING WITH IS LIFE, I'M FUCKING DONE,** he's the fucking reason i'm saving money to fucking dip when i'm 18, i sincerely, honestly, fucking want him to get fucking lost forever, any fucking idea on how to get him fucking dead? or at least out?

She studies medicine, so it is crucial for her to get some good sleep in my opinion.

Is there any way (ideally not meds) that could help her sleep better?

667,"Wow I am so grateful this group exists right now. I will try to keep this as short as possible but I know it will just end up being long so bear with me ❤️

I work at a non-chain pet store that prides itself in health checking their animals before selling them and only buying from responsible breeders.
Except lately we have grown in popularity so much, we have been (knowingly) buying and selling more animals that had questionable health, just to keep up with demand and keeping profit margin. Some animels turned out to be outright sick and potentially infectious to other animals. This is my first issue and goes completely against what I stand for.

My second and biggest issue is the gross lack of communication between my colleagues. We are a team of 7 people. We have no group chat, no work meetings and no performance interviews. My boss has no reason for this, he just doesn't feel like doing that. Me and some other people have been begging for at least a quick summary of important things that need to happen the day after so we know what to do and how to do it, but to no avail. He only really communicates things after they have already gone wrong basically. And even then sometimes he doesn't and just keeps it to himself. 
This has resulted in a LOT of insecurity on my part. My insecurity makes me panicky, hyperactive and I tend to over-exaggerate a lot of things which results in more insecurity. I have talked to my boss about this once, but he felt no need to really evaluate this ever, when I know for a fact it bothers everyone in the team. I have been told by one of the few people in the company I really like as a friend that they have even made fun of my insecure behaviour once. I know this is one of my weak spots and I genuinely want to improve myself.

Now my third reason is my boss' son. He gave him a job and is exactly like his father. He also acts like everyone around him is an idiot (especially me because I'm always to stressy) and he's not very customer friendly. At the same time he doesn't do a lot when he's at work. He's on his phone a lot and only really helps customers when they actively come to him with questions. And when people have concerns about buying an animal because they've had a bad experiences before, he doesn't try to ease their conscience but just acts like they're not worth his time. He's also the only one that is in actual contact with my boss so they feel like this pretentiously high and mighty unit that nobody can communicate to. 

Today I caught him making fun of me again and that basically just convinced me on the spot that I am going to talk to my boss about quitting tomorrow.
Now my big questions are:

-does this happen regularly in a work environment? This is the only company I have ever worked for. If not I would love to talk to people that have been through something like this and get your advice on how you dealt with this.
-when I quit, do I give my boss the actual above reasons, knowing he will very likely not take me seriously or scoff it off. Or do I just make up a simple story that will save me the stress of probably being made fun of behind my back, but will not improve the company whatsoever.

I really cared about this company and the animals I took care of so much. And knowing the customer base I built for myself, this company is going to lose a LOT of valuable customers. I'm very prominent in the community and people will definetly be asking questions when I leave. And while on the one hand I feel bad that everything I worked for is going downhill, I really don't care for the people that are going down with it.",23Oct2020,1
668,"I met someone on the internet about 3-4 years ago. We've talked pretty much everyday since then, we've had our ups and downs, and I cut them off for several reasons, but found myself texting them again to see how things were doing. We're on good terms right now, we never exactly fight or have disagreements, but I feel like they just don't care about the relationship. I know that's just what it seems, because deep down after having long conversations they always let me know how much they love and care for me, they just have a lot of trouble with expressing their feelings. We both agree that they have a lot to work on, specially their cofidence. I've tried to help them about it, give them advice, just be there for them, but nothings seems to really work. Most of the time it feels like a one-sided relationship. I'm asking for advice because I've already tried to tell them how I feel, and they have acknowledged it, but they seem to only take into account their feelings, and completly ignore how frustrating it is to be in my position.

This isn't about having a crush that doesn't reciprocate my feelings, we've actually talked about that and we both feel the same way about it. We're very close, talk about basically anything and have a lot of things in common. I feel like I've come to this point where I just can't cut the relationship off, not because of them but because I feel like I'm losing something so so important, and I'm so lucky to have them I'm just making a huge mistake I'll regret.

670,"Cheap boyfriend

This situation is making me feel some type of way. My boyfriend (22) and I (20) have been dating for about a month now. We are both final year college students. (I graduated from high school early hence me being 20).   Anyways, on our first date he took me out for coffee and he paid. I was fine with that because it’s the first date, we are both not working and I’m college so it’s understandable. The next time we went out, I paid for dinner for both of us. This was still fine because I offered. We then agreed to alternate paying whenever we went on an official dinner date . The next time was his turn to pay but he took me to a really cheap restaurant where we both shared one plate. This raised a flag in my head but I overlooked. Last week, we went out for a proper dinner again and I paid. 

Yesterday I was casually over at his house and we got hungry. Unfortunately I had left my wallet at home because I wasn’t planning on spending so much time at his place. He said it was fine and we went to get sandwiches. The bill was $14 (my food cost $5). He made sure to ask what I ordered that made my bill $5. Today is our official date night and since I paid for the last one, it is his turn to pay. He starts complaining about how he bought me food last night so I should be the one to pay for dinner tonight. It is important to note that every time I paid for dinner, the bill was $50 minimum but he barely spends up to $20. I would have paid for my own sandwich last night if I had brought my wallet when I came over, I just wasn’t planning on having dinner with him at all yesterday. I was supposed to be back home before dinner time. 

We both come from well off families so money is not a problem. The issue I have is I find myself spending much more on him than he does in return. I know he can afford to pay because he always has money to spend on weed and booze and hanging out with his friends but never enough for me. This guy eats steak three times a week. He calls it “self care”. Obviously not having money is not the issue here. So what is the problem?",23Oct2020,1
671,"CONTEXT : I study Industrial Design (which is basically making objects from like, cars and planes to maybe a sofa or a set of cutlery) - I'm currently in 4th year of 5 so I'm expected to reach a certain level with my projects at this point so I make a huge effort for them to be quiet unique and have certain quality, this is why this is becoming such a frustration for me


So, recently we started a new (individual not grupal) project in class, the way we present our advances is by sharing them during the online class in front of everyone. I was the only one presenting stuff during the first classes cause I started working early, the teachers talked with me and my classmates listened while I showed my sketches and explained my idea. It went like this for about a month.

Let's say I'm making an set of items A, B and C inspired by an octopus, I've been talking and developing this with my teachers since day 1 so the know what my project is. 

During one class, right after I end explaining, this guy who's starting to work on his project says he will be doing a set of items inspired on a Spider, he then proceeds to text me telling me It would be fun for him to fight my projects with his - I let it slide 

The next class he says he will do a water spider - so now he also has a water animal with a lot of legs. He didn't have any idea in mind, he just knew he wanted to work around a water spider. 

The following class he says he's designing a set of items A, B and C during the class - so now he's doing the exact same I've been doing for about a month already, and he also supposedly came up with everything from one class to the other while I've been working on this for a while. I was so mad, I am very mad.

My other classmates texted me immediately to ask if I was noticing what the dude was doing, I said I did but I can't just interrupt him talking in class to say EXCUSE ME TEACHERS HE'S DOING THE EXACT SAME THING I'M DOING. The only good news are that the teachers really like what I'm doing so hopefully they realize what's going on.

He then texts me, we were talking and he casually mentions that the dean was having dinner with his family the other day ----  am I going crazy or he trying to tell me not to say anything because they know each other????  

At first I thought ""well, I was showing my stuff before they started so maybe what I've been talking about during class had some sort of influence on them starting their own things"" but now he's just blatantly repeating everything I said the previous classes and it's making me nervous that this may affect MY grade. 

I felt suspicious so I started checking on his projects for other subjects, and guess what, this is not the first time does it. We post out stuff on a google drive, so everyone can read the other ones stuff, and we can also see the dates posted. There are actually a few projects of his that look like mine and I never saw them! I even checked the dates of the different stages of the projects and everything and I can confidently say I can prove he copied me on at least one other project too, and he didn't even bother to change much.

What do I do? My family says to talk privately to the teachers - but what do I say? How do I bring it up in the correct manner? Can you help me plan something to say? I'm really sad that this could make me look bad.",23Oct2020,1

Hey all, so I’m here to talk about how shitty my life has been lately because the world revolves around money.

I also just found out I have to pay $50 to the dmv or else I’ll get my license plate revoked.

I want to be an extrovert and I love going out and exploring the city, but I just can't, because my parents are just so scared. 

Not only that, they believe that I’m just asking if I could go out because I need to meet my non-existing boyfriend. Every time they ‘let’ me go out, which is them dropping me off at a friend’s, my mom always looked at me like she did me a favour. Or that she doesn’t believe me and wants me to know that. It’s so annoying that most times, I turned my friends down because of her facial expression. 

I feel exhausted to even ask them to let me go out, because every time I tell them I want to, they ask me a hundred questions about where I was going and how I know my friend(s), when I’d be back, who’d drop me off at home (bcs they don’t want me to travel by cab/taxi), if their parents are home, if there’s guys, etc. I’m afraid I’m going to spend the rest of my college years like this, sitting in my room doing nothing at all and being envious of my friends who get to hang out with whoever they like, without having to worry about answering their parents’ questions.

I never told him why I stopped talking to him, and it was sudden, because it only hit me that it was r*pe the day after, since I was in denial. The issue is he tries to talk to me in club meetings sometimes, so I just give him short, dry and polite responses and then go about my day. I don’t want to be on bad terms necessarily with him because he’s friends with everybody in that club so he can turn them against me cause everybody loves him, and plus, I don’t want to ruin the club for myself by being on bad terms with someone and making it awkward so I’m pretending to be friendly and that everything’s fine. But on the other hand, I don’t want him to think we’re on good terms either which I think he does, given that he still talks to me. I’m thinking I should just ask him to leave me alone and tell him what he did was fucked up? This issue is he’s a r*pist so he probably knows that already.

I've been sad for no particular reason especially in the evening. I don't have many friends (like 4 that I would consider as that) and it seems to me that I am not the first choice for anyone. What I mean by this is, that no one would choose to hang out with me over someone else. 
I am currently in my last year of school and with that comes a lot of anxiety about my final exams. I know what I want to do afterwards and I have some goals I want to reach, but everyday fees useless. I feel lonely and empty. 
I don't have any hobbies apart from playing games which I don't consider as a hobby but rather a way to pass time. I sometimes write but only when I have a particular thought in mind and that happens about once a month. 

If you have any advice for me on how I could improve my situation so that days are with waking up for. Just ask if you have any further questions. Thank you for reading about my struggles.",23Oct2020,1
682,"Hey reddit, I came here hoping for some advice. I often turn to reddit for reviews, solutions, etc. so I though this might be a good place to ask this.

My wife and I have been married for over 10 years, and she has increasingly become obsessed with gimmicks and quick solutions for things rather than dealing with what would be the root issue. From income to health, she's bought it all. Several MLMs, essential oils, chiro plans, you name it.

Today she sent me a link for magnetic dots to put on our cell phones to combat her dizziness and light headaches. We are currently conversing over text about it and I know the path this will take as it's become all too familiar. I am just exhausted of it. 

My philosophy has been to correct the poor habits that may be contributing to any given issue BEFORE buying ANYTHING, because otherwise the issue is simply masked and not fixed. My advice to her in her headaches and dizziness, fatigue, etc has been water intake. START there. She consumes a max of 24 oz of water a day and simply makes excuses as to why she can't or wont try for more, and often turns the situation around on me being dismissive and that being the answer to everything. I know 24oz is not healthy. I realize its better than nothing, but shouldn't she at least CONSIDER trying it faithfully before dismissing it? Additionally she spends the majority of her free time looking down on her phone. Habitually. Religiously. I simply can't break her of it. Yet a magnet will solve this particular issue.

There are many more instances of this type of behavior, from flouride in toothpaste to soap being harmful to us. And her answer is ALWAYS a shortcut rather than a conscious effort at fixing a problem.

My wife is wonderful and I love her dearly and I want to spend the next 60 years with her, please do not misunderstand this as a knock on her. But I need to get past this type of solution because, well, its stupid and expensive.

My question, reddit, is how do I converse with her about this type of thing? Whether its essential oils over disinfectants, or magnets over better habits. Is there a path I can take to discuss this type of thing or is it purely situational? There HAS to be something I can do here.

Thanks guys!",23Oct2020,1
683,So I’ve been friends with this girl for a while and we chat online a lot. We’ve met before and have gone to the same school and we’re really good friends. Lately we’ve been REALLY close. And she’s been telling me about how’s she’s toxic and how she self harms. I’ve been putting up with it for a while and helping her the best I can. But lately I’ve just grown tired of helping her all the time. I just hate waking up at 1 in the morning to help her out when I have a busy school schedule. And on top of that my mental health is also really bad. I just feel like giving up on her sometimes. But i’ve told her stuff about me no one else knows and i’m scared she’ll tell people if I leave her. Idk what to do anymore and I’m really close to hurting myself too,23Oct2020,1
684,"Pretty self explanatory but basically my fathers birthday is coming up in 2 weeks and idk what to get him. I want to get him something because he’s always so nice to everyone and always gets things for me and my siblings but usually gets nothing in return or nothing for himself. He’s turning 42 if that makes any difference.

686,"Since I turned 24 (I'm 25, 26 in a month now) I've completely lost interest in dating. I used to be very worried about meeting someone before this but now I don't care, instead I enjoy spending time by myself or with my friends. 

I've tried online dating again but every time I open the app I can't bring myself to message a girl. It feels pointless, like it's a waste of time. Also, messaging feels like a chore, like I have to pretend to be really upbeat and funny in order to get a date. Likewise half the girls don't interest me. I feel extremely disillusioned with the whole process for some reason. 

It's the same in real life, I often can't be bothered to go through the whole process of 1st date, 2nd date, 3rd, etc. It feels like a game, like I'm playing a game in order to get somewhere with a girl. I know this is a part of dating but I don't find it exciting anymore like I used to. I still look at girls, and still feel sexual desires but I don't feel the need to act upon them anymore. It's all very muted. 


Is it normal to feel this way at my age?",23Oct2020,1
688,"Asking for a friend. 

Her dad recently passed away and went through a really rough time with alcoholism/suicidal thoughts. One night the girl and fiance's step dad who is married to fiance's mom flirted, this continued on for a couple months. They didn't have sex but did spend a lot of time together and texted a lot which became suspicious. One night at a family function the girl drunkenly accidently rubbed his back. The fiances mother then accused the daughter in law of trying to ""molest her husband"" and told all of the family and friends this girl was after her husband and ultimately tried to turn everyone against her. Thus, the family nor step-dad talks to the girl and everyone has a half-ass story when the step dad was not innocent. She has screenshots of conversations and proof that she is not the only guilty one. Would you tell your side, or let everyone believe a story and wait for things to maybe one day blow over??",23Oct2020,1
689,"  

I went through a harsh breakup about a month or so. Not good, said it was mutual “ we are not meant to be"" kinda shit it was amicable and there were no bad feelings and we promised to remain ""friends"". Deep down I didn't want to and honestly, I felt that I was dumped.

I live in another country with no family and no long-term friends, I have some real friends back home and around the world but they are so far we can’t connect properly. Despite the distance, we talked through everything and my closest one realized how bad I was feeling and told me to travel ASAP and stay with her in her house but I can't because of COVID. (fuck 2020)

But I wasn't too worried about loneliness because here I had a really close friend group or I thought so, I know they are friends with my ex also with me and I thought we were close. They helped me move out after the breakup and settle in my new place and comforted me for a couple of days and it felt very soothing but after I was settled in they stepped away. It's been almost two weeks and they don't text or call or nothing. The last time I called to pick something that I left in their house they were cold and super distant and received me outside and rushed thing so I left, it broke my heart but I tried to thing they were busy, after that they didn't reach out again and I didn't either to not pressure them. 

The problem is I don’t know what I did wrong. Nothing happened between us that I can pinpoint and it is so strange. I feel like is the same situation with my ex I don't know what I am doing wrong for people to be pushing me away. When we talk and they always say that I'm great and kind so I’m beyond confused. 

I've been struggling so much and I hate to be alone. The solitude is pushing me to a very dark place. I don't eat much, once a day max, chain-smoking like crazy, I go out every day in the middle of the night to walk for a couple of hours, I usually cry and chain smoke listening to music. is cathartic but it became necessary since the rest of the time I'm just sitting in my house.  I've sleeping very little and I'm exhausted, hardly getting out of bed and neglecting university. I don't understand what I did wrong. I want to ask but I'm scared of sounding desperate. At this point I know I need someone to help me get through this because I'm sinking.

 I've tried reaching out to other people but they seem to be busy or for some reason brush me off and meeting new people sounds exhausting because I don't even have the energy to pretend that I'm okay. 

I really need help and I wished they saw that and it breaks me that they don't even consider checking a bit on me. 

What am I supposed to do? I want to keep my dignity and I don't want people to know that I am crumbling because the other party seems absolutely fine and I do not want to force them to be with me for pity by telling them I am not okay?

 How do I get through this completely alone? I don’t want to but I guess I have to which destroys me to mean so little to the people I love.",23Oct2020,1
690,"I’ve been sick for a few days and so have my mother. My father too, but he refuses to stop working. I’m 18, my mom is around 48 and my father almost 60. We’ve had symptoms of covid and my mother called the doctor. The doctor said we should go get testing. We called my father and said we should too. He called back again and started to argue with me and my mom on “what’s the point of getting tested, they’re not gonna cure you.” “There’s no treatment” I said that it would be a good thing to get tested and our doctor said we should. And we kept arguing. My mother was on my father’s, even though she said to me that her breathing is terrible!!! She uses this machine to help her breathe when she sleeps, I’d think it would be a good idea to still get tested. She often goes out to get groceries and people have been coming in and out of our house to do construction (like 2 other people). My father said “that’s why you wear a mask”. My father also kept saying, the entire time we were sick “you haven’t lost your taste, so it’s not covid.” I’ve tried to explain to him that it’s one of the many symptoms of Covid. Guess what, me and my mom can’t taste food. Then he changes and says “when you get sick, you sometimes lose the taste, it’s not covid. It’s the flu or cold.” I’m sorry, but I’ve only had problems with my respiratory system. I’ve been able to eat normal, no nausea or anything. Terrible pain in my chest, and A Doctor Said We Should Get Tested!! I’m sorry, but I trust a doctor over a man who only wanted to pay someone 100 dollars to remove my wisdom teeth just like they did with him. But guess what, he said that when he got his wisdom teeth out, it was one of the worst pain he has ever felt, like his brain was being sucked out. He wanted that same experience with me. At this point, I think he barely cares about me and would probably care once I died. So what should I do? Should I stop arguing and stay home, or should we get testing.

1. I as a person can't really make proper connections with people the way others can, meaning I don't have close friends or best friends at all, so I'm largely alone (something i am okay with/tend to enjoy)
2. My friends aren't as good as I made them out to be lmfao

Even though,he does all these, I am not sure whether he see me as a best friend or just a friend. I am always vocal about my feelings , maybe that's why I am skeptic about this. He has a another girl best friend from a different school. My feelings for him are entirely platonic and the friends I had so far were backstabbers. So he is the friend I am genuinely happy with and I trust him. Maybe this is just an irrational fear. What should I do?

Most of the students here are older than me and not tech savvy, so sometimes, the course can be overwhelming for them. For slow learner students, I try my best to help them by giving them extra session.

I grew up and remain surrounded by the type of people who aren't as understanding and accepting, but respect me enough to keep their mouths shut (for the most part). I'm a private person and I keep my circle very small so not many people even know I'm dating this guy, let alone that he's transgender. I recently told my college roommate, who I have been friends with for a couple of years now, and she has been making comments ever since. These comments aren't particularly directed at him, but more at me. She makes ""jokes"" about my sexuality (ex. asking me what it's like to be pansexual and just bringing it up in a condescending manner). Now might be a good time to mention that I'm straight, and I have told her that. The other day a male friend from high school texted me saying something like ""why didn't you tell me you have a girlfriend"". I had never even told him I was dating someone, and I don't have any pictures on social media with this guy because I never post anything. I don't know if he said that on purpose or really thought I was dating a girl, but he wouldn't tell me who told him that. Needless to say, not my friend anymore.

I'm with my boyfriend because he's a man, through and through. I don't expect everyone to agree, but I definitely expect my friends and family to respect it enough to not be transphobic?

705,"For a bit of context my(20f) boyfriend(18m) and I have been dating long distance for about 11 months now, his parents know of me and I've met his mom.

Since about two years ago I have been wanting to move out of my house because a big secret of my dad came out and through that my father became more aggressive with me because I would constantly refuse to be alone with him since I was not comfortable being around him anymore. It got to the point that a year ago he almost beat the hell out of me because I told him to leave my dog alone, my dog was being a dog and my dad was throwing his sandle in the direction of the dog (not to hit him but to scare him to go to his bed). Even after that, my mother didn't ever try to get him out of the house permanently. Regarding my dog, my father hasn't been aggressive towards my dog for about a year now since my mom protects him with every fiber in her body (my mom is the only person my dad will listen to out of our direct family). My dad is one of the reasons I want to leave.

The second is my mother, though she isn't trying to beat me or physically abuse me I still think that she's toxic to/for me. I've never done amazing at school and this is something she constantly reminds me about. Every time I get anything below a B in a class she asks if I even want to go to school that if I want to drop out then I should do it now and get a job. Before Corona, my mother would be annoyed and sometimes mad that I would hang out with my friends after my classes, constantly saying that I don't belong to the community of students who dorm and that I shouldn't be trying to have friends because ""true friends will follow you without you trying"". Back to the grades, whenever I ended up with lower than a B at the end of the semester she would take my laptop and threaten to take away my phone and computer from me completely if I didn't do better. Now more recent things, I've recently bought and built a computer with my own money so that I can play games without my laptop overheating and slowly dying and because my laptop doesn't work that well anymore. And so every time my mom sees me doing anything but homework she threatens to sell it or threatens that she'll force me to send it all back. When I brought up the fact that I want to find a therapist because I think I may have ADD/ADHD and because I have pretty bad anxiety to the point I cannot do anything sometimes, she tells me that there's nothing wrong with me that I only have a lot of energy because I never do anything all day, that me zoning out and not being able to properly concentrate is because I don't exercise, even though that when I exercised every day I still had these same problems. She used to always say that she doesn't believe in anxiety or depression or attention disorders, that they don't exist because she just doesn't believe in them. Which has been a problem since both me and my brother have/had problems with handling our depression.

So those are the two main reasons I want to leave my home, the problem is that since COVID I've been unable to have friends or maintain friendships with people I know from my city so I don't really have the option of moving out with friends. I also don't really have the option to move out on my own since living in a big city is expensive and requires you to work full-time if you're to live on your own. Which I can't do since I am a full-time student. And after seeing how poorly I'm doing in school this semester since I've been unmotivated to work since I just cannot learn properly online, I already know my mom is going to freak out and try her damn hardest to get rid of my computer once she sees my poor grades. Since school is online this semester and will very likely be online next semester I asked my boyfriend about the possibility of me staying with his family until spring semester is over, at the latest. Just so that I can get on my feet. He lives in Canada and I'm from the US, I am willing to leave everything behind if it means that I will be away from my parents and will not feel like my parents don't care about my mental or physical health at all. When I spoke to my boyfriend he said that he would love to have me there and that he's pretty sure his parents will agree to me staying as long as I pay for my food and/or possibly rent for as long as I stay there. Whether they are to say yes or no I will still be trying to transfer to a school in Canada or just trying to get a job and a place to live. If they were to say yes then I would try to transfer/find a job while I'm staying there.

 What I need advice on is, I guess, what should I do? Should I go through with asking his parents about it? Should I even be leaving my home? Are my parents actually toxic or am I just making a huge deal out of nothing? I'm just really confused as to what I should do since I know my boyfriend will always support me.",23Oct2020,1

Two weeks in Texas, my girlfriend and I was kicked out of the house after finding out my father had a bad drug habit, (cocaine, meth, weed and drinking all day every day).

I packed up what I could, I took the cars, the dogs and my girlfriend to the nearest city Austin. I took a big financial risk moving to Texas and it didn't pan out. My father left me with the bill for numerous things despite agreeing to pay them, which is one of the only conditions as to why I moved in the first place. It amounted to 10's of thousands of dollars.

I was still in school online finishing my masters in business analytics and continued to fight through to finish the degree as I was in my last semester in spring 2020. While we where in the motel 6 studio hotel room, I started applying to anything I could. Eventually I scraped the last bit of money I had left and was able to secure an apartment in Austin. The money was running out and companies where pausing hiring. I worked nights at HEB stocking groceries to get through and to get some money coming in, but it wasn't enough. They where one of the few places open and hiring still. Months have past and I finally started a great corporate job in May. I went 7 months, 7 fucking months, without a good job. I lost mostly everything I had worked for.  I moved to Tampa in order to work at that location, Tampa was expensive and wasn't the best place to live, I didn't know anyone there. After 4-5 months I moved from Tampa to San Antonio. My girlfriend stayed in Austin, Texas while I was in Tampa, she was lucky to get a job at a food establishment and worked to work as there where not a lot of opportunities. Now that I am back in Texas, all I can think about is moving back to Columbus, OH where I have lived for almost the last decade. I went to school there twice and started my career there, it feels like home.  My father still has an addiction problem, my mother and I are going to try and get him some help, but he doesn't think he has a problem. The only benefit of being in San Antonio is my parents live close in Austin and my cousin lives in Houston, with another in San Antonio along with my aunt. My brother is back in Columbus, OH.

I honestly don't know what to do, this job pays more than I was making before and I am still recovering financially, but these next two months I should be good again, but Im coming to the realization that money cant buy you happiness. I signed a 3 month lease here in San Antonio, hopefully by then I will able to decide. I have already applied back at the old company I worked for in Ohio and have already received some responses.

Working from home is lonely, I've moved 4 times so far just this year, 3 of those cross country. I miss my friends in Ohio, I miss going into the office. It is a miracle that I still wake up every morning. I am grateful to have a job, and to be able to recover, to finish my degree all in the wake of a global pandemic we haven't seen since 100 years ago. I'm just trying to find home.",23Oct2020,1

708,"My co-worker, we both are managers but he has me on seniority, has an underlying condition and has had strep throat. He gave me a call saying he was mad at me, and of course I ask why.

He ended the phone call by saying “... we have a hug problem, when I get back there is going to be trouble”
I don’t have any idea what he means by “going to be trouble”, I told him that I have no idea what he was talking about and that I’ve never stalked or tracked anything about his or his job other then the sales he made so I can follow up with service calls. 

At this point, I’m just sitting around not knowing what to do in this situation. We working in a privately owned company and he had worked with the owner a lot longer then I have and I’m scared that there is going to be retaliation if I talk to the owner but even still I’m not the type of person that takes insults and accusations sitting down.

709,"just in these past few hours, i heard from my mum that our neighbour told her something important. my neighbour attended a school that this teacher previously taught at, and says that he was actually fired from there - for HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH A STUDENT!!! (42 y/o man - probably ~15-16 y/o girl at the time)

i trust my neighbour, i’m sure she has no reason to lie about this. i am DISGUSTED. it’s been 15 years since he was fired, and he’s been at my old school (another girls’ school, no less) in a senior management position, for all this time.

it actually make sense as well: one time, he tried to warn us about dressing appropriately on school trips which turned into him telling a story about some girl who got sexually harassed and implied it was her fault for dressing inappropriately (this caused MAJOR outrage and  we all forced him to apologise). he also may work as a higher-up in some company, meaning he doesn’t need to be a teacher. he also worked at girls’ schools twice in a row which is... a weird coincidence, considering they’re not at all common. and, he’s just overall a major weirdo, has bad vibes.

i can’t find anything about this scandal online. i’ve only got my neighbour’s word to go on. as the school where the alleged offence occurred is a private school, they would’ve likely covered it up because kids would stop enrolling there and they have to worry about funds.

so i’m in a weird position where i’m almost SURE this shit went down, but i have ZERO evidence.

this is really weighing on me. i feel so fucking mad that this guy got away with it. it may be a _very_ long time coming, but he needs to get fired now. i don’t know what to do.",23Oct2020,1

721,"So me and my fiance got engaged a year ago, and we very quickly decided that we wanted to get married in August 2022. We have not set the date, but we let the close family know that was what we were thinking.
My brother got engaged to his (now)fiance earlier this month, I knew this was coming and whenever we had talked they were thinking of a 2021 wedding. They are WAY ahead of us in planning already, and due to covid have decided to push their date back to 2022... August 4th to be exact.... Now my brother simply forgot that we had been after Aug, and I am honestly not fussed about them getting married then.
It has however complicated what we can do, I am now struggling to think of a way we can fit our wedding in when there will be guests invited to both sets of weddings who will have to travel etc. Plus any honeymoon plans will need organising together so we can both be present at each others dates...
They have already booked a few things including the reception venue, so they can't really adjust their date and I don't want to ask them to.

He calls me back very quickly and in a stern voice asks me why I hung up and I proceed to tell him I was messing with him because I was bored and I know he's a scammer. He then tells me if I would marry him because my voice sounds good and fishes for my age and name and again I give him fake info and he just keeps saying things as if trying to kill time and keep me on the line so I hung up.

724,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible, this is my first post in this subreddit so please bear with me. I (26 F) live at home with my mom, grandma, and brother (32 M). My brother manipulates both my mom and grandma and uses their guilt over multiple things against them to get his way. My mom and grandma pay all the household bills, I helped with what I could when I was working and trying to get a job so I can take some of the stress off them. My brother has 3 jobs and just bought a brand new Lincoln, but refuses to help with any household bills.

Because they did not write out an agreement, she can't make him pay anything on it. I have tried to have a conversation with her and tell her she needs to put real thought into writing out an agreement and give him the ultimatum of signing and keeping his end of the deal or take his line off the bill. It is like this with every bill and when I talk to her about it she agrees with me but doesn't do anything. I feel like her and my grandma tell me what they think I want to hear but never follow through on any of it.

More info, we all have been home educated since kindergarten through an on and off curriculum of various workbooks - earlier years of homeschooling - and moved on in our older years doing lessons on the IXL website. Oh, and by *""on and off""* I mean that sometimes we would slack off for weeks or even several months.

While I have managed to self educate myself, I'm honestly more worried about my siblings. She's been barely working with them by doing 15 minute lessons every few weeks or so. Unlike me, they are very independent of her and without her company they practically do nothing. From what I've checked on my sibling's IXL accounts, they are all at least 3 grades behind on two or more subjects - especially my younger siblings. I don't have a problem that they're behind, it's just that I don't feel like they'll ever catch up and if my mom even cares.

I've also attempted doing school with them in the past, but they have trouble comprehending anything I say, even if I'm explaining a below grade level concept. Because of this I don't bother anymore ..they are both 10 and 12 years old.

1. Is it possible to learn/ be both? Or would that be a waste of time?

2. To my understanding, pipe fitting is heavily based on new construction, so if the economy is good work is going good, and if the economy is bad then you’ll get laid off for a while. Is this true/ accurate?

740,"TLDR: Got accused of something I didn't do, suffering from anxiety because of it. Need advice on how to solve this.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to a kinda long explanation but I'd appreciate if you could offer me some advice.

Earlier on in the year, a friend and ex-coworker of mine of mine (she had left the company by a year at this point) put out a post on social media saying her Dad had been let go as manager from the company we all worked for. It was at the beginning of the pandemic when nobody was sure what was happening, but she went on a big of a tangent on social media, including shaming the company for all sorts of things from promoting sexual harassers to ignoring bullies etc.

Her dad was above and beyond the best manager I had worked with, so I responded saying how mad this made me and I was so sorry to hear and echoed what I said above about him being the best of the best. She responded saying thanks, some love heart emojis and then told me she actually got it wrong. He was only being furloughed like the rest of us. Relieved to hear this, I said thank goodness and all ways fine.

Two days later - she unfriends me on everything except my Instagram. I ask her sister what that was about as she was ignoring my messages and her sister (who is one of my best friends) responded that they accused me of sending screenshots to our head office. This resulted in her dad getting into trouble due to her posts. I do not know how in any scenario someone would come to this conclusion about me, but it has really affected my mental wellbeing the past 7 months. Not only have I lost friends over this it has made me physically sick with anxiety.

I have managed to cope with these feelings for the past few months okay, but now after I liked a Facebook photo of my friend and her Dad today, the daughter who sent out the posts passive aggressively blocked me on Instagram... in response.  I had a feeling that would happen if I liked the post, but I like her Dad and I was glad to see my friend and him out enjoying the day after a long quarantine.

Unfortunately the daughter who made the social media posts does have a history of causing drama and blowing things out of proportion, but I cannot shake the anxiety this has caused me. A family I really liked now hate me because they think I did this horrible thing. I think really it's quite obvious this was a result of her own actions that she will not face. Our company was the number one trending topic on some social media the day she made these posts and they were all public. I wasn't surprised they found out and after she blocked me I even deleted my own account to be safe.

I'm so racked with anxiety over this whole thing I'm scared to talk to my best friend. She told me not to worry about it and she's always like that just ignore her but it's still eating me up and we haven't spoken much since. I grew up with narcissist parents who among a lot of things, would constantly blame me for things I didn't do and punish me for it which has caused me some trauma. I have been in therapy for this all my adult life. So to be blamed for something like this is really affecting me and no amounts of messaging to resolve helped, I just got ignored.

I have considered contacting my own manager at work and discussing this, as if I have been accused of being a ""mole"" essentially I'd like to know where that came from (if it ever actually did). I moved sites 3 years ago and have had no contact with my old one so obviously I'm taken aback.

Should I speak with my manager about this and let her know to have the manager of the other site explain it wasn't my fault and I was nothing to do with this? I know this seems like an overreaction to most but again, I've struggled with this my whole life and still don't know how to handle being accused of things, especially as serious as nearly costing a man his job. I may need to move back to that site at some point but am now afraid.",23Oct2020,1

I posted here a couple of days ago. I am a female in my midthirties who is severely chronically ill, physically disabled, and unable to drive or work. My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. Despite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him. Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. Please help. Someone please fucking help.

744,"So in the past my father has had very bad anger issues, we talked about it a few times and he’s worked on it a lot and has gotten a lot better. But he still does have flare ups or says stuff. 

Bc of that I have a lot of trouble talking to him bc talking to him gives me anxiety. I never know when anything I say might make him go off bc he can go from calm and chill to yelling in one sentence. When I was younger I just never talked to him unless needed and it was mainly “uh huh, okay” but now I’m at a point in my life (in college) where there are things I need to talk to my dad about things for advice and to let him know but I struggle very hard to do so.

Again it’s just the anxiety like idk how to tell him something even if I doubt it’ll make him upset there’s still always that small chance and he even when does controlling it will let out a comment or something with anger behind it which hurts to hear most of the time. I want to talk to him about it but I’m sure he’ll say he didn’t even realize he was doing anything wrong and I’ll end up getting real emotional bc when it comes to me and my dad I do get upset easily bc he’s the only one I’ve had growing up bc mom divorced and left when young and sister left as soon as she could so it was just always me and him. 

So yeah is there any advice how to deal with the anxiety of talking to my dad, especially about touchy subjects or things that may upset him?",23Oct2020,1

I recently started teaching online and because my apartment is small, I had to set up my office at the kitchen table. Every time the dog barks my mic picks it up and it becomes disruptive for my class. I've talked to my neighbors before, asking them if they can keep their dog quiet between 10am-2:30pm Monday-Friday because I'm teaching. They're home all day. They agreed and their dog was quiet for about a week. It started barking again. Should I talk to them again?",23Oct2020,1

I'm having a difficult time deciding what I should say. I know what I want, I think? But I think she wants a more specific answer. In short, i'd love an opportunity to network and to learn how to network effectively (although covid makes this 100% more difficult). And I told her i'd like her to elaborate on her experiences in the field so I can hopefully learn something from her experiences and potentially any mishaps she's had. Aside from these two things I can't really think of anything else...but I think she wants me to find more goals and what not.

I love my job, my coworkers are amazing and I get along well with my boss, but ever since I was promoted, I’ve felt this HUGE weight of stress on my shoulders. I feel like I’m in way over my head and not qualified to be in the position I’m in. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve started seeing a therapist. I’ve got a history of depression and anxiety, so undertaking such a position was probably a mistake, but I can afford my bills and rent now without having to ask for help from my parents. I always felt awful asking for help, like I’m a failure but that feeling is now amplified through my job. I love everyone here but feel like I’m terrible at my job, causing even more stress.

I want to quit and write a book. I’ve always loved creative writing and I have an amazing idea for a kids series (hopefully graphic novel series if I can find an illustrator). Everyone I’ve pitched the idea to loved it and asks about it all the time. I feel like I’ve come up with something really special and I want to bring it to life, but I’m so bogged down by work all I want to do when I get home is sleep or play video games (Persona 5 right now, it’s SO GOOD!)

She went to university for many years and does have some computer skills, but not \*that\* many. If she were to struggle with something in Microsoft Office, she tends to call me to ask for help rather than Googling it. \*\*IF she knows what question to ask\*\*, and if it is something she can Google, she would get overwhelmed with the amount of information and become stressed and upset. Though, sometimes she has NO IDEA what has gone wrong. The other day, I explained to her how the location of her files affects how she searches her computer for it, and why the document she was working on was in Downloads rather than Docs - she sent it to herself when switching devices. In all fairness, if you don't download things much and you're not used to computers, I can see how older people would not know this.

She's getting older and gets overwhelmed more easily these days, and has gone through a lot of hardships and life changes recently. I feel her frustration and want to help her, but she does not seem to realize that just because her work is hands-on having a business or simple communication FOR the business side of it involves using the computer a lot more than she knows.

754,"(People on other forums keep on saying it was rape, but it doesn't feel like rape. I don't want to report it because they're probably just going to tell me I'm overreacting and being stupid but everything really hurts and I think something's wrong down there and my arm really hurts and I want to go to urgent care, but they'll probably just say I'm being stupid.)

My boyfriend (22M) and I (21F) were having sex yesterday night and something really odd happened and I don’t know how to feel about it.

So due to some issues I have in my down there area sometimes sex can get painful after a while. Most times I just tell my boyfriend to stop and he does and he finishes another way. Yesterday night he came over kinda stressed out from work and he wanted sex so we did. He was a lot rougher than he usually is and it definitely felt differently than it usually does like it felt like he didn’t really care about me. It started to kinda hurt but he really seemed upset so I didn’t say anything at first. He was on top of me and had his hands kinda by my elbows and was kind of pinning me down. Then it started to really hurt just like the way he was holding onto my arms and how hard he was going and I really didn’t like it and so I said “I’m sorry, can we stop?”

Usually he stops and pulls out immediately but he didn’t even stop. I thought that he didn’t hear me so I asked again and the second time he just kinda pushed down on my arms harder and kept going and it really hurt. I told him to just stop again but again he didn’t so I kind of took my foot and was going to push against his stomach to push him away, but he put his knee on the top of my leg. I kept telling him he was hurting me and he wouldn’t stop. It really hurt down there like way worse than it has in the past. The only reason he stopped was because he came and he came inside me which he wasn’t supposed to because he wasn’t wearing a condom. I know pull-out isn’t an effective form of birth control but he was so upset last night and I just finished my period that I didn’t even think to ask him to put one on.

Then he just took a shower and apologized and left. His apology didn’t seem genuine though. Everything hurts today so much. My left thigh, elbows, and the top of my left arm are bruised really badly and I can’t move my left much without a lot of pain. It really hurts to pee and walk and breathing hurts my lower stomach a lot too. I think my period started again too because I’m bleeding again and I have these really bad cramps that are a lot different than the ones I usually get. So everything really hurts a lot.

My boyfriend came over after I got back from class this morning and he apologized for being too rough last night and got me Plan B. Then he got annoyed because I didn’t want to take the Plan B right then because I already wasn’t feeling well and I really didn’t want to go out for lunch. It just feels a lot worse than him being too rough because he’s usually a lot nicer afterwards and doesn’t just leave and if he hurts me he’s always super apologetic.

My roommate (22M) keeps asking what happened last night after my boyfriend left all angry last night and I just want him to leave me alone about it because he’s a nurse which means he’s a mandated reporter and I’m afraid if I tell him he’s going to take it wrong and report it.

I just wish people would leave me alone about it but I want to talk to someone about it so badly at the same time. I have no idea what I should do or if I should talk to my boyfriend about it or just give it time. I know I should just handle it like a mature adult and talk it out but it just seems so hard to talk to him after last night. It sound so childish and stupid but I just really want my mom right now but I can't tell her about it because she's just going to get upset.

I guess I just want advice on how I should handle this with my boyfriend. I feel like I'm just being so stupid and overreacting about this whole thing.",23Oct2020,1
755,"I have been out on my own before, but my most recent mess up landed me back at my parents house. Now after 4 years of living at home, I am proud to say I am leaving for good this time.  I was making conversation with my mom &amp; told her I wanted a wonder woman comforter set for my bed.

Why?( I didn't bother explaining because I feel like my parents don't truly understand the adult me.) I like wonder woman honestly cause she's an inspiration, motivation to me. She gave me a scenerio, saying that if I met a nice professional man, then he would get turned off after seeing my bed set &amp; I would not get a second date. She told me that I should put the set in the guest bedroom. But then I was like, it's for me tho?

I live alone &amp; don't see the big deal in this. It's not like my entire apartment is covered in Wonder woman gear.  I do consider myself to be very mature, but idk. I like small things that make me happy. If I were married &amp; living w/ a man that would be different.

756,"Let me start off by saying I love my boyfriend, we have been together for four years. He is very sweet and patient. I also have clinical depression if that helps.

&amp;#x200B;

When we first started dating I was so excited over this sex thing. We were each other's first and I wanted to do it everywhere/all the time. As time went on I found myself crying in the middle of sex, and not really wanting to do it but forcing myself because I didn't want to disappoint him (he never made me feel pressured). Today we were doing it, we haven't done it in awhile. I have been really depressed and stressed this year, unexpected deaths and all that. I started sobbing quietly in the middle of it, but he couldn't tell because I was still breathing heavy. I felt so disgusting and wanted it to be over.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is starting to make me believe I was potentially molested as a child? I no longer have contact with my parents, but here are some red flags that I remember from my childhood ((((tw warning)))

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mom did not respect my boundaries and would suck on my arms, kiss my neck, walk in on me naked in the bathroom. Often times this resulted in a meltdown, especially if she kissed me. I remember screaming and crying and scratching my skin while I sat in the corner. I really, really hated it when she touched me. Sometimes I find myself feeling that same anger when my boyfriend kisses me, like I don't want to be touched by anyone? 
2. Father did not respect my boundaries or me as a daughter. He often pinched my butt and made disgusting remarks about my body, comparing it to my mom's. He never respected women in general. I saw him lift up my sleeping mother's night gown to take pictures of her. He flashed me a few times. He only turned his attention on me when I turned 14 (that I noticed) and it never went further than that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now when I try to get intimate with my boyfriend I find myself crying or feeling disgusted because someone is touching me. I hate the sound and feel of kissing sometimes, but I don't want it to stop because this is probably more than he can handle. I just want to know how I can get rid of these feelings on my own?",23Oct2020,1

Communication does not work. I can not rely on anyone--my father is useless and does not know what to do either.  


She'll pretend everything's fine then stay awake all night terrified and paranoid, barely listening to us. We think she's fine for awhile but then something ticks her off and she does the same thing.

It never changes this happens so often but in different circumstances. I also don't like social media so it makes it easier for guys to cheat on me. I'm ashamed to say it out loud but I dated ugly guys to see if maybe they would be different.

I have minimal experience buying gifts for anyone due to a very small family, only 3 other family members, and due to being socially awkward I have no in real life friends, so I've never had to buy gifts for anyone outside my family.

A little about her, I guess you could say she's a tomboy. She doesn't wear makeup, doesn't wear dresses, not really into fashion at all to be honest. A pair of jeans and a top will suit her. She loves animals, her favourite is a leopard. She's also into cars, but I bought her a driving experience last year, so I don't want to do the same this year. She likes reading and she likes gaming. She's not really someone who will wear jewellery. I've seen her with a necklace on only a handful of times, and the only jewellery she'll wear on her wrist is her smart watch. Her favourite colour is matt black.

Her bf of almost 4 years dumped her the other week, and their 4th anniversary would have been the day after her birthday which is in 2 weeks, and as it will be her 18th, I really want to get her something special to make her feel better. I've had a few ideas, but the more I think about it, the worse they sound. I'm honestly really stuck and would just love any suggestions anyone has.

765,"Due to wishing to remain annoynmous, I will be using fake names here. I'll speak from my perspective and talk about the person in question as 'Sarah'.

I will start from where we became friends to provide some back story. We met in college 3 years ago and became good friends fairly quickly. I have always been a considerably shy and introverted person and Sarah was someone who really brought me out of my shell and made me a more confident individual. Our humor was mostly based off taking the piss out of each other, which may seem odd but there we always saw the comical side of it and no offence was ever taken. 

We both graduated college last year, and in that time have only seen each other once, reasons for this include different job schedules and living over an hour away from each other, not driving etc. 

However over the last few months we have really not been getting along and as much as I hate to say it i have grown to really dislike her and she has 'shown her true colours'. We argue a lot and its usually over such ridiculous petty things, i will provide some examples of the petty arguments we have had- which are a result of my actions however, in my opinion she over reacts.  Few months back as a laugh, I added Johnny depp to our Instagram group chat. This pissed her off, she told me to grow the fuck up and have fun somewhere else and proceded to remove me from the chat and never add me back.

Most recently, on a Snapchat group chat she was asking people could they please comment on her Instagram photo so it looked like she had friends. As a joke, I commented on her Instagram heres your ""please can you comment on my recent"" comment. I thought she would take it as a joke. She didn't. She called me to stop being a bitch and that for once could I stop joking and take something seriously. I was taken aback, as I'm not constantly joking, I am serious when its needed and have been there to support her several times throughout our friendship. 

She then brought up old arguments about how I never make any effort to meet up with her and our other friends. I explained to her as I have done many times before that it is due to my depression which I have suffered from for 4 years. I lack motivation, making plans can be difficult, its hard to be interested etc. She just said stop making everything about yourself. 

Heres the tag line. I love my other friends to pieces, we get along and they don't get so wound up by such small things like she does. However i share these friends with her and I know if I cut her out of my life I would lose those friends too most likely. 

I'm just so sick and tired of this girl getting offended so easily and by everything. I feel like I cant even joke because every time I do, she bites my head off, calls me a bitch and tells me to grow up. I understand people not being serious can be frustrating and maybe I am a little immature, but like I said I am mature and serious in situations where its needed. I was just trying to have fun.

767,"A little bit of background is necessary: we met in middle school, where he started off as very sweet and understanding and very quickly turned nasty. He was emotionally abusive and, when myself or any of our friend group stepped out of line, he became rather violent. He punched me in the head, stole my wheelchair from me to strand me alone, and tried to push me into traffic to name a few. He's also incredibly manipulative, even going so far as to stage a suicide attempt and blaming me as a means of trying to get me back in his life. He was emotionally cruel and vindictive, and uses my medical condition as a weapon against me.

He spent several years, all through high school, tracking me down on backup account after backup account. Every time I blocked him, he would reappear and shoot me new messages. He'd found me on Facebook countless times, found me on twitter, deviantart, and now he's tracked me down through instagram. He'd even tracked me down in person a couple of times, staging run-ins in public places where I couldn't call him on stalking me because... well it's a public place, right? It was really intense throughout high school, with him making himself a constant presence in my life. He'd always start his messages off really sweetly, and tenderly, and make all these big apologies. Then, when I wouldn't respond, he'd launch into vitriol unlike anything I've dealt with otherwise, saying he hopes I never wak again and other such things. He's threatened me on a number of occasions, and even tried to hurt my brother for coming between us at one point.

I hadn't heard from him in almost three years, and now he's back.

He has been incredibly cordial this time, but I don't trust that even a little because... well as I mentioned, that's sort of his MO. I didn't realize who he was at first, and as soon as he identified himself, I blocked him and haven't gone back. I don't think I have any of my old evidence saved anywhere anymore because... well after two years of no contact, I really figured he was finally gone. At this point, we're both in our early twenties. Maybe he's changed, and seen the error of his ways, or maybe he's playing nice to get me to let my guard down again. I don't want to talk to him and test the theory, but I'd also like to know what my options are if he reverts back to his usual form. I'm scared.

That's why it's been hard for me to have female friends -I haven't been interested in girly topics. And it's hard for me to have male friends because of my father. So I'm asking for advice. What should I do? 

--- unnecessary information about my family ---
I have an overly controlling and kinda-toxic father and we can't get along with each other lately. My passive apathetic mother is not someone I want to be like and she doesn't care about me. So I've got nobody to trust and speak up. I haven't had many friends because of my father since I was just a kid. I remember the times I cried because I didn't have any friends when I was 10. 


---unnecessary information about my situation in highschool---
Now, I've been going to a prestigious highschool  in my country in another city for two years (this is my 3th year and I'll have 2 more years before I graduate because I studied a preparation class for German -it's complicated to tell you about) and stay with my aunt when the schools are open. I had two classmates (a male and a female) who I spend time at school but couldn't speak so openly. They've been dating each other for one year and have forgotten about me. I'm alone. Since the schools are closed due to corona I've been home with a toxic environment. 

---unnecessary gripe part---
So, I'm tired and have nobody to talk or ask for help. I'm tired of the problems mostly about making some decisions for my future and some mistakes I've done. I'm confused what kind of person should I be and how should I feel about some topics. I don't have anybody to trust. I'm sick of behaving like nothing bothering me but crying in my bed before I sleep -trying to be sure nobody can hear me.

•Thank you for reading all these 


So I'm repeating my questions again: What should I do? What should I feel about that situation? Could you pls give me some advice and say me what to do? I'm searching for an advice.",23Oct2020,1
771,My primary doctor referred me to a specialist who can’t see me for another 3 MONTHS. Is there any way I could call my doctor back and give them the name of another specialist to refer me to that has sooner appointments? Or will I just have to wait it out?,23Oct2020,1
772,"Basically the husband who works hard and has enough money to survive - is dumping his wife, who is lazy and has been ""disabled"" for over a decade, just collecting SSDI and not helping with rent and utilities, etc.

I moved in a year ago and never signed a lease, I've been month to month, but a new lease has been drafted with my name, the ""disabled"" person's name, but NOT the employed husband who just moved out with zero notice, he called the landlord behind my back and took himself off the new lease, then suddenly moved out and told the landlord to draft a new lease with my name on it.

The ""disabled"" wife does not seem disabled, just watches TV all day, does not contribute in any way, not even easy stuff like cleaning up and taking out recycling. Several months ago she used one of my items, broke it, admitted it - and said she'd replace it. She never did, and 2 months later the husband stepped up and replaced it himself. She recently opened some of my mail. She is not only lazy, but mentally ill, and untrustworthy. 

I had always found the husband trustworthy, but upon his moving out, and the way he did it, it seems like he was lying and misrepresenting a lot of things that I won't get into here, and I now suspect the worst of him with this latest development. 

The bottom line seems to be that he's trying to get me to sign a contract with the ""disabled"" wife in order to absolve himself of the many responsibilities he'll encounter in a forthcoming divorce. She almost certainly is not going to help with the rent and utilities - so even if I pay my portion of the rent - I'd still be screwed because her name is also on the lease and she almost certainly won't pay rent either. I haven't signed anything yet. Please advise, thanks.",23Oct2020,1
773,"I’m currently doing a diploma in software engineering technology and AI in Toronto. My program is in-person, but I’ve been doing this term fully online because of COVID-19.

My college is reopening in the winter term, but I want to switch to the fully online version of my program.

I like how the online program gives me a window to write tests and provides recordings of all lectures. I’m really bad at waking up and getting to class on time. Plus, I’m saving money on restaurant dining and commuting.

Would you advise against switching to the online program? Are online degrees still stigmatized?

I’ve been there for around two weeks and I fucking hate it because no one is training me, I get left alone to figure everything out myself  and the crew members have pretty much been the only people helping me. However none of the crew members are friendly! There are all extremely rude and when I ask one of them for help they act all snarky. The managers are not helpful and don’t even talk to me. I’m on the verge of tears every shift and have just looked at my roster and I’m on for sooo many hours during busy times!! I want to quit so bad but 1. I don’t know how and 2.

779,"I am currently a sophomore studying pre-med as it has been my lifelong dream to become a surgeon. I have always wanted to be a medical professional for as long as I can remember and has always been my plan. During high school, I was what people call a procrastinator. I would rarely do home-works, study for exams, attend class, etc. I would always just say to myself it didn't matter until college. I graduated with decent grades and was able to enroll in a pretty good university in Texas so I packed my bags and left the little town I was raised in. 

Freshman year of college was a huge reality check for me and made me realize I had to change my ways to attend medical school and make my dream come true. I started studying for hours a day and would even attend tutoring and asked people for help when I needed it. The first semester was challenging but I ended with a 3.6 GPA. The second semester was way easier since I had taken Biology 1 first semester and Biology 2 was not that difficult for me. I had an A in all my classes until COVID-19 started. We were sent home and had no classes for two weeks. Those two weeks caused me to return to my ways back in high school and started doing badly in a class. I would focus all my time and energy on more important classes like Biology and Math and eventually got a bad grade for psychology. However, despite all this, I ended the semester with a 3.7 GPA getting A in all my classes except psych.

I was able to transfer to one of the best universities and Texas for my third semester and is where I am right now. I am taking 4 classes being Medical-Terminology, Kinesiology, POLLS, and Chem 1. At first, all my classes were really easy and not difficult but that quickly changed. Chemistry started making me suffer and studying hours a day was not helping. We have had 2 Tests and I have failed both, the first with a 33 and the second with a 63. We are currently going over a hard topic which is the heart of this class and I just feel lost. I have attended tutoring multiple times but I just don't get the material. There are some days I understand and can do the work he gives us but the last two weeks I have turned in 5 home-works and gotten 0 on all of them. I currently have a D in the class and at this point, I only care about passing it. All my other classes are going well but this one is a pain in the butt. Today after trying to complete my homework for 8+ hours I decided to throw the white flag and give up. I have made the decision that depending on how I score on this test I will drop the class and try again another semester. The thing is if I am struggling every day and waking up unhappy just because of this one class then why should I try to continue pursuing my dream of being a surgeon. 

I have always been told that I was choosing a very long and hard career and I knew. I accepted what my days were going to be like and decided to pursue my dreams anyway. Was it a mistake? Is chasing my dream, my only goal in life worth waking up every single day unhappy? Is it worth it considering that I live stressed out and barely have time to do anything else? I feel as if it would be easier or at least more plausible if classes were in person and not online, but there are no what-ifs. I know that if I decide not to pursue my dream I will regret it every single day of my life. I just don't know what to do and can't think straight. Even if I was to change my career what would I even study? The only things I like are medicine and science but don't want to end up being a teacher (There is nothing wrong with being a teacher it is just not for me). The other thing that gets me is that this is barely Chem 1, there are still 3 other chemistry after this, and I don't know if I'll survive.

So, should I give up the beauty that is medicine because of one class or should I keep trying even though I live in constant suffering? My parents would support me either way if that helps, but I don't know if I would be able to ever forgive myself if I choose to give up.",23Oct2020,1
780,"I have the worst crush I’ve ever had on someone on J. What’s funny is that i didn’t even like him as a person for the first year that i knew him. I thought he was a pretentious dick. Then we have cooking together this year. We start to talk a little and i realize that he’s not like that. So then last weekend comes around and It’s my close friends birthday and i’m going to spend the night at his house. My friends older sister is really good friends with J so he was there. We don’t interact a bunch, just a little and some group conversations. There were a couple other people there. So then night comes around, and my friend is sleeping in his room and the other people are on an air mattress. That leaves J and I on the couch. This couch is one that is like a corner, so there was plenty of space on the couch. Eventually everyone but him, i and two other people are still awake. I don’t exactly remember why, but he moves over to my side of the couch and we’re cuddling. That night we stayed up all night talking. Early in the morning we got up and drank coffee outside. The thing is, throughout this, he was touching my inner thigh and stuff, and he was not being shy about it. Then when he left realized that maybe, just a little bit, I could have a crush on him. Then come monday we now sit my each other in cooking. Over this week i realized that i have a full on crush on this guy. But i’m awfully confused by his actions.

782,"So if you don't know who Wonder Bread guy is, he is this super weird, super creepy guy who developed an obsessive kink for white and blonde women buying shopping carts full of Wonder Bread, and cutting down rainforests. He keeps commissioning artists to draw blonde girls buying Wonder Bread or mayonnaise, or harming the nature by making factories or something. He's so creepy that even Shadman said no to his requests. All the guy EVER talks about is things that revolve around this fetish appearantly. Oh he's also unbelieveably racist.

So I started making art commissions a few months ago and I've received 0 customers :(. Not to sound pretentious but my art isn't even bad, I guess they are even good. I won't share my drawings though because that might reveal who I am, thus defeating the purpose of posting this from my alt account. Anyway, so I figured, what if I reach him out and draw a painting of some girl eating bread or something? He pays HUNDREDS of dollars for just one commission and I really really want to buy a record player to listen to vinyl records. If I draw something for him it'll be like drawing 5 to 10 commissions at once. Besides, the drawing subject is nothing bad. I'll also be able to buy a good enough record player instantly after he does the money transaction. But I'm worried I am gonna lose some of my pride in the process.

I just think about him crying and not knowing why I’ve left him and why I’m not coming back to get him and I want to throw up. I am so guilty and ashamed and nauseated and I will never own another pet again, I don’t feel like I deserve to be a pet owner after having to surrender him. I am dependent upon my parents because of chronic illness and my dog has become aggressive and because there are young children in the home the vet said he needs to find a home with no pets or children so that his needs are better met and my parents of course agree because it is their responsibility to keep the kids safe. If I could move out with him to focus on him I would but I could not support us. I understand why he has to go but I feel like it’s all my fault and if maybe I did something different he wouldn’t have to leave. 

I just really hope he has a great life and his new owners can give him everything he deserves. I was in a dark place when I adopted him and he truly saved me. This year was hard I also had three guinea pigs, one had to be put to sleep because her body didn’t work correctly and she was suffering, the second one passed away in her cage when I was gone so she died all alone and the third one passed this summer. I’ll have lost all four of my pets in less than a year I don’t think I’ll ever adopt pets again. I do have a cat but he is more of a family pet and is very independent, he loves my sister and sleeps with her and spends his days outside so I don’t have that connection with him like I did my best friend.

784,"Looking for advice on what I can do to make sure he can't hurt someone else. 

He works as an engineer. They met on hinge. They facetimed multiple times before meeting up in person; she got no creepy vibes from him through a week of texting and talking. They went somewhere public, but he still tried to drag her off after the date when she refused to go home with him. He held her by the hand and tried to literally pull her along with him. He forced his tongue in her mouth, and she told him, ""No means no. You are not listening. You are not respecting me. My housemates know where I am."" Then she had to calm him down and gtfo when it was safe. 

She's still dealing with it, and doing okay, but definitely shaken. What can I do to make sure he doesn't hurt someone again?

785,"i’ve been playing the cello for about 4-5 years now and i really hate it. about a year ago i told my parents i wanted to quit and they wouldn’t let me. in third grade we had a choice to learn a string instrument, i chose the cello because the violin was too small and the bass was too big. i never really learned because all my music teachers didn’t teach and just assumed that i knew how to play. now i’m in online middle school and all my friends know how to play really well because they had private teachers before. my current teacher assigned three pieces, each 6 pages long, and we have to record ourselves playing them and submit it by december 22nd. i’m freaking out because i suck at the cello and because i’m literally going to fail. my teacher also assigned a playing quiz which is like 15 measures and the tempo is 100, and i already had a hard time learning that. the real pieces are 132 tempo and i literally cannot play that fast. i heard that the band teacher is really nice, but i don’t know how to play a percussion instrument, and our chorus sucks because it’s just mostly kids who don’t want to play an instrument. i know that nothing matters before high school, but should i drop out of orchestra and join chorus? how do i tell my parents that i really want to quit the cello?",23Oct2020,1
787,"Hey there. I’m 15, and since July, I’ve been obsessed with my classmates, more specifically showing off to them and making them think I’m ‘cool’ or something. It’s cringe, I know, but it’s on the back of my mind every second and I just can’t stop. 

I don’t have any friends. I live in a very ‘chavy’ area in England where every girl is a bimbo and every guy will beat you up for looking at him the wrong way, so it’s hard for me to fit in anywhere. I think this may be why. I want to be liked, and a lack of socialisation isn’t helping me. 

It’s just so frustrating... for example, I’m a musician, but whenever I hear a song that sounds similar to my style, I instantly think ‘promote it to your clasmates’. Even though I know they’ll mock me for it, even though it’s not even my song, it’s always on my mind. I really don’t want to do this, and it doesn’t stop there. Fantasies of being some kind of badass and making everybody respect me, not even like, just acknowledging that I can do something.

791,"If you don’t know impulsive lying is when you can’t/ have a hard time controlling what you say.

I used to believe everything he said until I started getting older and I started seeing through his bs, he will make stuff up about random things to stop me from getting them for example:   “Get the ps5 not Xbox series x because I saw that the new Xbox is weaker then the the Xbox 360” and stuff like that, as well as trying to manipulate me and some of his other friends into getting the same thing he has rather than something that could be better for ex “don’t get 5g internet because that will be bad for you and isn’t as fast as 4g”

794,"I can't believe I am actually writing this. I just remembered something that happened 5-6 years ago when I was 11 and I honestly never realized how weird it was and I now hate myself for it. Basically I was traveling with my family to Germany and we were staying at a Hotel. The thing is, I had to share a bed with my younger sister (she was six). I love my sister and would never purposely cause her any harm. Yes we did use to get into a lot of fights but this is normal for two brothers, right? The problem with me sharing the bed with my sister is that I had no privacy at all. I remember one day wanting to masturbate and since I didn't want to wake anyone up, I decided to wait until everyone went to sleep to do it. The problem is; I didn't know much about the ethics behind masturbation, I didn't know about the proper places and situations where it was ok to masturbate. So yeah, I did on the bed as my sister slept. I tried to be as quiet as possible because I really didn't want to wake her up. I swear to god I am not an abusive brother, I have always looked at her as my sister and nothing else other than that. I really didn't do anything to her, I just happened to be on the same bed. I know it's weird, but I thought it would be ok if she didn't know what I was doing. She woke up eventually, I think it was because of the noise of the sheets moving. She didn't realize what I was doing because she was much younger than me, still it scared me to hell. I waited until she went back to sleep and finished very quietly and went to sleep. This memory came back to me from time to time and I would always cringe at myself for being so reckless and stupid. But now I am afraid I might have been ""abusive"" in any way.

797,"Several months back I started getting texts from real estate agents, random pizza delivery updates from dominoes, tinder profile account verifications codes, etc.... At first it was just an odd one every couple of days, but as of recent it has turned into multiple times a day I'm getting texts from some random corner of the internet. After texting back the real estate agents that message me I was able to get the name of the girl who is using my number and through plenty of google, youtube, facebook searches I think I have found her. 

The youtube account associated with this name has several videos that are public and appear to just be a young pre-teen/teenage girl in my city posting blog like videos of nonsense thoughts. Typical young teenage behavior. I'm confident this is the girl responsible due to how unique the name is and the fact she seems to have given herself a nickname/alternative name that some of the real estate agents have used when messaging me. 

My first thought was to message her on her youtube account and ask her to stop using my phone number. My wife thinks that is a bad idea and will possibly just make the kid angry using my number more or just the optics of me (a middle aged male) messaging an underage girl on the internet. I honestly don't believe she is purposefully trying to prank me or anything. The videos she posts to youtube seem to be more of a girl that wants to do things like order pizza, or create a tinder profile without her parents finding out. I have no idea why she has apparently created an account with dozens of real estate agents. 

All that said, I just want the spam texts from her to stop. Ideally, I'd be able to find a way to contact her parents and ask them to tell the girl to make it stop but I have no idea how to find her parents. Would it be inappropriate to message the girl on youtube?",23Oct2020,1

807,"I always wanted to be an airline pilot, or a private jet pilot. Since I was 14 years old, I really believed that was the career that was meant for me. I was so excited. I spent all my time studying and learning, I even bought myself a few flying lessons to see what it was like. 
I didn’t realise that not only did I have a family illness that would make it difficult for me to get a medical, but I was also below the minimum height for a pilot. I also didn’t have any money to study, but somehow I believed I could save hard and pay for it. 

I am now 24 years old almost, it’s 10 years later. I have found out that I am too short. I will struggle to get a medical certificate. And I still have no money towards learning to fly (I needed the pay rent on a house and pay for a car to get to and from work). 

So at this point in life I must come to terms with the fact that most airline pilots are qualified by 20 years old, and friends I grew up with the same age as me are now captains for airlines. I never made it. 

My heart hurts every day because I didn’t achieve my one goal in life. Nothing will ever come close to that feeling of flying myself. To become who I wanted to be, and now I feel empty because I really always believed I would make it.

809,"I've been friends with him for almost a year now, we started off at work, then half way through we all switched to working from home and he left the company soon after. 

I figured it would be like every other work friendship, you know, when they leave we all just live our own lives and move on. There's nothing to talk about really. 

But it wasn't like that, we talked almost everyday since. Stupid conversation most days just to say something and to get some response and so on. We did have a couple heart to hearts. Eventually he told me he felt some kinda way but right after acted like it never happened.

Its been hot and cold since. And if I ever say anything he makes me sound crazy and says he doesn't remember. We made out once too and almost went there. The second time we hung out, he didnt even want to come near me, which was so confusing, bc we basically planned on sleeping together. 

He then started asking to hangout and then bailed consistently, to the point where I'd say yes but keep going about my day bc I knew it wasn't gonna happen. 

Recently, we both said some harsh things, and the last thing he told me was that I'm the one thats attracted to him and he's not. 

Keep in mind, any moves that were made were from him, until at the end I started reciprocating it. 

So I said nothing for 2 days, wrote up how I felt and sent it to him, and I shut everything off until ik how I feel. 30 days of NC starting today. 

He tells me we're just friends, but he pushes buttons on purpose. He never says sorry straight up, he just uses not remembering as an excuse. 

If I go a day without saying anything he will text me first. 9/10 times he texts me first. And when I start texting him first he thinks I'm freaking out lol. Literally his words, ""if we don't talk for 2 days you start freaking out""....

I don't send paragraphs or anything crazy like that, id just pop in and as if he's good.

813,"

Sorry for the weird title but I’m not very good with words. Tbh this will probably be such a stupid thing to ask advice for but I have no one else.


I’ve always had that one group of 6 friends throughout high school; everyone else was just an acquaintance to me or well I thought they were my friend back then but nah. I’m a loner who hates changes and gets anxious when I have to speak to anyone but those 6 people. Now that it’s been two years since we graduated, I’m still the same, except that group isn’t as tight anymore. I still talk to two people once in a while since they go to my college, and two other people who were always the closest out of the 6. 

As I mentioned before, change is something I hate because I’m afraid of it. You guessed it, my college life consists of me without any friends besides those two high school friends I occasionally say hi to, even then, we don’t really talk. I witness them entering their new lives with new friends and they invited me on their discord server to make me feel included, but my anxiety makes me feel nervous to even talk to these new people I have actually met irl a couple times last year, but felt out of place. 

I guess I’m asking for advice on how to stop this little jealousy of mine from arising. I’m not even sure it’s jealousy, but my social anxiety really makes me feel nervous with new people, which is why the advice of simply reaching out scares me. All my other high school friends are all in their new lives with new partners and friends and I’m just here. I sort of saw myself pushing my high school friends even further so I don’t have to see their new lives, but I don’t think that’s a good idea",23Oct2020,1
814,"I tried to post this on r/teenadvice, but something went wrong and it wouldn't let me save the draft (it's a request to post thing, but it wouldn't let me request). If there's another place I can go to I would love to know. 

This is a bit long I know, but I don't know what else to do or say and I can't afford a therapist to talk to. 

&amp;#x200B;

About three or four years ago, my mom and I lived with my great-grandmother, her husband, and my grandma. It was life in Hell for me. I gained depression and anxiety (I was already bound to have things like this due to genes and childhood trauma), and I was very suicidal. My family, who all tend to ignore important health signs, did not listen to my pleas of help. I finally got my mom to realize I wasn't just trying to get her to give me attention when I had a huge meltdown in school, and told the counselor about how I was feeling.

I moved away from there in 8th grade, and things sort of got better. I was away from my toxic friends, I wasn't suicidal, and my 8th grade year went pretty okay. I had an amazing group of friends (who have since then shunned me, because of reasons not my doing unfortunately), and yet I still had this sadness to me. 

Freshman year was the absolute worst. I was seeing a therapist who didn't help me, I was taking anxiety meds that weren't working, my mom used essential oils on me and in my room because she thought my problem was not enough spirituality (I'm atheist , I haven't told her but I think it's pretty obvious to her). I was failing almost all my classes (I don't remember all the exact grades, but I was making an actual 4 on my report card for Spanish 1). I got moved into homeschool, and didn't do a single thing, not because I didn't want to but because I just didn't have the energy. I spent all my time ignoring my building problems playing video games, and my mom ended up leaving me to live with her ex husband (not my dad) and my sister, so that she could could take my OTHER sisters kids into a functioning home back at my great-grandmas (she has full custody over both of them). I had a choice to go with her, but I said no because of how I was living there originally. 

I spent maybe 6 months, possibly more, just staying locked up in my room, eating ramen everyday (there was never anything else that I could eat that wasn't for my sisters specific diet, and all of the snacks and stuff were for her two kids). I played on my Xbox 24/7, and was sleeping through the day and awake all night. 

Eventually, a week or two before 10th grade, my mom had me pack my stuff up and move with her back to my grandparents. That's where I am now, and I feel like I'm going back into my old habits. I'm thinking bad thoughts that I haven't had since 7th grade, and I feel so worthless and unloved. I practically live in a shed outside, about 30 feet away from the house, and the only thing I don't do in here is sleep (I sleep on the couch, since I don't have a room). 

A few days ago I called at five in the morning from out in the shed, as I had heard footsteps walking around it, and I was in tears talking to my grandma while she just grumbled and told me I wasn't supposed to be up that late. To be fair, I was trying to work on some important stuff, and hadn't been checking the time. 

When she brought me inside, I ran to my moms room and told her what happened- I was shaking and crying, and I knew I was about to have a panic attack, and her only response was ""you're just gonna have to go to bed 11 o'clock then"", and walked me to the couch. I sat there, and experienced a mental breakdown I've never had before that moment. I was twitching uncontrollably, screaming and hyperventilating, I couldn't think, the only thing I knew in that moment that I remember is ""my fault"". My grandma told me to shut up, and I ended up holding my breath for god knows how long. I thought I was going to pass out, and my chest wouldn't stop hurting for almost three or four days after that. 

Ever since then I get random little twitch spasms, and my words come out a lot more stuttered, especially if I'm stressed. I'm very concerned with my mental state right now, but I'm only a child in the eyes of the adults around me, and my opinion, no matter how mature I am, they don't want to listen to my worries. It feels just like when I told my mom I thought I had depression in sixth grade, and she said I was just having a tough time in school. 

When I told my mom (well more like yelled, we were fighting outside) that I felt like everyone in this house hated me, she told me to stop talking because I was ""embarrassing myself"". We have fights like this all the time, usually in the car. She get's mad at something I say, and I try to defend myself. She ends up turning the conversation to how bad of a mother she feels like, how I make everyday so difficult for her, she tells me that I don't deserve to feel bad about myself. She brings up her childhood, how she was abused and things like that, and without fail I always feel like I'm an awful person with no reason to live. I've came close to telling her that, but she tends not to listen to what I'm saying during these things. When we fight outside, she tends to storm off, and almost always five or ten minutes later when I'm back in my shed (before here it was room) she'll invite herself into my safe place and yell at me for arguing and making her feel upset. That's been happening since 8th grade, but her yelling at me in general has been a constant. 

When I came back to this school for 10th grade, I went into public instead of virtual, because it would be ""good for my mental health"". Seeing all of the people here again, the people who made me want to die, it just is doing so much to me. I went into virtual this second six weeks, but my moms putting me back in because I'm doing poorly in a few of my classes. She doesn't believe in the sickness going on right now, even though there have been three cases in my school (the reason why I was in virtual, all the students had a choice to stay or go). I live with my 86 year old great grandmother, she has so many health issues pertaining to her breathing, I know I'm going to give the sickness to her. This is a very ""no masks required"" area I live in, and although it's supposed to be enforced, most teachers tell us we don't need them, and that we shouldn't let in to the hoax. I'm quite frankly terrified here, but there's nothing I can do about it.

I know I have five years until I'm free to leave, but five years can hold a lot in store for a person. I don't want to wait that long, to have so much more added stress to unpack and heal. Besides, my family is very poor, I know I won't be able to leave immediately after 18 unless I'm willing to be homeless on the streets. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so lost, I want to just quit trying and honestly, even though I know that's probably the worst idea, I'm really close to just giving up on everything. I just want guidance, I want more than one friend I can talk to about things, I want a life that's not full of pain. There's so much more that I didn't talk about here that probably have important details, but I just don't have the time, or probably space, to write it all at once. I just want help, and I don't know what that help looks like, but I'd really appreciate just some sort of wisdom or even just understanding. I don't want to be alone anymore.

815,"Hi guys, I am 30 years old and after a lot of marijuana I realized I was gay. I was into straight porn a lot of it until I got really high last year. And since last year women starred not turning me on. I still find them beautiful and what not it's just my penis stopped working on them. So basically I can fall in love with girls I just can't have sex with them. Don't know why that is, cause I can have homosexual intercourse but on the other hand I can't fall in love with men. It's really odd. It made me depressed for a while cause I want to have my kids and be a dad. And 29 years of my life I spend thinking I could have a normal family. But since my penis stopped working on girls and a vagina, I don't really know. P.S. I live in a country that gays are facing persecution. So living makes things hard for me. It's really odd but I want to believe that there is a cure for being homosexual like for being a pedophile even though I think I am gay and I don't have anything against anyone who wants to be gay. My being gay hasn't got to do with me but rather my penis. It's what I told to myself but turns out it's what pedophiles are saying.   Can anyone describe to me the difference between sexual deviance (like being pedophile) and homosexuality without the consent thingy? Cause I get aroused on straight guys without their consent. I am not even joking. I attempted suicide over this. And as are stories about people being trapped in a wrong body. I am a straight guy trapped in a homosexual body. Is there any help for me like there is for others that feel trapped in their body?  Why someone doesn't advocate this. I know lgbt are endangered and they should get rights but what about people like me? Who wish other happiness but aren't happy themselves?

821,"I'm going to try and make this as short as possible. I need to vent to strangers because I feel like I am losing my mind and am at the end of my rope.  (My husband and I are currently living with his parents thanks to COVID and having no money.)

My husband and I have been married 4 years, and his brother just got married 3 weeks ago. I like my brother in law, however his new wife....is the biggest A-hole I have ever met.

She has been nothing but rude to me and my husband, and is probably the most stuck up snob I think I have ever encountered. I will say hello to her when she visits, and she will ignore me and pretend I am not there. She's also freakishly obsessed with her dogs, yet I have seen her shove my little poodle when he tries to get her attention. I've bit my tongue more times than I can count, and this last ordeal at their wedding was the nail in the coffin for me. 

Her family was SO rude to both me and my husband. Her parents walked over to us, and I said hello to them. Her Dad looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""I'm here for Grandma."" I did not realize my husband's Grandmother was behind me, and shortly after he said that to me, we were shoved out of the way by them. I was so happy my husband was there to see/hear that, because everyone always thinks I am making this stuff up. He was shocked at her parents behavior too, but shrugged it off. This has bothered me to no end. Then her brother made a comment about how he has heard TONS of stories about my dog... (which validates that she does hate my dog for whatever reason too.) This was like something you would have seen in a sitcom, and I was waiting for the UFO to beam this family of circus freaks back up to outer space. 

I felt like her family had this pre-notion about my husband and I, and it was really uncomfortable for me. It was like I could not do anything right, and like I was kind of under a telescope. I feel the same way around her when she comes by. She will say nothing, and if I joke around or say anything she scoffs at it and/or ignores me per usual. 

Then, the witch made no effort to say anything to us at the wedding. Oh, and they are the a-holes who just HAD to get married during this COVID time AND are also having a vow renewal and 2nd reception next year. Their poor 85 year old Grandma came to it, and had to quarantine for 2 weeks in her room at the assisted living center she resides at. This year's wedding was only 25 people. They had the option to just postpone it until next year at no cost, but they insisted on having 2 freaking weddings. I understand how busy a wedding is, but being that there were only 25 people there she chose to sit by only her family and friends and ignore the rest of us.

At the end of the night I gave them all a hug (we were masked up and everyone else was doing it), and she made some backhanded compliment about my dress I was wearing. I put a nice post on Facebook congratulating them both, and she never liked it or said anything. But then I see her commenting on everyone else's posts about them. (I know that's a stupid thing to be upset about, but whatever.)

Oh, and it appears that everyone got a thank you card except for me and my husband. We gave them a very generous gift, despite the fact that we are poor. I guess that doesn't matter though, since you know we don't matter to this witch. 

How can I get out of going to their 2nd wedding next year? Also, how can I dodge seeing her this upcoming holiday season? It's so hard since we live with my husband's parents. :(

I'm really depressed and I hate it when people are rude to me. I was bullied all throughout grade school and high school. I am kind to everyone, and I have tried so many times with this chick and she continues to sh\*t all over me. Thanks for listening &lt;3",23Oct2020,1
822,"Apologies for this being long, but I  have a lot I need to get off my chest. This isn't something I've been  able to discuss with anyone in real life. I'm hoping sharing it here  will help me find some clarity. Thank you, if you take the time to read  this and offer advice.

I've known  this guy for a couple years. We met as I was a few years into my current  relationship. I'm not the type of person who connects with people  easily, but for some reason, I connected with him almost right away. We  first met through online through a mutual friend until we met in person  at a party a few months later. One of our first conversations online  lasted over two hours. It was a really deep conversation where we both  shared some personal things, even though we didn't know each other much  at this point. I don't know why, but it felt very easy and natural for  us to open up to each other that way. This almost never happens to me!

When  we met in person, that strong instant connection I felt online  translated in real life too. We talked for hours, and had great  conversations. I also thought he was cute, but since I have a boyfriend,  I did my best not to dwell on this much since it can't go beyond  anything platonic. I've never cheated on him, and I never would. I want  to clarify, my boyfriend is a really great guy and our relationship has  been awesome. We have a lot of chemistry and understand each other well.  Our relationship being so positive makes me feel frustrated with myself  for developing a crush on this friend. I don't feel able to help  feeling the way I do, but I try to minimize it as much as possible since  I know its harmful to my relationship.

Despite  making sure i rarely initiated conversation with my friend, we still  found ourselves talking regularly and often. Our talks were always  platonic but they were also deep conversations about some of the common  interests we share. We would often also talk about his love life and  some of the women he was pursuing. Although at times I found myself  feeling jealously, I did my best to push aside those thoughts and  instead tried to be genuinely supportive of whatever girl he was  pursuing. I am taken anyway, so I know I have no right or logical reason  to feel jealous. I'm also hoping him getting a girlfriend might help me  get over these feelings.

I have  no idea if he feels the same way I do, but I really wish i knew because  sometimes I wonder if it's just in my head. That is a conversation i  can't have with him, as long as i have a boyfriend. Certain things make  me suspect we may be feeling the same thing, but other signs show  otherwise. I hate how often I think about this and that I can't talk to  anyone about this. We recently saw each other in person and like most of  the times we've seen each other, I felt palpable sexual tension. I  don't know if this was just mostly on my end though.

I  really want to erase all the non-platonic thoughts about him out of my  head. He's someone I'd love to have in my life but these feelings are  making it difficult to do so. Connections like this don't happen often  for me but my relationship takes priority over any friendship I have  with him. For the past few months, I've done my best to distance myself  from him but seeing him again recently made all the thoughts come  rushing back. I hope I can eventually get over this stupid crush and  just enjoy having him in my life as a good friend without it feeling so  complicated.

If anyone has advice  on getting over this, figuring out if it's mutual or in my head, or  whether or not I should share this with my boyfriend, please let me know. Thank you if you took the time to read this",23Oct2020,1

828,"I'm 17 and for quite some time now I've been suffering from sleeping problems. They cause me to wake up multiple times throughout the night and subsequently rob me of my sleep. To be fair they have come and gone over the past year, they have been especially severe in the winter months tho. I already went to the doctor and found out it has nothing to do with my physical condition which would only leave my mental condition to blame. Now here's my problem: My gf who herself goes to therapy (but for other reasons) told me it might be good to see therapy and see if my sleeping would improve. She also said that she has the lingering thought there might be other mental problems I fight with subconsciously. While I consider myself a rather mentally healthy person I have been noticing some stuff in my self that just keep on bothering especially at night and they obviously get worse over time when I can't seem to get a good night's rest. I told my mom about this idea and she seemed hurt over this and kind of outraged that I apparently wouldn't want to share my problems with her and that a therapist would be too hard to get to begin with. Now I'm conflicted on what my best course of action might be. My mom and I have had a pretty rough time recently and we seem to not get along that much. There's also the fact that I'm unsure wether or not I really need a therapist cause I fear that my problems are ""too basic"" or just not in need of professional help.

Please help me out if possible.

829,"I (21F) can't for the life of me keep a job. Trust me I want to, and I've tried, I've been in and out of jobs since I was 17. I don't know why I'm like this and I don't want to be like this anymore but I don't know how to change it. It always happens the same way, I'm determined to get a job so I go get one, I hype myself up, tell my self its easy work, I can do it, think about the money, look at everyone else, elderly people can keep jobs, friends and family can do it, so I can too! I got to said job and things go good at first, then after a little while I start getting anxiety, finding ways to leave early. Then a little while later it gets to where I spend all of my days off stressing, worrying, and panicking about when I have to go back. And them it gets to where I have full blown crying panic attacks before work and I quit. Wait a month or two and repeat. My husband works and supports us but we struggles some times and never have any spending money, so I really want to help bring in income. Could this be a mental health thing? Should I seek help? My grandma is the same way, I'm not sure if she has the panic attacks and stuff but I do know she is in and out of jobs ALOT. but its not like I grew up around it, I was raised by my dad who has always been a hard working man and takes pride in that. Could it be hereditary? The longest I've been able to keep a job is 3 months. Everyone just calls me lazy and says I need to shut up and keep a job, but I'm really not lazy in another aspect of my life, I work out, the house is always spotless and I home-cook 3 meals a day besides fridays dinner every week, we have pizza that day.

835,"I'd been living with and regularly sleeping with my roomie for around 3 years before COVID hit. We were pretty close and did everything together, then suddenly around early March he started pulling away, shutting down, being passive aggressive, picking at everything I did and said, starting fights over stupid things....

Initially when I asked him what was going on, he said it was just all the work and COVID stress, and he apologised. He made an effort and his behaviour improved for a short time but then he started to exclude me from things that we would normally do together, avoid me entirely and start big fights over petty things. It felt like he was looking for excuses to be angry with me all the time.

Again he said it was all stress related and that I was now making him feel pressured and more stressed by wanting to talk about it all the time. He keeps telling me he cares about me a lot and wouldn't still be living in this house if it weren't for me. He keeps me hanging on...

We've had some ups and downs over the year - but generally have enjoyed each others company. I guess in my mind we were like best friends or something. There was very little time or experiences we didn't share together. 

But over the course of the last 6 - 7 months he's basically changed our whole relationship without any communication or explanation, and expects me to just suck up and get over it. He keeps using COVID as an excuse and even tries to say that I am the one who is not coping, behaving badly and making him feel uncomfortable in his own house... 

I know it's been a tough time for many people, including for him and people deal differently with stress - but am I wrong for trying to get him to talk? Should I give up and walk away? Or should I keep trying to get through to him and save our friendship - even though I seem to spend a lot my time crying because he's always being mean to me?",23Oct2020,1
836,"So I grew up and my mum was usually fine but over the last few months or years she has progressively gotten worse and more unreasonable over time to our close family. She's lazy (she says she has a condition but never could get diagnosed) and putting herself into financial issues because of it and isn't taking responsibility for anything instead blaming family members for her issues not directly tho. As this progressed she just generally became more toxic complaining over anything really like I'll make a plan with freinds then she'll be like ohh you should do this instead and make an argument out of it. I'm writing this because I just had an argument were I called her out on blaming everyone for her problems and that she's selfish and entitled. It use to be occasionally a few months ago but it's just become almost everyday and i want to leave but I'm only 18 without decent pay and I'm quite good at what I'm studying so I don't wanna have to get a dead end job and give up my future because of her. 

Anyone know what could be causing this except stress cos surely stress wouldn't get her to turn on everyone and be this toxic. Could it be depression maybe something else?

837,"My now ex girlfriend as of last night,had been acting weird all week long. She was called into work on her day off because of short staffing which made her a little upset that day, which I understand totally. Then the next 2 days she spent the night at some friends house and was drinking and doing who knows what and ignored me for those 2 days. I tried to be patient and figure out what was going on. Maybe I had done something to upset her? She told me no. It was no big deal she just wasn’t feeling herself. As the days went on this week I just had a feeling deep down that clearly something was up and I couldn’t quite pin it down. The only thing I really knew is that she was hiding something. A few days later one morning she had come home after not telling about anything that happened the previous 2 days. We talked and she said she was lying to me and that she was upset with me because I had neglected to do stuff such as check the mail like I said I would that day. Which I guess is understandable but to ignore me for 2-3 days and literally not tell me anything? I don’t see how that could upset her that much. Last night I decided to get on her phone as she had added my fingerprint to it months ago, and as I got on one of the apps she used for messaging I noticed messages from a guy I had never heard of before. I looked through the messages and what I saw caused my anxiety to sky rocket. My hands were shaking my body felt like it was hollow and I was outside of myself. The things I read broke my heart truthfully. To quote one line, as it’s the only line i managed to read fully before I had to put her phone down and leave. They were on the subject of regretting what they had done that night and both of them had said no they don’t. My ex gf said she quite enjoyed it. She said this new guy gives her butterflies and I never had. Now not even 24 hours later she moved all her stuff out and now I’m alone, in my head trapped in an endless cycle of anxious thoughts and bouts of depression. It feels like tears are ready to pour but they won’t come out. Thoughts like “am I unlovable?” “What did I do to deserve this?” It’s a nightmare and I’m begging to wake up from it. Please if anyone has any advice, please share. Or if you just have words of comfort please share. Anything would be appreciated. I don’t share much publicly about my life so this is the first time I’ve done anything like this. What can I do to cope with what’s going on inside of me. Nothing is working. Breathing exercises do nothing for me. I’ve tried coping today but I feel as if my body has no strength to do anything. Im not suicidal. But I am depressed and I see no way out of this.

838,For context I live right next door to my aunt and uncle so we see each other and talk a lot and they come over often. So my uncle got out of jail 6 years ago and three years later married my best friend's mom. She is an alcoholic and the worst kind of drunk. She stoped drinking for around 6 months. But she started drinking again on the anniversary of her dads death. Over the last 3 months it's gotten really bad she has evicted her friend and her friend's daughter after an argument she started out of nowhere. She pushed around her son and when he pushed back she told everyone he manhandled her and most recently she punched three holes in his bedroom door and yelled at him until he cried for no apparent reason. He is currently staying at his dads. But I'm 16 I can't see anything and my families pretending like nothing's happening. Any advice,23Oct2020,1

841,"So I find myself stuck right now. Currently in Mexico taking online classes while teaching myself Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, all of which I'm already familiar with but not sufficiently skilled at yet. I've made a few small projects, but nothing impressive yet.

I'm also certified in SMAW and GMAW welding which I went to trade school for about 9 months for, and although I don't know much more welding than that, the welding I DO know how to do, I'm pretty good at it.

Without giving too much information, I have these choices: 

Going back to this religious volunteer gig where I live on base, help kids, help build a community, work 10-hour work days Monday - Friday with 6 hours on Saturday. With lots of chores to do after work. Lots, and lots, and lots of things needing to be done at the base after work.

Find another volunteer gig, which I'm not that interested in doing because I'm kind of burned out on altruism.

Go back to the US and try to land a welding job.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go back to the US and get a regular job because I'm pretty stubborn about wanting to have my own place so all I have to do is show up to work, clock in my hours, clock out, and then spend the few hours I have to myself coding and writing, and have a little social life on the weekends.

 I also believe that college is just more debt and not really necessary for someone in my professions unless I want to be a programmer in corporate, which, I don't. I'd rather have my own little business or freelance gig going which, I'll admit I don't know a lot about.

But, and don't laugh (or do) if it sounds like a joke, but I watched a video recently by Sam Hyde, where he was like, ""If you can, avoid getting a job while working on your ambitions for as long as possible, and if you can't, just minimize your life as much as possible so you can save money and, more importantly, **TIME**: Live out of your car, live with your parents if you have to, get a gym membership and shower at the gym, do your computer stuff at Starbucks or the gym, etc.""

And then that made me think like, ""Well, shit. At the volunteer gig, I didn't have bills, I had work to do every day with reasonable hours with people who appreciate me so I had structure to keep me from slacking, I was serving a community with kids that I've grown attached to and care about which helped keep me from feeling lonely and angry all the time, everything is much more affordable, I was learning a bit of carpentry, learning Spanish, and I got time to code after the work day, too.""

Whereas if I go back to the US, I can get a job and my own place, but I'm probably going to be working 12/6 work weeks with a bunch of people who won't appreciate me, not that I care anymore, and am probably going to have to REALLY work to keep myself steady-headed while going it alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite having a falling out there, I'm thinking that going back to the volunteer gig is more worth it in the long-run, especially since I made a promise that I don't want to break and need to learn how to commit.

That said, if I can manage to get a job and a place and find plenty of time to work on my own things in my limited free time and do things at my own accord, that would be great, but I don't know how realistic it is.

I do have a few medical things I want to get checked out with my legs and knees and teeth, but I'm not sure how feasible or worthwhile that is with the current state of doctor offices in the US, and dentists in Mexico are cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

My ultimate goal in life is to find a way to make money using a skill so I can some day build and live on a sailboat or build a home and live in the mountains or some place, and just, find a way to be self-sufficient and close with nature, and spend the rest of my days writing, tinkering, and making sure my little sister is alright.",23Oct2020,1

845,"I have this friend that is very racist towards multiple races. He is white, but he has this fake persona that he thinks he's black. And he thinks saying the N word is fine because he says ""I'm black"". He also is racist towards Asian people, and I'm Asian. I don't really get offended by racist jokes, my friend takes it to a level where its not funny and repetitive (Ex. He just sometimes says ""CHING CHONG"" for like a minute straight. It's really annoying). The only time he's not overly racist is when he is around his family. But basically anywhere else, he's so racist.

Now, I do make some racist jokes as well. But I usually contain it to Asian and white people jokes because I'm Asian myself, and my friends are white. I do admit that I'm a little racist myself. But I don't go too far with my jokes. But my friend, he just says the N word like its okay to say it. And every time I ask ""Can you stop being racist?"" He just makes the pitiful excuse of ""You made me racist by saying racist jokes"" or ""I can't help it"" It's just a pathetic excuse. It just annoys me so much because he is aware that he is white, but he pretends he's black and says the N word when ever his relatives is not around. He also says the N word at school. He also says the racial slur for Asian people (Also known as the C word).

He's so racist, and I want to call him out for it. But I honestly can't bring myself to do it. He has other friends, and I'm not sure if they're racist as well.

I need some advice. I don't want to hurt him or anything. But I'm tired of his bullshit excuse of ""I could say the N word because I'm black"" Even though he's probably the whitest person I know.",23Oct2020,1

I still don’t drink a lot only a couple beers since I still have that 30 minute drive home.

Last night I was there and there was this girl who was noticeable drunk like very flirty, loud, and continuing to drink. I talked to her and flirted a bit but in my mind I wasn’t trying to make a move, 1) she was wayy out of my league. 2) As I said she was noticeably drunk and I just wasn’t comfortable with that with me still being sober.

She went home with this one guy and who I believe worked there and wasn’t too drunk if any at all. I can’t help but feel uncomfortable about this just because she would have literally said yes to anything at this point.

So I have two questions. What should I do in this situation? How drunk is too drunk for a guy to leave with a female at a bar?

851,"Firstly, I am currently an undergraduate junior at a high ranked university in the US. I'm supposed to be a senior but I took 2 medical leaves (will touch on that later). I am a sociology major with a double minor in psychology and biomedical ethics. Long story short, I was dead-set on going into criminal justice and law until recently when I came to terms with my suppressed passion for healthcare due to the fact that I was told I wasn't smart enough (even though I have a 4.0 GPA) and that science wasn't my strong suit in high school and college (I despise chemistry). As of right now, I am nowhere near having the pre-requisites and science background/experience in order to apply to medical school, if that is the route I decide on, because of my previous dedication to law and criminal justice. I just recently discovered (even after years of thinking about going into medicine or healthcare) that I 100% am dedicated to this route. If I can't afford/don't have time to take all the prerequisites and get my science classes in before I graduate, how can I still apply to get into medical school? I'm not exactly sure how that process works. I am also nervous that I won't do well in science courses, and that will impact my MCAT scores and ability to get into a reputable medical school.

Secondly, I struggle with mental illness, specifically anorexia and depression. I've been struggling for the past 7 years, but I've been to treatment multiple times and have had periods of stability. I've missed a lot of high school and have taken two medical leaves from college to enter treatment or because of hospitalizations. I am definitely a perfectionist and have a type-A personality, and I am extremely organized, I have pristine time management skills, and my work-ethic is insane, however I'm anxious to go into medical school knowing how stressful it is. I'm scared I won't be able to handle the stress and pressure and have to drop out, or take leaves like I did in undergrad. It's an ongoing journey for me, but it's something I have to consider given the rigor of medical school.

853,"Thanks for reading, I don’t know who to talk to irl about this. I’ve never asked for advice from the internet, I’m grateful for any insight. 
-
I’m a woman in her late twenties, I’ve started hanging out more with a guy friend, who I’ll call J, around my age that I’ve been getting to know slowly for the past 4 or so years. I think he might have been interested early on, but he was still a bit immature then and I was in a weird place. I had low self-esteem, spending a lot of time/energy chasing emotionally unavailable dudes and then filling the void that creates with casual sex. This self-destructive cycle eventually culminated in getting the shit slapped out of me during a hook up gone wrong - It was a vicious wake up call and I took a break from dating or sex at all for a couple years to process how the hell I got myself in that situation. I’m in a much better place now, I am not trying to prove myself to anyone or seek validation through sex.

J and I hang out quite a bit now as friends, he seems to have matured a lot and I am finding myself really appreciating his personality and how easily we get along. He’s thoughtful and we have a lot of common ground. I started to have romantic feelings for him, thinking maybe I was finally falling for someone emotionally stable/present. We’d been hanging out more one-on-one for a while, flirting a lot but neither has ever admitted any feelings. I was starting to hope he would.

But things kind of shifted in a split instant. the other day we were sitting outside talking, I had on a loose shirt that was hanging off my shoulder. I was in the middle of a sentence when he suddenly slapped me hard square on my exposed back. It took me off guard. It was without any verbal warning and way harder than it needed to be, he said he was aiming at a mosquito, but missed. I was stunned for a second, it was a friendly gesture I guess, but I hadn’t been slapped in any way since I was assaulted. He totally derailed my train of thought. eventually instead of confronting him directly I half joked that I appreciated the thought, but since he didn’t get the mosquito all he did was hit me. he kind of laughed it off that slapping mosquitos is ‘assault with a purpose’ and didn’t really acknowledge that he did anything wrong. 

now I feel like my bubble’s been popped and I don’t know who is popping it... J, for ‘helping’ me by smacking a mosquito without a heads up, or me for having such a visceral reaction to it. I don’t feel like I can address it honestly with him without being more vulnerable than I am comfortable at this point. 

I guess I’m looking for an outsider’s perspective: Is this a subtle red flag about his behavior that I shouldn’t ignore, or not as big a deal as my trauma response tells me it is? 

And how should I move forward if I want to give him another chance but want to make sure I also feel secure, without over sharing on my part or making him feel like shit?",23Oct2020,1

Now we stopped talking in december 2019, but then during covid(march 13th) we started talking again. Obviously i was a little sus about it but surely enough we started playing xbox again and talking more and soon hanging out. We brought the whole “squad” back together on xbox and now everybody plays together. But now i feel like i’m starting to get cut off... Nobody invites me to the xbox parties anymore(voice chat), i have to find out on my own. When I’m in the party I always get called trash when I truly am trying. They poke fun at my level ,my rank, etc(note i’m only allowed to play for 3 hours a day, while their parents could care less if they play 24/7). Now about 3 days ago I get on xbox, and all of them appear offline. Every single one of them. So i text our group chat and once i do everyone of them go back online. I join and they act like nothing happened, but u can hear them snickering. I text the main friend and he says i’m being dramatic and being annoying. Like sir what... and then today, I get an invite to the party, and some other kid we play with is like “well if u don’t like who’s in the party just kick them, your party host” so i’m like... cool, and leave.

871,"Hi, I really don't know what to do anymore so I'll take my chance here. First, let me introduce myself - I am the eldest son and I am the only one working in our family for more than 5 years. My parents has a little source of income tho, but of course it is not enough since I have 2 more brothers my 2nd brother already graduated more than 2yrs ago(no job until now, think highly of himself and very choosy in jobs) and the youngest just enter college. I am working for almost 10-15hrs daily, grinding everyday to have a good position and develop my skills and I can say that I have a good paying job now. I am the type of guy that cannot buy shoes if I want unless I can buy 3 - if I bought something for myself I always felt guilty not to buy something for my siblings also. Every occasion; birthday or Christmas I always make sure our table is full because that what makes my parents happy. I always bought something for my family. They keep me motivated before. Now, we got lucky - a long term property of my parents has been sold and they now have a fortune somehow to live comfortably. I don't have any savings or whatsoever (I know that it is still my fault) and since my family doesn't need my support anymore I can keep now to myself right? I know that it is good. But I am already 28 and I want to somehow make a move to escape corporate slavery + I am planning to get married next year. So I ask my mom to help me for some capital so I can start a business alongside my work. She laughs at me, laughs at my idea. I got offended. She refuse to help me since my second brother is also asking for a capital to have his own business also. What I am most angry about is in her eyes I am on the same level of someone who don't do anything and just lay in bed for 2 years(my brother). I mean, she told me that it is better if I will save money now and I told her that I am getting old and I need help and she told me that I should thought of that earlier in my life. She is right but the main reason that I am in this situation is because we are poor. I need to provide the things that they cannot provide to us. I find it hard growing up, the only guy with keypad phone while everyone already got a touchscreen and I don't want my siblings to feel the same that is why I am giving what I thought they need. I understand that I sound immature and selfish now. But I regret that I provide too much, every night after our conversation I am always thinking the things that I've done and become and it feels like all these years they didn't see me. What I achieved and everything. I regret it. I should have taken care of myself more, I should think of my self first. I know what I sound like, but all I want is acknowledgement and now I can't sleep and I am underperforming at work. I am always an open minded guy, I always put myself in the shoes of others but now I just can't understand it and all I am feeling is that I'm not appreciated or whatsoever.",23Oct2020,1
872,"Hi r/Advice,

Please don't judge or say anything rude, I'm just looking for advice and haven't made a decision either way yet.

Background: I'm a college student, still trying to figure out my identity and what I will and won't support. I am a white, upper middle class, secular female and don't have the cultural background to make these kinds of judgements. I have always advocated against cultural appropriation, and don't want to offend any religion.

Situation: I have recently entered the goth subculture, and have been trying to expand my wardrobe to appear more goth. A big part of the goth fashion is wearing crosses as fashion, and that includes rosaries. They were established in the goth scene because many popular goth band members grew up in Christian/Catholic homes and wore them on stage and in photos, so have been a part of the scene for decades, and are still a popular trend.

I'm considering buying one, but don't want to be offensive towards any religion. After doing some research, I decided that buying a rosary-type necklace without prayer beads or any explicitly Christian symbology except for the cross from an individual alternative jewelry maker.

BUT (sidebar), this reminded me of the Youtube controversy with Social Repose. If you don't know, Social Repose wore an all black Native American headdress for years, and when called out for it, made a video saying that it wasn't offensive because it was made of plastic and not real materials, and therefore wasn't a real headdress. A lot of people had an issue with that explanation.

I also think it's significant that Native American culture has been degraded and demeaned and Native American people have been mistreated for centuries, and many victims of cultural appropriation are underserved communities. In contrast, a rosary is really only a part of the Catholic Church's teachings, and isn't written about in the bible or used as heavily in other denominations of Christianity, and the Catholic Church has been responsible for mistreatment and degradation of other cultures for centuries. (I have nothing against Catholic people or the Catholic belief system, only the system of the Church that has caused much pain).

I also understand the significance and meaning of the rosary, and don't mean to disrespect Christianity. I live my life without any religion, and would consider myself very secular, and wouldn't have anything mean to say if someone asked about it or told me it was offensive. In my research, it also seems like it's a personal decision if people think it's offensive, some do and some don't. I am also not approached very often in public generally, and don't think that many people would ask me about my religion or reason for wearing it.

My boyfriend is worried that I would be perceived as offensive and knows that that goes against my beliefs and morals. I would never wear pieces that resemble those of other religions that I do not have exposure to or knowledge about.

SO, should I forgo buying the necklace because I would be wearing something that is based on a religious piece? If I do buy it, what would be the best way to approach conversations about it?

I'm sorry that's so long and confusing and maybe complicated, but any advice would help, thanks :)",23Oct2020,1

874,"So last night I (18F) was hanging out with some friends in the lobby of my dorm. We dispersed around 11pm because it was quiet hours. I sent my friend (18M) ahead of me to meet me back at my room while I returned a speaker to another room. 

When I got back, my roommate (18F) and her friend were leaving in a hurry and my friend was throwing away cups and the room had an odd smell to it. I started to ask him what was happening but he refused to tell me. So I went into my room being pissed because I was pretty sure there was alcohol involved and my roommate and I had a deal that we would not have alcohol in our room no matter what. (We all underage).

Another guy comes over and says he forgot his bag and my friend ushers him away and as they are walking down the hallway I hear the guy ask if I was mad and whether I found out. At that point, I was pretty confident that they had been drinking in our room and I was so mad.

My friend texted me asking if I was ok and I said that I didn't know and that maybe I was being paranoid. He comes back and I start asking him what happened and he again refuses to tell me and I just keeping getting more mad because no one is telling me anything when this also concerns me because it is my room too.

Eventually, my roommate comes back and my friend leaves and we go to bed. I was still pissed this morning so I didn't talk to her. I did talk to her this afternoon and we cleared up what happened and I forgave her. I want to talk to my friend because I still have some questions and she doesn't remember what really happened so she was down for it as well.

So I text him asking when he was available and he says not until after 10pm because of work. I say ok and ask if he was ok with coming over after work. He then askes why and I tell him. He then says it is not his problem and that I should really just talk to my roommate about the issue. I try to explain why I can't do that because she doesn't remember it and he keeps shutting me down. I am conflicted on what to do at this point because I want to know what happened but I don't want to lose my friend but I feel as though it is important to talk about this especially because they (my roommate and my friend) seem to keep hiding things from me. I honestly don't know why they do this. I was upset last night but them not telling me anything made me more upset.

875,"Im a teenager- I was a sophomore when I first smoked marijuana. It was amazing, and quickly after my first time I bought a weed vape and used it everyday all day; for about 6 months. This was a year ago. I got caught by my parents and got it taken away, (although not fully because my dad is a huge stoner and didnt care until my grades dropped.) Anyways, this causes me to stop for months and then I started smoking again. I've had several episodes since March. They include insane paranoia, hearing a voice, and not feeling real. My memory has gone to shit and I cant remember most parts of my past. Simple things like last summer or an old friend. I used marijuana to cope and now I think it fucked me up. I also have some mental disorders, (BPD, ADHD, depression, and anxiety) I'm also being evaluated for bipolar. My only therapy is a group therapy so I haven't been able to tell them about it because I'm not gonna announce that I started hearing voices when I smoked pot and havent been the same since. It's like the paranoia is still there, it doesn't overwhelm me, but its there. The episode usually goes away when the high does. But one time I had an episode that lasted 2-3 days. Im pretty certain I hadnt even used marijuana beforehand but again my memory is shit. Obviously I finally got it in my head that cannabis is no longer my thing and i've stopped.

Unfortunately, they called me at a point where I had little time to discuss my medical progress so far and express my decision, so I tried setting up a point where my boss was free to talk and continue the conversation. 

I'm stuck since they aren't answering their phone when I called during business hours and I never got to set up any further meetings.

  I dont want to call it too early, but I felt like the counselor and I didnt vibe? Are you even supposed to vibe or click with your therapist?

We’re both 17F and we’ve been friends for 4 years. 
A and I because extremely close last year. We were practically best friends. 

Her cousin passed away last year and I was there with her through it and I was there for her. 

She been hung up on the same guy for three years and the guy moved on. I’ve helped her stay away from him and get over him over and over again. 

I listened to her always and let her rant to me when she needed to. I was always there for her and we made the best memories possible. Everyone in school saw our duo as the perfect one. 

We have another extremely close friend, We’re a three friend group but I’m closer to both of them, than A is to her. 

Once quarantine started, we used to talk everyday and we became even closer. It was perfect. Once lockdown got over, I started going out a little, meeting up with just 3-4 people and even our common close friend. 

She wasn’t allowed out, and we were very understanding of that. She used to call us out and tell us we were being irresponsible but we told her we were being careful but she felt extremely left out. 

Three months back, we realised that the only time we’d talk was when she was upset or crying, and needed to talk about her ex that she misses. She even went out for a birthday party, and for lunch at a restaurant. 

It was upsetting that she didn’t care much for me to check up on me but made everything about herself. Random people would come tell me A is crying. She’d cry sometimes and say I was just bored.

These last few weeks she’s been leaving me on seen, she doesn’t respond properly, she ignores me most of the time. I stopped calling her because I didn’t get a good response on call everytime and now she’s acting this way with me. It’s my birthday next week and she doesn’t care at all. She told everyone we know that she has to study and doesn’t have time for this, even though I went and surprised her on her birthday and made her a huge gift box and surprise video. 

I really just miss her and I don’t know how to bring it up to her without her crying. It feels so shitty

Recent college grad. I graduated in a field that is very competitive and based on connections. I had to move home due to covid. I'm sort of beating myself up over the fact that I believe I should be further along in my career than I am right now. I feel like maybe I could have worked myself harder in college. I am currently home and have had a hard time finding work related to my field (most work is in bigger cities). Because of COVID i've been wary of moving. I hate to sound winy and I hope it doesn't come off this way, but I just feel sort of stuck. I almost feel under-qualified for most jobs in my field. I try to work everyday on expanding my knowledge but I think the emotional toll of living at home is starting to get to me and make me feel stuck. My options currently are move to a big city far away for more opportunities (no job guarantees however) or move out closer to home and take an unpaid internship and hope that opens some doors for me (music industry is notorious for treating unpaid interns like shit).

I kept my guard up for a while and eventually i wanted nothing more than to be with her. so I dropped everyone i was talking to. she recently found messages from people i was talking to up to 3 months into her and i talking, and she got so angry and called me a scumbag cheater and left me. what i thought was something monumental in my life that i was proud of myself for doing now feels like something horrible that i did. i dont know how to feel about it. she found them because sometimes i would get messages form people i used to talk to on snapchat that said things like ""you two look so happy together"" and id reply with thanks or something. she saw there had been messages between us and just saw that i was still talking to those people. i tried to explain to her that i dont have normal everyday conversations with them and all she could see was the past messages. She doesn't even want to talk to me at all and everyone i tell this to says thats how relationships start, and it's not cheating. help pls",23Oct2020,1
886,"So i’m thinking of buying a tv for my bedroom rather than just having it in the family room. I’m tired of sharing a tv with my siblings, worrying if i’m being too loud and honestly would like to just experience gaming and relaxing with friends online in peace 

but then again i would end up using my own money, i’d get hungry cuz i can’t eat in my room and i don’t have a chair or couch so slouching on my bed for longer gaming sessions would take a toll on my back

I’m meditating 
I’m working out
I’m practicing French 
I got my license 
I got a job
I’m having good family relations
But I’m stuck somehow
I haven’t written a song in about 20 days
I’ve been working on concepts for music videos and an album and such and such
I have a date next week
But I’m fucking never satisfied with my days anymore
I’m doing fine in school 
I have a way better social life
But every now and then I get stuck on some fucking app wasting my time and I hate it
When I’m like okay fuck enough of this shit
And decide to work on something I just sit down and I can’t fucking get shit done
And when that happens nothing can fix 
I can’t sleep 
I get filled with rage
And everybody around me tries to say chill out
But that’s the opposite of what I need
I’m not a fucking loser 
I’m not gonna be
I’m gonna be somebody
I hate sitting still 
How can I get my momentum back?

889,"My (F15) whole life I’ve always liked both girls and boys. I came out to my friends in 6th grade and recently now in 9th grade I came out to my mother. 

Sexually I don’t have a gender preference at all, when I imagine being in relationships gender doesn’t take a part it in. The problem is that I can’t at all see myself in relationships with guys, it’s just completely unthinkable. I don’t get it, sexually I don’t have an issue liking guys but the emotional aspect/relationship appeal just isn’t there. The last time I’ve even been able to imagine myself with a relationship with a guy was almost a whole year ago. 

I don’t really like to label myself because of this, but when I’ve got to, saying “I’m bisexual but I would never date a guy atm” sounds dumb. I feel as if I’ll be able to date guys in the future, but it just doesn’t feel right rn.

I’m feeling as if this could be the result of not really having a close father figure and then not having any close male friends through out my whole life. In general men just make me uncomfortable.

891,"My (F19) whole life I’ve had some pretty severe mental illnesses. Depression being one of them, i have really low depressed states that last for months and then I’ll be manic for like two straight weeks. Those are my better weeks, just my anxiety is at the core of those weeks. Anyways, I spend my life in this cycle. I was managing well until the past like two years. I started abusing adderall really heavy, I got clean and haven’t been the same. My depressive months are so bad I can’t get out of bed, I lost many jobs because of this. And then when I get manic, at the end of that time period I have like an hour long mental break down and it always come down to the fact that I don’t want to live. I don’t have energy for it. Everything that can go wrong swallows me whole bc so many things do go wrong and have gone wrong in my life. I used to lean on my sister a lot, but I moved thinking that if I moved I would be more independent and that would help my motivation and my general mental health. It did not. So anyways, I went through a severe manic episode the past week and a half and I just hit the mental break down wall and it feels like my chest is being ripped apart and like my life is ending. Like I can’t fucking breathe. So if you have this or experienced anything close to this do you have any advice? Because I hate this so much, I just want to function. I don’t have money or health insurance for a therapist right now also, because I live in America and that’s really hard to access.",23Oct2020,1
892,"I'll try to write this as short as possible.

In December of 2019 ( i was a year 9 student) I came across a school that just seemed perfect for me. In a rushed and naïve decision i switched schools and went there instead. As soon as i did i realised i had made a horrible mistake. I couldn't deal with the loss of my old school. Not just my friends but i had become attached to the entire school. i didnt feel right. Cut to now Im in year 10 and i thought i had gotten over it. I was sorely mistaken and recently brokedown in class because of it. I have been offered the chance to move back to my old school but there is a big issue. My current school is a much better school and im more likely to succeed there but i cant stand being there at all. If i transferred back i would love being there and actually be happy but chances are i would end up less successful. I have to choose in the next week or so and need some advice on how to handle it.

894,"Sorry for any typos or misspellings, my first language is English, but I suck at it. I am on a laptop, but still not the best speller.

Backstory: My Mom works as a teacher helper for elementary kids, and my brother and I are in middle school(6th-8th). Since this COVID business started, school has been switched online, so there are 3 people using the internet at the same time, so the internet is pretty laggy. I come from a pretty privileged family. I know this so I hope this post doesn't come across as too in your face or entitled

Story: So, my immediate family has a computer that the family uses for online things, like email or YouTube and whatnot. But over the summer, my brother got into Minecraft, so he bought the game and started playing it on the family computer and playing it pretty much any free time he got. And he likes going on a zoom with some of his friends that he like to play with, which would be fine, except he like to yell at the other players, the game, and his friends. Any time he gets mad. Which is often. My brother gets mad, then is cranky and rude to the rest of the family for the rest of the day. And because that is the only place for my brother to play his game, he plays it right there. And the computer is in the living room, so when he yells, everyone can hear it and interrupts whatever others are doing and it is really annoying.

The district that I go to gave out Chromebooks to families that didn't have a computer or other device that they could use for school, so my family got 2. One for my brother and one for my mom, and I would use the computer. But that didn't work because my brother started sleeping through his classes because the only room  he could go onto zoom in was his bedroom. Then he started getting up late for school and missing his classes, and because I go to the same school, we have the same schedule, So I couldn't help him because I had to get onto my classes, and my mom can only help him get to homeroom because she works from 9:00 to around 11:00. So then my parents came to the conclusion that he would use the computer and I would use the Chromebook so he had to actually get out of bed to go to class, and we wouldn't let him sleep in.

Then my grandparents got wind of this set up and got us a laptop so I could use that instead (because if you haven't seen a Chromebook before, they are kind of tiny. I do know that it is better than nothing, but is still is kind of tiny). So my brother got Minecraft on the laptop and added something that he could only use on the laptop. I forget what it was. So then my brother started using it all the time. Then the computer got really slow, so it took like 20 minutes to load something, so my brother started using the Chromebook. I didn't like using the computer because it took forever to load and I couldn't do my schoolwork and my brother couldn't use it because he kept getting kicked out of his game. So then I was asking for the laptop to do my schoolwork and my brother didn't like that. Then my dad said that the laptop was to be used for homework first, then brother's game. The dialogue usually went something like this.

Me: Can I use the laptop for some homework?

Brother: No, I'm playing my game

Me: But Daddy said that the laptop should be used for school first.

Brother: I know. But I am playing my game. Can't you use the computer?

Me: Can't you? I don't want to. It is really slow.

Brother: It's slow for me too. 

Me: I know. But I want to use the laptop.

Brother: I don't care.(goes back to playing game)

Me:(goes to get daddy)

Daddy tells him to give the laptop to me, Brian gets really angry and stomps out of the chair he was sitting in to give me the laptop. My brother is in that phase where he doesn't want to listen to anyone and just play his game and gets really annoyed when anyone tells him to stop. He has an attitude towards anything he doesn't like. 

I don't know how to help him. I can't really do much since I am only 13, but maybe I can suggest it to my parents. Sorry for the long post.",23Oct2020,1
895,"Hello, I'm feeling a mix of emotions and I think I'm in shock. Today I got a call from my brother crying telling me that our dad has sepsis while itd common I feel it's serious given his situation. He had emergency surgery today due to his colon bursting and now has a colostomy bag. 

Currently I'm in no situation to be able to visit him, I'm in the Army training for my job and I'm waiting to see if it's serious enough for them to send a Red Cross message in order for me to be able to be there. 

The reason why I'm posting here is because I haven't seen my dad in 8yrs, and I want to rekindle my relationship with my dad. This has opened my eyes to the anger that I still carry with me. 

My dad is a recovering drug addict, when I was a teenager he lost custody of me and I moved from Indiana to Texas. I never even got to say goodbye to him when I left.
I recently started speaking to him mainly through Facebook, but I want to help him in every way I can.

I'm already planning on sending him a gift to come home to and enjoy while he recovers. I'm wondering what I can do to make his life easier now that he has a colostomy bag. Can anyone help give me advice with what things I should get him to help make things easier and more pain free for him? 

I know this isn't for medical advice honestly I just want him to feel loved by me since I can't be there. He told me he wants to see me and it kills me I can't just drop everything and be there for him. 

I mainly want to show him that I love him and forgive him. What made me cry was even while he was in extreme pain from his surgery and out of it he asked me if I needed money. I've never asked him for anything before especially money because I've never had issues with money. He told me that he cares about me and just wants to help. I just want him to know I care about him.",23Oct2020,1
897,"Here’s the text from a post I made about it 

All my friends are getting gfs and it’s making me feel unbearably lonely

I know I’m not going to find the one in high school or even college probably but I can’t help but feel lonely. My friends are out here watching movies late night and texting while here i am alone and with no one. It makes me feel sad and just frustrated because they all got them in school while I never could. The only girl I crushed on I have now moved on from but I just feel alone. I want to know how it is to text a girl late night while joking around. To watch a dumb movie together and laugh. Spend time and bond with. It’s so emotionally taxing and upsetting right now.

I just can’t help it at times. It’s a combination of jealousy, hormones, and the fact that I haven’t received much affection from my family in a while.

901,"Within the last couple of months, my best friend and I have constantly floated around the idea of doing a dorm-style in his room. 

Since Covid-19 lockdowns began, I can barely see my friends, especially with college/work preoccupying everyone's time and taking precautions. Fair enough to my parents though, they are worried about catching the virus, especially considering how unpredictable and dangerous it is. We take precautions like cleaning off our groceries with bleach water (anything that can be left out, we leave out for a day or so) and limiting how much we bring people into our home (even for repairs). As a result of the lockdowns/pandemic, I missed out on a lot I was looking forward to and have really missed seeing other people besides my parents. Like everyone else, it has caused me to be pretty sad (I wouldn't call it depression, but it's been the worst it's been ever), harder to get up out of bed, lonely nights, etc.  Not to mention, my parents constantly and I run into issues often. It's almost every month we have had a rather heated argument over something.

Recently though, my friend said that his parents have been more and more open to it, considering how they see how limited I am to seeing other people.  With the growing possibility that I could move in with them for a while, I have actually been considering doing it. 

The problem is the reaction my parents may have (considering they pay for my college tuition, which is $1,000 a semester). While I am 19, legally, I can do anything I want. I have about 2,000 grand I can contribute to my friend's family so I am not freeloading off them. I have also known this friend and his family since 6th grade. Either of us rarely crosses a line (once or twice in the past few years). Additionally, I have a job I can go back to at any point I want if I need it. 

The last concern I have though is leaving my small dog. I'm worried he may pass away, considering he is ten years old with a seizure disorder (he has seizures every few days).  

If I were to go through with this, it would be around January that I would move in. That way, I don't leave my folks alone for the holidays. From what I know about my parents, they won't want me in the house, so there is no possibility of them getting sick. But they would be open to masks and distancing outside so long as they feel as I am taking precautions too. Considering how long this pandemic is estimated to be, I don't want to be away from my parents and dog for over a year (since the estimated end of social distancing is till the beginning of 2022). At the same time, I would feel better than I do now if I lived with him. I would actually be able to interact with someone outside of a screen. He cares a lot about my well-being, and I feel like we could have a lot of fun together.  Obviously, we would make a bunch of rules and make sure both of us could have some alone time. Both of us are extraverts, so we have the same tolerance for being with other people. I would also talk to his parents about what they would need out of me for me to stay there.   

If you have any questions, I'll make sure to look out for them in the comments.

I would love to hear other people's opinions on this! Thanks guys!",23Oct2020,1
902,"I’m in uni studying construction engineering. I hate studying. I’ve never liked it and had mostly my parents push me to a STEM line in high school, and eventually a STEM major in uni. It was easy being lazy and getting good marks back then but uni is understandably not the same.

On one hand; I want to stay even after having failed 6 (or something) exams and failing again now after I was pulled back a year. On the other; I’m thinking of all the stress I create for myself when I procrastinate the hell out of studying and just do anything but physics, and maths and whatever else.

My parents (mother especially) can’t imagine me dropping out, and the reason I chose engineering specifically is because it was supposedly a high paying degree. I thought I could force myself through it for the end goal: money, but I’m not so sure anymore.

What should I do? Do I stay? Try to get tutors and just re attempt every year? Do I change? How do I figure out what’s best paying and what might interest me? Do I drop out? Where the hell do I go from here? :/",23Oct2020,1
