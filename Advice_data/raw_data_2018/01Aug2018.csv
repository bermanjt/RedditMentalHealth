6,"Hi Reddit,

I'm stuck. I decided I'm going to be leaving the university I was going to for many reasons, but all of them lead up to the fact that I just genuinely wasn't happy there. I'm considering transferring to another university for a program my old uni didn't offer. I got accepted, but it's a little more expensive than expected. As well, the program is for speech-language pathology and, unlike an English degree, there isn't much wiggle room in terms of career. What if I realize I hate SLP? Nonetheless, I've been looking at applying for financial aid but I can't bring myself to do it-- I think I'm scared, and I keep trying to avoid the issue all together. I'm scared I'll be filled with regret.

I can always go to CC to finish off my last gen eds, but--I know it sounds petty-- I'm afraid I won't have the social life I want. I don't think I'll be in the general environment I want to be. Then again, finance first. I just want to know what I can do to stop trying to avoid these problems in my life when they appear right in my face and I only have so long to make a decision.

All help is appreciated, lemme know if you need more details. Thank you",01Aug2018,1

13,"I have been playing CS-GO for multiple years and found a best friend. We always played together and we've always talked through discord chat. However, she has never used her mic. I would be the one in the Discord call using my voice while she would be messaging me through the chat. It never used to bother me until we kept on talking about our daily lives. That's when curiosity hit me. Whenever I would ask her why she wouldn't use her mic she would reply with ""No"" or either ""Don't want to talk about it"".

So today I managed to find out why she hasn't been using her mic. 

She was bullied earlier by multiple people online  and now she's super self conscious of herself. She apparently used her mic a lot according to her old friends. She often says that she's mute just to avoid people asking why she doesn't use her mic.

She is super close to me but still doesn't want to use her mic. It's frustrating for me now as well. I want her to stop being self conscious now and talk to me. How can I help her?

14,"I'm staying at a relative's house right now. They were out all day. I woke up at noon, and the thermostat said it was 80 degrees F in the house. They told me to keep it at a certain temperature, so I turned it down, plus it was really hot.

I didn't check my messages until like 5 pm. I saw that they texted me this morning saying ""please don't touch the thermostat."" I panicked, and switched it back to 80, thinking that maybe they had it set that high on purpose.

They got home like 20 minutes later, and were mad about the thermostat(""it's fucking 80 degrees in here, why did you turn it up so high?""). I told them, it was like that this morning and in my mind I was just trying to fix a mistake I made by touching it in the first place. They accused me of lying and deliberately doing that to piss them off. I tried to explain more, they said they didn't want to hear it. So, I just said ""I can leave if you want, I can stay somewhere else."" I thought I was just being helpful, and they said ""don't give me the guilt trip.""

So yeah...in general, is saying stuff like that manipulation/guilt-tripping? I didn't want them to say ""no no no, it's okay, don't worry!!"", I just wanted them to ask me to leave if that's what they wanted. If they're gonna stay mad, then I probably will want to leave, I can't take conflict(involving anger) and it's a character flaw of mine.  ",01Aug2018,2
15,"I(23f) was just offered a contract job with a company my dad worked for back in the 1980s. Basically I am negotiating a start date with them.

 It had another name then, he wanted full time, and was laid off with a bunch of people. He then had a couple more jobs before landing his current job (30 years). He then did the service work for this company up until last fall when he switched divisions.

Me getting this job is bringing up all his mistakes in his life. And all he keeps saying is how scary stuff repeats itself. My current job is a seasonal job where multiple family members worked at in the past 50 years. 

Should I take this job or back out of it? The position already might not happen because they are pushing a start date less than 2 weeks away and I am not happy with it being rushed. My current job will go to weekends in 3 weeks. Thus causing me to skip the  last 2 weeks of the season. I also need a full time job and it would give me another step towards that.

16,"I’m not sure if this is depression or just depression because of not smoking or a combination of both. I’ve cut back my pit smoking because of my son, I’ve been out of work for half the year and can’t help to think because of the lack of motivation that I got comfortable smoking more because I wasn’t able to work so I got stuck. Now that I’m searching for work I’ve had many employers call and interview me and say they want me but don’t really go on with me.

17,"We're basically polar opposites. I'm super conflict avoidant, she's extremely confrontational and loves picking fights with people. She genuinely enjoys pushing people's buttons and trying to get under their skin. To her, she says what she feels and views it as ""telling it like it is."" She views this blunt directness as a positive trait, and to her people who aren't like this need to change. Problem is, she genuinely doesn't care if what she says is hurtful, and it often is. Yesterday she thought it was funny to say ""wouldn't it be funny if I could give you an eating disorder"" then spent the rest of the day calling me fat. I'm actually super thin and not remotely fat. She doesn't know this, but I've actually had some issues with disordered eating. That's just one in a million examples of her being super mean &amp; confrontational. I'm sure I'm on the more sensitive side, but in the majority of these conflicts it's just her starting crap for no reason. 

She seems to want me to change my personality to be ""less weird"" and more like her, but why can't she just accept me for how I am? She frequently says I'm weird, I'm really feeling frustrated and hurt. I'm pretty quiet &amp; reserved, so when I see her I'm always on edge waiting for her to say something mean. She knows I'm quiet and constantly calls me a robot for not seeming human, which really bothers me. Some people are just quiet and like to be left alone, but especially around her I want to be left alone because nearly every interaction I have with her inevitably involves her being mean or making fun of me. But then because I'm avoidant around her, she notices and the vicious cycle of her being mean continues. I just feel like I can't get through to her- I'm not even asking to be BFFs, I just want her to understand that people are different &amp; it's ok to have a different personality &amp; interests than her.

I never pick fights with anyone, I always try to diffuse these conflicts ASAP. I've told her I hate when she starts fights &amp; intentionally starts drama/conflicts, but to her she thinks it's funny and genuinely gets a sadistic kick out of it. She's always been like this. She's said I'm super quiet (I am) and has said the only way to get me to talk to her is if she picks fights &amp; tries to get me riled up. Idk why tf she thinks this, cuz I'm happy to talk if she's nice. But she usually isn't. She'll start off ok, but then 10 mins later goes back to being super judgmental and critical. A lot of the time I just want to be left alone, and we don't even have any common interests to talk about. We literally have nothing in common, and our personalities are polar opposites. I really do want a good relationship with her, but she makes it so difficult even though I've told her countless times that I'm always happy to talk to her as long as she's nice and doesn't start fights or deliberately tries to be mean/annoy me. 

How do I improve my relationship with her?",01Aug2018,1

I blacked out for 3-4 hours and I have no idea what I was doing. I feel so so so ashamed, I cried so many times today because I’m almost sure I did something wrong. I didn’t talk to my friends about my behavior after the blockout but I’ve heard someone saying that I passed out on a table. I have no idea if I’ve thrown up or made a complete fool out of myself. The idea of going back to work and look them in the eyes is killing me. I’m not sure if I should act like nothing happened or ask about my behavior. When I woke up I was laying on a couch covered with a blanket with a different shirt on. I was too embarrassed to even ask about it. One of my friends said that I was so drunk they had to carry me so I could sleep on the couch. What should I do?

* number 2 and 3 on both sides of the center are small and the ones coming in her permanent teeth are almost 3/4 their size.

* We may need to pull number 2 from center on both so her center bottom will have room and then later pull number 3 on the both on both sides to have room for the number 2 permanent teeth to have room. 
* dentist says to leave spacers in so that the other teeth don’t move forward and don’t move backward they stay put. That the spacers are the same size as the other teeth they replaced and removing them would mess up teeth and leave no room for permanent teeth to grow in later.

* dentist is lying. 
* to remove spacers so that the center bottom teeth have room to come in

33,"I am really starting to worry about my own mental health. I remember as a kid telling myself if I every felt this way I would end my life. Part of me wants to really bad just because I worry about myself so much and I am a burden to the ones I care about now.  


Sorry for extreme bitchfest.

  
Basically, what it comes down to is that I am a simple soul deep down. I like simple things. Pain and suffering and fighting and arguing really takes me to a dark place. I really loved attention and affection as a kid. The happiest memories I have are from in school making jokes. I really loved being around the type of people who are just happy, like innocent happiness. I had my first feelings of love at a young age but was too sensitive to peruse and really really regret not expressing my emotions as a teen and chosing retarded coping mechanisms instead like porn and Weed and stupid depressing music.  


I spent alot of time on the taboo and dispicable sites of porn. I convinced myself that it wasnt bad because nobody really sees me doing it and the actors pretty much all agreed or w.e. I always replaced my real emotional needs with sex. Like I would'nt be horny just lonely and would go in the internet. I never had sex in my life. I tried once with my brothers ex GF. I felt terrible about [it.](https://it.It) It was an aweful experience of getting hard and limp like 3 times and hating myself and feeling akward and wrong. It was a really low point. I would buy weed from her from time to time. I knew she always wanted me and this is the main problem of why she broke up with my brother. My brother isnt perfect so he deserves it a little but still This caused massive sadness in me because I loved seeing them together. It gave me happiness and hope for both of them. I fucked it up by being an unsuccessful idiot who mooched off of him. I ended up living with him in his trailer while he worked I was at home with his GF in the house. This eventually ruined the relationship.   


I never held a job because I never stayed true to myself and always felt like I was playing catchup and not getting rewarded properly for my efforts. I was given opportunities, shitty ones but they were opportunities. I didn't keep my strength because I let go of my faith at some point. There was an explosion of information and things happening during my teen years. It was all so much for me to take in. I just went into depression. Basically I wasted the best years of my life.   


So how I feel is basically, I just really want to be loved. I know I need to deserve it but I don't know how. I feel like its not just there like it should be anymore. Feel like my innocence has left me. I take responsibility. I am also emotionally scarred and damaged from certain things in life. I don't care about anything really I just want everything to be ok for everyone. I would die a million times for it. I can't stand seeing all the pain. I can't stand feeling everyones pain. Its really hard holding my head up these days.

34,"Heya, I'm leaving out a fuckton of back story, but I don't want this to be too wordy.

I \[F, 22\] moved to London from the Middle East for uni in 2014, and have lived there since. My parents (English mother, Arab father, both 50s) live in the Middle East with my other siblings \[M, 16; F, 19\]. I'm currently visiting them and they're desperate for me to move back in with them, but some of their behaviour has me confused as to whether or not that's a good idea:

\- When I met my partner \[NB, 21\] my mother said I had to break up with him or my sister wouldn't be allowed to study abroad (I didn't, but my ma assumed I had - that's a whole other drama).

\- My dad says me being away has affected his health negatively. He also says he has depression because of me, and he's been to doctors about it (something my mother had no idea about until he was screaming it at me).

\- When they sat me down for a 'life talk', they started talking (to each other) about how I should start a business (something I really have no interest in, I did Business GCSE but apart from that I have no idea where that came from). I burst into tears mid-way through and my dad yelled that this was 'the height of manipulation'.

\- My mother came into my room today and said that she doesn't understand why I'm being so stubborn, and I'm so used to getting what I want. Why couldn't I just concede this one time?

\- I'm really excited to go back to uni and start a PhD. When I mentioned this to my dad he, very calmly, said, 'Well, this is the first I've ever heard of this, I actually believe that you just want an excuse to stay away from us.' When I tried to explain that it's always been a pipe-dream for me, he kept interrupting me and wouldn't let me finish.

\- Anytime I explain why I want to stay in London it's met with an immediate rebuttal, to the point where I'm just exhausted from arguing. For instance, 'Oh, you want to vote and participate in politics? We'll fly you out to go on marches!' (??? it's a march, not Coachella)

\- Literally a week after I graduated from uni, my dad told me that if I genuinely believed that I was able to stay in London, he regrets wasting \[insert exact amount of money here\] on my degree. For reference, I got a First.

\- I've turned down job offers in London because they've told me to.

\- Anytime I say they've hurt my feelings they either laugh or say 'Well, why don't you think about how *we* feel?' Like, on the one hand I feel like that's a valid response, but also please take the fact that I'm feeling shitty into account too.

This is what I can remember off the top of my head. If you need more context I'm happy to give it, within reason ofc.

I love my parents, but I'm so confused as to what to do. Am I actually being a spoilt brat? I think there must be something to that if they keep saying it so much. Thank you very much for reading all this, I would really appreciate a third party's input and advice as to what my next steps should be.",01Aug2018,1

It’s just that I’ve tried to be nice,friendly, confident with everyone at school and it hasn’t gone anywhere.

My parents just suck because all they do is argue with each other in front of me and my siblings over the dumbest things and it’s been said that they supposedly stay together for us(me and my siblings) but I think it would be better if they had divorced.

im 15. 

Recently I became uninterested in everything I've ever liked which was terrible, although yesterday I started learning the piano and I'm enjoying that.

My relationship with my parents and siblings is shit and I can't swallow my pride and fix it.

I'm not inheritly kind. 


Everything sucks. I don't get good grades, all my friends hate me, my famillial relationships suck.

I've lost interest in everything I used to be good at. 

I just want to start over. Or be someone else.

I've never felt this way. I feel like an outsider in my own body. I see every thought and feeling I have and it just makes me think ""I hate you so much. I wish I wasn't you"".

41,"My passion is superconductivity and goal in life is to bring about the discovery and production of bulk room temperature superconductivity (I know I know but trust me, science is really close despite 30 years stagnation).  I am attempting to start a company selling superconductors, superconducting powders, and educational kits in order to fund my research and hopefully a decent life for myself. I plan on starting with educational kits and grow from there. In the lab I work in, we use these pretty regularly in physics lectures, but superconductors are brittle. The company formerly selling them seems to have stopped or gone under and we learned there are not any other suppliers in the US. I consider myself a very knowledgeable expert and can make our needed superconductors better than the original company. My issue though, is that I do not have a Ph.D. or even a masters degree, only a BSE in Material Science and Engineering. I am afraid no one will take me seriously, or give me the time of day. Every expert I have talked to who could potentially buy or use my products has shut the door on me (figuratively). Besides educational kits, I feel like I will never sell anything in this field. 

Am I wasting my time on this dream? 

It is also really difficult for me to save money to obtain start-up costs. Taking a loan is a bad idea because the market size is so small, and I barely save $200 a month if I never leave my apartment or eat out once. Thankfully, my grandparents gifted me $5000 to get started. I didn't even ask, as I never ask for anything. As great of a head start, this is towards my goal, I'm still a long ways to go before being able to get started. 

Every start-up incubator or entrepreneurial clinic has never returned my emails about help to get started. I still save my pennies and will try anyway, but is there anything I could do that I haven't thought of?

Any advice would help. I don't want to go to grad school because of the outrageous expense and debt I would accrue only to simply start a company like this after I graduated. 

Thanks, Reddit.  I need some encouragement and advice right now.

42,"I don't know if you can help me, but please steer me in the right direction to seek help.

I moved away from my home town for grad school in 2012. We are in 2018 now. Yup, 6 years have gone by. I was in my last year of grad school when I was arrested (falsely accused) by my (current wife) of a crime (1st degree felony). Plead no contest and am on deferred adjudication until December 2021. I was kicked out of grad school. No way to get back in (trust me, had two lawyers). I go to probation monthly now and it has me depressed. My wife cheated on me back then which made things even worse. She's supportive now but since I already plead there's nothing I can do about it (no, nobody wants to drop charges, that's just how crooked this system is). So now I am trying to support her, my child, and my older parents and put on this poker face like everything is okay. When I close my eyes I'm terrified at the fact that I am now a ""criminal."" That I am labeled by society. I was told that I'd be able to file what's called a motion for nondisclosure so that at least I wouldn't have a hard time job hunting or apartment hunting in the future once this case get's dismissed, but now I just figured out since it's classified as a ""3g"" crime that I am not eligible for a motion for nondisclosure despite the fact my case will be dismissed. Now, and forever, people will see the arrest when I apply for the job. Not only is it difficult already, but to have to keep trying to explain something that I did not do is extremely tormenting to my mind. It's a devil to my life. I have become extremely depressed (have had suicidal thoughts, sometimes, although I'd never act because I'm too damn religious to do so). I also have severe anxiety levels and health anxiety/depression. 24/7 I feel like I am having a heart attack and dying due to the stress and have been admitted into the ER about 6 times this year.

Now, I am broke, jobless, owe 170k plus 8% annual interest in student loans, have no degree to show for, and have the LOWEST of the LOW credit. My life is a disaster.

There is only two things that I have in my life right now, my God, and my family. Other than that, I'm hopeless.

What I do have going for me currently:

Got certified as a personal trainer back in December (haven't ever worked in the field though; currently on my own weight loss journey), and will graduate with a bachelors in accounting next summer. (Going to have a hard time with the field of accounting too, but I said, F it, I'd rather have a hard time with a degree than without.)

Reddit, what do I do? If not, where do I go for help? Maybe this was meant to happen and God was trying to teach me a lesson about life. I do not know why. All I know is that after I concluded my prayer, my next obligation was to find out some life advice or if not, at least where to go to get help and fix my life before it's too late.

44,"Hi everyone! I hope this isn’t too long for you guys, but I just want to rant somewhere that no one I really know will see, and maybe catch some advice. I’m 18, just graduated and I’m headed to college in a couple of weeks. This summer has really really sucked for me. My dad died in a tragic boating accident about two months ago in June. My older brother has always been a POS  (lying, stealing everything we have, taking money, screaming at my parents and my sister and I) but since my dad died it’s like he thinks he can treat my mom like crap even more. He’s very aggressive and violent (keep in mind he’s 23 and my mom doesn’t HAVE to house him, she chooses to because he’s her son). Yesterday midday we all got into a HUGE altercation. He lives in the basement, where all of my dad’s belongings are, because he had just moved back in when he died. My mom was extremely upset because all of my dad’s things were thrown around, ripped, basically ruined, and the whole basement is just disgusting because he can’t clean or do anything correctly. My mom proceeded to yell at him, as mothers do, for ruining everything always. He screamed at her saying horrible things about my dead dad, which caused me to come downstairs and see my mom throwing things into bags. No family who lost someone should have to get rid of the decedents belongings in these circumstances. This all escalated when my sister came downstairs and also began yelling. My brother got really close to her so she shoved him a little and he proceeded to grab her and shove her on the ground. He then was pulling and grabbing my mom yelling about her taking “his stuff”. He threw my sister on the floor about three times and told her he would “break her face and her ribs” if she didn’t stop touching her stuff. He shoved me a couple times. I know my mom would be even more mad if I had called the cops, so I didn’t. Thankfully he’s supposedly moving out tomorrow but I know it won’t last long. It never does.
Am I a horrible person for wishing it was him instead of my dad sometimes?
I feel so guilty about it but I can’t help from thinking it. If it happens again, is it appropriate to call the police?

45,"I'd like advice right now if anyone is active in this hour to at least try to make me feel well

Basically I woke up randomly exactly 3am. Went to take a piss and drink a glass of water and couldn't sleep again. Being superstitions of the 3am myth I closed the bedroom door that is usually left wide open since it's too hot.

I checked the clock sometimes and it was always with a 3 in the minute section (3:03, 3:13, 3:32 it went 33 immediately after I unlocked it and most recently 3:43). In those 45 minutes I heard some very silent muffled noises but chalked it up to paranoia.

At around 3:45 I went downstairs again to drink a glass of water and found the door left ajar with our house cat just laying in our stairs. Creeped out I woke up my dad and he sorta checked downstairs while I checked upstairs (It's a small house even though it's 2 stories high so not much room for hiding). When I locked the door it was easier to lock making me think that dad tried locking it thought he did but left the door at a state were it could easily be pushed forward a bit and it'll open (It's an wodden door btw).

It's 4:06 as I'm writing this. I can't sleep and am kinda afraid to (reason to that below)  Calling the police seems to be out of option because dad just went to sleep and didn't give it much thought.

47,"I'm a guy (35), she's a girl (30). We met over a year ago, had instant chemistry. We would text back and forth, met for a few drinks, I started to like her a lot, until she told me I was misreading her flirtations and that she only wanted to be friends. It was a little tough, but I moved her into friend zone, (which wasn't that different from where we were before, except I stopped texting and asking her out as much). Not too long after we had a falling out. I was being playfully antagonistic by sending her songs without ""context"" and she didn't think it was funny at all.   


Six or seven months later she reaches out saying it was a misunderstanding and she wanted to meet for ""real talk."" Told me she wanted to clear the air cause she was moving into my neck of the woods and we'd likely run into each other, that we both do the same line of work (how we met) and that we had chemistry which counted for something. She confessed that she thought I was trying to get into her pants (which I wasn't) but I confessed I had been looking at her as serious girlfriend material. So we agreed to be friends. Now it's been six months since that ""reunion"" and I don't feel like we're friends at all. I would call us acquaintances.   


I've tried to be a friend, helping her move, asked her out a few times for drinks, invited her to go see a museum exhibit with me, shoot her a funny text from time to time, try to crack jokes -- and it's like I'm hit with a wall. She responds with the telltale signs that she's just not interested. Takes forever to respond to texts, if at all. When we are together she doesn't really ask questions or show an interest in me, I'm the one who has to keep the conversations alive. Despite this we've gone out a few times and I thought we were making progress, and she says she wants to be friends with me. But I just get the really strong vibe that I annoy her and I don't usually feel good after we actually do have an interaction.   


Recently she accused me of being emotionally blocked, and using humor to hide my true feelings. I told her that I caught myself trying to both impress and un-impress her because I feel like she could take it or leave it with me. But I think she has some serious emotional blockages herself. I didn't say this to her, I just absorbed her blows. She said she was lonely, sad, and weighted. Meanwhile, I feel lucky that I've got friends, and I don't feel lonely, nor do I feel sad. So even though she's been accusing me of being emotionally weird, I think she's not reflecting on her own actions. She has friends and I want to be her friend, but it's just so hard.   


At this point the original title of this post was going to be ""how to break up with a friend?"" Should I tell her any of this, or is it best to let it all silently float away and stop contact? Or do I have the wrong idea of what friendship means between men and women, and what it really should look like? Should I ask her what she wants the friendship to look like? I feel like a lot of this will only make it worse. I don't know what to do, cause everything I'm doing seems to push her further away. Oh and she doesn't talk on the phone, only via text or in person. Which means things take a long time.

61,"Hey everyone, I need some help. So a few months ago, out of the blue, I came home from my university (I'm 21 and attending school in a different state) and was surprised to hear that my dad, a lifelong smoker, had recently quit. I was so happy for him and proud of him. He has been badly addicted many times and tried to quit just as many, but it's never worked for him, so when I thought he had finally done it, I was overjoyed. But I just found out after coming home for the summer that he's been lying about quitting. He has a lot of health issues too, so quitting really means a lot for his health. And certainly, even if he's lying, it's gotten a lot better; he used to step outside every few minutes for a smoke break. But he's never really fooled me when he's pretended to quit, which he has already done once before. That was probably six or seven years ago, and I caught him smoking and told my mom about it. He was furious with me and for several days called me a rat, even changing my facebook profile picture to a picture of a rat. But that's only him at his worst. I absolutely love my dad. Growing up, he was basically my best friend and has been my greatest mentor and inspiration. And now I don't know what to do. I don't want his health problems to get worse because he's been sneaking smokes on the side, and it hurts that he's lying to me, my brother, and my mom. Even when I just suspected he hadn't really quit, I told him how proud I was that he had quit smoking and he just thanked me. Now I don't know what to do. I found out that he's been smoking again because I can smell it on him sometimes when he comes home (it's a very very hard smell to hide) and I went into the garage and found an ashtray that's still filled with cigarette butts. I don't want to tell my mom because he might get really angry with me again, and I wouldn't want my ""ratting him out"" to make him go back to smoking as much as he used to, because it really has gotten better. I'm afraid about talking to him about it because he might just accuse me of being a liar and tell me that the cigarette butts in the garage are old, but I know he's been smoking just from the smell. Even my brother agreed that he could smell that my dad had been smoking sometimes. Is there anything I can do that won't hurt my family or cause my dad to lapse back into his old ways? I thought about writing a letter to him and leaving it for him when I go back to school, but that's still almost a month away. Anyway, thanks for the help, I really appreciate it. ",01Aug2018,1

63,I've been an average student.  My grades sucked through most of my school career till High School when I found I could take online classes.  I quickly saw the massive disparity in my grades between online classes and regular classes.  Where in a classroom I would get 50 to 70 percent online I was getting 70 to 90 percent with each semester me coming out with 80s to 90s.  Right now I live at home and have been working for the past year.  This was supposed to be my gap year but I didn't sign up for any colleges or programs so I have nothing going on this year either.  I'm honestly just terrified to return to classrooms especally ones that have been hyped up to being the supposed hardest classes I will take as a student. I'm also not very well off and the prospect of going to school and coming out with a lot debt scares me.  I've thought about maybe doing online courses but I don't know if it's even worth doing,01Aug2018,4
64,"Reading my only other post will help give better context, but isn't needed.

About 8 months ago I cut off a friend because he was acting extremely narcissistic. Lately I've been feeling guilt about this, especially because he even kind of asked on another platform after I had blocked him on one, something like ""maybe I can fix it"" I can't remember but it was something along those lines. At the time I just told him that was that and blocked him on almost everything else I could think of.

I have no idea why I felt so aggressive at the time, lately I feel like a real asshole not even trying to talk or work things out first. The guilt has struck me hard recently.

Only today I even considered this, should I apologize to him? I don't want to make even more of an ass of myself. As selfish as it is, I just really want this guilt lifted because I know how much of a dick I was. And if I shouldn't, how should I go about moving past this?

65,"Sorry, this is going to be long. I don't know a better/shorter way to express it.

I should start off by saying I'm only 19 and I know I shouldn't know for sure what I want, but I don't even have a clue and only have about 2 weeks to make a fairly major decision. I've also been diagnosed with depression and have gotten within seconds of ending my life over these thoughts multiple times and I'm afraid of what will happen to me if I choose wrong.

I've never really had a chance to come up with dreams for my future. I only really started making decisions for myself when I was 15. Before that I always just went along with everything. Any time someone told me ""You'd be a good \_\_\_\_\_ when you get older"" I'd just say that that was my dream for the future up until someone else told me something different. Any attempt to branch out and make an opinion of my own about anything was punished and it wasn't until I was 15 that I started realizing things shouldn't be that way and I wanted to exit on my own. Even then though I was always just going with the flow I think because looking back now I've realized I still never really thought too intensely about what I wanted. It was only what I knew I *could* do on my own. I graduated high school a year early just to prove to people I was smart enough to do it, but i was still left feeling like the idiot in everything.

I ended up deciding my dream was to become an engineer because I am really good at maths and sciences, but I've started realizing I don't actually particularly *love* engineering. I like it, but not enough to feel like I can continue to like it as a job. In my first year of uni my depression intensified to the point that I barely did any of my work properly and just stayed in bed all day most days. My friends did what they could, but they could only help so much. I ended up climbing halfway out a window on the third floor before realizing what I was doing and stopping myself. When I got the letter saying I was suspended was the first time I felt any kind of weight off of my shoulders since as far back as I can remember.

My mother refused to allow me to take that as a sign to take a break and forced me to take classes at a community college until I could get an associates then I would have to go back. In that time I moved out of my parents house permanently and more recently I've gotten a full time job, but I don't have enough saved up for anything (I'm only about to get my second paycheck next week). I'm working as a housekeeper and most people keep telling me the job is beneath me and I should obviously work on getting my engineering degree to get out of there, but I actually enjoy it. I enjoy my coworkers and all of the alone time it gives me to think. I enjoy dragging myself home sore and exhausted everyday. For once I actually feel like I'm making some kind of progress and I haven't had a day where my depression has stopped me from even being able to get out of bed since I started. Until recently anyway.

I just finished my last course at the community college. So far my mother has still been covering all of the expenses I haven't been able to cover on my own and paid for most of my college and books. The problem is I now have 2 weeks left to submit my transfer papers to go back to uni. If I go back I know I wont be able to keep up with both work and a full set of classes. I don't even think I want to go back to uni. If I don't go back though I'm afraid of what my family might do. I know financially I'll be fine with this job, but I'll most likely become trapped in it and even if I do one day want to get a ""better"" job I won't be able to. I've never been close with my family, but I don't want to have them turn on me either. I already know they don't approve of my thinking about not going back, but before I started and when I got suspended my they acted like it was too obvious that I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't want to prove them right and get trapped in a job I'll regret, but I also don't want to stay just out of spite and risk losing the only thing that's made me feel like I was getting better either.

I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid of the consequences.",01Aug2018,1

I'm a single guy, not tied to anyone or anyplace. I also work remotely (freelance writer), which makes this a whole lot easier.

My options in and around LA start at $2000 (and that's generous). To give you an idea of what I'm working with... In a good month, I make around $4000. In a bad month, I make around $2500. I haven't been freelancing for very long though, so I'm expecting my income to get better.

Study for standardized tests 4.) Play sports with group of 2 friends every other day.  The problem is, despite working really hard, I look everyday at social media and see my friends who don't work jobs or work out as much having tons of fun with girls and other people at the park or parties. I tried deleting social media but then I felt like I was missing out and I get depressed every time I realize how lonely my life is. I go to a single sex school so it just feels like I blew my summer vacation doing the same thing I do during the academic semester instead of meeting girls and it makes me feel socially inept compared to my peers. While I was never invited to begin with, my inability to engage in these social gatherings limits me in the future simply due to underexposure.

If these lives were taken (Lynchings/Slavery/Homophobia/Genocide), and were ANHILATED (not ""sent to judgement"", the best thing we could do for the victims is to make sure these events NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

83,"My best friend just told me that her and my brother had sex and that she is unsure if she has feelings for him.

I am currently going into my second year of University and my brother and I live together in a farmhouse away from our parents for the summer. My friend who I’ll call “Jade” has been visiting lots this summer and her and I have always been close but this summer has only somehow allowed us to become closer. She introduced me to smoking weed and I have loved it and we started smoking it a couple times a week together and she would stay the night in an extra room in the house.

One night my younger brother who is going into his senior year of high school joined us and we all had a blast. My brother and I have always had a rocky relationship but it has gotten better in the past year as we’ve had distance between us and time to grow up. My brother is a nice guy but he has a reputation for getting around our small town sexually and he loves to party. 

Most nights when I would smoke weed I would go to bed shortly after I felt high as I would have to work the next day and I need lots of sleep if I want to function the next day. I didn’t think anything of leaving the two of them alone everytime I invited her up to hang out, but Jade just confessed to me tonight that she slept with my brother one night when I went to sleep.

Jade said the following to me during a car ride tonight:
- My brother has been flirting with her constantly and will not stop calling her beautiful and “such a nice person”, etc. but has never outright declared his feelings for her.
- She originally told me that she kissed him and was I could tell that she wasn’t telling me the entire story as she wasn’t making much sense and it seemed like she was skipping parts of a story and telling me bits and pieces. We talked about it and I told her that I felt weird about it but that she’s an adult and I can’t tell her what to do or be upset with her because that isn’t my place.

I need to clarify that Jade and I have a very different relationship compared to my relationships with my other friends. We talk about deeper subjects than I do with anyone else and we connect on a level that I don’t with anyone else and we’re both very open about this with one another and we constantly express how much respect we have for one another and how much we love one another in a sibling kind of way. We’re both very openminded and try to be accepting of as much as possible and I trust her more than anybody else. (She’s one of the only people I can talk openly with about my sexuality and how I’m a closeted gay living in a small town) 

Jade also said:

- She has been texting my brother lots but says that it’s only about weed and stuff like that. 
- After we got back to the house we talked for another hour or so about them kissing and then I asked “Well did anything else happen?” and her face kind of scrunched up and she leaned back in her seat and then she said that they also had sex one night in a field near the house... 
- She kept on repeating how sorry she was but then would also say things like “I don’t even regret having sex with him” and “I mean it really isn’t your business who I have sex with but I wanted to tell you anyway”

Jade also told me that my brother told hos friends that he had sex with her and in a small town the word travels fast and Jade’s brother found out and she has been seeking advice from other people for a couple of weeks and she just told me tonight after saying that she owed it to him to try and figure things out with him first. We talked about how our trust will need to be rebuilt and she kept on saying how ashamed she was but would also say that she didn’t regret it?

I agreed with a lot of what she said but I do know that she has remorse of some sort but am I allowed to be upset? I don’t know how I should approach the situation from here....

I went on vacation for a week in mid June and came back to see some of my makeup that I left at home had been opened and some of it missing. My 13 year old step sister is notorious for taking my things (especially makeup) and nearly destroying it or using it all. So I looked in her room and found my missing item in her drawer. I didn’t say anything to my parents as this has happened countless times and nothing ever changes. I wrote a note and taped it to my makeup bag that I leave at home that said not to touch my makeup unless whoever is using it is going to pay me back for what they use. To be honest I said “don’t touch my fucking makeup unless you’re buying me more hoe!” I was pissed off and thought it was funny so I left it there for a few days. A few days later, my dad calls me asking if I called my step sister a hoe. I was like no? I left a note in my bedroom telling whoever was digging in my things to stop. He told me she was in there just “looking” at my makeup. Okay. Whatever. Anyway, that was like a week or two ago. Today, he comes into my bedroom and asks me to apologize to her for my harsh language because now she is “scared” of me. I refused. I’m not going to apologize for shit because she has not even been punished for using my things (or reimbursed me for the makeup she used like my parents said she would) and I have nothing to be sorry for. My parents got into a huge fight and dad told me that my makeup was just pointless “shit” that could be replaced. It can, but I pay for that makeup and my boyfriend has bought me things as gifts and I don’t think she should get away with using my things. I was so mad I left to stay at my boyfriend’s. Am I in the wrong? I get she’s still a kid but she has been told so many times not to use my makeup or go into my room in general. She even stepped on my laptop and cracked the screen a few years back while digging in my room. I feel as though they are letting this behavior slide and if I don’t be mean about it, it won’t stop.

87,"For those of you willing to read a long post, thank you!


My boyfriend and I are in our early 20’s and moved into a new apartment complex a couple months ago. Not long after, we met an older neighbor (60s?) who would strike up conversations in passing. We’ll call him Mike. In our second conversation ever with Mike he told us he was divorced, estranged from his children, suffering from cancer, and living alone. The only family he has in the area is a brother. He seemed like a kind, talkative man who was just lonely and looking to make friends, so we have always been polite. 


One day Mike asked us for our phone numbers so we could get together for dinner sometime. Knowing he needed some company, we gladly gave him our numbers, and he immediately started texting my boyfriend everyday. Sometimes just saying hi or asking how we were doing, and sometimes it was extremely personal stuff. Since we have not actually been able to get to know this man well, the personal stuff always weirds my boyfriend out a little. If my boyfriend didn’t respond quickly enough, Mike would call to make sure he had gotten the text. It quickly became clear that he was very lonely, so my boyfriend and I made it a point to schedule time for dinners with him. However, every time the day came around, Mike would call us to say he was very sick, sometimes having to make trips to the hospital (cancer related), and couldn’t do dinner, so we would reschedule. 


The last time Mike said he was sick, I baked cookies and had my boyfriend take them over to his apartment. He invited my boyfriend in and talked his ear off about how he is a successful, published author. My boyfriend looked up the books and found a couple overly Christian books and a couple books on tips to becoming a published author, all free books on Amazon. None of which are anything worth bragging about. Mike also asked if we would consider becoming his caretakers, and says we could just come over a few times a week to clean but we’d receive a full-time job’s payment. (We’re both full time professionals with 2 dogs, and it doesn’t seem like something we’d be able to do.) At this point, my boyfriend has spent enough one-on-one time with Mike and feels he over exaggerates his stories, and overall, Mike makes him feel uncomfortable. But we still want to be nice to him, as it seems he needs friends. 


The night before last, Mike asked my boyfriend to come over because he had stuff to give us. It was just old food from his pantry that we didn’t need. He then told my boyfriend that he had tried to commit suicide this past weekend but the police had shown up just in time. He said it so plainly, so my boyfriend tried his best to talk to him about it.


Last night my boyfriend texted to ask how he was doing and he replied that he was on his way to the emergency room because there’s “BLOOD IN MY URINE!” Again, this is a bit personal and we don’t really know how to respond. 


This relationship we have with Mike is just becoming something we do not know how to navigate. My boyfriend and I work from around 8 AM-6 PM Monday-Friday and are out of town most weekends visiting family who live in the next city over. I’m not exaggerating when I say we’re almost never home.

I'm sorry for the longish post.

We've been together for almost a year now. During some of his ""episodes"" he's broken up with me, just to come back a few hours/days later. 

He refuses to get therapy. He says he's been to wards before and HATED them entirely, says he's never going back. I've mentioned something less intense, like a psychologist, but he doesn't think he needs help of any kind. 

He doesn't cry, hasn't done so in 6 years. Says if you cry you're not a real man. Hides his feelings. Has anger issues. Ignores his sadness. When serious things happen, he doesn't even acknowledge them, just tries to forget about them.

He's only 18 and already talking about how he doesn't have any plans for the future, how he won't continue going to college, how he's a complete failure and won't be able to provide for a family, which is why he said he wanted to break up with me again.

91,"My dad and I have had a complicated relationship, And I'm going through a personal process of going over things with some of my family members, expressing how I feel to them and bringing a lot of things to the surface. I've talked with my dad in the past about this, but I want to reaffirm myself to him as part of my process and to better our relationship, I also don't want to hurt his feelings. My dad and I had been apart for a long time before we reunited in 2012, I had a lot of pent up anger towards him and didn't want to interact with him, and I looked down on him for things he did and how he had acted in the past. This poisoned me, I didn't know how much damage I was doing to myself, or to him, I didn't care, I was too angry to realize. I went through something really tough and my dad did his best to help me, he was basically the only person by my side, and still is. I want to repay him for what he did for me, and all the things he did for me before that. But first I need to put to rest these things that I still have between me and him.   


What happened is that my dad left to work out of the country, and at some point became involved in a drug operation, he was arrested and spent 5 years in prison and prison rehabilitation programs. I found out about a lot of things about my dad and my mom and their relationship on a single day and after digesting the shock I became very angry and resented towards my parents, it only got worse with time and everything that happened after, and before that I already was pretty resented towards the two of them, most of what I knew of my dad was through my mom, and she didn't like him. After I moved with my dad I learned things from his side, and as I was already used to, turns out things were pretty different from other points of view. I still couldn't excuse or forgive the things he did, so I didn't. Since I've recovered somewhat, I want to talk with him in a father daughter context, without him feeling like my caretaker or responsible for me in any way. I do live in his place and we spend a decent a mount of time together, but I want him to feel like he can say and do anything without feeling responsible for my well being or my feelings. I'm still  angry at him hiding things from me and not being honest with me, and I'm also angry at seeing myself living with him and depending on him for anything, but I don't see that as his problem, I do want to make it clear to him. I was never able to tell him those things without being defensive. I feel like he doesn't tell me things because he thinks I can't handle them, and he told me that I wasn't gonna be able to follow through with school, so I know that he thinks I'm unreliable and incapable of handling anything.   


How do I get him to tell me the truth about how he feels about me without trying to make me feel good? ",01Aug2018,2
92,"Is it normal to hate the sound of someone's voice, if that person has caused you a lot of pain in life.

I was raised by a very abusive human being; and to this day, when I hear the sound of his voice, it sends me in a panic, and makes me feel physically sick.  It literally sends cringy shivers down my spine.  

Does anyone have experience with this?  Is there a way to heal from this so the sound no longer causes a reaction?  And, you can move on with your life without feeling like you're going to vomit at the sound of this person's voice?

93,"My sister and I do not get along for the most part. I’m almost 25 and she is 19 so we are getting to the age where I’m realizing it’s not just a teenage girl drama thing but actual fundamental differences in our personalities. Tonight we had another blow out fight because she refuses to lend me her car tomorrow so I can go to work. My car is being worked on. She is currently unemployed and on a typical day, she hangs out at home all day watching tv (not using the car at all). The only place she might decide to go is less than a 5 minute drive away and she has alternate ways to get there other than driving herself. To put this even more into perspective, she hates driving and won’t go on the highway, so her dropping me off at work is out of the question because she would have to take the highway to get there. 

I have been driving her 2x a week to summer classes on my way to work and picking up groceries/prescriptions/whatever she texts me for on the way home. When I asked her to borrow her car she started screaming saying she only has 3 weeks left until she has to go back to college and because she doesn’t get to bring the car to college, she says that she “never gets to drive it.” 

She is NOT a rational person and is extremely stubborn so trying to talk her out of it is not going to happen. Our mom is telling her to lend me the car (our parents pay for the car) but she won’t listen because she’s extremely defiant. Even if I end up taking the car and she gives in, I need to somehow get across the point of how upset this makes me and how selfish I feel she is being. It bothers me that I am always willing to help her when she needs it but she won’t help me out. 

My blood is boiling typing this.. please help with anything you can.  ",01Aug2018,1
94,"Young 20-something here.


Some time around late September 2016, I was interviewed for a room rental by my current landords. Things seemed to go well. The questions seemed general. One thing I found interesting is that landlord_1 stated that if they feel there is a reasonable risk present in the house that they may surreptitiously record in the house. From what I gather is that by signing and agreeing to rent that I consented to this condition. (This will be material later on.) Anyway, nothing so far seemed out of the ordinary. I paid and later signed a month-to-month agreement. If I recall correctly, I signed with landlord_2 that made no comment about the recording consent. I move in to the room/house sometime around early October 2016.


As I become accustomed to the new place, I begin to learn about people in the houses. Landlord_2 is a professional mental health expert and Landlord_1 runs a corporation out of the house. I also come to learn that landlord_1 has had a few felonies related to their past, but, this is of no issue to me as I believe I have worked with and around felons and see no issue with them much like everyone else.


An event unfolded regarding landlord_1 and his brother. I went to see how landlord_1 was doing in their office and found landlord_1 and their brother in the office. It looked like they were drinking alcohol. Landlord_1's brother seemed adamant that I come and drink with them. I declined nicely (from my perspective.) Landlord_1 said (paraphrase): ""*brother*, I don't think *tenant* wants to drink"". Landlord_1's brother stated (paraphrasing): ""Oh, I think he is going to!"" If I recall correctly, I walked away without issue.


Over the course of several months (crossing over even to the New Year,) there was some family drama between landlord_1 and his brother. Involved a friend of landlord_1. Sounds like the brother of landlord_1 broke into the landlords business office (the landlord operates a corporation out of their office,) and stole some compromising documents about the brother (possibly evidence of illegal behaviour), according to the landlord. This break-in evolved into the brother leaving (although the brother seemed to leave on their own terms) and nothing to the best of my knowledge came about concerning any legal problems. The friend of the landlord (what was living in the house at the time) also seemed to have a falling out with the landlord and left the house (forced out or left on their own, I can't recall.) After that, the house seemed to become quite and peaceful.


Sometime during the month of (March? 2017?) landlord_1 stated that the router reported a [""FIN Attack""](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/60csuz/local_network_attacked_admin_said_it_was_my/) or something to that effect. The router (according to my landlord) said that the attack originated from my computer. I don't recall every launching any program to 'attack' any network or network-device. I did, however, tell the landlord (paraphrasing here) that I found that odd and that I had a Linux computer and that I did not need an anti-virus program to protect my computer. The landlord looked at me weird and then (from what I gather) thought that I attacked the network. Reminder: this is a corporate network. The landlord then supposedly found an [Stack Overflow](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/81486/fin-attack-what-is-this-type-of-attack-really#81488) post that showed that a version of Linux was vulnerable to theses attacks and that (paraphrasing) I was responsible for violating their privacy and possibly hacking.  They stated that if I don't install an anti-virus program on my computer that they will take me off the network. So, I installed ClamTk to my Linux computer. I informed the landlord. However; they did not come check my computer to verify. Over time, the landlord refereed to the incident to some effect as something akin to a 'mistake' or 'misunderstanding' and, (from what I can tell,) may have reminded me at one point that they saved me from the legal system. I found the whole situation weird. Considering that, if I recall correctly, the vulnerability was patched before I ever started using Linux (2013? 2014?)


Over time, I began to pick up odd behaviours of landlord_1. They seemed to be constantly questioning me over trivial things like nights that I went out with landlord_1, possible their spouse, possible friends, and possible alone. Since recently, I have been developing a feeling that I am being surveilled every time I am around landlord_1. They continue to question me. In some cases, I feel like I am being drilled by police, but the police are nice and friendly. Questioned about situations and that if I can recall them correctly. I don't recall every detail about the last two years and I have a feeling that there may have been some slight changes to my memory that may have resulted in conflicting information. I have a feeling that landlord_1 is recording these possible contradictions. I can't really tell you what I have said specifically, nor can I tell you what verbal errors I have committed in the last two years.


Some time around (October/November?), 2017, landlord_1 was served papers related to a no-contact order hearing against landlord_1. This caused issues and anxiety with landlord_1 as they have a felonious record. I wasn't aware of the papers until later in the night that they informed me of the papers and then began to question me if I have ever spoken to police. I 'pleaded the 5th' and landlord_1 stated that I had no 5th right to refrain from answering the question. At some point during this (rant?) about the papers, landlord_1 (threatened?/stated?) that they would (paraphrase) 'subpoena my ass' if I didn't (tell them I ever talked to the cops?)(did not go with them to court?). I don't recall exactly. If I do recall correctly, landlord_1 may have been drinking alcohol. They may have made a passing reference to ('threatening') their attorney from a previous case over putting landlord_1's brother back on the stand over some possible perjury. That kind of startled me. I have not brought that point back up to landlord_1.


Sometime around (December?) 2017, landlord_1, landlord_2, and I went to (if I recall correctly,) Pizza Hut and it seemed that landlord_1 was having an anxiety episode (these seemed to be frequent.) They began to, again, question/drill me and may have stated that the comments I have made could be used in court. I don't recall exactly what was said, however, if I recall correctly, that I began to stop talking to landlord_1. (landlord_2, if I recall correctly, thanked me as the continuous talking may have contributed to landlord_1's anxiety.) I don't know what specifically triggered the anxiety episode.


It seems, as time goes on, that the behaviour of landlord_1 is, well...on edge. I have no reason to believe that landlord_1 is on any drugs (only have seen them consume alcoholic/caffeine beverages to the best of my knowledge.) I also feel like I am being implicated in something although to the best of my knowledge, I haven't committed any crimes. I feel like I am becoming on edge and anxious. Recently, at work, when it becomes busy, I feel a heightened sense of anxiety with an impending sense of doom. I feel like I am about to have my life thrown away in a jail cell, implicated on some crime that I never knew I committed. My mind begins to fantasize of courtroom hearings with my landlord laying random charges against me and me losing my life. I feel scared. If I recall correctly, landlord_1 mentioned something about ('files'?) related to everyone they have rented to. So, I don't know what's in my 'file'...if it even exists. Landlord_1 may have mentioned in the past that they are a member of the press and that anyone who wrongs 'them' (I am assuming both landlords' 1 and 2) that they can put up a website dedicated to whatever facts that they have against the offending individual. Apparently, it is neither libel nor slander.


Landlord_1 seems to possess a strong sense of justice and that any wrong perceived is seen as a massive slight against landlord_1. From my perspective, it seems like every time there is an issue that landlord_1 becomes fixated on said issue. Example: there was a tenant that, if I recall correctly, put in their last month's notice. According to landlord_1, this tenant may have changed their reason for leaving multiple times. One of those times, supposedly, was in front of me. landlord_1 asked this tenant why they were leaving. The tenant gave a response. (I forgot what it was.) Later some time, landlord_1 seemed to insist that (paraphrasing) I was a (victim?) of lying  and that what happened was egregious to landlord_1, landlord_2, and I. Looking back, honestly, I couldn't care less as whatever this tenant said does not affect me negatively in any material way that I can think of.

Landlord_1 has a policy of (paraphrasing) 'consistency is key.' In that, their behaviour is consistent to their best ability. It seems that way (except when landlord_1 has anxiety or may have consumed much alcohol.) While on the surface there may be some consistency, there are some discrepancies that I cannot seem to solve. For instance: I don't recall ever telling any of my landlords or any tenants of my porn consumption habits. Honesty, it is none of anyone business. Yet, if I recall correctly, landlord_1 made a passing reference to my porn consumption habits. Landlord_1 also made a passing reference to 4chan. I have visited 4chan before while renting, but I don't recall ever mentioning it to landlord_1, landlord_2, or any other tenant in the house. If I recall correctly, the 4chan incident is recent (this month: July 2018.) I don't know if my internet traffic is being monitored.


I don't know what to do. If I keep renting, then I feel like I am being drowned with a weight on my body, sinking. If I leave, then that will cause landlord_1 to begin (questioning?/interrogating?) me about why I am leaving. I feel that whatever answer I give will cause issues with landlord_1. I'm tired of feeling anxious over something that may or may not be an issue. I don't know why I feel anxious, but at the same time I get this sense of impending doom. I feel like I am walking on egg shells. I feel that I can't talk to landlord_1 without there being issues or feeling that I am being set-up/implicated in something. I also feel like I can't talk with landlord_2 about any concerns as well, as any concerns will be relayed to landlord_1 and possibly causing issues.


I just want a place to live and be left alone. I feel like I am being set-up, for God knows what. I can't think of anything that I have done wrong, but from talking with landlord_1, they seem to possess a vast knowledge of law. Using this knowledge may be instrumental against me if I ever do anything wrong. I have no intent of harming anyone. I want both my landlords to feel comfortable and happy that they are renting to me. They both are cool! It's just that, I feel there is something wrong and I can't put my finger on it. I hope that I am just imagining everything.

101,"I(20M) have a super intense crush on my best friend(17F). I absolutely hate it. No matter what part of her body I look at when I'm with her, I find myself being turned on. Adorable face, great hair, and her body shape in general is the dream shape for me. 

She has no interest in dating me, so that isn't a solution. She is strictly against that large of an age gap for romance, despite the fact that she is more mature than I am. I have asked her about dating me a few times specifically.

 I don't want to view her in this way anymore. I want to view her more like a sister rather than a romantic partner. It got to the point where I just got into a shitty, depressed mood when I found out that she had a crush on another guy. 

Is there any way that I can see her on a regular basis and not be attracted to her? Distracting myself with other girls is a difficult option, because I don't feel like I get attracted to any new girls that I meet. I'm not just going to leave her either.

104,"A bit of background. I was raised in a country where drug gangs are a big problem, so was always scared of anything drug related. As my education in  neuroscience progressed, I became aware that the dangers of it come mostly from the legislation rather than the drugs per se (talking about soft drugs here), but there's still that big stigma in my head about drugs being bad.  On the other hand, my bf (also neuroscience nerd and aware of the same) has what I would call an addictive personality (being a smoker, who has tried quitting several times with  no success). He had tried drugs before while in university but had gone several years without any kind of drugs (except tobacco) until last year. 

That's when we decided to have some recreational drugs together. We always did it in a safe way, testing our drugs and whatever. That happened a few times during the past year. It was my first time trying any sort of drugs. And I'm not going to lie, I liked the experience, after all we're sort of biologically 'designed' to enjoy it. Anyway, time passed and we were forced to start a long distance relationship. During this time, he has told me several times he had weed and shrooms (sometimes while home alone) and ecstasy in a couple of parties. 

He's been trying to grow some shrooms in his house since they're hard to get where he lives. I had no say on this, of course since Im not living there. But I only did not opposed to this but supported it because of the following reason: he has depression and there's a lot of evidence saying it might be good for it. So it was a 'let's see how it goes'. We're now thinking of moving together next month and he suggested we could grow some weed at home for personal use. I refused and he said that the good side is he wouldn't be giving money to drug dealers and it would be more controlled. That's true but then you have easy access to it as well. I'm scared he might get too deep into this stuff. What can I do? Should I also tell him to get rid of the shrooms and ruin that chance of him getting over his depression? Isn't it hypocritical to support him growing something and not another thing, which is actually not really harmful? I'm also under a visa so I want to avoid any sort of problems. Doubt it would lead to any problems, is not like police go knocking from door to door, but still, there's a risk right?

I am also thinking about the future and the fact that we might get married someday. I don't want to raise my kids with a drug user as a husband. He's an extraordinary man, I really love him and I don't want to leave him because of this, and I probably won't but I wouldn't want this to become an issue. 

I definitely don't think he has a problem now, but I'm afraid he could develop one, especially considering his background and also if I facilitate this in my own house. So how much is too much? How often would you say taking drugs is bad? When should I start worrying? Again, I'm aware a lot of these drugs don't really generate addiction (I guess only psychological) so am I overreacting given my upbringing?

106,"Okay my friend is in a really bad situation

So basically, I live in London and she lives in Manchester. I’m 16, she’s 15

So my friend, let’s her call her A. A’s mum kicked her out of the house because she a man over A. A then had nowhere to live as her dad was dealing with depression and bipolar disorder and was not in a state to look after A.

So A has to turn to her 16 year old boyfriend and live with him for a bit. We‘ll call her boyfriend M. 

So M’s family aren’t the best bunch. His brothers are in prison for acid attacks. His dad is prison for murder and his mum is just a crackhead. Now this is really bad for M but doesn’t warrant behaviour whatsoever in my book.

So A and M were together for a year and she loved him. He’d buy her literally whatever she wanted. Gucci,IPhones etc

Now it’s a bit strange for M to have a relationship with a 14 year old in the first place. And M hasn’t ever spoke to any other girls apart from A. Very strange.

So fast forward to now, A broke up with him 9 months ago for reasons she don’t want to say. M’s 17th birthday is a couple of days. M and A haven’t spoke since they’ve broken up. Then yesterday, guess who pops up,M.

M says “ Baby I miss you blah blah, I love you so much blah blah, give me a second chance “

M is also very protective of A eventhough they’re not in a relationship.   Recently, A was talking to a boy and when M found out, he went over to the boy and strangled him. So not the nicest guy.

A still loves him or so she thinks.

Now M took A’s virginity and did other other sexual acts which she didn’t want to do but gave consent because she loved him and he wanted to do it.

So A a few hours ago pops up to me asking for some advice. I say sure and then she tells me all  about M is trying to get back with her etc.

A told she wants to hate him but she can’t.

Now she tells me that M probably just popped up to her because it’s his bday and he knows he’ll get a raw shag out of her.

I said well don’t give him that shag and she goes well it makes everything worse and I’ll just cope with it.

She eventually starts crying and tells me the things he’s did etc and how M treated A like shit one time and then a princess the next time. This to me seems like a very aggressive breadcrumbing .

I’m saying this ain’t right, you don’t have to talk to him and she tells me that M has all her passwords,bank details etc.

Now I’m friend with a lot of gang members in London. Especially 9th street and 1011. So I said to her that I can get these people to have a chat with him, rough him up a little and tell him to leave her alone.

She goes now if you hurt him, he’ll end me, he will get someone to my house and kill her dogs ( she absolutely adores her dogs) and her.

I asked for a description of this M and all she said was Black,Black hair, Stubble, blind in one eye with a scar across it. Sounds bit like a villain if you ask me.

Now I don’t want to use violence but if this M is fucking with my friend then I will if needed.

A few mins later she goes off the call and texts saying that people are coming to her house even though it’s 4 am. I’m like um okay I’ll speak to you soon, Bell me.

She replies with oh I’m probably not going to be able to do that after this meeting, maybe in another year 

I reply with what do you mean

I keep asking and she keeps nevermind,don’t matter etc.

I’m telling her that the guy is using her as a sex doll and can just do what he wants to her.

And A is such a nice ,bubbly girl who’s very very good looking.

She’s changed and the last time I spoke to her was about an hour ago when she said don’t pop up, he’ll see it’s a boy and get mad.

Clearly she’s being manipulated and just being used and she’s just a young impressionable girl who got given loads of stuff and was there for her in her time of need

Of course M just used this as a way to take advantage of her.

I really don’t know what to do. Her dad won’t help her and neither will her mum.

I told her go to the police, I said I know snaking isn’t really right but I’m this situation it is.

She says no, I don’t want to go the police, too many questions and drama.

What should I do?

I just want to help me friend.

There are so many layers to my story there’s no way to it all....
Background info: I(16f)have lived with my mother my whole life up until February 2018 she was very abusive and cracked my head open and I finally did something. She was horrible alcoholic ect, moved in with dad, did a lot of moving, got sexually assaulted by him and immediately ran out the house and ran and ran for so long and got to a hospital after sitting down and calling for a ride or whatever got the rape kit done. I was put into foster care. The whole time I’ve been in foster care and the whole time I lived with my father I’ve had a boyfriend. Started dating him (20m) two months before I moved out of my moms. We have been having a rough patch this past month, and I just moved into his aunts where he lives a week ago while we were on a break. 
This is the part where I need no judgement... 
I was planning on never getting back together with him and I ended up hooking up with someone that I’m interested in (16m). We didn’t use protection , stupidly, I know. And he came in me. He didn’t tell me until a few days after so plan b was no longer an option and he’d assumed I was on birth control (?) I used to be but I didn’t have health insurance for a bit and didn’t go to the doctor yet to get it again at this point but have an appointment with my OB-GYN.  So, I still live with ex bf(20m) and his aunt, he doesn’t know I hooked up with someone else and he wanted to get back together, since I’m living here I felt an overwhelming feeling of guilt for living here and not being in a relationship with him. That would be too uncomfortable for me, but seeing as I JUST moved in not too long ago, I don’t wanna move out idk. I don’t know if I’m pregnant or not yet because it’s too soon to take a pregnancy and I haven’t missed my period yet because it hasn’t come. He doesn’t know I hooked up with someone else and the last thing I want to do is tell him because it would be unbearable to say that to him while living in the same house. This is long asf so imma leave it at this but any advice you could give me on anything at all after reading this please do I know I fucked up but I’m goin through some shit. I’m diagnosed with ptsd( grew from acute stress disorder) generalized anxiety order , panic disorder, ADHD, and a few other things since all this happened. Also spent two week or so in a inpatient treatment for mental health (an addiction cuz marijuana was in my system when I went to the hospital) idk I’m a mess I don’t know what to do anymore and my life in unmanageable as fuck with my own self at fault for some of it. Also, with the boy I hooked up with, I don’t know how I’d even tell him. He’s definitely not in a position to be a father or anything and I don’t see him being apart of the life of a child at this stage in his life, which I can’t blame him he is a 16yo teenage boy.. I kept rambling after I said I was done.  I’m sorry y’all last piece of info I can give that can maybe help is I have absolutely no family because they’re out of the country and my fathers side of the family is across the country and helping my father w his case with me ahhhhh ok I’m done ",01Aug2018,0
108,"I’m 21 and am currently separated from my husband of 2 years. We have known each other four years and at the start of the relationship I found things out about him I didn’t think much until now.
My husband now 24, I found out when he was 14-20 was touching his sister (7 years younger than him). His family also found out the same time I did and were going to press charges but didn’t due to the sister not wanting to.

Their father died of cancer leaving her with her only male figure her brother. I didn’t think much of this because I assumed he was still under 21 I could write it off as siblings playing “doctor.” I was falling for him and he seemed so remorseful. He wasn’t allowed to be alone with her anymore either so assumed it was nothing and longer a threat. 

As I relationship broke down he began to ignore me a lot. I brought this to his attention but he didn’t care. Through an unfortunate incident I was raped and told no one because at the time I was trying to meet new people and make friends. My husband stated if I got raped he’d be extremely angry with me because he’d be “right.” 

Six months after that happened I finally told him and I also told him I cheated on him with another man. In a fit of anger that night he raped me. I didn’t speak out for 7 months after this happened as well because he seemed really remorseful. He was still my husband and I loved him but, he started using my visa (I am currently on) as a tool to try and control me. 

He told me there was no chance in repairing our marriage we would have to get divorced. He began to record our conversations and take pictures and videos of arguments we had so he could feel “safe.” This is caused me not to tell any of my in laws or my friends (really the only friends I had in the country were his) or even reach out to therapy. 

We eventually went back to marriage counselling but couldn’t keep up properly due to finances. He said his therapist and friends said he should deport me even though I have been in the country 3 years and invested my life here. He wanted to ask the marriage counsellor her opinion if he should deport me so I was scared to keep reaching out to her. Fear he would try and manipulate the situation.

I was awaiting my permanent residency so I was scared to out to family, friends, lawyers and therapists. It was hard to admit to myself I would lose my husband who I thought I knew so well and loved me. For two years before this he ignored me and we had sex a total of 11 times in two years. I brought it to his attention many times I felt extremely unwanted and lonely in the country. He ignored this. 

When I was struggling with my first job in a foreign country and getting scrutinized at work constantly. He was extremely unsupported. I began self-harming to cope with a lot of these things throughout these last three years.

I was contemplating ending my life after recently being diagnosed with PTSD, my husband knew this. He then kicked me out of our home because only his name was on the deed and he didn’t want to pay to put my name on it. I didn’t have the funds at the time for this. He kicked me out on a court order and from his lawyers stating my mental health was effecting his. Directly in this order he states he fears that I suffer from anxiety and is afraid I’ll self-harm so I must leave the home.

I was left homeless in a foreign country with no support network and nowhere to go because his family sided with him. Parts of his family don’t know what he did to his sister either or to me. He says he still wants to help me with my visa if I sign his finical agreement so he can have all funds from selling our home together. 

In a letter he wrote to me two weeks before kicking me from my home he stated he was scared I was mentioning the rape (or as he calls “Impropriety”) to my therapist and one of his friends. I believe he kicked me out because he could no longer control and he was scared I would tell people what he did.

Days before he kicked me out he pretended everything was normal. He held me as I cried and I opened up to him about how I was scared of him. How I felt hopeless and alone and wanted to die. He said he loved me, he said he cared about me then when I got the call for the order he simply said “You have to go.” 

I recently found out he was possibly grooming his sister and manipulating me and threw me out when he felt he lost control of the situation. I’ve felt scared and trapped for months but some part of me really misses him horribly. We had a pretty sick relationship as well where he would have me relying him completely for all my necessities. When I tried to break away and do things my way to become an independent adult he would get upset I wasn’t doing it his way. So I got the jobs he wanted and did things the way he wanted them done.

He would always hold how much money he spent on me over my head. How he was giving me my future and opportunities and I wasn’t appreciative enough. When I’d bring up I left my family and country behind for him and our love, he would say “Well that was your choice.” 

My question is:
How much of how he treated his sister and sexually abused her may have affected how he treated me? 

I know this isn’t solely to blame on it but therapists and family have been bringing it to my attention that it greatly may have effected how badly he treated me. Which I can’t seem to make sense of because he now still even says he cares about me but it seems like he’s trying to keep my strung along as long as he can till he has everything he wants.

TL;DR

My husband (M24) had been touching his younger sister (16) since ages 14-20, how badly would this have affected his recent abuse towards me and if this would cause him to have extreme manipulative behaviour?

Lately between my jobs I’ve taken it upon myself to run errands via bicycle for friends in exchange for food and toiletries and such and it’s been working in my favor. It’s becoming such a staple in my everyday life that I’m curious as to how I can further this self made situation to benefit me into my own place? Rent here has skyrocketed and I can’t work more than 16 hours a day which I already do.

111,"So I have been living in Los Angeles for the last two summers and going to school in my home state that is 1500 miles away (I have one more year left). I met this girl last summer that I immediately fell for when I first met her. I could go on and on about why I think she is incredible but I’d rather just cut to the point of this post. 

We seemed to really click last summer and I felt like she possibly had feelings for me. She even randomly asked if I was dating anybody back home or not. Which I thought was interesting. And I caught her taking a Snapchat of me while I was looking away that she was sending to a friend. She didn’t know that I saw it happen. 

But I didn’t think it would be wise to try and start something since I was leaving soon for school and I didn’t know if I’d make it back to LA or not. We kept up communication through out the whole year and I was able to come back for the summer. But I when I came back, My friend told me she had a boyfriend. But she has never told me that and has never mentioned anything about a boyfriend. But she said things that would make me think she was single. She said, “I think I’m gonna be single for a long time”. And she even asked me again if I was still single. I’m so confused haha. My feelings are still strong for her and going the whole year without closure was eating me up. 

Now, I’m trying to decide if I should tell her how I feel. I want to respect her relationship with her boyfriend. And I don’t want to put her in an awkward situation. And I’m leaving for another year of school and don’t know where I’ll be next year. But I know another year of not telling her will kill me and I won’t try and meet a new girl back home. I don’t want to lose her friendship and I care about her a lot and don’t want to lose her. Because I know that if I tell her, the only good that will come of it is that I get it off my chest and I get somewhat of closure. But that’s all selfish. I don’t want to make things hard for her or awkward for her. I don’t know what to do. I would love any advice. ",01Aug2018,1
112,"I've been giving this a lot of thought and I can't figure out what to think or do, so maybe someone else's view will be of value here.

So, here's the thing:
I went to visit my family for around 10 days to another city. I have a cat so I needed someone to take care of her. This girl I've been having casual sex with for around 4 months leaves near my place so I asked her if I could leave her the key to my apartment so she could feed my cat and maybe spend some time with her, even stay there if she wanted. She agreed and stayed there with me the night before I left and apparently spent a lot of time there afterwards judging by her instagram stories. 

About her: 
She's my best friend's best friend. They've known each other since highschool (we are all 21 now) and met her this year. We started seeing each other and so around April or May and since we don't have that much chemistry other than sexually it hasn't gone much further than getting together every weekend or so, having some beer and weed and having sex. This has been talked about and agreed upon. 
For some reason I started questioning my trust in her a few days before leaving, mostly because my cat's one of the most important things to me and I started wondering if I was leaving her with the right person. I remember being with a friend and telling him I was having doubts because for some reason I was feeling an odd vibe from this girl and I didn't know why exactly. I always felt she was a really troubled person, she's always stressed about not having a job and I haven't really ever heard her say a nice thing about anyone, less than anything the other guys she has sex with. She's always talking shit about them and she can get generally a bit intense or exaggeratedly aggressive. 
There was this time in particular when were out all night and I had a lot of money with me for some reason and didn't spend all of it, but the next morning I found that I couldn't find what was left of it. I remember distrusting her for some reason, but since we were a bit drunk and I tend to lose stuff all the time I blamed it on myself. She's also a bit annoying when it comes to pay for stuff because she normally plays dumb so other people pay for her.
Other than that I have no reason to say that stealing is part of her usual behavior or anything like that (or I wouldn't see her anymore ofc).

The facts: 
I left some money at home on top of a bookshelf in case something happened to my cat and she had to run to the vet or something. I completely forgot to tell her about it. I came home a few days ago and we spent some time together that day. I told her about the money and how I forgot to tell her were it was (but did not go to check on it). She answered that she wouldn't have seen it and asked me if it was on the bookshelf (could be a coincidence since it is an obvious place to keep it). I went to look for the money the day after and noticed it was missing. Checked everywhere before panicking but no trace of it. I checked all movements and withdrawals on my bank account from the day I left and tried to remember very well every expense I made that morning in case I had used the money and still thought I left it at home (I remembered getting to the airport with no cash, so I would've had to spent 1000 ((not dollars)) before getting there and that is impossible). 

I havent told her about this, I just talked to her to ask her subtlety but she hasn't answered and honestly don't know how that conversation is gonna go. She claims no one else was in the house, but Im hoping she tells me the opposite now cause it'd hurt me a lot to know that she stole from me and having to tell her to fuck off. I talked to my best friend about it but she swears over and over that this girl would never do something like that (I really trust my friend). I still don't know what to do, I see two chances: a) she stole from me, b) someone she brought to the house did. 
In the meantime I have decided that either way I won't see her anymore, cause even if she didn't do it, the fact that I dont trust her at all after knowing her for this long is enough to tell me I don't want to keep this relationship. But still I don't know if I should confront her, cause I really feel like I need an answer to this. What do you think?",01Aug2018,1
114,"For a long while now, my depression and anger have been really bad. Bad to the point where I'm driving a wedge between me and him. Don't get me wrong, I'm not being abusive to him, but it's hurting him to always see me like that. I don't want to lose him because I love him more than anything. When we play video games, I get really worked up and angry and I don't know why. I've tried so hard to control it but it always gets the better of me. A side effect of me getting angry is getting really sad as I come down. So not only does he not enjoy our game time (we're long distance so it's how we hang out together) but I also bring him down with my sadness that comes after.

115,"Hi! So,  I'm a 24 year old guy, and I have recently been undergoing a lot of changes. I've lost 42 pounds so far, have updated my wardrobe to what I like and find stylish, have gained confidence, etc. I have never been with a woman, either romantically or sexually, and I have been told that being emotionally open or sensitive can help in finding relationships. I'm friendly, laid-back, positive, altruistic, and open. The problem is that I don't cry. It's not like I try not to, I just don't get emotional, even over family deaths. I grew up in poverty, had loads of hard times, including step-parental abuse as a child, homelessness, two brothers dying, four friends' deaths, and starvation, threats of death while working as an Corrections officer years ago, and all of these things hardened me. While watching sad movies or videos, I don't even feel a bit sad. When I listen to or read sad stories, or hear people's experiences, I only relate and can explain how I overcame them to help them, but I don't feel emotional.

I am having a really hard time with money and I can barely pay the tuition with the 50% off scholarship I got. Luckily I have a car for transportation, but the parking pass in the university is pretty expensive and I don't think I will be able to get it (also because I think all the passes have been sold already). 

I was thinking about walking there but the walk is about 25 to 35 minutes and I am not used to the exercise, then I thought I would have to walk this distance at least two times a day (which I understand is not so bad but I don't want to be sweaty every time I get there) and I don't know if I can endure this. Also what if there is bad weather or a storm or something and I'll have no choice but to run home.

I also thought of parking my car someplace close to the university. So I checked a map and the only parking spots nearby will end up being more expensive on the long run than paying the parking pass. 

Then I thought I could get a bike or something like that, but... 1. I never learned how to ride one 2. The road I take to the university has no bike lane and it can get dangerous without experience and 3. I would have to pay for one with money I don't have.

One of the girls always makes sure to jump on the new girl so that no body takes her away and befriends her right away by talking bad about others.

She has issues of her own and comes off rude, but is very young and her mother wasn't around to teach her certain things she is clearly lacking.

I've had my arguements with some of them but Im always the one to try to talk it out but they've already got me labled as the outcast.  Hence my lack of interest in doing things with these girls.

Based on the different components that play a fundamental role in college since I have ambitious goals such as making a different, being the leader of an important club and contributing to the community, among others. I know age doesn't reflect maturity, but it's a good indicator.
So, based on this and other complements... should I just go by 20 or 21? 
What would you do and why?

Thank you!!",01Aug2018,2

149,"***TO BE CLEAR;*** *I am* ***NOT*** *suicidal.* 

Apologies if this is not quite in the right subreddit; couldn't really find one that applied that well. While I believe my issues are very interconnected and somewhat difficult to understand without the full picture, I understand I'm unlikely to get any help if my post is pages long. As such I'm separating my situation and questions (*See* **TLDR***)* from the ""brief"" description of myself/overall problem. I've also included an *actually brief* description of myself/issue. If you know of a more suiting subreddit to get answer from, please redirect me.

&gt;***""Brief"" description of my history***; I'm a 24 year old male. I've been severely depressed (Suicidal as well) and lonely for 10 years now (Though there has been a hiatus here and there, explained below). I was home-schooled all my life by overprotective and emotionally abusive parents in the countryside of Kansas, with *LITERALLY* (I really can't stress that enough) my only social interaction being with people at the store and occasionally my grandparents. When I started going to a community college at 17 (Depression from isolation and lack of friends began 2 years prior), 90% of the students were adults of 35-50 years of age with families and full-time jobs (So not an option). This left a very small pool of potential friends, with all attempts at initiating a relationship (Platonic friendship) ending in rousing failures. After 3 years and approximately two dozen failures, I was ""adopted"" as a friend by a lesbian my own age. We took classes together and studied together constantly for 2 years, during which time she helped guide me and clear up some my misconceptions about how to interact (Was/am going exclusively off of TV and books. lol). Eventually I moved away to another state and the friendship I've had died. That was 3 years ago. Upon moving I started attending a four year ""party college"", where everyone was my own age. Things haven't gone well. After a few failures, I took a scientific approach towards trying to determine why I couldn't make friends. 2 years and 54 failures later, all I did was rule out a few things and come to the conclusion my ""problem"" is something nebulous that I can't ""diagnose"" and treat, like ""I rub people the wrong way"" or ""I feel. . . *off.*"". Eventually, and to my great amusement and pleasure, I was adopted by yet another lesbian (S) just under a year ago, only this time there was a significant age gap (she was 17, I was 23 at the time). We became study buddies and *kind of* friends. I kept to myself as much as possible in regards to communication and information, as to avoid losing her, only interacting when she initiated contact. After weeks, she eventually confided in me with some of her deep personal and mental problems, after which she asked about me. I opened up to her, first time I talked with anyone about everything, and admitted I'd been struggling with wanting to just kill myself out of hopelessness for my situation (I replied to her pointed questions. This wasn't a ""she asked: *How are you?* and I replied with: *I've been severely depressed my whole life and ache for the release of death""* type of thing). We spoke for hours about each others problems and did so on several other occasions (Only when she asked/offered). Later, after she had acquired a girl friend and thus was almost always preoccupied with her, I became especially depressed and began skipping assignments, classes, and preforming poorly (I'm an honor's student and my education is my life, so this sent red flags flying for her). She ""confronted"" me, after which I opened up to her (S) again and her girlfriend (M). Spoke with them for hours, during which I ended up becoming very close friends with her (S) girlfriend (M). We then spent time together, and I was very happy for several months. Later, however, and without cause (This isn't my imagination, she told me herself she does this) (M) wouldn't respond to my texts or speak with me unless around (S), whom also became unresponsive. I eventually only saw (S) in class with no other contact (We still sat together and talked though.). At this point, the depression became much worse, and as my methods of improving had failed again and I had decided it was time to finally go through with my suicide. Before hand, I had wanted to protect the ones I loved as much as possible, so I ""made"" (S) push me away by mimicking toxic/abusive behavior she has unfortunately been exposed to in the past. This worked, and all I needed to do was wait for spring break (To allow family some time to deal with my death). Being deliberately vague, when ""the time cam"" I decided I owed it to those I cared about to try one last time, something I hadn't done before, and *ask for/try to get help.* I regret doing so. My father was useless and made things worse (He was abusive), two of my siblings ""peaced out"", my mother basically disowned me (Long story on how that happened. She means/meant well) and of the two counselors I saw one told me my problem was I was unhappy to be ""in the friendzone"" and the other was solely concerned whether or not I was suicidal. That left one sister, Haley. She helped me, even found my ""friends"" (I don't mean that in a disliking way, I love them both very much) and explained to them what had happened, which they were sorry/sad to hear and offered help and to patch things up again once I had become more stable (I was a mess at the time, due to things going so badly on the home front and the original reasons for the suicide). Tried getting better and seeing new counselors, but about a week later I received no contact orders from my ""friends""; these are not legally binding, just something the college does upon request without any justification needed. That made things a lot, lot worse. Later my sister Haley became impatient with my lack of improvement and effectively left me. Skip ahead 3 months, and that's where I am now. Nothing has been resolved, still alone, and no idea what to do (Other than ask reddit apparently). 

**----&gt;(TLDR starts here):**

**Description of myself/situation:** I'm a 24 year old male. I'm a virgin and have only ever had a single friend. The friend part is because I was homeschooled all my life by my overly protective and abusive parents in literally the middle of no where, meaning physically miles from other people. I was 17 when I start going to an all adult (35-50) college, and 20 when I made my first friend (A lesbian my age). I later move to another state, lost said friendship in the process, and was 22 when I finally had to chance to be around people my own age. It didn't go to well, for reasons largely unknown to me. Situation go bad enough this spring I had decided to kill myself, but decided I should actually try to get help form other people. My father responded with abuse, two of my siblings ""peaced out"", my mother disowned me, and the counselors I have seen only care if I'm still suicidal. That literally one person, my youngest sister, to help me. She did, really well actually, for a time but ""gave up"" about a month ago. I've been seeing a good counselor, but can only see her for 1.5 hours a month.  

**Description of my problem:** I've had severe depression for roughly 10 years, the result of extreme non-selfinflicted antisocial ""behavior"". Naturally, this has been extremely draining and demoralizing as it has lasted so long and has only gotten worse with time. This is made worse by my consecutive 54 failed attempts at making any kind of relationship over the course of 3 years, with \~85 nonconsecutive failures (I had one success, for which I am very grateful). When I say failed attempt, I mean we spoke, exchanged numbers, studied together/spent some time together, and started to become friends, only for them to completely ignore me for seemingly no reason (Most of the time, I know a few times a female mistook my behavior for romantic intentions). This always occurred within less than a month. Its been 3 years since I've had a friend, with the only thing remotely passing for a friendship being a coworker I see for 10 minutes each week (I manage a club). **This is my problem:** crippling loneliness. I don't mean romantic (Though that is a source of pain and loneliness. And by romantic, I mean romantic, and not sexual), I mean human relation. I have never had anyone outside of three siblings, and I don't even have them anymore. I have no one now. 

**What I'm currently doing:** Trying to manage side effects of my depression/stress (These being things such as severe difficulty sleeping, high blood pressure, etc.). I'm trying to pull my life back together, by that, I mean exercising regularly again (Which makes a huge difference), start studying (I basically dropped out this spring and am going to skip this fall as well because I'm not ready emotionally. I know that sounds kinda bad, but my situation has literally only gotten worse since I wanted to kill myself, so I don't think adding more stress/responsibilities is a good idea just yet), and get my life together financially. I'm making progress on all accounts except exercise, which experienced a bump as I got an ear infection. 

**Finally, questions:** I'm of the opinion that my only hope of getting better is to make human connections. My difficulties being numerous; 

1. How on earth do I try to make friends? I mean this in a logistical sense; like an app? ""Go places""? Lacking friends or connections, this has always been a significant barrier for me. So far, I think it would be best to use an app. My sister recommended the Tinder friend matcher, which I'm all for on paper. 
2. Relating to the last question, any advice for making friends with women without making me sound like I'm trying to get laid? I'm a through and through a bleeding heart romantic and all around ""woman's man"". I find women much preferable to men, due to women typically being more mature, compassionate, and less selfish. To clarify, this is about my age group within my social bubble, being college students at a big *party* school. Coupled with the especially hedonistic culture of this state, and you get 95% of the male students primary concerns being getting laid, high, drunk, or partying. The same can be said for much of the women, but a much lower percentage. As an old soul, I have very little in common with such people and little interest in their company. While I have met several males whose friendship I would value, at tried to obtain, I failed as well (I believe in large part to my lack of interest in sports and similar ""man"" things). 
3. How on earth do I try to make friends? I'm in deplorable condition emotionally, with my life in similar condition. I mean I have a job, two now in fact, apartment, car, etc; but I'm horribly depressed constantly and spend much time just lying around crying/being depressed. Don't get me wrong, I can ""fake it"" and function normally socially (To what extent I am capable). The issue being a moral/social problem I'm been struggling to find a solution to, do I hide every aspect of my life from a potential friend due to my depression permeating it all in some way? I'm honest to fault (I never lie), so I'm not willing to outright lie, but even if I was, how could I possibly make a friendship without them even knowing me as a person? And if I'm honest with them, it basically becomes ""Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself if I can't make any friends soon. Say, wanna be friends?"" as that's terribly unfair, unhealthy for any relationship, and very uncomfortable/off putting. But I can't see any other way of improving (I have tried every self-help technique in the book (Meditation, exercise (The only one that makes a real difference anymore), ""accepting oneself"", etc)).  
4. General advice?

159,"There's a girl I am currently friends with, attractive lady. Fairly popular. Met her for some time.

161,"So, I'm 23 years old, and ever since I was young I knew I wanted to do something creative for a living, but it has always changed from thing to thing to thing. Let me lay it out for you to get an idea of what I mean.

When I was young, and I mean very young, I loved singing and music. And I mean like, 3-6 or something like that. I loved to sing and even act, and I acted in a few plays in early schooling. I drew as well, and I loved to draw and pursued art at times. I also loved Youtube, and making videos and things like that. When I was 10 or 11 my parents bought me a childs practice guitar, but no real materials, and I never really taught myself back then. I got very much into making videos in my early teen years when I was bought a flip video camera, and and uploaded a lot of youtube videos under a billion different accounts. I acted in a few school plays as well throughout childhood, and even a couple in late high school and early college. I took art classes in high-school, but I always hated the art that I made. Then, when I went to college, I chose film as a degree because for a while I really loved movies. I made videos all throughout early college and late high school, and for a while in late high school thought about pursuing acting, but I'm poor and live in the south, and with some mental health issues, never gathered up the bravery to pursue it and just leave and go do it. I taught myself guitar during the Summer between the second and third year of college, then dropped it, then picked it up again, then dropped it, and picked it up again this year, and recently dropped it again, though now I'm making simple chiptune music on a little program on my computer. For a while there, on and off throughout my whole life, I also wrote too, and thought about taking that up, but gave up on it relatively quickly with the realization that I do not read enough and I think it would be personally hypocritical to try and be successful in writing when I don't read nearly as much as I should. So, as you can gather, I've done a little on and off of everything 'artistic' to a degree. Drawing, painting, sculpture, music, video, acting, writing and so on and so forth.

Some of the advice I wanted was simply, 'Is it too late?' I know it isn't. I guess that shouldn't even be part of the question. I know it is never too late if you have dedication, but that is the hardest fucking part! I find it really hard to become dedicated to things. This plays into many parts of my life, from relationships to movies and shows to games. I move from thing to thing a lot, and honestly my personality and opinions change a lot too. I'm aware of it, and I haven't really thought it was a bad thing until recently when I realized how often my mood changes when it comes to things I like and things I dedicate myself too. I think the thing I've stuck with the longest has been making video of any kind. I kind of fell out of love with that too upon the realization that it is hard to do narrative video on your own.

I can write up more if you need to know it. I'm currently living with a roommate in a bigger Southern city and just... hoping and wanting to find something creative I can eventually turn into work. I don't have the money to go back to college, and don't want to just believe I'll make something worth getting famous or popular because that is unrealistic. I like having dreams like that, but I know the percentage chance of that is like, nil. The mental health issues I mentioned earlier, at least the diagnosed ones, are GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and ongoing depression inherited from my parents. My mother has a bi-polar disorder, depression and anxiety, and my entire family on my fathers side are all diagnosed as prone to depression, and my father and grandmother prone to fits of anxiety. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Like I said I'm willing to add more if need be.",01Aug2018,2

164,"I’m heavily debating whether I should get jaw surgery. I have a class 3 malocclusion (underbite). A surgeon told my that my upper jaw didn’t grow properly, and is farther back than my lower jaw. Naturally I’m terrified of getting surgery, so I’m currently seeing an orthodontist who is fixing my teeth. However, I’m worried about my facial aesthetics, mainly my side profile. I’m sort of in a now-or-never decision point, as my parent’s insurance would likely cover surgery, and my orthodontist says I should make a decision before my teeth are fixed, or I’d have to get everything reversed. So I want an honest opinion on my profile, as to whether it’s noticeable enough to warrant getting the surgery.

So I(24F) met said guy(31M) I’ll call Wyatt, while working in a restaurant.. I served, he bartended. I had stopped working for some months, then came back. He took notice, asked me about things, was curious about my new schedule, told me that he was excited I was back. I had never been attracted to him before this very moment. We now had the same schedule working mornings, and had the most fun together. He asked the managers to make me the bar closer, so I was near him every day. We helped each other out a lot. So eventually I became infatuated with this guy. 

At the time I was living with my abusive cheater ex, he helped me through leaving him. Wyatt was also living with his long term girlfriend, I’ll call her Cindy, and her teen daughter. He tells me their sexual relationship had ended about a year prior, they never saw each other and he felt neglected. I felt bad honestly. He spent most of his time with her teenage daughter. To the point where he had revealed to me that he felt as if he was dating her rather than her mom... (Creepy I know) 
He promised he’d never hurt me, lay his hands on me, never cheat or hurt me in that way. He tells me he’s making plans to move out and I believe him.. then Cindy develops some sort of cancer, or finds cancer cells, I’m not sure, but she had her uterus taken out. I’m not even really sure, but this held back his moving out. It was honestly one thing after another thing with him moving out, but I was understanding to how hard it is to leave an ex, especially since he was helping her raise her kid. So I dealt with it. He had gone back from staying with his mom for weeks at a time, to my place sometimes, then end up right back at her place. It was heartbreaking. 

He hid me from them, his family and friends. He lied to me about being with her. He was unreliable. He also would constantly drive by my apartment to make sure I was home, and that my lights weren’t on past a certain hour. He’d say some stalker like stuff at work the next day like “why were your lights on at 3am last night?”

But I stuck around. And he finally moved out, into his moms house to save for his own. I met his friends. He brought me around family, particularly his mom. She didn’t like me much. Guess she fancied Cindy. He stood up for me though. Told her if she ever wanted grandkids, that I would be the woman to bare them, and she needed to respect me. I felt like things were looking up. I felt he was finally committing. 

Fast forward a little bit. He scores a good job, and he buys his own house a few streets away from where I live. Amazing. I will say I was noticing a problem with his drinking and sometimes his self hygiene but nothing too crazy. Then his father passed away, and he went into a huge downward spiral. He drank tons, and didn’t sleep. He accused me of cheating constantly. Texted my ex from my phone pretending to be me, trying to act like I wanted to perform sexual acts to get some sort of distorted info. When my ex went along with the sexting, Wyatt lost his shit. He woke me up from my nap by lunging me off the bed, and screaming obscenities in my face. I was so confused. I just cried and covered my head hoping he would stop. But he didn’t, he dragged me down the hall to the front door and told me to get the fuck out. I got up grabbed the closest thing (cup of water) and threw it on him. He came at me again so I kneed him in the nuts and bailed out. 

You’d think I’d of ended it there but nope. 
He has some sort of psychological hold on me. 
What I think is love.

So after this I go back and things are up and down for a bit. He’s still accusing me of cheating but he always has had insecurities”because of his past with other women.” I tried really hard to make everything transparent so he would know I was faithful, but nothing worked. 

Fast forward Wyatt had started accusing me of cheating again, so I told him we should take a break. I thought it would be good for us. I don’t know what I was thinking, maybe that he could see even if we weren’t “committed” I would be committed, and we could work on ourselves individually. 

After about a month I messaged him and we rekindled. 

We talked about everything that had happened when we were apart ,and he told me he hadn’t even tried talking to another female. This made me happy, as I couldn’t ever bring myself to talk to another guy..and I trusted him.

Fast forward again, and one day I’m hanging at his place and notice I’ve been getting bitten up by some sort of bug. Turns out his dads stuff he took in when he passed was infested with bed bugs. Wyatt neglected to inform me. From here on out we only hangout at my place. “Because of the bedbugs”  .. again fast forward to the most important stuff; he’s planning a trip for us. It’s going to be a grand weekend. Then a fight occurs. This happened sometimes on the weekends, he’d start a fight then just want to “be with his friends.”

Well I just wasn’t having it. I was so upset and I wanted to talk it out this time damn it. It was Friday. I tried calling over and over. To my surprise, I had been blocked. So I showed up at his front door, which I had never done before, so my nerves were shot. I was shaking like crazy when I pulled up and saw a tiny red car parked in the front. I told myself it’s just his coworker and walked up to the door. I could faintly hear slow jams coming from the back of the house... I lost my shit. Started banging on, and kicking the door. Called his phone on private and it stopped the music, I took this as an opportunity to scream his name. He finally opened the door with a crack and told me I need to leave with a very stern voice. 

I busted open the door and he was completely naked. His best friends child’s mother standing behind him with a startled smirk. I started hitting him, she started hitting me. He took her off of me. I hit him again, then leave completely torn apart. 

He then tried establishing a relationship with her, that failed. 

So after all of that craziness.. a little over half of a year later, I still can’t get him off of my mind. Not bad stuff anymore. Most of the time I want to talk to him. I miss him. 

I’m terrified this is one of the dumbest things I could do. 

I’m terrified he wouldn’t even reply, or want to talk to me.

I just want to get him out of my mind, but he’s constantly there. Everything reminds me of him always. I feel like I’m still under his control. 

Should I reach out to him to try to resolve these feelings? Or perhaps wait and hope this will go away on its own? 

Thanks for your time. ",01Aug2018,0
170,"I [M/16] have a dear online friend [F/16] from the UK who i talk with daily. Im from Italy btw.


We have a great bond and in general things between us are very good! We are such good friends that we both talked about each other to our respective real life close ones (for example i talked to my therapist about her and she talked to her sister and friends about me).

We talk on Instagram and recently her sister followed me aswell on all her profiles. Sound good right? 

Now, i perfectly know that obviously i am much more connected to my friend and not her sister but its just a matter of manner. When she replies to some of my stories, i reply back and then she never responds back or even open the message while being active. Either she ignores it constantly or she deletes the chat (even worse).

You guys have any idea why she does this? Should i feel bad for it? thanks ^^",01Aug2018,1
171,"Well not always tired, but I feel that way.

I get 7-8 hours of sleep. I'm a 18 year old male, just starting UNI. I often feel a weakness, both mentally and physically. I gym every 2-3 days, keep up with my studies. But I still feel tired and I've come to conclude that my problems derive from this; I could be doing more and putting more energy into my life if I had this energy. My diet isn't perfect, especially for the morning. My sleeping schedule isn't constant for everyday. I even feel physically tired, like my body just feels weak and I midly feel like I want to collapse. Could you give me any tips? Foods to eat? Diet to stick to? Posture? Things to refrain from?

173,"Next week my boyfriend and I are going to a major theme park. Whenever I've been to a theme park/funfair before I've been in a group so there's always been someone to hold everyone's bags while we're on the ride. This is the first time I've been with just one other person and we'll obviously be going on the rides together so there won't be someone to hold our stuff. 

I know at this park they have areas on every ride to put your stuff while you're on it but I don't feel completely comfortable with that since they're not locked away anyone could take your bag when you get off. 

I have a bum bag which I think will be the best option since it's small and I can strap it to me but I don't know if I'll be able to wear it on every ride? I'm also planning on taking as few things as possible but that includes my phone and card,  things I'd rather not lose. 

Any tips on how you look after your stuff at theme parks? ",01Aug2018,2
174,"My laptop broke down 2-3 weeks ago. I sent it to a company to get it repaired. They said that the mainboard was broken and wanted the money in forward. Okay, did that. So a week passes by and they tell me that the graphic card is also broken. They ask me if I want to ignore it, since I have another onboard GPU (which is pretty weak in comparison) or if I want it to be repaired, for an absurd amount of money (since my laptop is an expensive one and also replacing GPUs are expensive). 

I passed and told them to send it back because I didn‘t have the money to have the GPU repaired. It was so expensive that I could have just easily bought another good PC with the money. 

Now here is the big issue. If I had known that BOTH my mainboard AND my graphic card were broken, I wouldn‘t have paid them money at all because I would have had to spend 1000 euros! 

They made me think that only the mainboard was broken which is why I gave them money.

So now I have a gaming laptop I can‘t use at all for its purposes because my graphic card isn‘t working properly. 

What should I do?

175,"I’m a 26 year old female bartender. Been bartending for serval years and have worked in three bars. I started my current job in January and was made manager two months ago. 

Since then I’ve realized how much illegal stuff is going on. It’s a small business, not corporate. The owners don’t have any of the 6 bartenders on payroll and hand write all of our checks. They take our taxes out by do not report them to the irs and have no intentions of doing so. They basically pocket our money. 

I work about 25 hours a week behind the bar but so a total of around 50 including running errands and all those other managerial duties. When I asked for a raise, my boss said he’d give me $1 for every hour on my time sheet. I only put the hours I’m behind the bar in the sheet, so this makes for 40-50 hours each pay period. So he’s giving me $40 every two weeks and thinks this is fair to cover the work I do. That equates to last that 25 cents per undocumented hour. 

I have to be at the bar every morning by 9 to open our safe and make sure there is change for the bartender. This takes 30 mins to an hour each day. I’ve missed one day in the past two months. I often close the bar and we stay open until 2. So even on days where I don’t get off til 2 am, I still have to be back at the bar by 9 am the next day. 

(Just wait, it gets worse.)

Today around 7 pm a coworker calls me to tell me she needs several bottles we are out of. So I tell my boss I’ll be going to the bar to get cash, grab the liquor, and drop it off. He acknowledges this. The coroner calls me as I’m pulling in to the store saying she needs that money. I offer to come back, she tells me to just get what I need to get. I spend 30 mins in the store and am in line to check out when the first boss texts and tells me not to buy anything and go back to the bar. 

I am dumbstruck. I’ve just spend an hour doing this liquor run and am just now being told to put it all back and go back to the bar with the money. 

I text my boss and tell him I’m pretty upset I just spent an hour of my own time on my day off running an errand for nothing.  I say next time I’ll go through both bosses, even though I’ve never had to before. He just says “thanks”. 

I tell him I’m going to need $10 for gas to cover the last three weeks of errand running. (Hardly enough but I’ll take what I can get.) he says the $40 I get should cover that. I explain that the $40 is to cover the fact that I’m st the bar every morning at 9 whether or not I work, plus to cover all the unaccounted hours I work every week. He sends a passive aggressive 👍. 

I’m pretty pissed at this point. I’m barely being paid and not getting enough hours to make this worth my time. I’ve not been thanked once in two months. I’m owed so much money in stolen taxes.  

I’m currently looking for another job and have no intentions of staying at this bar. They violate ABC in about 100 ways, major tax fraud, and all licenses are over a year expired. 

I’m wondering if I should address these issues now or take some sort of legal action when I have another job. Is there even any action I can take??? I’m so tired of being used and under appreciated. Even worse, under compensated. Both of my bosses talk badly about me to my coworkers and regulars. I’m fed up. Help!

TL;DR: my bosses are not paying me fairly and taking advantage of my title as manager. The are breaking IRS law, labor law, and ABC law. Should I say something now or wait until I find another job to report them? And can I take legal action? ",01Aug2018,1
176,"We best friends. Told her I liked her. she likes me back. Then she tells me she doesn't wanna date and when I ask her to clarify her reason just changed each time. Gave up after the third time and just figured I'd wait for a bit. 

We're doing a little movie marathon and today she asked me if our mutual friend would also be coming. I said I don't know. This friend has complained about being a third wheel in the past and I kinda think this may be why my friend asked if he'd be joining.

Would it be bad to just ask her straight up if she didn't want him there because we might cuddle or something? We have done so in the past with other groups so I'm secretly hoping we will lol. Still in a weird spot tho because her not wanting to date but still saying she does like me.

180,"Hey guys,
Next year I will begin attending my local community college to get my associates degree. My parents are not paying for any of my college education so naturally I am doing all I can to avoid getting into debt. Since we are upper-middle class, I do not qualify for any sort of financial aid. After my two years of community college are up, I'm going to transfer to a four-year university to complete my bachelors degree. Afterwords, I plan to go to dental schooI and pursue a career as a dentist and hopefully one day own and manage a few dental practices. 

I come to you to ask what you guys think I should do reguarding picking a university to transfer to after I get my associates degree. I have a few different options as far as universities go, but they all have some pretty  significant pros and cons that are somewhat unique to my current situation and life goals.

Because I was raised in a very active Mormon family, I am eligible for tuition at BYU and BYU-Idaho for $4,000 and $3,000 respectively. Additionally, I have several close family members in Salt Lake City that have expressed their willingness to let me stay at their place, given I go to BYU. From a financial stand point, this is the ideal choice. However, the problem is that I have no interest or intention of staying a church member as an adult. Going to either of these schools require me to abide by very strict  rules (https://policy.byu.edu/view/index.php?p=26), as well as pretending to be an avid believer and church-goer. Getting caught breaking these rules or having my true beliefs exposed could cause me to lose my reduced tuition and/or make me uneligable to graduate.

My other option would be attending a non-Mormon university, but forking over a substantially larger sum of money. Although I have not looked into many individual universities, tuition price would be my primary deciding factor on where I go. I usually fall within the top 5% of my peers on the PSAT and other standardized tests, so I assume I could get some form of an accedemic scholarship, but it's hard to compete with $3,000/yr. Additionally, since I will be going to dental school after graduating, I will likely only be able to make minimum payments on my college student loans as the interest builds up over four years. That's all on top of the ~$200k in unavoidable student loans I will have to take out for dental school. However, I feel like going to a normal university would be substantially better for my mental and emotional health, as I can only imagine how bad it would suck to maintain an ingenuine Mormon persona with quite literally everyone I come into contact with for two years (not an exageration in the slightest). 

The way I see it, I have to decide if my emotional health, although pretty hardy, is worth ~$10,000/yr + four years of interest. It's a rough decision for someone with as much of a debt phobia as myself. At the same time, I feel like attending a Mormon university would force me to sacrifice my college experience, as well as any chance of forming substantial lifetime relationships while a young adult. Without college, I'm not entirely sure where I would go about dating and meeting other people.

What do you guys think? Should I suck it up for two years and make the best of it, or should I dig my hole of debt even deeper in order to have a meaningful college experience?

Thank you all.",01Aug2018,2

When going into a store I hold the door for people and most of the people do say thank you but there are a great number who say nothing-at the point now where if they say nothing I’ll yell very loudly “your welcome” !


I have a great dane - I realize not everyone understand’s he’s a gentle giant so walk him very early in morning...On one of our morning walks we were on the path and noticed an older woman who was walking a dog who seemed to be very scared , So I went down off the path near the stream figuring maybe her dog could go by more relaxed. I was about 2 telephone poles away from her while my dog was laying in the grass and I hear this noise from the path...She was stopped and was  yelling asking me if my dog was on a leash.  

It isn’t hard to see that he was but I can appreciate perhaps she didn’t see it So I just yelled back yes. Well she is still standing there with her dog getting more anxious by the way it was behaving and asks me again with more attitude and I yelled again “I said yes!” she finally continued walking.   End of story the path is like one big loop and she kept following my dog and I which was making me angry so I ended up just leaving very annoyed.

183,"Hi everyone and thanks for helping.

We recently just broke up after she was living with me for a year, in total we’ve lived together for 3 years over the course of our relationship. 

It’s either everything is great, sunflowers and rainbows or it’s not and everything’s fucked up till it comes to a head and she leaves me or I leave her.

We both have a lot of emotional and mental health  problems we need to work out that just wasn’t happening when we were together. But we both care about each other deeply and never in the 5 years of knowing each other not cared for one another deeply. 

She is admittedly really promiscuous every time we break up. Which really hurts, cause I can’t even think of being with someone else.

Every time we break up we both kind of cave in on ourselves. She starts drinking and partying, and I start abusing whatever I can get my hands on and isolate.

192,"Writing this from a balcony over viewing the beautiful desert of Palm Springs , California. So great, this is the way I envision life. I’m on the last day of vacation , clearing my mind smoking the fine ganja the women at the dispensary recommended me, while j Cole plays through my headphones and I feel great. Right now , I feel like I’m at state of bliss that I’m not sure I’ve ever achieved in my 22 years of living. I’ve been down in the dumps over the last few years. To say the least, this vacation is long over due.  

I’ve failed so much coming along, I should have got Better grades in school, which one have allowed me the opportunity to continue playing sports past high school. I’m at a really clear space in life right now, and I’m able to evaluate my problems. One of the biggest one is not playing sports right now. It’s every ones story; grew up loving the game , became complacent with the ability you were blessed with, fucked around and that train left you . This was my biggest issue, and to this day it holds a little bit of strain on me . 

My next biggest strain after that , snowballing together was taking care of my terribly ill grandmother. Completely dependent at the time , it was extremely difficult to watch and even reflect on right now. It was so hard , I didn’t even go see her at times because I would walk out in tears after visiting my poor grandmother suffer in a nursing home as the Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s just eat away at her. About 2 years before her passing , my family got her out of a nursing and in a home with a family member. Shortly after, I dropped everything and helped her , as I mentioned she was completely dependent . I quit some fuck ass job, I washed rvs in rain hail sleet snow for nearly a year for a few more dollars than minimum wage. That was a really low point. Although it was probably my 2nd highest paying job I’ve ever had, it wasn’t where I wanted to be and I hated it. 

Taking care of her brought me solace. I’m with my parents, and grandmother everyday for nearly two years. My parents are a lot older, and I am very family oriented obviously as you can see. It actually saddens me to come see them and they always look older, even since I was young. I even got back in to school , still fucked off. I have this terrible tendency to start getting lazy half way through the quarter and just completely check out. This, and adding the day, in the middle of my class, in the latter half of the quarter, I got a text that the hospice dr that visited us said she had 3 weeks to live. I straight up quit, and didn’t finish the new found hobby of playing the piano , and as I was getting in to my much desired class that was poetry based. I actually lost all of my interests, except smoking weed, drinking and playing video games. Stopped going to the gym, was in the best shape of my life at the time physically. Stopped all these new hobbies I found interests in and buried my head in the dirt. Eventually, i watched her pass and as you can imagine , it was the worst. I’m coming up on 5 months on the 15th. I started working too fast , about a month after . Started working at a dispensary again , which is what I did for some extra money during the late nights for about 7 months while taking care of her. Not the best, but I did it for the discount. 

So I got hired at another one, super trash. 20% off, when I’m used to about 45% off . They collected tips and the big wigs distributed them at the end off the month. I quit a week and a half later, standing at the door checking ids was also a dealbreaker for me . It wasn’t the position I applied for , respect it or not . Shortly after , i sold cars for a week. On top of the difficulty of coping with watching my grandmother leave us physically less than 2 months prior , but I was working 50-60 hours a week for pennies and nickels , and the pay is the usual , but I was at disadvantage in a low income neighborhood with low foot traffic. I didn’t like it so I left after a week as well . Now , 5 months later I’m working a shop weed shop again. It’s paying well, minimum plus tips I’m making 18-25 an hour. But I’m ready to pursue a career . I’ve been flirting with the idea of starting a business. I don’t know where to even start or a skill I could start a business with. I have a recording setup I was thinking about renting out , and engineering music and working on my craft and not working for someone else watering their grass. I just have to good first. That is one of the hobbies I was exploring that I dropped that I am gonna explore when I get back. I had a long session of just relaxing and taking the time to think , which is something I’m going to start implementing into my regimen. However , I think I may have found a potential career path that I was seeking advice for.  I don’t know how to finish this , but what are thoughts on a business admin degree.? I’m reading a lot online about it potential uselessness. But I would love seeing myself starting out marketing on a large scale. I somewhat follow popular marketers, and their lifestyle seems in line with mine. I feel I excel with my social skills. Which is why I wanted to pursue psych, and I worked for the car dealership. I feel I am persuasive . If I do decide to pursue a business degree , I will also pursue a degree in journalism in junction with that. I just need advice which is why I’m here. I did therapy for a couple weeks after my situation to help with everything, and now I don’t feel as down as I did before I still feel it will be a great resource. I have such a short attention span it just fell out . I will look back into that, but for now I just need some help fellow redditors. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my sob story.

A) I didn’t say something equally as rude back or B) I’m letting it get to me 3 hours later.

Yesterday I had two run ins. The worst was with an aggressive road rage middle aged man who threatened to blow up my car while calling me a **** ( very bad word to call a female) and throwing cigarettes at my hood.

Today I woke up and one of my mirrors were broken on the ground and the other one was still on but battered.

Now I’m sitting at home typing this wishing I would have handled it differently. I feel like there’s something about my demeanor in public that makes people feel it’s okay to treat me like crap.

196,"One of my best friends gf is really close to me. She always says how Im her best friend and stuff. I also feel close to her but only in a platonic way. My best friend was on a 4day trip to another city with some friends while I, her and two other guys from our group were casually hanging out drinking (were all 17 years old). When the two guys went home around midnight her and I stayed outside to chill some more (I dont have a better word for chill im sorry, im german). By that time we both were way too drunk. She wanted to smoke cigarettes from the ground because we hadnt had any cigarettes left and I couldnt even walk properly. Because it was cold she came under my jacket and one thing led to another and we made out. I know Im the biggest piece of shit and I seriously would like to die im not joking. Ive never hated myself more. After we made out we realized what assholes we were and she started crying for a very long time and I got so desperately sad that im such an asshole that I punched the walls and stuff. We felt really guilty and 100%regret everything. 
The thing is I dont know if I should tell my friend about it or not. My first thought was I had to 100% tell him and live with the consequences because he deserves to know and being a good friend means having to loose a good friend. When I told her so she said that we couldn't tell him because hes gonna destroy himself again (they broke up for a month or so she knows how he would react) and its gonna ruin their 2 years relationship. Because no feelings are involved and we were way too drunk it should just be forgotten (I know being drunk is no excuse because not cheating also means not getting into situations were this can happen but its kind of an explanation). I still kind of think i have to tell him but she says its only gonna ruin him, their relationship and her just for the sake of me having a good conscience. She says shes willing to live with a bad conscience for sake of him. Her focus is more on him being better than her. Im not here to be told im an asshole who doesnt deserve to live, i know that. I just want to know what to do because I want the best thing for my friend.
And just for you to get the right picture his gf isnt a whore or something shes really a good-hearted angel she would never do anything like that ever again. We both dont know how this happened. Its not like i need to save him from his evil gf (what she did was still horrible dont get me wrong). They are the cutest goodhearted sweetest couple i have ever known. What should I do?",01Aug2018,1

my second year, my depression and anxiety got the best of me. usually i am able to manage it super well but i think being away from my family made it 10x worse. slowly, my grades were starting to go down. i haven’t checked my gpa or credits yet because i don’t want to see what the result ended up being. i know they’re not good at all anymore. i ended the school year feeling like shit and i planned on taking a quarter off to work on my mental health. i just didn’t feel like the person i was when i was a first year student. it’s like something in my brain changed and it didn’t work the same anymore. i felt incompetent. easy everyday tasks were hard for me to complete. getting out of bed and just brushing my teeth was a challenge most days. 

to my surprise, my parents were supportive when i talked to them about what was going on. what they told me caught me off guard. where i was living this past year was technically a basement. my room had no window, so it was always dark unless i obviously had the lights on. they told me that my depression and anxiety got unbearable because i slept in a room without a window. i had to tell my roommates what my plans were and my reason for them, one of them told me the same thing too. 

i didn’t think much of it until now actually but that not the reason for my post. coming home this summer, i decided to get help because i couldn’t do this on my own anymore. my doctor prescribed me lexapro. i took that until the bottle ran empty. i later decided that the side effects weren’t worth it, i was starting to experience depersonalization, one of my brothers has this too. so i guess it’s genetic or something. i’ve been off lex for about three days and i don’t really feel as depressed as i once was. i was originally going to stay here and just go to a community college since i lost my scholarships due to my bad grades. but i don’t really have interests anymore. every thing seems boring. i don’t know what i want career -wise now.

207,"I need help getting through a situation that’s making me emotional. My mom wasn’t any help.

For the past three years I’ve been on a competitive martial arts team at my university. I’ve mainly stuck with it because of the great friends I’ve made on the team. Usually, if you train for four years, you get your black belt at the end of senior year. This is a really important and meaningful milestone and people who started training together usually get their black belts together. It’s very sentimental. I have three really great friends on the team and we were all on track to get our black belts at the same time. Last Fall, I studied abroad so I missed out on some training. However, I trained with the team over half the summer (which my other friends didn’t) so that I wouldn’t be far behind. Getting to practice that summer was extremely difficult. I lived 45 minutes away by bus (in a different part of the city for a job that gave me free housing) and would often get home at 7 PM. Practice is at 8 and I would leave immediately. I missed out on quite a few fun events with my coworkers so I could get to practice.

Still, my friends got half a rank ahead of me when I studied abroad. Which is fine, studying abroad was a great experience and I’m glad I did it. But my coach assured me that she would accelerate me over the summer and that we would all still get our black belts together in May 2018.  My friends assured me of this too. 

However, now one of my friends is graduating in December. So my coach is accelerating the other two so that they can all get their black belts together. I would have been able to accelerate and get mine in May, but there’s no chance I can get mine in December. So now I’ve been left behind. 

This is extremely depressing for me. I started crying when I found out (well once I was alone). It’s already bad enough that they’re all one rank before black belt. My coach invited them all to karaoke last night and not me because of their rank. It will be really depressing for me to watch them all achieve this huge milestone in December without me. And then I’ll have to get my black belt in May, alone. I don’t even care about getting my black belt. It’s a piece of cloth. What I cared about was achieving something with my friends who I’ve been training with three times a week for four years.

They only have a month and a half more experience than I do. My mom thinks I should quit so that I’m not constantly reminded of something that makes me very sad. But quitting would have a very negative impact on my social life and routine. ",01Aug2018,1

209,"Yeah that title already sounds pretty interesting huh? This post might get a little long, I'm sorry, maybe grab some coffee and put on some music? Thanks for reading :)

So, I have to explain first how I got in this situation. I left my mom's house because frankly she just couldn't handle money or get organized and the place was a mess, she didn't feel like she controlled her life so she often went apeshit on me and my two brothers. I didn't feel encouraged to clean the place all the time because I felt I cleaned way more than I made a mess and no one cared to keep the place tidy. I love my mom, but looking at things objectively and seen as my mom was absorbing my money like a sponge and we weren't getting anywhere, ever, I felt stagnated, and left, wanting to grow and build my life.

Lived in grandpa's for a while then moved in with some friends. Meanwhile my mom got a new house, rented, but she needed a guarantor. It's common here to sign a rent contract where you have someone that will pay for you if you for some reason can't pay rent. It's a sort of insurance for house owners. My mom begged me to be the guarantor or she couldn't get the house, and even though I knew this could be trouble, I couldn't refuse and just decided to trust her as she really meant to pay rent and I know she did.

As you might have guessed she missed some payments and I got a pawn notice saying the house owner's lawyer would pawn part of my salary to pay for the late rent plus interest. This is legal. Since I was already paying a loan my mom asked, and a small loan my uncle asked from me, I felt financially choked and decided to ask a public entity for help with debt. This public lawyer said I should file for bankruptcy, we went over the situation and I ended up trusting him and going for it. Now I'm bankrupt for the next 5 years but I'm guaranteed minimum wage + a small help. To be honest I can't quite understand how different this is from getting my salary pawned since they can't pawn past minimum wage anyway. But anyway, It's already done, I kinda regret it but I can get out of it I think. 

Anyway, meanwhile the friends I live with wanna move out. And I can't pay rent on my own, 625 €. I currently make about 800 € because I'm working two jobs, but I can't cover all expenses with just this. I spend 120 € on gas, and I'd still have electricity, water, cable, food and whatnot. So I have to move out too. And here in Portugal cheap houses can only be found pretty far from the capital, which will force me to change jobs as well. Now the women come into play.

I have an ex living in Mexico. We dated 4 years and have a strong connection, but she also suffers from high anxiety, visits a therapist weekly, and she's very very needy of attention. We've gotten into arguments about it often, and I think to make things worse I might be the kind of guy to want to have some space. Like I don't mind texting during the day, and I do, and calling every other day, but that doesn't seem enough and I don't know how things will be in person. But I'm welcome in her home in Mexico and I guess I can look for a job there and maybe things can work out, even though It's a third world country.

However, there's another girl here in Portugal who I like. She's the sister of my best friend's girlfriend. So It's kind of cute that we'd date sisters, and I get along with their family pretty well, and her father works in IT as I do, and he needs someone full-time for his business, and he's interested in me, so it all kinda seems to fall into place. Except I'm still getting to know this girl and I don't know how things will turn out. Also, houses close to where she lives aren't very cheap either, so I'd be left with finding a room to rent, but renting a room at this point in my life when I keep jumping around..I mean I'm 25. I feel like finding a place for myself or live with friends or family, but my grandfather wants to be alone (he's got PTSD from war and stuff), my mom has 4 people living in a house with 1 room, so no space for me, I don't know my father and my uncles don't really have space for me either. 

So either I go for the Mexican girlfriend, or for the Portuguese girl living across the river, which isn't so far. And I either find other friends to live with, or I get a small place really far from everyone, or I forget about everyone and just move to England where, allegedly, things would be easier financially, or I don't know. 

All of the options here seem like a risk and a sacrifice. I'm not sure what the best option is. I'm not sure what to do. I love my Mexican girlfriend but truth be told she's crazy. This Portuguese girl is more like a fixed wedding, because of other interests (even tho I also do like her, she's cute and we might get along). ",01Aug2018,0

I pulled into a driveway nearby and started knocking at houses in the area asking if they knew who the puppies belonged to.  During this entire time, they stayed in the road.  Finally, I found the right house, and a woman answered the door along with at least one fully grown dog.  She wasn't mean or anything, but she didn't seem to care they were in the road.

However we have just had graduation and he mentions the day before that his girlfriend was staying the night. Which is fine, but we don't know her and thought it was a bit rude that he hadn't asked in advance (especially since I'd had to pay for my parents to stay in and Airbnb since he was sleeping in the bedroom which myself and my boyfriend share the living room - our preference.)

The girl is one of my girlfriend's best friends. I've seen her a few times and she's just so nice and fun.

Her boyfriend is an ass. He's really rude to people - in a joking way, but when he follows it up with ""haha, just kidding"" you just notice he doesn't mean it one bit.

They moved in together a while back (a few months). She had just graduated college and started a job. He was in between jobs when they were about to move in. He had a trial at a fancy restaurant, but it turns out he didn't get it.

Fast forward to a few weeks back. My gf went to visit her friend and it's going horrible. He hasn't had a job in months. She's the only one putting any money on the joint account, which they use to pay bills and rent etc.

On top of that he makes almost no effort at looking for work and goes out every night he can. He doesn't have money, so he asks her. When she said no, he took it. She has to hold on to her own bank card, because he knows the pin and takes money anyway. She can't put any money on the joint account as he'll withdraw it asap.

He finally got a job that seemed pretty sweet, but after 2 days he went out celebrating. The girl called and texted him to come home as it was getting late, which he ignored. In the morning she tried to wake him up, which he didn't. So he lost his job.

She hates it, but at the same time likes him too much to kick him out. She's also really emotional and - according to my gf - suffers from break-ups for way longer than the average person.

223,"Hi everyone, just as the title says i’m on a job hunt and landed an interview. Problem is it’s going to take at least 3 hours because of several tests they do there and therefore i need to find a way to get some time off. 

Here’s the problem. My boss always needs a very solid reason, otherwise i can forget about getting time off. Since we are only with 4 people and one is one vacation it’s even harder to get some time off. 

I need a good excuse, my sister told me to tell him i need to get my car fixed and i have no other way of getting to work, but knowing this guy he’s gonna offer to pick me up. 

I thought of telling him there’s someone coming over to inspect the house and nobody is home, but then i remembered he’ll just tell me no because my parents should get time off for that ( since i live with them.) 

As you can tell, he’s a tough nut to crack and i need a good effing excuse to get out of work for the morning. 

Any tips are appreciated ",01Aug2018,1

It's worth noting that both of us are autistic and find communication difficult, so I could really use some advice. I intend to send her a tweet. What do I write?

Thank you guys

226,"They just visited a few days ago. I have been waiting for this visit for over a year so of course my expectations were high, I'm not gonna lie. But the whole time they were here, I barely got to talk to her, sit next to her or just have her undivided attention. 

We would be in the middle of a conversation and he would walk up and interupt what we were talking about and yell ""hi!"" (It's this ""cute"" inside joke thing they do... Not so cute)  And ask her something just completely random to be in the conversation. He also does this when my boyfriend was mid-sentence in a convo with fiance. 

She and I were going to a concert and we had been planning our outfits and just how we would get dressed up in general for a girls night. I hurried to shower and get ready so she could use the bathroom and she wanted me to do her hair and make up. I get out and they had gone to clean her car for whatever reason, 30 minutes go by and they come up all sweaty because they had been making out in her car. At this point we needed to leave in 20 minutes. I asked her if she wanted to shower and she no and that her fiance says she doesnt need to be getting dressed up and should just wear what shes wearing... Ok. 

He has to shower with her, go to the bathroom with her, if she needs to run out to the car - he has to go with her. Anytime she's talking he talks over her. Those two examples are just two things that happened in the 3 days they've been here. Maybe I'm being dramatic but I don't have a good gut feeling about this guy and my gut is usually right. And I dont want her to become 40 and look back on the last 20 year's full of regret. I feel like I really need to tell her how I feel but I dont want to ruin  everything we have. Should I tell her?

For the past couple of years, I've become quite comfortable with a living condition where I have my own room and an own 'space' to retire to, just lying around or watching videos, etc. Funnily enough, this is the perfect situation - my flatmates are much older guys with completely different careers that I have no common interests with. They 3 have known each other for a while now, and are comfortable with each other. They are perfectly happy to leave me alone, don't keep trying to hang out, etc.

238,"I’ve been really working on myself a lot lately—facing past traumas, forgiving myself, rearranging priorities. That kind of thing. I’ve been excluding people who I feel like cause me more stress than joy &amp; recently I realized the only 2 major stressors in my life are my dog &amp; my boyfriend. 

My Siberian Husky I’ve had for 5 years. When i got him, I had a husband &amp; a home. Husband &amp; I separated a few months after &amp; it’s been him, I, &amp; who ever I allow in my life throughout the years. Ever since he’s gotten big enough he has done nothing but destroy things. I can’t afford training classes so I’ve tried everything in my power to get him to stop. I’m talking old school disciplinary methods, crate training, you name it. But to no avail. He’s a very high energy dog &amp; i must work so he’s alone pretty often &amp; that’s when he strikes. He also shows off when i’m not around, even if others are. Anywhere we go he causes trouble that i have to speak up for. It is really hard to keep defending a repetitive offender. He’s not welcomed anywhere really &amp; everyone in my life seems to hate him—they don’t understand. Sometimes i wish he would die. Then I realize i love him &amp; I shouldn’t think that but I still think of rehoming him, but I worry about how that would go.

My boyfriend i’ve had for the past 3-4 years. He’s been very helpful &amp; very progressive, but he’s soooo negative—Negative Nancy in the flesh. He knows I suffer from social anxiety &amp; depression yet anytime I’m being affected by one of these he attacks me for it, &amp; tells me how ridiculous i &amp; my feelings are.  He hates my dog. Has nothing but negative things to say about him &amp; basically feels as though he’s a murderer even though he has more good experiences with other animals than bad ones. (Dog got into a fight with a cat once &amp; won; also once bit a dog belonging to a friend of boyfriend). He tells me he loves me but that he shouldn’t have to deal with me being unhappy when it happens. Makes me feel like everything i do is wrong &amp; i get that from pretty much everyone so i wish he would be more supportive. He makes me hate myself sometimes. He makes me wish he was gone but then i realize I love him too. &amp; i blame myself for making him feel like he’s useless to me. He’s pretty much been my financial supporter since he came into my life so what would i do without him. He’s my partner in crime, although sometimes i find myself seeking attention from other men.

I’ve been flip flopping between rehoming my dog, or getting rid of my bf. Leaning more towards rehoming dog b/c I’m sure he’ll be happier in a house w/ a yard &amp; full family setting. If i get rid of my bf, i’ll have no where to live, &amp; barely any means of survival, &amp; only my mom &amp; sis to turn to, who i feel like hates my dog as well, &amp; who doesn’t understand me. I feel completely &amp; utterly alone, &amp; i can accept that, but the fact is i’m not alone. I have a bf &amp; a dog who stresses me out often. What would you do?

SUMMARY: I have dog who destroys apartments &amp; can be mean. I have a boyfriend who loves me “unconditionally”, but constantly tells me I make him miserable which really affects me when my social anxiety &amp; depression are present. I’m thinking of getting rid of one/both. What would you do?",01Aug2018,2

241,"I am currently working a summer job in a small store. I work with the manager of the store and one coworker. So far I love it here because both of my coworkers are awesome people and it's fun to work with them. Or so I thought. My coworker, let's call her Jessica is a bit awkward and takes everything very personally even if it has nothing to do with her. I try to be friendly and open to her. I thought I had a good professional relationship with her.
Two days ago I worked with the manager of the store and it was Jessica's day off. The manager let me know what there was a complaint made by Jessica to the assistant manager of the entire facility that I do not work and sit here and read my book the entire time. The manager of the store reassured me that she and the assistant manager both gave me permission to read my book and study when there is down time. I do NOT read when there are customers in the store. Of course this frustrated me and honestly hurt me a lot because I work just as hard as Jessica does. I'm confident that I won't get in trouble for slacking off or pushing anything onto her. The manager reassured me again saying that she knows I work just as hard as Jessica and to disregard this. That frustrated me even more because that's just sweeping what she said under the rug. I believe that the manager should say something to her. I also found out from both the manager and another employee at the facility that last year Jessica did the exact same thing she did to me. She ended up ruining the relationship between her and the person from last year to the point where the employee said they would not be returning the next summer season.
I pretty much resolved that I had lost my respect for Jessica but I would not cause trouble for her. As petty as what she said is, my intention is not to get her in trouble. I would treat her professionally as a coworker and do my job but I refuse to be anything more than that. Yesterday I came in and said hi to her. Cleaned the entire store and filled up the ice chest. The entire time she was in the back room on her phone. She asks me why I'm mad at her. I said because I'm frustrated and upset that you told the assistant manager that I don't work and only read my book. So she gets upset and tells me she never said that. And then starts shouting at me to tell her who told me that over and over. That freaked me out because she's taller and probably 100 lbs heavier than I am. I said I didn't need to tell her anything. So she grabbed her stuffed and stormed out saying sarcastically that well she knows who her friends are. I assumed she went on her break but she never came back.
Today I opened up the store and I'm dreading what will happen today. She's due in at noon but I'm worrying if she'll show up or not. My managers husband just came in and I explained what happened to him. He's clearly not a fan of Jessica because he told me he hopes she quits. That's not what I want at all. I want her to understand that what she said is wrong.
For context I am 24 and Jessica is in her late 40's. I also feel that I should mention she has a disorder that effects her mobility. Personally I do not treat anyone by their disorders. I treat people by their personality and how they interact with me and those I care for. From what I noticed she seems to be threatened by me and the employee from last year. Almost as if she's going to lose her job to us. Now walking out on the job and causing trouble with coworkers in my opinion is reason enough to be written up by the manager. I have no intention of taking her job or getting her fired.

244,"This may seem like a stupid predicament but its been on my mind for a while now. This weekend my girlfriend invited me to go with her family on vacation and I really want to go however my friends invited all planed this get together we call a boys night. (It sounds dumb as hell but its pretty cool lol) Its going to be the last boys night before we all go off to college and I want to see them all before I go but that would mean missing time with my girlfriend on vacation. 

To be honest, the choice would be easy for me but about three months ago I found out something that hurt me. Before I graduated from high school I really wanted to let the boys know that I cared about our friendship and that they were truly the best friends I've ever had (I never really had a lot of friends growing up and these guys really were great friends). I wrote up 10 letters for each of the guys in the group and basically wrote a personal letter for each of them saying that our friendship meant a-lot and I also added some personal touches to each letter. I set up a date at a boys night to hand them out and all was fine. About two weeks after I set up that date I find out from another friend that all the guys were making fun of me and the letters and pretty much calling them stupid and that it was too much for them. I was hurt beyond belief and I threw all my letters away. They kind of half assed apologized for it and I forgot about it and things kinda went back to normal. 

I do care about them but sometimes I feel like they don't value my friendship as much as I value theirs. So when I have to choose between going on vacation with my girlfriend or hanging my guy friends it may seem like an easy choice but its not and I don't know how to approach the situation. I don't want to miss out on really the last time ill see my friends altogether but I also want to spend more time with my girlfriend before I go off to college. If I choose one or the other I know either side will get really upset or hurt. Does anybody have any advice?",01Aug2018,1

250,"I'll be honest. I'm not entirely sure if I am even looking for advice. Maybe just a place to vent, maybe to have my voice reach a single reader in hopes of having someone understand. Even just a sliver of hope. 

Where do I even begin? Maybe where last Monday I was told I needed to have surgery on my leg. Back in April I went in for an MRI in hopes of finding out what is currently growing on my leg. They say it's a lipoma. Just a bunch of fatty tissue cells. Three months ago I was told I had nothing to worry about and we'll just monitor it. This past Monday, I was told by the very concerned surgeon that I needed it removed. I was so taken back I immediately started crying. Why all of a sudden? What changed? You've had these results for three months, then without even doing an examine it's off to surgery I go (or schedule). Why, how? I couldn't bring myself to ask these questions I desperately wanted to ask. All I could think about was money. Three months ago I was given the option for surgery, but there was no rush and no pressure. I asked about how much it would be. Let's just say I'm going to have to pay my full high deductible. Thinking having to pay the MRI was bad, that was spare change in comparison. Money is just money... at the end of the day I reworked my budget, and while having to push back several things, I can make it happen.

As soon as the slightest bit of relief hits, it immediately vanishes.  The actual procedure. The part where they cut into me and remove whatever lies underneath is not what scares me. What scares me is being put under. Which should be irrational. I've been under sedation 3 times before. Why is this any different? Is it all my health issues that I'm worrying about? Lately I've had ridiculously high blood pressure. Unfortunately, this does not mix well with sedation. Google has been my enemy, feeding me these horrible nightmares. I got the courage to email my surgeon asking why I couldn't have local. I made a comment that I was concerned about sedation. All I got was ""size, width, depth"". No concern, no advise, just those three words... At least I asked, right? Then there's the second, most intense fear. What if it's not a lipoma. What if it's cancer? I mean that's the whole reason I'm getting it removed. While they say all looks normal, it very well may not be normal. They can't verify if it is or isn't, which I knew from day one. They could only speculate what it looks like on the screen. Chances of it being so are low, I hope. But there's still that chance. still that possibility. 

Now comes all the tests before. I have to keep reminding myself. These tests are good. You aren't going into surgery blind sided. You are preparing. Your doctor is preparing. Your surgeon is preparing. They have your best interest. This is for the best. It's hard when people you care about act like it's not a big deal and to just brush it off. Maybe you want to desperately talk about it, maybe you're so scared you stay awake at night getting lost in books trying to live out someone elses life. This is also a red flag seeing as you are a gamer, not a reader. 

This past Sunday I had a Bridal Shower. A little back story, my Mother died when I was 7. Her whole side of the family lives here. Her biological parents passed before I was born, but there were her cousins and aunts that raised me as their own, so now my cousins, aunts, and grandparents. Anyways, my dad remarried years later and she is of course part of the family. Now, don't get me wrong, I do love her. She is a wonderful, good intention woman. She is strong, caring, and is a very good person. She's a great role model. Our personalities clash like no bodies business, but that's just how it is. 

Anyways, at my cousins (mom's side) shower, my other cousins were asking me details about my wedding. I'm supposed to be getting married in a year and a month and a half now. Being engaged for almost 11 months has been a long process. I booked the major vendors, but that's about it. Still having a good chunk of time left leaves me semi bored, sometimes wishing it was sooner. Either way, for whatever reason my step mother does not care about our wedding. At first she was nice, happy to give her opinions, ect. But after booking a couple vendors she got angry with me, saying it's too early, don't decide on anything, and shut me down every time I tried to bring something up. She got so annoyed with me and acts like she's ashamed that I want to talk about my own wedding. It just feels so cruel in person. So with her sitting next to me was awkward, as she would roll her eyes and just brush off my opinions... 

Then I had to tell my aunt about the surgery. I'm trying not to drink too much alcohol to have a better outcome of the surgery. For whatever reason she got pissed that I didn't have a mimosa, so they drilled me about it. I explained my feelings and my stepmother rolled her eyes and said it's not a big deal. It breaks my heart, it's a big deal to me and she just doesn't care. 

There's so much more, but surgery and the lack of support are the biggest things on my end. Thank you Lord for all of your beautiful blessings, and for bringing my amazing Fiance into my life. He has been a sole light for me. He has truly been remarkable. A support system, lover, best friend, and hero. I am so blessed he is in my life, supporting my goals and feelings. 

But that is my sad sob story. If you have made it this far, I commend you (and I am very sorry you had to read all of that). I hope you have a wonderful and blessed day.",01Aug2018,1
251,"I'm 22M, and my mom remarried and had two more kids 14 years after I was born. I have two brothers who are 6 and 4. I give them both attention, don't get me wrong. I feel super bad about them because their dad is physically and verbally abusive. They have to go there at least once a month, sometimes every other weekend when he demands the custody agreement be followed to a T.  


I find myself spending a lot more time with my 4 year old brother when I'm visiting them. I even let him sleep in my bed or on the couch with me when I've kicked out my 6 year old brother in the past.  


The reason is that I've always felt super alone in my family. There are a lot of aunts, each with a lot of kids, and I haven't had a single relative who was like me until my 4 year old brother was born. I feel like I have deep emotions while everyone else, both male and female, is dumb and aggressive. Countless times I was told that what I liked or felt was stupid. I hate the term ""gifted"", but it's been applied to both me and my 4 year old brother. I prefer saying ""imaginative"" or ""emotionally intense"" because this is not about what anyone's IQ happens to be when it comes to how well you can connect on a deeper level.  


I've been showing my brother all the books and movies that got me excited at his age, and I love seeing him get excited too. On a darker note, I also suffered every kind of abuse as a kid, and I would have been glad to have someone who listened to me and cared. When he comes back from his dad's with a bruise, I tell him he can tell me anything. Sometimes it was an accident. Sometimes he says his dad picked him up and dropped him or whatever else, and then I hold him and tell him his dad was wrong. I know I'm going to ruffle feathers if I keep doing this, but he's 4 and this is horrible. My other brother doesn't want to talk to me because he thinks his dad does nothing wrong, and he's pissed I ""called the cops."" If you think I should call CPS and the police, you're not the only one. THEY DON'T CARE! They've taken the kids away from him before and just gave them back later.  


I'm worried though that I'm going to damage my 6 year old brother by playing favorites so much. I do things with him and it sometimes doesn't go well at all. It's like he's already 13 and thinks adults are stupid. He hits me, kicks me, and runs away in a public place when it's time to leave. He's dumb and aggressive like everyone else in our family.

Its not that I don't get along with my peers, but when it comes to leadership and working together, I always feel like I struggle the most to earn their respect above all.

258,"About 18 months ago, I developed an unhealthy habit playing the multiplayer game Overwatch.  I  was depressed and suicidal and used the game to escape my problems. 

Eventually I started medication for depression, but continued to play the game for several hours a day despite wanting to take breaks and learn new skills, namely programming. So I threw out the game and deleted my Blizzard account to prevent myself from playing. 

It’s been about seven months since I quit, but I’ve played occasionally using my brothers account. I’ve since set and completed several goals - a first in my life, since I’ve been depressed since I turned 12 - and I’m feeling pretty good. I’m unemployed and not in school, so I spend a lot of my day programming and taking care of my dog. But I also spend a lot of my day wasting time on the internet. 

I’d rather spend my internet time doing something productive, and I enjoy the meta-learning and entertainment that Overwatch provides. Do you think it’s a good idea to re-buy the game if I feel in control of my life and habits now? ",01Aug2018,0

260,"I'm a college student spending the summer couch surfing in Maine. Long story short, I'm poor, and homeless. I've been stuck like that since 2015, when my parents kicked me out right after graduation.

This summer hasn't been good for money. I've only made rough 1.5k working at a Lowe's in a seasonal position, and it's just not going to cut it for how much I need this upcoming semester at my college. However, me and the SO got a call yesterday--a GameStop we applied to when we first got into the area is interested in hiring us. That's fantastic, but we're leaving the area in 24 days.

A part of me wants to go after this job because not only would it give me an extra money boost, but having experience working at a GameStop also makes it easier to be hired at GameStops down in Florida, where I'm from. That's relevant because getting a job in Florida, especially in the big city I live in, is near impossible without extremely relevant job experience *and* a degree. One of which is still in the process of being finished.

But I feel like it's a dick move to try to be hired by a place when I'm going to be here for less of a month. On the flip side, I desperately need money--I owe the school 4.7k for this semester alone, and the huge school-specific, minority-specific scholarship I've been desperately trying to get the school to give me an application for has lead nowhere (the Financial Aid department refuses to give me any potential info on where it might be/if they can send it to me, and everyone else in high up positions can't find anything on it *anywhere*).

271,"Hiya all. Need advice but mostly need to vent. I wanna talk to someone but there really isn't anyone to talk to, and shrinks are expensive, so I'ma type this as if I'm talking to someone if that is fine with you guys. 

For a little context I am 20M and she is 22F and we are coworkers. We don't work in the same department but we work together occasionally, but not often. Maybe a few times a month.

Where do I begin. I guess from the beginning. The first time I saw her I was like ""damn."" That's it. She isn't smoking hot sexy pornstar 10/10, that isn't what I mean. I don't know, there was just something about her that I couldn't put my finger on. She was pretty. It seemed as if the room would light up whenever she smiled. And I felt happy around her. Idk its like when I'm around her I can just forget my problems. Time would just fly by. I would just constantly be smiling when talking to her, she made me feel happy. That's all I really wanted.

I've never had a girlfriend before since I've been unhappy and very stressed out all throughout high school. That is a story for a different day though. When I graduated high school I thought I felt happy to be out. Finally free, ya know? I thought I was happy. Then I met her and I realized that I was still unhappy the whole time, but just slightly less unhappy. When I was with her I felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. That's all I ever wanted, just to be happy.

And now I'm starting to cry while typing this. Moving on. So in late May I was considering asking her out. Two options, she either says yes or she says no. If she says yes then I will finally achieve the happiness I've been wanting for years. If she says no then it doesn't matter, I'm used to being unhappy. So in early June I have the chance to ask her out. We've known each other a little over half a year at this point so it isn't like it was too soon. She said ""it's not you..."" ""...I have a lot of my own problems..."" ""...but we can still hang out..."" These are the only things I heard. After this first the words I sort of zoned out, like I knew where it was going. It is a pretty surreal experience that I've never felt before. You know in a movie when someone gets hit in the head or something and they are starting the black out and the camera is shaky and the background sound is like a loud high pitched sound and the character can't hear someone else screaming their name? Then all of a sudden they snap to reality? Idk if felt like that, except without the camera tricks and background sound. Idk I just zoned out, it is like I didn't experience it, like time froze and unfroze. No problem. I'm fine. Alright, if you change your mind lemmie know :)

On the way home I feel like shit. Why? I don't know. It isn't like I care. Then I go right to bed even though it is like 3 PM. And I start crying harder than I can ever remember while whispering her name. Idk why but whispering her name was comforting to me. Then I go to sleep somehow, like going through all that emotional bullshit was making me exhausted. Then I woke up at 8 PM and started crying again. Then I eventually went to sleep like normally at 11 PM and woke up next morning. The first half of my day was great because I spent the whole day up until that point with her. I felt extremely happy being next to her. Everything after that was the worst emotional experience of my life.

So we work together and we gotta see each other. I am aware of the ""don't date you co-workers"" rule but please don't give me shit abut that, I don't give a fuck. It is only awkward if we make it awkward. And it isn't awkward. We just acted like nothing happened. And it was that way for a while, but I noticed after a little while she was starting to change. Some days she would be talking to someone right next to me while being 10 inches away from me and not even say a word to me and walk away without even looking at me. The next day she was her happy self, the one who made me happy. Then the next time I would see her she would just ghost me. Then she was her regular self again. Then she ghosted me again. Like a pattern. After a while I was getting a little bit pissed off. I don't know what's her problem or why she is doing this. One time while she was her regular self when we were working together and we were getting food (we were in the same car, she was driving) and when I was gonna start eating she said ""you're not gonna wait for me?"" And I said okay lol (I didn't really say lol, I forgot my exact words but it was something like the real life equivalent of saying lol.) Next time we did the same thing, I didn't even start to eat we just automatically did what we did last time. We waited to get back to work and eat next to each other while talking. Kinda like a date but as friends. I guess this was her way of being nice to me. And I am perfectly happy with this, I don't need to be romantically intimate with her or anything. I just love spending time with her. That's it. She is such a nice person when she is her usual self. But then the next time it was different. I didn't touch my food but she started eating while we were in the car. Hmm, ok. I guess she doesn't want to eat together today. It isn't a big deal. I don't remember if she was ghosting me that day because it was a few weeks ago (she probably was), but I remember this part of that day.

Anyway, why is she ignoring me sometimes and other times not? There is a very obvious correlation. She ignores me when other guys (co-workers, specifically when they are male) are around, and is her usual happy self when I'm the only guy around. The only exception to this is when another guy is around who is quiet and never talks in the first place. 

Here is how I figured this out. So a few days ago she sends messages me on snapchat while we were at work. I guess she was being her usual self. Except when we saw each other less than an hour later she doesn't look at me, she doesn't talk to me. And guess what, there were like 4 or 5 other guys around me. Okay, fine. Whatever, don't talk to me. I'm used to it by now, I guess this is a day where I'm being ignored. But then a few hours later she is talking to me again. I was walking in her direction and she says hi, and we talk for like a minute. Then I start thinking, you ignored me before but now are talking to me? It is never both in one day. Then I made the connection and thought back to times where she was being nice to me, it is when we were alone. 

Also one time I glanced at her phone (it was in plain view, I wasn't stalking or anything) and saw she had a message in her Instagram DMs that she didn't open. I jokingly said something like ""oh why don't you read your DMs?"" And she said something like \*\*(this part is important)\*\* ""because he's a creeper! We went to high school together. I don't look at messages from creepers. I always reply to your messages though."" I get like 20 DMs a day on instagram because I have quite a few followers, and I don't ignore a single one (unless it is a foreign language.) That is just me, I don't expect everyone to do the same. My philosophy is that all human beings are equal, and what kind of human being am I if I can't give someone else just one minute of my time to reply to what they said?

Anyway... we've DM'd each other on IG a few times in the past. No big deal. Last time I DM'd her was a bit over 2 weeks ago. She replied to my first message, and I messaged her a second time and she ignored me. Didn't even look at my message. Ouch, oh well. Guess she is busy. We saw each other a few hours later and she continues our conversation that she ignored. Okay, that's weird. No biggie. A little over two weeks later and you still didn't even open my message. And it isn't because she is flooded with DM's, I saw her inbox that one time (by accident, I wasn't actively looking over. Her phone was in front of me.) She gets like 2 DMs a week, and the only person she ignored was that one creeper. Well when I messaged her yesterday guess what, ignored lol. I posted something on my story and she saw my story, and you can see the icon on instagram when someone is active. So yeah, she ignored me. Guess I'm a creeper.

Now you might be thinking ""oh well it is just instagram, who cares. You're overthinking it."" It is the fact that she ignores creepers on social media... and she ignores me on social media. K then.

Now you might be saying ""well I am hearing your side of the story, if she tells her side it is probably completely different and you are actually a creeper"" blah, blah, blah... Yes I understand that there are ""nice guys"" and shit like that, but I assure you I am not like that. I never pressured her into anything or asked her for anything. I never tried to make her feel guilty or anything, I have accepted the fact that it is a possibility that I am the problem and that she isn't. I honestly have no idea what I have done wrong. She has two personalities, one that makes me happy and one that makes me hate myself.

So yeah. As I said I don't have to date her to be happy, I am just fine being friends. In fact, she called me her friend a few days ago. But I've been a creeper for at least two weeks now. She has two personalities, and a lot of people (most people) at work don't like her because she is bossy and uptight. We don't work in the same department so she isn't bossy to me, but when she is her other self she definitely is uptight. So maybe she is the problem? I would honestly rather it be me who is the problem because I can't stand the fact that this person I fell for could be such a cruel person. Why would she have these two different sides to her, one that she shows when we are alone and another when we are with different people?

The answer is simple. She is manipulating me emotionally. So I gotta let go. I read \[this\]([https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Loving-Someone-Who-Doesn%27t-Love-You](https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Loving-Someone-Who-Doesn%27t-Love-You)) and it says to get rid of mementos of her. I guess that would mean unfollow her on Instagram and snapchat and delete all the photos I have with her (the ones we took when she was her usual self). I can't do that though. I like her regular self far more than I dislike her other self, but nowadays she is becoming her other self to me more and more often.

273,"I'm having an extremely difficult time dealing with my husband's ex. They have a child together and she has been relentlessly harassing us. I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with a similar situation and what they did about it.

She made a fake plenty of fish dating profile of me a few months ago and while pretending to be me, sent my husband's friend a message. The message was talking about how I wanted to sleep around behind my husband's back etc. I was furious and called the police to make a harassment report. They linked the IP address to her computer and she got charged with disorderly conduct. 

There was a time that my husband went to pick his daughter up. We were going to go to our cabin,  so we had our bags packed in his truck.  I wasn't in the car at the time for obvious reasons, but she saw my pink bag.  She freaked out, snapped both of my husband's fishing rods, called him every name in the book,  took their daughter and left.  She kept the child away from him for 4 months until he spent thousands of dollars to a lawyer to gain partial custody. She also called the police on him, telling the police that he was hitting her etc. The police threw out the case because there was a camera in the parking lot of their exchange showing that she lied. 
 
Yesterday, my husband made a last minute doctor's appointment for his daughter and legally, he has to let her know. I was with because we didn't think she would show up at the doctor's with such short notice but she did. She saw that I was there and immediately snatched the child, walked up to my husband and was screaming and swearing in his face the entire doctor's appointment (all while holding the child). It was embarrassing. She was calling him a piece of shit husband and how dare he bring her daughter around me (even though I'm his wife?).

She has punched him and hit him in the balls. She has called him every name in the book. She has broken his belongings. She's been late during their exchanges most days.  This is a regular occurrence. We have phone recordings and police statements about these things but yet she seems to be getting away with everything. 

She doesn't take good care of the child either. The daughter shows up dirty, unbathed with matted hair all the time.

In Minnesota, women have all the power in custody battles. My husband is a great father. We have a child of our own together. The ex is just bitter because we got married and she obviously isn't over him. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? Is there something further we can do in court? I feel hopeless and its been very tough on our marriage. Thanks in advance.

My friend must have been looking through my profile (I didn’t know anyone knew my account) and found it 32 hours later (it was completely burried. No way he found it casually browsing any subreddits. 

Ive since apologized and there’s nothing more I can do but give it time. It kills me to know something I put out in the world caused someone I care about pain.

284," I didn't give it much thought to it  when we first met, but sometimes we have fights or discussions: she is convinced that standard medicine is basically harmful, and that big pharmas cover up the side effects or change the results of scientific research, so those arguments are useless with her. Consequentially, she only uses all natural products.

I'm not against that, to an extent I agree with the overuse of medication and antibiotics, but she is pushing it to the limit, making an argument for very unusual methods of treating more serious diseases like cancer. Sometimes she tries to convince me to not take medications or use her natural things, and I agree most of the times, if I find it right, but recently she challenged the opinion of my doctor, which I just could not stand.

About vaccines, I cannot find any common ground, she is certain that they are either useless or harmful, despite the proof that I tried bringing up. I am getting concerned for the future.

Most of these ideas come from her parents and family, who is involved with natural cures. 

What do you think I should do about this situation? Should I confront her? Should I oppose to her attempts to make me use her medicines? 
 I am concerned for her safety too, since she sometimes won't take some medicines because she thinks they are harmful. ",01Aug2018,3

I've been on dates- but they grow awkward, especially after a few when there's the expectation of moving forward. I've never been in a relationship, I hate kissing and with a couple exceptions that's about as far as I've gone despite being almost 25.

I'm sure this is related to social anxiety on some subconscious level, but I'm not sure how. I've been told it may be a physical result of trauma, being unable to create sensations to match my feelings (making them there, but hard to recognize). I've also done a lot of roleplaying characters in relationships online since I was a teen, which has turned into a safety blanket. Visualizing myself loving and being loved only feels natural when I'm pretending to be someone else.

Has anyone else been through this? Did you fix it, and if so how? I would love to date, there seems to be lots of benefits, but I just can't fathom it. The rare occasion where people are flirting obviously enough for me to pick it up makes me want to turn tail and run, I just don't know how to react; it's so obvious I'm not feeling what they feel, that it makes me uncomfortable.

**My boyfriend and I are together for a couple of years. He works together with a single straight female colleague for 2 years. I never liked her and I feel like she wants my boyfriend since the start of their working relationship. I have never seen the girl in real life. I want to make a summary of things that made me believe he is cheating on me. Mostly include text conversations of them. I know it's a long story and I am sorry for that. By the way, my boyfriend is a very social goofy/clown person so please keep that in mind.**

* Text conversation: Girl; talking about this game. Bf; did you enjoy the game? Girl; nah i wasnt feeling overwhelmed by it. Bf; No because you are only overwhelmed by me LOL. Girl; hahah. Bf; yeah sure, thanks for the confidence boost :D
* Text conversation: Girl sends a pic of her TV screen around 5PM, she laid in bed, you can see a bit of the bed on the photo. My boyfriend reacts: also nicely cozy in bed -crying of laughter emoji-
* Text conversation: Girl talks about how she lives at her grandma for a while and that her grandma is out now. Boyfriend reaction: also nicely home alone -big smile emoji-
* My boyfriend claims he never went to her house, ever. I found a text message that follows: Girl tells that they put her dog down. Boyfriend reacts shocked. She says: you have seen her, how old she looked and such. This made me believe he went to her house and see the dog. She couldn't bring her dog to work and they don't have social media, also I did not found any pictures of the dog on his phone or conversations about the dog. I got super mad and asked if I could send the girl a message to ask how many times he visited her house, and he refused that. He said that would be a super weird question and he didn't want to involve her in the situation. He says he doesn't mind if I meet her though. He wants me to introduce to her in real life, but I am afraid I can't keep my cool and beat the girl down.
* She has called him a few times around 9/10 PM, but he never answered the calls.
* They text at least 4-5 days a week. I told him that it makes me uncomfortable and he says it's just a colleague and he is not willing to cut it down.
* Apparently a year ago they wanted to meet up to eat ice cream and play video games at her house, they made an appointment but he didn't show up. (I only know this because I've read the conversation a couple of weeks ago. He never told me this. He says he wanted to get rid of her whining about meeting up, and that's why he made the appointment )
* She came back from a 5 week holiday and he said he missed her.

**Now there are some few positive things to the situation.**

* She has send him a bunch of selfies. Some show her legs(she showed a cocktail) or her thigh.(she showed her PC) . He did not respond to these selfies, or just a very dry reaction.
* He doesn't use blush or kisses or hearteyes emoji's or something like that. He use that a lot with me and his (male)friends. He also don't call her babe, sexy, hot, or whatever.
* About a year ago he tried to bring her together with a friend of his, but his friend totally screwed up.

**I know it's a long story. But I hope someone can give me advice about this. I feel really messed up at the moment.**",01Aug2018,1

296,"Hey

For the last 2 weeks ive been on a trip to the usa (washington and new york city). When we were checking in i made eye contact several times with a girl i saw. I was instantly blown away by here face, seriously i havent seen someone so cute and pretty in a very long time. I instantly fell in love with her and atm i cant stop thinking about it. For the couple days i made eye contact with here a lot of times so i kind of know she might be interested too. I wanted to ask her for her number but havent had a chance to get to speak to her. I REALLY want to tell her how pretty she is.

Its 12:45 now and im leaving to the airport to fly back at 17:00. Im just chilling around in the hotel lobby right now desperately waiting for her to walk by. 

Is there ANY way for me to find her on social media? I know theres like 0% chance i ever see her again, which sucks, but i can accept that. But that doesnt take away my strong urge to tell her about my feelings (or at least that shes the cutest girl i ever saw in my life)

The hotel im talking about is the Holiday Inn in manhattan on the 29th street near 7th Ave. 

I have mixed feelings about this. At one side i feel extremely happy to have witnessed someone so nice. But at the other side the fact that the next like 2 months she will be on my mind with nothing for me to do with it, cant even look at a photo or something, and its going to ruin the rest of my free time from school because the thought of just leaving this for what it is horrifies me. On top of that i almost havent eaten anything for the last 2 days, its really taking away my appetite. I honestly didnt believe in love at first sight before this but now i havent been so desperately in love with anyone ever. And i havent even talked to her it was just the eye contact that did the trick.

Shes a relatively short girl, a bit dark blonde (not brown), an extemely beautiful face (although i might be biased because of the feelings, but shes really really pretty), and anywhere between 15-20 years old.

300,"HELP ME

So the way it works, is today at 11 its my turn to register for one class, and everyone does the same at an assigned time today. Basically to ensure everyone gets their priority class. And then on august 3rd, we get another time assigned, and we chose the rest of our classes.

Since im an incoming freshman, i have a freshman class automatically assigned, so i need 3 more classes picked out.

My goal for a schedule is (college counselor said it was good:

Quantitative Reasoning

Psycology

Painting

Freshman class

which would end up as:

Monday/Wednesday:

Psychology 9:10-11:10

Quantitative Reasoning 10:20am-11:20am

Freshman class 1:50-2:50

Tuesday Thursday:

Painting 9:40-12:10

but the problem is art classes and psychology classes both fill up really fast. If i chose psychology today, theres a big chance i wont get art, and if i pick art i probably wont get psychology.

Theres only 3/16 spots in the art class, (i think non freshman already registered)

Theres only 3/16 in the back up ceramics class i chose (not really a great back up)

Theres only 20/40 spots in the intro to psyc class

Im not sure what my backup would be for either of these classes. The art class might be easier to replace since i could just literally any tuesday thursday class, but id have to find a morning class to replace psych which might not be too hard.

(SIDE NOTE: the reason i want psych is because i might want to peruse that major, this class was going to be a testing to see if i like it. I wanted to take painting because its fun and ive never taken a painting class, only drawing and ceramics)

My counselor at first suggest i chose psych, but also said if i really want the art class and am willing to risk it, i should chose art.

316,"Hello Reddit users! I'm brand new and decided to join the community, looking forward to being apart of this community!

I figured what better way to find advice then here?

So I have been dealing with this dilemma for the past couple months or so and I am not sure what to do...

Apologize for the long post...

**BACKGROUND**

I had a horrible break-up last year. After 5.5yrs, my fiance suddenly called it quits then went out with another guy less than two months later. We were both 24 at the time. I was emotionally devastated and even went to therapy. It wasn't all bad. I learned a lot about myself, went on a lot of dates (\~35), made new friends, re-connected with old friends, excelled at my job, etc.

**THE BEGINNING**

I met my current girlfriend \[24/F\] on Bumble. I have been in a relationship since the end of March. She first started out as a little timid and shy. Then she eventually came around. I remember really liking her in the beginning, she matched me on paper perfectly. She is incredibly mature, has the same values on drugs/drinking as I do, has a good education, is pretty, has her own place, has a nice job, etc. I was so excited to finally meet a non-crazy girl, then I quickly asked her out within a couple weeks of dating. In retrospect, I feel I may have rushed into this...

**THE FLAWS**

After a few weeks, she told me that she has never had a relationship past 3 months. She said that she has a tendency to find flaws in people then immediately leave. This worried me. She also stated that she has only had multiple ""flings"", in an effort to protect herself from heartbreak. She was (at the time) a virgin. She wanted to wait until she was ""in love"" to have sex with someone. Then she became a little clingy after awhile, which turned me off.

In short: her lack of relationship experience, sexual experience and clingyness ultimately turned me off. However, her maturity and other adult-like characteristics made me keep her around.

**THE TEMPTATION**

There was a girl at work that I always thought was very attractive but she never seemed available. One day, we started chatting and she wondered if I wanted to grab a drink with her (this was around mid-April). I agreed and we went downtown after work. We discovered that we had a lot in common (i.e hobbies, future vision, interests, etc). We literally have the same sense of humor, which made the night to be so much fun. We talked until the bar closed and went home.

I woke up the next morning wanting to see her again since I had so much fun.... this is where I knew I started developing feelings for this girl (let's call her ""A"").

Over time, I started finding out aspects of this girl that I had concerns with....

She is 27 and still lives at home, she claims that she does not make enough money ($35k/yr) to move out on her own and do the things she wants to do. Her friends sound a little wild, but she isn't that wild. She has a bigger dog, which gives me anxiety. I am usually never an anxious person and I don't mind dogs... but her dog frightens me because he is big, has a loud/scary bark and is unpredictable at times. Not to mention I am allergic to it. The thought of living with a dog makes me sick, but maybe that is because I never lived/grew up with one?

# ====TL;DR====

I have a girlfriend, which is everything I'm looking for on paper and is perfect moral match for me. She is pretty, smart and mature. However, I am far more attracted to work girl (""A"") and have far much more fun with her. I find myself looking forward to seeing work girl, while I feel ambivalent about seeing my girlfriend.

I do not know if they are ""true"" issues or not:

1. **Living Situation**
   1. Girlfriend \[24/F\] has her own place, work girl (""A"") \[28/F\] lives with parents - should I be concerned?
2. **Pets**
   1. Girlfriend has no pets, ambivalent about having one. Work Girl has a big dog and loves it. I am allergic to it and causes me anxiety. Do relationships with animal lovers &amp; animal haters ever work?
3. **The ""Spark""**
   1. I do not feel a ""spark"" with my girlfriend, while I feel a huge spark with work girl. Is this a sign or just lust/temptation?
4. **Interests**
   1. Girlfriend &amp; I don't really have simliar interests, other than relaxing &amp; watching movies. Work Girl has all the same interests I do.
5. **Humor**
   1. Girlfriend is sarcastic, but she gets offended easily. Work Girl has the EXACT SAME sense of humor I do, great laughs
6. **Feelings**
   1. Girlfriend admitted to being ""in love"" with me, even though she has never been in love before and hasn't had a relationship longer than 3 months (our is going on 4). I do not feel the same way, either because my 5.5yr traumatic breakup has created an emotional wall or my feelings are contaminated from work girl.

317,"Yesterday, my application got accepted and the employer wanted to schedule a interview. I replied and said ""okay any time is fine just let me know when"". They didn't respond until 8am today. They asked if I can come in today before 12pm. I said no because it's a short notice and I woke up at 10am, and asked them if we can do tomorrow. They said anytime between 11am and 3pm is fine and everything was dandy. Until I've come across this dilemma.

I hadn't had a haircut in two years and my hair is really freaking long. Being male, I feel like it should be appropriate to tidy up my hair and get a nice cut for the interview. I called in to my local salon ( the only decent one around here) and they said their appointments are full and I need to wait until 4pm tomorrow. I was surprised by this since I've always done walk ins when I get haircuts. Now my interview is at anytime between 11am-3pm tomorrow. Should I ask my employers to reschedule to Friday, or will that look really bad on my part? Especially since I told them I was available all week. It's a job at as a cashier at a hardware store so it's nothing high end or fancy, but I still really want to get this job. So should I reschedule to Friday or is that a horrible first impression? If yes, how should I approach this to save my already low chance of being hired? Should I tell them directly about my situation or is that a big no no?

And yes, I've realized I have horrible time management. I should've got the haircut way before I started applying for jobs. But now I'm in this dilemma. I need some advice or help.

Thank you for your time, any advice is appreciated.",01Aug2018,1
318,"My brother’s room is up on the third floor, (our attic is finished) and I’m not sure if he thinks we can’t smell it or something, but most days when we are home alone, I can smell him smoking. I don’t really have an opinion on smoking weed because I’ve never actually done it, so the only thing that really upsets me is that he is does it during the day almost every day. We have a younger sister too, who has complained to me about it more than once without her actually realizing it’s the weed she is smelling. 

My mom knows my brother smokes weed and I’m pretty sure he knows she does. I’m not really sure if he knows that I know. 

I don’t wanna ‘snitch’ on him to my mom because I feel like it would put a dent in my friendship I have with my brother. I also don’t know how I could confront him about it because I don’t wanna make a big deal out of it, but I also wish he could go somewhere else and do it because it really stinks up our house.

321,"Hi all! I would like some advice. My almost 2 year old's birthday party is this Saturday. We live in Wisconsin, and the weather will be about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, 55% humidity. There will be about 30 people including my family. Only a few kids. How much water should we buy to drink? We already bought five 12 packs of soda(so 60 cans total) and I'm making punch. We were going to buy like 4 cases of water (144 bottles total). My dad told me to buy double whatever I was thinking because it will be so hot. I think that's a huge overkill. I honestly think 4 cases is too much. My family doesn't drink bottled water at home, so I think it's a waste of money to have tons of extra water we don't need.

322,"Hey

For the last 2 weeks ive been on a trip to the usa (washington and new york city). When we were checking in i made eye contact several times with a girl i saw. I was instantly blown away by here face, seriously i havent seen someone so cute and pretty in a very long time. I instantly fell in love with her and atm i cant stop thinking about it. For the couple days i made eye contact with here a lot of times so i kind of know she might be interested too. I wanted to ask her for her number but havent had a chance to get to speak to her. I REALLY want to tell her how pretty she is.

Its 12:45 now and im leaving to the airport to fly back at 17:00. Im just chilling around in the hotel lobby right now desperately waiting for her to walk by.

Is there ANY way for me to find her on social media? I know theres like 0% chance i ever see her again, which sucks, but i can accept that. But that doesnt take away my strong urge to tell her about my feelings (or at least that shes the cutest girl i ever saw in my life)

The hotel im talking about is the Holiday Inn in manhattan on the 29th street near 7th Ave.

I have mixed feelings about this. At one side i feel extremely happy to have witnessed someone so nice. But at the other side the fact that the next like 2 months she will be on my mind with nothing for me to do with it, cant even look at a photo or something, and its going to ruin the rest of my free time from school because the thought of just leaving this for what it is horrifies me. On top of that i almost havent eaten anything for the last 2 days, its really taking away my appetite. I honestly didnt believe in love at first sight before this but now i havent been so desperately in love with anyone ever. And i havent even talked to her it was just the eye contact that did the trick.

Shes a relatively short girl, a bit dark blonde (not brown), an extemely beautiful face (although i might be biased because of the feelings, but shes really really pretty), and anywhere between 15-20 years old.

324,"I currently manage/captain a 7v7 coed soccer team that plays once a week. I’ve played in the league for a couple of years, and I manage/captain another coed team on a different night, so I have plenty of experience on this front with managing different egos and attitudes.

For this upcoming season, the league I compete in sent over to me a “free agent” to play on my team. In getting to know this person through both email and texting, one of the things they let me in on is that they’re gender fluid/non-binary, and this person may flip between being male, female, or somewhere in between on any given day, Furthermore, this person is very adamant on us considering her said gender and using the pronouns that associates with said gender, or none at all, at that given day.
This creates a few unique potential situations:

-	This person noted to the league that they’re gender non-binary and was not assigned a gender on the roster sheet for that reason. So technically I have this one player in a limbo situation and roster numbers of the day of the match may get wonky. 

-	One any given matchday, this person may go male (he/him) and skew our roster numbers unfavorably for both males and females. Since we roster already eight males, this person would be male number nine, and thus, males wouldn’t get much playing time, thus I’d get some very unhappy males barking at me. Same goes for the female side of things (we currently field 3 females plus this person).

-	If this person decides to go neither male or female (they/them), this person specifically insists on playing as such as gender non-binary. I honestly don’t know how to handle this, as it’s very obviously this person is going to be very mindful of how they’re presented by me and may create a bigger scene (I can’t tell if it’ll get to the levels of a SJW, but I’m not taking that risk).
 
-	The rules of the league is set up as such that you can up to five males on the field at any given point. There are no rules regarding gender non-binary or gender fluid players, and in discussion with the league managers, they doesn’t seem to have been any previous precedence regarding what to do in such a situation. 

I feel like I am walking on eggshells with this person and I don’t want to create any issues or problems both with my team and the league. I’m also using this as a way for me to open my eyes and mind on the whole concept of gender fluidity and gender non-binary, so I am using this person to help determine how I should sway my worldview on the subject one way or another. With that said, any advice or guidance would be wonderful on how to handle this situation.  ",01Aug2018,0

327,"My parents divorced when I was a toddler, and for most of my childhood my father did not really participate in decisions regarding my life (an important note is that my mother and I lived in another country during this time). Now that we moved back to the same country and live one state away I have been able to see my dad much more often and he has become more involved. Im very happy about this, but the issue obviously arises when a decision of his about me contradicts my mom's.
Example: I currently have an old beat-up car that my mom wants to sell since it is constantly breaking down and the cost to fix it has been adding up substantially. She wants to buy a newer car that will that won't have that kind of cost and that can last for a throughout college. My dad disagrees and says that they shouldn't get a new car because I need to learn the value of things. I completely understand his point, and its not like I am brat that expects to get stuff given to him. But keeping my old car means my mom has to bear all the costs of it because my dad doesn't pay for any of them (repairs, insurance, etc.).
 To complicate things, my mom gets mad in response because she says that he didn't help out when I was growing up and now that I'm raised he intends to participate. Also, my dad doesn't make any decisions without consulting my stepmom, while my mom does I understand her frustration, but I also think that my dad has a right to weigh in nonetheless. 
So in conclusion, idk how to deal with this situations like these and I often have to act as a kind of intermediary between both of them.

328,"I'm a full-time college student in my sophomore year. (Started college late, I'm 26)

Currently, I am working at a law firm as a receptionist, full-time. (Have been here for about 5 months)

Pros:  
\- Guaranteed salary pay every month.  
\- Health Insurance paid by employer.  
\- Off on all major holidays.  
\- Guaranteed hours.  
\- Plenty of time to catch up on homework at work.  
\- Looks good on my resume.

Cons:  
\- Never have anything to do. (Unless there is unfinished schoolwork in the spring and fall)  
\- Difficulty requesting time off.   
\- Only make bare minimum of what's needed for bills and groceries.  
\- Tuition is more expensive because of only being able to take online classes.  
\- Can't leave desk.

My previous job was at a well known restaurant in a busy city. (Worked here for about a year and a half)

Pros:  
\- Pay is fantastic for most of the year.  
\- Co-workers are more relate-able.  
\- Flexible schedule. (Willing to work around class schedule, and easier to request time off)  
\- Can walk around inside or outside as I please.

Cons:  
\- Slow season in the summer.  
\- Not great for resume.  
\- Can be frustrating at times.

Some things that are also important:  
\- My partner works at the restaurant. It would be much better for our lives to have the same schedule.  
\- Working both is not an option. We have pets to take care of, and we live too far away to make a quick lunch trip home.  
\- Even in the slow season, my partner was doubling what I make at the law firm.  
\- I'm not the type that likes to sit around all day.   
\- My college has a student services program where I can see a doctor if needed.

329,"So..This is a novel and I apologize, but theres no other way to explain for the advice I seek in particular. 

 I met a girl fairly recently, and we haven't hung out too much, but she seems to really dig me. I think she's cool, but I'm not like.. head over heels or anything. Im more focused on me (Im 25 M By the way). 

So she comes to me after a night of hanging out and we have a good time and all that, and she's nervous to show me a ""proposition""...shows me 2 tickets to possibly my favorite band of all time. (The Distillers) I have always wanted to see them. 

It's in Las Vegas. It's September 20th (They were 30 bucks a piece, so it's not like unreasonably generous for a fairly new friend/lover)

I showed her this band and she fell in love with them just as I am, and also throws in that she has family there as well she is meaning to visit. So we can crash there too, for basically free. She says she's going, and that one of these tix is for me, should I accept.

The back story.

5 or so years ago I had a bit of a melt down, and developed some interesting ""phobic"" behaviors, I guess you could call them that. As well as a TON of anxiety, panic attacks etc. etc.

Fears including... Traveling too far from home, letting other people drive (not being the driver), eventually elevators? weird... and pretty much any form of forced closeness or being ""stranded"". (PS was always sort of scared of heights.) I had no confidence, and pretty much no understanding of my emotions or what/why I was feeling this way.

Ive been in therapy for this more than 6 months now,  and I have figured a TON of shit out. I feel the best I have since... maybe ever mentally/emotionally. In the years since the ""breakdown"", I quit smoking/pot,  started-run a little personal training business, train Brazilian Jiu jitsu regularly, meditate daily (just a little capsule to articulate that Im not some helpless lunatic... atleast anymore lol and that I have made a stable little leap from that bad place)


The present

As I hold these tickets, it feels like a surreal treasure. Like tickets to a future I was promised I'd never dare to have. A dream come true.  It seems like fate to do this, and my gut tells me now is the time. Now or never. 

I tell this girl yes.

Soooo, Im terrified. Not really, just incredibly nervous, but I think a fair amount of that is excitement. This feels like the beginning of a new chapter, like some grand adventure that finally ""frees"" me from this bubble I've been trapped in by my own design.

The advice. 
I am trying not to think about it too much. Ive also decided not to tell anybody. I feel like it will add pressure. (I quit smoking pretty much in silence and it went well.) Plus I feel like part of my phobic shit is about my parents (go figure) and my moms inability to let go and not worry/make ME worry. 
Im worried I will freak out on the flight, revert or regress back into some former existential crisis, and face all of those old, inexplicable feelings of doom and hopelessness that Ive crawled away from slowly for years. I also worry I'll land in Vegas with this dread, and be too frightened to board the flight back home (hilariously irrational). Im ALSO worried that I'll get to Vegas and feel lost, alone and scared, and that will suck. I have no post therapy reference!

So based on ALL of this (sorry again) what do you guys think? Any advice for a first time traveler in general? Am I nuts for doing this with a girl Ive only known a couple of months? Do the Distillers actually suck and I just can't hear it? Am I being over dramatic about my fears? 

Thank you so much if you even read this. it feels very, very good to finally tell somebody. ",01Aug2018,1
330,"Background: we started dating early 2015, met for the first time June 2016. I broke up with him fall 2016 because of distance (that was our only problem he would get frustrated that I wasn’t there with him). We still talked a lot almost daily. Come late 2017 early 2018 I encourage him to go out with someone else. He was still my best friend and he was still sending me emails saying he misses everything about me and that he loves me. 
June of this year, I realized I made a big mistake and that I’ve always loved him. But now he tells me he is in love with someone else who lives near him. He’s been talk to her for over 8 months but they still aren’t dating (boyfriend and girlfriend officially). She very shy, in her late 20’s and not sexual at all. As in she’s just not comfortable with it. But he is very sexual.
I though I could win him back because we might have had distance problems but that was the only problem, it’s a fixable problem. But you can’t make someone sexual. And a relationship like that would have more problems than we ever did. 
Today he told me he asked her if he could send her a link to a video on an adult website. She said sure. He said he’s trying to get her more comfortable with it.

When I first left for college, I was so excited to be away from home and my freshman year was mostly good. as the years went on in college, I struggled to get by just like any other college student. I would think back about the brat I must have been to take everything I had back home for granted. The later years of college were not so great and I couldn't wait to leave that place. I had been really excited to come home and work on myself. I wanted to get really in shape as I had been feeling pretty poor about myself after a recent break up. I just was so motivated to change who I was. I always kept to myself at home. Just to give an idea of our family dynamics, it's my younger sister (4 years younger), father, mother, and myself in the immediate family. 

Yesterday I was upset at my mom because her and my sister keep doing this thing where they go out and have lunches with my sister's boyfriend. For the 5th time since ive been back, they'll offer to bring me back food and 2 hours later, they come back without anything for me and some excuse. I was't upset because I expect to be brought food, just that i'm on a very strict diet to gain weight (i'm severely underweight) and i'd rather them just not offer so I could make something at home instead of waiting two hours for nothing. Regardless, I was not that upset. I was mildy annoyed and showed it on my face. They come back, no food so I start prepping some pasta and a protein shake to make up for it. I make some petty comment (annoyed but genuinely just trying to be funny) then all of a sudden she swings the pan she had just started washing at me. My sisters boyfriend was home and she immediately put the pan down before it touched me but it was really close. I was shocked. I haven't had someone try to hit me since I was a kid. Then I realized, she was the only person who had. I remembered every time she left marks on my face and body. I remembered the times she mocked me when I said I would call the police. How she said i'd be put in foster care just like my cousin. I turned into a kid again and I did something I have never ever done in my life. I cussed at my mom. I told her I hated her for hitting me as a kid and how terribly it felt. I told her it broke my heart that she even felt the desire to swing at me like that again. Then I packed a backpack and left.

333,"21/F

I went to a different country and continent to study for 2 months. It wasn’t my intention to stay much longer than that but as I was about to leave I met my current partner. 

He has been separated for two years but isn’t divorced yet (he’s taking care of it though). It wasn’t a big deal at first as I was trying to see where things were going. 

I ended up overstaying my visitor visa and I’m at risk of not being able to go back and visit him anytime soon. I also don’t have qualifications to apply for a decent job there and go through a working visa. He can’t move to my country and live here with me because he has a stable life and job there. This makes marriage being the only thing that would allow us to finally be together again. My problem with it is:

• He never mentioned being interested in getting married anytime soon. I don’t know if he wants to get married right after getting a divorce

• We have been dating for 7 months only, but lived together for 6 and we’ve seen it works. 

• Being the second wife is something that mildly bothers me, but my main problem is probably not having a planned wedding that both our families can attend (unlike his previous wedding). Also having to rush it and not making a decent party out of that. 

• I don’t really care if I’m the one proposing and I don’t need him on his knees with rings and shit, but it would be cute if I could propose at least later on in the relationship, in person and while having a nice dinner. I find it kinda lame to just be like “yeah, should we consider marriage?” like it’s something we just wake up and decide to do. 

• What if he says no or avoids that option? He stated that he won’t loose me and that we’re meant to be together so we’ll figure it out, but not knowing if he thought about it at all makes me very anxious as I don’t know if he would say yes. 

I’m also very young and I’m scared that he won’t take me seriously. I know that regardless of the kind of wedding, this is still a big step but I’m aware of that and I’m sure this person is worth fighting for. 

My biggest fear is knowing that if he’s not willing to marry anytime soon, the chances of us being together are non existent because we’re not willing to stay on LDR for more than a couple months, and I also have a life that I cannot sacrifice for an illegal status in a random country for god knows how long. 

How should I even approach them? Is there any chance of turning this whole “we need to get married asap or I won’t be able to see you for god knows how long” into something more meaningful and romantic without the whole legalization process directly involved? Fml",01Aug2018,0

I’ve only worked for this company for three years, and I just thought that the manager would either say something upfront about a bonus, or just include it in the Christmas paycheck. 

....

Well now, we just got word from our boss that there will be no bonus this year and next because of a “project to be revealed down the road”. This means I’m now out $10,000 in bonuses from the last two years, and that it’s going to be four years of no bonus. 

I haven’t asked my manager about this situation yet, I know that the bonus payouts I’ve missed, but I was looking at my the written agreements prior to me signing on with the company, and things such as the new “project” are grounds to remove annual bonuses due to monetary outlays that come about. 

The only other things that I see that will be against me are that annual bonuses can be declined by the employee, but there’s no specification as to *how* they would be declined. It doesn’t say anything about how the bonus offers be administered.

338,"I can't tell if I'm acting entitled or if my family really is shitty to me.

I was the oldest of my four siblings and as you can imagine I took up a lot of responsibility with them . I was a live in babysitter, house cleaner, dinner maker. Getting into my teenage years I would not be able to do things with friends because my mom needed me to babysit. The essence was that I was in the family, so I took up those responsibilities as well. 

I recently became a single mom after leaving my 2 kids' father after an unhealthy 7 year relationship. I receive no assistance in supporting my kids from their father, emotionally or financially.  Which I realized I was just forced to accept and I powered through it. 

Though Recently after falling into a bad financial spot, I began to reach out to my mother for some help when it comes to my kids. My mom has never worked, and most of her days are in front of the TV. She's about 48. 

My family and I both live in the same town and I work full-time for a non-profit in a neighboring town, about a 15 minute commute. What I have to do is extend my lunch break (lose money)  to drive back down to the highway and pick my daughter up from school, then back to work. So instead of work-home. It was work-home-work-home. Murdered my gas tank. 

I asked my mother to help me up with pick ups. I was flooded with excuses like, ""I have to go to the grocery store today"" and just really generic stuff which would hurt my feelings because I know she has no pressing matters. She just literally doesn't feel like it. I stopped asking. 

A few months go on and my mom calls and says things like, ""maybe Ill pick up the kids"" and stuff like that but I never held her to it nor told my kids in fear of getting them excited. and I was ok with. 

I have recently asked for her to babysit more so 1) I can work and odd job. and 2) just have be able to spend a few hours with some friends and escape the single mom life for a few hours. Nothing drastic, like maybe 4 hours a week. 

It really does hurt. I did so much care for my younger siblings. My mom had it so easy having four kids because she had me. She never had to go in a grocery store with kids because I was there to either wait in the car with them or at home. She wouldnt have to get out of bed some nights because she could call for me to get up and make a bottle. The list goes on and on and I just feel so heartbroken that when I ask for help with my 2 kids, her grand kids that she posts about how much she loves and their ""her world"" yet lives a 5 minute drive from them and doesnt see them. 

I know my kids are my responsibility. Just I can not help but be really resentful to have my mother live in the same town as me, seeing how hard I work, and just not even say ""Good job"". Am I entitled? Or has my mom really just....used me. ",01Aug2018,1

340,"Hello. I’m a 16 year old girl about to go into my junior year of highschool. I got a 4.0 GPA freshman year, but during the beginning of sophomore year, my mother relapsed (alcoholic) and everything seemed to fall apart from there. My depression came back full swing, and I missed a few days simply because I couldn’t motivate myself to get out of bed. My father isn’t around much, so it was up to me to keep an eye on my deadbeat mom. Make sure she didn’t get another dui. That type of thing. To top it all off, I relapsed with bulimia, and dropped 20 pounds in about a month. I quit doing my homework and studying; I never did my AP world homework either. It was just an awful year overall. Anyways, I ended up getting a C in every class besides Art, Spanish, and English. When summer began, I was ashamed and depressed; I’d always dreamed of joining a police academy or going on to a college and getting a degree in criminal justice. I just feel like my dreams are shattered. I passed geometry by 1%. I just... I was so overwhelmed last year and I guess I shut down. My overall gpa stands at a 2.9. I’m just... god, I don’t know what to do. Will I be able to repair this in the next two years? What can I do?",01Aug2018,1

342,"Preface: My wife and I live in the United States, and she was contacted today a company based out of Australia about a job for an office they're opening in our city in a few weeks.

So, my wife gets an text from a company this morning, claiming that they would like to interview her for a position within their company.  The position will start off as a work-from-home situation, and then ultimately work in an office once they get their office operational in our city.

My wife sent me the entire dialog of their interview, which was  done over a web app, ""app.wire.com"".  The interview seemed fairly straight forward, lots of typical interview questions.  She finished the questions, and after about 20 minutes or so, they sent back saying that they would like to offer her a job.  They then sent a whole bunch of stuff about what the company stands for, what they do, how the company makes money, etc.

They then say that tomorrow they will send a job offer letter, Code of Conduct, USCIS Form I-9, and W-4 forms will be sent in an email tomorrow, and within 2 weeks we will receive hard copies as per ""Quality Compliance purposes"".  The last part makes me feel like this is fairly legitimate; I work in a company that manufactures electronics and every year we have compliance audits for various electrical standards, and this kind of thing strikes me that they're running a legitimate business.

The next thing they asked is how my wife would like to be paid, weekly or bi-weekly and check or direct deposit.  They also asked with banking institution we are with.  They never asked for account or routing numbers.  The only information they have requested from my wife was her full name, her cell phone number and our mailing address.

After that, everything was pretty much a list of duties, which fits well within the realm of an administrative assistant job (that's what they claimed the position was for, and the duties match what I'd expect).

The conversation ends with saying that she is to report online tomorrow at 9:00AM for tasks and to get the paperwork rolling for the job.

---

So.  Sorry, for the long introduction there.  I just wanted to give as much background as to what my wife experienced, and I want to get some tips on how we can proceed to know whether this is legitimate.

I'm a little concerned at how quickly they decided to hire her, and I'm also a little weary about the hourly rate they quoted her to be making.  They stated the pay rate was $30.25/hr, and I'm not sure whether that is AUD or USD.  USD it comes out to around $22.44/hr.  The first figure sounds pretty high for someone doing an administrative assistant job, the second figure sounds a little more believable.

Is there anything we can do on our end to prevent being scammed?  She got this job throug Ziprecruiter, and the only thing I can think to do is to contact Ziprecruiter and get some kind of verification that they're a legitimate business.  They also have a website that looks like they're running a real business, and they even show up in the Australian stock exchange.

Am I just being paranoid?

343,"On mobile, expect terrible formatting.

Ive always had a fear of not seeing all of something. The darkness, deep water, slightly opened doors all freak me out. I’ve generally got it under control but sometimes I panic. Being in complete darkness makes me think someone/something is moving around in the dark. (You know how it seems the darkness “moves” when you stare at it too long? That.) Too long and I rush to turn on a light, sometimes bringing me to tears. With pools it’s a similar situation, when I swim (my father was a brilliant swimmer and he wanted me to learn how to swim as well, since we live in an area with a lot of lakes, rivers, and beaches) I sometimes feel like there’s something underneath me (squid, octopus, shark, whale, etc.) that’s going to come up and take me underwater, regardless of what I’m swimming in. This leads to me frantically looking around and swimming as fast as I can to get out of the water. When I was younger and taking swim lessons, I would freak out and get out of the pool and not get back in.

My parents were not very tolerant of this. Mental disorders are INCREDIBLY frequent in my family and I’m the only one without a disorder of some sort besides my mother, so my whole family thought I was just being dramatic and yearning for attention (which I did do often, but that wasn’t why I panicked). When I would have these “outbursts” they normally would forcefully have me do whatever it was I was afraid of.

I’m about to be on my own, but I still have these outbursts time to time. Am I being too dramatic? Are my parents to harsh? How can I deal with these outbursts?",01Aug2018,1
344,"Hi,

To cut a very long story short, I’ve suffered from severe mental health issues from the age of 17 til now 31.

I’m now in a place where I’m healthier than ever and I can’t wait to get out there. 

I’ve had a couple of jobs along the way and plenty of studying but this time I’m ready, I want that career, I’m healthier than ever and I want to start living life.

The problem is, I have never been one to bullshit myself into believing stuff like this as I have thought myself as a realist and honest that hard work will get rewarded down the line.  For example, my sister is going thru some very tough times and asked me for advice.  I told her what she needs to do to get back on her feet.  I was told by my wife that what my sister really needed was a shoulder to cry on.  Crying on my shoulder is not really going to fix the actual problem at hand but taking steps 1 to 5 will help.

347,"Hi reddit,

I need some advice, and hoping to get some good feedback. 

A couple months ago my dad told me he is going to marry his gf. A little backstory, I’m a mid 20s female, and an only child. I was raised in a 2 parent household, but saw the deterioration of my parents relationship around 6-7 years ago which lead to a separation. 

My dad cheated a lot , and I’m sure that was a big part of it as well as financial issues. But about 5 years ago they separated and went their own ways after 20+ years. By the way .. they were never married. Smh (I know ! ) During that time my dad met someone else but never introduced me to his gf. I was aware he was probably seeing someone else but didn’t press the issue. 

After the death of his uncle this almost 2 years ago who raised him, he began to bring the woman around more . His uncle left a house to him as he was living in it since the separation from my mom. He has since renovated it, and also moved her and her daughter into his home(After his uncles death) And fast forward to just a couple months ago, he told me he will be getting married to her next year. 

I just feel sick about the entire thing. I want him to be happy, but I almost feel like he’s starting over and starting a new family. We barely talk after being so close , but I started to keep my distance once I was aware his gf was around more and more. His now fiancé doesn’t even try to get to know me, while im his only kid. 

He hasn’t even told my mom yet about the marriage, which I have asked him to do because I really can’t bare to break it to her. 

Am I wrong for feeling some sort of way about this marriage ? I feel so upset for my mom , but they were both adults and I guess marriage or lack of was their decision. 

I just feel like I’m slowly loosing my dad. Or maybe I already have. His fiancé isn’t really nice from our limited interaction. She comes off with this attitude of being “untouchable” regardless of how I feel about her.

I like memes and I like absurd humor, sometimes I find myself watching crappy shows like Uncle Grandpa but I unironically enjoy them or playing videogames.

So Ive been going to the same hairdresser since I was 10. In the Netherlands hairdressers and barbers, as far as I know, are both refered to as ""kapper"". She is a lovely woman. My parents also get their haircuts there. The problem is I dislike my haircut. I am too scared to tell my parents I'd like a new hairdresser. We have a sorta a repore with her at this point.

I know it's her job so I shouldn't be embaressed to say ""I wan't something else please"" but I cant bring myself to. I don't suffer from an anxiety disorder or anything I'd just rather not bring this problem up with her.

356,"So this issue for me has its roots back in high school. I was raised a Protestant Christian by my family, went to church every Sunday, etc etc. But by the end of 10th grade I didn't really believe in any of it anymore, and spent the rest of high school as pretty much an agnostic/atheist and hid this fact from my family. 

When I moved on to college a couple years back, I was excited to not have to pretend anymore and to be able to live life the way I wanted to. This worked quite well for me in the beginning. Unfortunately, things started to change during the back half of my first semester. I started to have problems with panic and anxiety attacks. I had never had any sort of anxiety related issues before in my life, which made the appearance of these episodes all the more alarming. On top of this, a friend of a friend committed suicide and I found myself unable to stop thinking about death, a concept that hadn't really bothered me before, even after becoming an apostate. This was honestly the darkest time in my life, and was ruining college for me, which up to that point had been incredible.

I couldn't do the things I liked without the fear of having another attack. I stopped going to the gym, couldn't focus on my studies, and there was a point where I lost 10 pounds in a week. I was shaking all the time and I spent the majority of most days feeling terrified for no good reason. I couldn't take it anymore and I called my mom, hoping that she could help make it stop. She told me to seek out resources on campus such as counseling, but she also wanted me to try praying.

I took her advice, with respect to both counseling and prayer. I obviously didn't think prayer would do me any good, but I was so desperate at that point that I was willing to give anything a try. I began to pray again, and I made wagers to God like ""I'll give you another chance if you take my anxiety away"". One thing led to another, and gradually I began to improve. To this day I don't know why the attacks started or why they stopped, but I figured I would give Christianity a second chance since praying had brought me comfort, and I was curious about what Christian life on campus was like.

So I talked to one of my friends who I knew was a Christian and he invited me to one of his campus ministry's events. I went to a couple and fell in love; it was an environment totally different to anything I had seen at home (I had a lot of problems with our home church and there was no one my age there). The people I met were some of the nicest and most sincere I've encountered during my time at college, and I had a ton in common with many of them. I was inspired by other students and the staff in this ministry, and by next semester I was a Christian again.

Things were pretty sublime for the rest of the year. I had found faith again, my grades were much better, and I even met my first girlfriend. I became more involved in my ministry group to the point that I took on a leadership role last year, the beginning of my sophomore year. But in order to become a Christian again, I initially found myself having to suppress many of the doubts I had always had. I knew I had taken a massive leap of faith by ignoring them; the positivity that faith had brought into my life seemed like more than enough reason to ignore my doubts at the time. But over the course of my sophomore year these doubts lingered to the point where I knew I couldn't call myself a Christian anymore. I had found faith and lost it once again, all within about a year's time. 

I didn't tell anyone in the group about this. Fast forward to today and I'm a month away from being a junior in college. I spent the better part of last year faking it once again. I have met so many extraordinary people and friends through this group and through the church on campus I had started going to. But I know that at heart I'm not truly a Christian. Perhaps my initial re conversion came out of desperation. I know that it brought a lot of good into my life. But I can't continue to lie to my friends and those around me; it eats at me every day. I've stayed this long because I don't want to disappoint anyone, I don't want to let people down by walking away from my role in the group. But I'm also afraid that I'll lose the friends I've made if I leave. They're good, non-judgmental people but I know things won't be the same if I go. 

I want to walk away from the ministry group and from the church I started going to. I know I'm not a Christian anymore and the only way to be honest with myself and with others is to leave. But I don't want to lose my friends, and the further you are into college the harder it is to make new ones and join new groups. I've got to make a decision before August ends. What should I do?

357,"I've never had a great social life, but I have friends. Just no social circles. One problem is they are all scattered around and don't really know each other, but more importantly **they never want to do anything**. Obviously I made these friends because I used to never want to do anything either. 

I've been changing over the past year or so though. I want to do stuff, go out to bars and meet people, go to concerts, wander around the city, get out of my comfort zone. I've been hiding in my home, doing nothing all my life. I've had enough of it. None of my friends ever accept my invitations though. For example, I'm going to a concert in a few weeks. Tickets are like $20. I invited 5 people and they all got flakey and said stuff like maybe, but I know that means no. 90% chance I go alone which is ok because I love the band, but it's also frustrating. They're still my friends, and if I asked them to play a videogame with me, they'd say yes in a heartbeat.

I guess the reality is that I need new friends. I just don't know where to make them. I've tried doing things by myself, and sometimes it's fun but it'd be more fun with friends. And some things like going to bars by yourself is honestly just depressing

358,"Yesterday I left the town I live in, which is about 1 hour from my family, to head to my hometown to surprise my parents. During my 1 hour drive a huge rainstorm hit and I hydroplaned and totaled the car I was in. Now I’m stuck in a extremely negative state of mind. 

The car was a gift from my parents about 4 years ago so I could commute from work and college. It was a fairly nice 2011 Buick Regal. Very dependable vehicle and I was speechless when I got it back in 2014. 

I know my parents saved up for a long while to get this car because they don’t make a lot of money. They’re well off, but not drop $18k + interest out of nowhere well off. So to think all the work hours they put into that car and how I totaled it is really getting me.

Seconds ( probably like 30 seconds) before I hydroplaned I also told myself I should slow down because I knew the storm was getting worse. For some reason I didn’t slow down and just kept going. This is another reason why I keep beating myself up. Then to top it all off my girlfriend of 4 years was with me in the car and I didn’t once think about her safety! I just kept going. I put her life at danger and truly we’re lucky. Not a single scratch or bruise on us. 

Now I’m constantly beating myself up over not listening to myself. I feel like an inconsiderate selfish asshole because I didn’t consider anyone else that may be affected by what could happen. I just wanted to get to where I wanted to be without thinking about others.

I consider myself very lucky that the accident wasn’t bad enough to physically harm anyone. I know it could’ve been much worse. I just can’t help but think about the what - ifs. I destroyed something my parents worked so hard for and put the woman I love in a position that in others cases people have lost their lives. 

If you have some advice to help someone get out of a bad state of mind I’d really appreciate it. 

If you  have read this and got this point please be careful driving. Always be cautious and take your time. That place you’re heading to more than likely will be there when you get there even if it is a few minutes, hours, or days later. Also, when someone else is in the car with you... put them first. They place their life in your hands and one should not take that lightly.

364,"Helloo everyone! 

Using a throwaway account for this. Anyway, I am currently writing down my experiences from childhood and all that and just finished the introduction chapter and was wondering if anyone of you had any tips concerning style/word choice. Anything could help! 

Everyone has a story and it is about time that the world would hear mine. 

This book is going to try and understand all the sides of the things I experienced in childhood. While everything is tainted by time and a flawed memory I shall endeavour to stick as close to the truth of my experiences as I can recall it. 

There are several reasons why I am writing these things down and before going into the experiences themselves it is important for you, the reader, and for myself to figure out why I am digging up these skeletons. It isn’t that digging them up requires a reason, but it is important to figure out why you are reading this just as it’s equally important for me to figure out my motivation of writing. Whenever I feel continuing isn’t worth it anymore, looking at these reasons reminded me that it is in part healing and understanding that brought me to start writing in the first place. Just as it is important for the reader to understand the motivations as to why these words mean so much to me. 

First off, no one likes a sob story, so I am not going to let this be turned into one. I do not think that the experiences I gathered throughout my life have really been that horrific. If I hear stories from other people my heart tends to break. Nothing along those lines happened to me. Not even close. Yet they have impacted me in such a way that maybe, just maybe, writing these things down might just help someone, anyone to better understand the concept of abuse. 

Another fact is that I do not know what the results are going to be of writing these things down. Maybe once I am done writing I’ll print these pages out and ritually burn this entire paper to ash just to find some closure. Or that in a couple of years along the line, after I published it on internet or something, someone sends me an email stating how much it has helped them. I do not know. But the thought of it making a difference somewhere down the line for either others or myself is comforting enough for the moment to start writing.

These experiences have given me the ability to understand and maybe in part explain abusive behaviour of others. I am not a psychologist nor am I trained in the way the human mind works. What I noticed however is that my experiences have put me in a position where I am able to comprehend situations that would go beyond the ability of someone who didn’t suffer at the result of abusive behaviour by others. This level of understanding and comprehension is an ability that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I remember when I was 15 I had a friend who said that it would have helped if he could have suffered from abuse to a degree, to be able to help me and his then girlfriend. He did not mean that he wished he would have been abused in his life, not at all. My friend realised that he lacked the experience of abuse. He did not know what it was like to go through anything even remotely similar and that because he didn’t, he wasn’t able to understand, no matter how hard he tried. There is something to be said for a then 16 year old having levels of comprehension larger than most adults are able to show. Yet the fact is that understanding, true understanding, is above the pay grade of almost anyone you will encounter. Sadly enough most people say that they understand, but how could they? Abuse goes beyond the experiences themselves. As example, if you see a beautiful flower, you might get really happy, emotional, excited, in awe or anything really. You can tell someone how much seeing the flower impacts you. However, telling someone you saw a certain flower doesn’t mean that they instantly understand what it was like for you. They might have been used at a funeral for someone you loved or it was gifted to you by someone who meant a lot to you. How you connect the dots in your mind that other people didn’t even know existed is the reason they can’t ever truly understand. Even when you tell them about those missing links or experiences, they might still not get certain pieces of why it made you feel so happy, emotional or exited. Because if you would explain every single missing link of why something is important to you, you could be talking about seeing a flower for more than a day. Reaching full comprehension is something incredibly difficult to achieve even when someone went through the same experiences. Say they went with you to the funeral, they saw the same flowers yet they have nowhere near the same connection to it because the dots are differently aligned in their minds. So for them, even if they theoretically understand and maybe even point out the flower to you the next time you come across from one, the emotional experience of others will always be different than your own. It is the exact same thing when it comes to a story, your story of abuse. Others can understand, emphasise and feel your sorrow but they can never be in the same situation as you were. They can never live through what you have. They can never connect those subconscious dots in your mind; fill in those missing links because you don’t even know they exist in the first place and if you don’t know they exist, how can others possibly know them if you don’t tell them about it?

365,"So long story short, my ""friend"" if you want to call him that is on the local college football team. Needs to pass CIS150 to play this year, has failed it 3 times. I have a bachelors in CIS. Offers to pay me 10 bucks per assignment. I complete over 40 assignments, take the midterm and pass with 96 percent and do an extra credit assignment. Pays me half at the half way point. Refuses to pay me the rest, ignoring me etc.

Feel like exposing him to his professor/university if he doesn't pay. Don't really know him anyways. I got my degree. I'm good to go.

366,"I feel like the military is extremely corrupt and its too big and powerful.

I'm thinking maybe we should not need to expand it anymore or slow down the expansion. We are more than good enough to deal with Russia and I think unless we are in a war which we aren't we really shouldn't be spending on military too much, which both Trump and Obama do too much of. It feels good enough as is.

Instead we should focus on improving general technology. I think the US military should merely be self defense forces and that has plenty of room for expansion.

We've focused more than enough on getting into other people's shit.

I think if we did that we would have a better economy and then if we did need to get involved in World War Three, we would be more stable doing it, including the ally defense portion.

Is this an ok opinion to have to begin with? I always thought the military was corrupt but my parents want me to think we need to get involved in other people's shit.

I feel non-interventionist.

368,"Tl;Dr at the bottom. 

My parents are wanting a divorce or at least my mother is. I guess I should give some info about this so I'm sorry if there's mistakes or errors or whatever I'm just not sure how to feel or what to think or just I don't know. 

I've always been a neutral person as in I agree with what people say or I take a stance in the middle so I can avoid conflict but now I'll have to choose one or the other. 
I guess for some context I should say that I'm Hispanic and family just really matters in ours, specifically my mothers side and my fathers side (both are still mainly back in our home country). I feel like our family, my sisters, my parents and I just have no room in all this and it's sad. I hate it. We used to get along so well but now it's just I don't know. 

I guess it started last year or maybe two years ago I can't actually remember but my mother first brought it up to both me and my sisters that she wanted to leave and find a new place to live with her sister, my aunt, and us. 

She said the reasons were because my dad favors his family and that they treat ours badly. 
That she's the only one that cares about us, the kids, and that she's had enough of how my dad would always put his brother and work first and his family second. 
How her daughter, my sister, doesn't do anything around the house and it's his fault for never saying anything to her since she won't ever listen to her. 
How he treats us differently with her getting better treatment over me or my other sisters. (For the record she's a lazy slob that doesn't nothing around the house and demands everything, personally I just think it's puberty or a lack of discipline but who can say. Also he does somewhat treat us differently but that's just because I have no idea on how to approach my dad, how should I put it...? He speaks Spanish as do the rest of us but after years of having English speaking friends, rarely speaking Spanish outside of the home and being a recluse it isn't exactly the best so I brought that one onto myself by not knowing what to say or how to say things. He speaks some English but it's broken but enough for work and getting around but not enough for having the deepest of conversations with, when we talk it's mostly him speaking and me going ""uh huh"" ""yeah"" ""no"" or a short sentence back in Spanish so it's my fault on that)
His brother, my uncle, has lived with us for 8 years and she has a problem with it since he doesn't want to help my moms sister, my aunt, in her time of need.
She said that now that her sister is in her time of need, she just had a kid and the father likely already has another family since he only comes one or twice a month, and needs help but my dad wants her to move out since there's been some problems with money between them in the past and how she hasn't been paying for rent since an extra person costs more in the house. 
She's (my aunt)only just recently started working again to help with rent and this and that since she's been spending time with the kid and all that (getting back into being able to work, American maternity leave is just awful) so it's essentially a give and take relationship at home with her since she watches the youngest kid while no ones home and we watch hers while we're here and she isn't and that's how it's been for the longest time now. 
My mother also says that my father berates her on the amount of money she makes and other stuff like that (personally I've never heard either say that about the other). 
She says she's had enough of it all. 
My mothers problems basically boil down to ""Shes the only one that cares about this family and that our father doesn't since he only favors his (brother and his parents and family back in our home country)""
She just wants to be a good mom but doesn't want to deal with my dads crap any more.

My father has his own set of issues as well which I'll list below. 
My father is a workaholic, not like the Japanese where he's working to the point of killing himself but at least a 12 hour workday 6 days a week, which doesn't leave much time to spend with us usually (he works from 6 AM to 6/7 PM most days since everyone's busy at different times). 
He works a lot so that he can send me off to college and do something with my life (he wanted to become a doctor but life happens but he says he just as happy if not more just by being a father).
He says he cares about his family but because he doesn't want to own them anything afterwards (namely his parents and his aunts and uncles), how should I put it...? His brother, my uncle, and a few of his siblings are the ones he mainly gets along with in his family at least above the superficial level since they were all put to work at a young age on farms and from the bits and pieces I've heard him talk about himself I've put together that his parents were in an abusive relationship, one was a drunkard a good chunk of the time and the other neglected the the family a good chunk of the time as well so they had to they along to really survive (a few, at least 3 have died from various reasons at different ages, I think(?) one was at 7 (suffocated), another at 10 (animals trampling) and the last was at 19(tried saving another younger kid around age 12 from a snake and got bit, died shortly after because of he venom but he did kill the snake and save the other) he doesn't like bringing up his past but that's what I've gathered throughout  the years, there's a bit more but that's really the main gist of it. (So that's why my mother thinks he cares about his brother the most, because of his childhood) 
He wants me and my sister (the older one) to get along, we used to be like cats and dogs but now it's like oil and water as in we'll tolerate each other but we'd rather do our own thing. I get along with the younger one just fine though. 
He's adamantly trying to bring this family (ours) and our relatives (the ones that live in our general vicinity closer) since there was some falling out with each other's for some reason, he said he'd tell me when I'm older so for now I'm not sure.  What I do know is  just that he's very stressed out because of everything from work to family. 
He wants to bring his own family closer too (ours not the one back in our home country) since he wants to make it work and keep this family functioning just right, marriage kids and all. 
He wants to be nothing like his parents were which he's succeeded in (he's not a heavy drinker, he only drinks maybe two or three at the most but he can hold his liquor well and that's only at parties we hold at home so he can talk and get along with the others (he hates parties but he wants to bring others closer) and he's not abusive either, the only time I can remember getting hit by either of my parents was because I was a little shithead as a kid and my mother disciplined me once and that really straightened me out and same with one of my sisters (I don't know what happened but I all I know is that my youngest sister (5) started picking up terrible habits from the older one (12) and she lost her temper with her and he had to stop her) but he himself has never laid a hand on me or any of my sisters or mother for any malicious reason.
He just wants to be a good dad, but he does things his own way to try and help. 

In essence they both have problems that they keep bottled up and can't really see the others problems from their point of view so it's just a mess. 

My sisters are both young, one is 12 and the other is 5, I'm not sure how things will go for them but I want to be there if they need me to so I have to figure out what to do. 

I know I said I had to figure it out but I don't know what's next, any help would be really appreciated and I'm sorry if I don't get back soon enough it's just that I have work shortly after I post this. 

Tl;Dr: Parents probably having a divorce and I'm not sure what to do, I'll soon have to pick a side but I love both and since I've always been a neutral person I don't know what to do. Any help would be really appreciated. ",01Aug2018,1

371,"I play a smaller social game (around 100k players a month), and there's been a disturbing trend for years where people will advertise for underaged girls to send nudes to them, and/or have an explicit video chat with them, for in-game currency. Some of these girls are then blackmailed for their account info. I knew it was an issue, but I assumed that the moderators of the game were dealing with it. 

After talking to some other players I've discovered that they have not been taking actions against these accounts. There have been cases where there are players that only play the game to get CP, say this openly in-game, host events asking to ""buy"" nudes from underaged girls, and haven't been stopped after years of doing this. When the players are reported to the admins by multiple people on multiple occasions no action is taken against them. They either don't investigate the reports or they simply don't care.

372,"So this is an issue I don't have much control over, but I want to be as helpful as I can. Here's the information I have about this situation.

TL;DR - My young cousins are leaving to a small town of 300 in northern Canada which is known to have an alcohol and possible abuse problem. They probably will not fit in very well because their interests don't really line up with the cultural norm of the town, and I'm worried they might get bullied by the children there or possibly abused by adults. I'm looking for ideas on how I could help them or be influential to them. Also if you know of any other subreddits, posts, or sources that could help me out that would be appreciated,

Not TL;DR

So my cousin's mom has decided to move back to the small town she grew up in, and to bring her kids. The town is high up in northern Canada and has a tiny population of about 300. She had left because of abuse she endured as well as because of how normal alcoholism was there. She hasn't thought much about the effect this will have on her kids (my cousins) who are going to probably hit puberty within the next year or two (which isn't a very good time to cut them off from everyone and everything they know and love). She has full custody and it cannot be contended by my uncle (my cousin's father). My cousins are barely prepubescent and have never grown up in that culture. For people who don't know it's basically taking a person who has lived in a city all their life to live in an aboriginal reserve and expecting them to adapt to the culture (I'm not saying there's a problem with the difference in culture, just that it's going to be a hard to adapt to when they've never lived in that culture and are just coming up to puberty). I don't think they will fit in, and will be bullied for their differences (because children are good at bullying people based on their differences, as I've experienced in grade school). It also doesn't help that both of them are kind of introverted, the older one would rather draw than hang out with people. Neither of them really do physical activities for fun, I cannot imagine the older cousin would like hunting or fishing, and he also doesn't like that style of food. The news of the move is new to them as well and they are confused about the whole thing.

I can't just move there to help with them, but I want to do anything I can to make their time more enjoyable, less harmful, and/or more safe. I've come up with two ideas and would like more if possible.

1) Have regular communication with them, try to remain close and care about them. They have internet there so I could use Facebook messenger to communicate

2) Offer them a place to stay if they want to leave and are old enough to make that decision on their own (legally too).

I really don't know what else to do, so I wanted to ask for help, and if you know of any other subreddits that might be more useful for this question.",01Aug2018,1
373,"I have been dating my long distance girlfriend for a year now and we really want to live together. They have encouraged her to move here and live with us. She can transfer jobs and we can live with my parents rent free but we would probably get an apartment or rent a house together instead.

381,"Hey all. I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this because I already did what I wasn't sure if I'm supposed to do but now questioning whether it was the right thing

Last week, while I was driving for uber, I met this girl and we seemed to hit it off from the hour long trip she requested. She said she's still new in the country (2 weeks) and doesn't have a phone yet so we exchanged instagram accounts.

I talked to her a couple of days before asking to meet up on Saturday, she said she's busy. She then texts me Sunday night and asks if I want to meet up, and if I'll pick her up. Not a problem, I went picked her up and she started telling me about her problems with her friends and family and that she ran away from home 2 days ago.

She ended up booking a hotel room for herself and we stayed the night together. 

She would get up and go to the bathroom every 20 mins or so but since we were having sex I thought it was something relating to that so therefore private and I didn't ask what shes doing. Same thing happens in the morning so I asked her what drug she's doing and she said crack.

Now I don't mind someone that's on drugs, whatever they may be, but have your shit together and then do whatever you want, so I communicated that and she said this is only her first week doing it, and that she has her shit together. So I told her that's fine.

So later on in the morning, we were planning on going out for breakfast and she asked if we can stop by the train station to meet her friend and get a phone from them, and she wanted to go to the bank to open an account to give her new landlord rent money . She was planning on moving in later that afternoon. She logged in to her Instagram from my phone to text her friend.

So we go to the train station, she gets in a car and disappeared. Now I waited for about 30 mins before starting to wonder what's going on. And her Instagram was buzzing non stop. So I decided to take a look make sure everything is ok.

It was her sister, and she has sent about 60 messages. Asking her where she is, begging her to come back home, telling her that her father is in the hospital because of what she did and that the police are looking for her because her friend got beat up by a crack dealer. 

I read into that conversation a little bit more, and turns out that she actually ran away from home 3 weeks ago following an overdose incident and her sister was begging her to come home, not to succumb to the drug addiction and that her family will forgive her for every thing they just want her to come home.

At this point, I've been waiting for her for 2 hours and I start to get worried that something is happening to her with that friend she met up with, most likely a drug dealer too.

So I opened her Instagram and copied the number her sister gave her. I texted her sister and told her that I have her but now she's been missing from me for the past 2 hours and we work together to find her

Ended up waiting 4 hours, then she texts me and asks me to meet her at a gas station almost an hour away from where I dropped her off 

At this point I'm not interested in the girl anymore and more interested to help out this family because clearly this girl is a mess and has made an even bigger mess all over.

I texted the sister to meet at that gas station and we did. We found the girl inside the bathroom, doing crack and when she saw her sister and mom she licked herself inside.

From there I decided to leave as this whole debacle has been almost 7 hours and I had work the next morning. 

The sister texted me the next day and said that they stayed at that gas station for another 4 hours until she came out of the bathroom, and she put me on speaker with her family of 5 and all thanked me 

Here is my debate, the family were all extremely religious and that was the reason the girl ran away from home, and I can extremely relate to that because I was raised in similar way and don't like it but not enough to run away and start doing drugs


Did I do the right thing??

382,"So I recently graduated from college/uni and Someone surprising said they would like to keep in touch however I'm not too hopeful. Since I am so lonely was planning on asking whether they are up for doing something . However i feel like they were saying that to be nice more than anything else . Is it worth asking them as at this point it's not like I can lose anymore friends. Also if they say they are not interested than this is gonna be a real kick in the nuts and will support my view that people only talk to me when they want something and that's it . 

To provide a bit more context Sorry although we worked together on every group project and that ive known them for around 3 years we never really did anything socially outside of college/uni . We talk a lot as we used take the same route to get into college /uni .Pretty much know her life story and she knows more about me then most people .Also due to shared extracurricular activities we've had a fair amount of surprisingly deep conversations . That's why it's quite confusing for me because on the one hand I know all this stuff about her and normally you wouldn't tell people stuff unless you trust them and then on the other hand we never really did anything together outside of academics .

384,"I (24M) am currently in a job at my family's company where I have been for a year and half. My salary is good and my job provides nice benefits. For the most part, I like my coworkers. Our work environment is pretty relaxed in that most everyone dresses down, we throw nerf darts at each other, etc. The job itself can be quite stressful, but I think this is expected in Project Management wherever you work.

The issue? I'm not truly passionate or interested by what we do. I'm torn. Stay at the company? Leave? Leave and potentially come back in the future with a different perspective of seeing what it's like to work at other companies?

On one hand, I stay at a company where I like most of the people I work with and am groomed to take over the company. By the time I'm 30 (possibly earlier), I expect I'll be in a six-figure position. Maybe even running the company. This is my logical/financial decision. It sets me up for a secure future. A lot of people would kill for this kind of opportunity. Would it be foolish to pass up?

On the other hand, what we do is not what I'm interested in. I work for the weekend. Most days, I don't want to be at work. Which could be something a lot of people find themselves thinking. Do I really want to do this for the rest of my life?

My parents have always been supportive of the ""Do what you love/what you want to do"" concept. As their child, my happiness is important to them. Although, I am curious to how they would react and if they would think the same way if I were to introduce the idea of me leaving the company. 

For the friends that I have spoken to, they suggested I speak with my Dad. And if I do, sooner rather than later. I feel the longer I stay at the company, the more deeply rooted I become which would make it harder to leave or even speak about the idea of leaving.

Am I living with a ""grass is always greener"" mentality? Would it be a poor decision to leave? What does Reddit think? Thank you all.",01Aug2018,2

390,"Hi so I am in need of advice about what I should do with my job. I have worked in a restaurant that my father owns for the last 3 years. Recently he has been urging me to be a manager but I have a few reservations. Firstly I don’t want to have to deal with the high school level drama that the current employees get themselves in. Second, I don’t want the stigma around me to be “the owners son” manager. Third, I don’t really like working there as it is and the highest paid person makes $14 an hour, so the future does not look bright. My father says that the experience I get will be valuable to me in the future, and that he needs my help. The only reason I still work there is to help him out but I don’t want to commit to working there much longer. I’ve been offered positions elsewhere that pay much better, but I do not know what I should do. Will the experience as manager be worth it. Should I go take a new job elsewhere? What should I do?",01Aug2018,1
391,"I’m relatively young still and have been in a relationship with my SO for a little over five years [20F/22M]. We have been living together for a year. Recently a family member asked me if we had plans to get married anytime soon, and I said no due to us still being young and not having a lot of money to our names. The discussion that followed got me thinking though, as this family member suggested we look into the financial benefits of getting married but hold off on having an actual wedding celebration until we can confidently afford it some years down the line.

I’m floating the idea of getting married young because I’m in college in a state different than the one I grew up in and don’t qualify for residency here, while my SO does qualify for state residency. My tuition costs are about six times what my peers have to pay, and other expenses are piling up as well. I’m currently only planning to get my associates’ degree but would like to go farther if I could responsibly afford it, and I have already taken out a few thousand in student loans that I have no idea when I’ll be able to pay that back as it is. I am receiving some financial aid and have managed to be awarded a couple of scholarships, but it isn’t quite enough. My parents are firmly in that middle class bracket where they aren’t quite paycheck-to-paycheck and can afford most needs and many wants, so we don’t get tons of financial help, yet they don’t make enough to completely pay for (or even pay for most of) my education independently either even though they wish they could help more. I have researched the qualifications to become a state resident and the only one that seems viable for my situation in the near future is to get married. My SO and I plan to stay in this state for the foreseeable future and can’t really see ourselves moving somewhere else through at least our early-mid 20’s. He has an elderly relative who needs to be checked up on often for as long as she continues to live, and both of us are working to establish careers here.

Going back to my home state anytime soon is not a great option due to a.) it not being a good area of growth for my field/not having a school that interests me,  b.) my SO never wanting to move there and honestly I don’t want to live there long-term ever again either, and c.) family complications where the side of my family that I have unrelated issues with lives all across that state. Overall it’s a place of poor growth and negative associations that has few redeeming qualities for us.

As for my personal feelings towards marriage, I guess I’m pretty indifferent about it right now. My SO and I already live together and spend most of our days together, so besides the legally-binding part I don’t expect anything to change or have any over-the-top expectations. I could take it or leave it, though it would be really good to have benefits such as hospital visitation rights and again, the state residency. My SO comes from a more traditional/religious upbringing than I do and while he feels about the same as I do about marriage in the current moment, I know it will be much more important to him in the future once we’re at an age and financial standing where it’s more socially acceptable (for lack of a better term?) to get married and he teases it a bit every now and then.

Priorities-wise, we are pretty compatible. Neither of us has a long-term career plan that would get in the way of the other’s. We have the same values about our relationship and relationships as a whole. We agree on not ever wanting kids. We are both moderately religious and identify as Christians. We are very open with each other about our individual finances. The only thing we disagree on is that we have some different political views, but I don’t feel that this affects us negatively. 

Honestly, I feel pretty ignorant and naive about marriage from a financial standpoint though, including taxes and insurance. I’ll give some context on our current situation though. He has a job that pays decently, I’m stuck working minimum wage jobs for the time being and am unfortunately in between jobs right now, but I hope to get my foot in the door with something more related to my career within the next year or two. He doesn’t currently have health insurance and is saving up to acquire it, I’m still on my parents’ plan but will lose those benefits by next summer unless I continue my education, which will allow me to have it until age 23. My parents still claim me on their taxes so I am unsure if I would even still be considered a dependent or not, which would be just one more thing to weigh out the pros and cons of I suppose. I’m currently low on funds due to an unexpected major expense last month that I haven’t been able to recover from yet and have &lt;$1000 in savings. Both of us do still receive some financial help from our families, though he is much closer to being fully independent than I am.

Would marriage be a viable choice for us at this stage of our lives, or is there another option I could look into to ease the financial/education woes?",01Aug2018,1

I'm by no means homophobic. I'm a transgender man. But the idea of a man overpowering me scares me to death. I'm extremely dominant and manipulative in my dating life, and often reduce women to sexual objects just because I want to feel like I have power.

I recieve benefits because I am a student. I recieve health benefits and a monthly amount of money as long as I am in school and maintain a gpa of 2.0. 

I need the healthcare benefits because I am a Type I diabetic and we would not be able to afford my supplies were it not for these benefits.

The majority of the monthly amount of money I receive goes to my parents, who I still live with, to help pay bills.

I am not doing very well in school (lack of passion, miserable when at school). I have been placed on probation, meaning if I do not keep my gpa up by receiving at least a 70% average for this current summer semester, I will lose all of my benefits.

In one of two classes, I have a 50%. The way it is now, I will finish with a 60 if I get a 100% on the final. This means that, in order to get a 70% average, I must finish the second class with an 80. It is very likely I will recieve a 70% give or take in my second class. I have a little over a week left.

The entire situation causes me immense stress, and, as many diabetics know, stress can mess with your blood sugar levels. This is especially true for me.

Now, I'm a guy in my 20's and I have no issues with communicating with people, and I get women who flirt with me pretty obviously. Because of academic reason and my personal beliefs I don't want to be in a relationship.

This is not an issue, and it transitions to just being friendly after my intentions become clear. However, not when it comes to the shy ones. It seems as if it comes periodically. They act all bland, and I don't hear from them for a few weeks, then they suddenly get all flirty and open. This repeats itself.

Basically, their behavior switches between no communication and flirting, texting actively (emoji bombardments), making plans about doing things together. It is worth saying that these people seem to get pretty emotional about compliments, and signs of affection (romantically implicit or not doesn't matter).

If they were to end communication permanently, I'd get that they don't like me, but they end it for a short while, and then come back, want to add me on some app or social media, and want to do things. It's almost as if they're bipolar or have social anxiety, which might actually be the case.

This also applies to men, but without the flirting, but to a lesser extent.

Now, I could just cut communication with these people, but it would be a shame to let their positive traits go to waste simply because of irregularity. Therefore, I'm wondering if anyone with actual experience with this could share some insights on this behavior.

I believe employment is my only way to get my life back on track, but I've so many barriers in my way it feels hopeless. I do volunteer work, but it's not enough.

Social isolation has a huge impact on me.

I’m nowhere near finished with college (I have about 33 credits at the moment). I’ve only ever held one job in my entire life as a waiter, and that lasted for about 3 months in 2015. I have very little work experience, and I did extremely poorly in my first year of college due to personal reasons, but I have redeemed myself in school (somewhat) in the past year. That being said, I have no clue what I want to do career wise or major in. I am broke as hell and I don’t have a job at the moment either (been looking for one for a while now).

I’m sick of living at home with my family, I can’t seem to progress anywhere in this environment. My mom wants to kick me out and says I need to live on my own. They’re very controlling and pressuring.  My mom has been emotionally abusive for so long and its taking a toll on me. It feels as if I can’t breathe in this environment. I need some way out, or a fresh start. Tired of being forced to follow religion. Tired of listening to my parents just blackmail and threaten constantly. My parents have been hammering the nail too hard for too long. It feels as if I’ve been in a bubble and there are pins poking at me from all sides creating that tense moment before the bubble bursts. Whatever the case, I know I need to move on and  I need to struggle on my own and learn through experience.

It seems impossible for me to move out and have my own place in NYC because of the expense. I’ve been trying to figure out if I can study in Buffalo by taking out loans for tuition.

423,"I'm at my knees now asking for advice with my own self, I have some heart issues, first I will say, I used to be a very nice genuine person, but over the past 6 months there has been a slow gradual change in me, which had affected others and most importantly my SO. I have a heart of stone and are too prideful, I make excuses because I don't want to face things head on and personally. And lastly i feel like I just have a mental fog that is a constant thing, which even then still causes problems. I guess what I'm trying to get from this post is some advice on how I can start to work and implement change within myself. I'm tired of how I am and how I've been to loved ones. I'm ready and desire genuine change but have no idea where or how to start, especially how this is my first time wanting real change within myself. ",01Aug2018,1
424,"I work with kids and this is my first summer on the job since it is a seasonal job—long story short I have some coworkers who have been there for a couple of years and think they run the place. We have a new boss this year who really has turned things around and doesn’t take any crap. Last year was allegey a mess and this boss wants to pick up the pieces. These coworkers of mine were complaining from day 1 about the changes this boss has made. Long story short I work with older kids and we help the younger kids do activities throughout the day and we help provide them with the experience of having friends and fun. Over the past two days though, my immediate coworker and I , along with the kids we work with, have been walked all over and were basically being yelled at and told what to do by our peers and given an attitude throughout each activity. My team member and I had to tell my boss about what was happening and plus we had an activity because we knew that anything we’d say/do would get ignored where my coworkers were not watching their kids and how we were being treated like kids and walked all over and of course they reacted negatively and were blabbering to our other team members about what happened and now I’m public enemy number 1.I approached them nicely after my boss talked to them but I can tell they are going to make me the odd duck.

Most of the time drinking water just feels like a chore, so I don’t do it. At the same time though, I really don’t want to be feeling sick anymore from this. 

So Reddit...

1). How can I re-hydrate myself so that I don’t feel sick anymore? I read online that dehydration can carry over to the next day if you don’t hydrate properly the day before. 

2). How can I learn to drink enough water so that I don’t feel sick anymore from dehydration (like a normal person)?

427,"As the title says I just need some other opinions on what is going on. 

So last Thursday my radiator blew in my car. I got on my insurance app and used their roadside assistance. On the app they had their recommended mechanics and I chose one near my house. So the driver did what they should and took my key and put it into the overnight slot. This is what The insurance company said.  The shop has not contacted me at all this last week.

 I called my insurance Monday and they said all they could do is tow it somewhere new. But first I need to get my key. My key is in the mechanics shop. The next step the insurance said was to call the police. I did and they said all they could do is call the number they have on file for the person. No answer. 

 Today I went to the mechanic again and nobody was there. I walked up and down the street and asked the neighbors and they said that they haven't seen the people in weeks. So once again I called the police and they told me all I can do now is to sue the mechanic in small claims court. 

I just need another opinion. I paid 3k cash for my car in December 2017. The radiator will be 500 at a shop. To get the new key made by a locksmith with I'll of the taxes and such will be 450. In the meantime I am uberring for 20 for each trip to and from work. 

Do I actually sue the mechanic? Should I buy a new car? Should I just wait and take the 200 hit a week to uber? I need some opinions. It's just been an emotionally exhausting week. Thank you in advance. ",01Aug2018,1

431,"So here's the situation it's pretty long, but please bear with me. I state in short what the problem is at the end if you don't feel like reading all of this.

First off I just have to say I go to an all girls school. I met this guy several months ago and we started talking on a friendly level. About 3 months in my best friend goes to a school sponsored trip along with a girl that we'll call Jane. My best friend (loyal at all times) tells me before they’re even through TSA that Jane is talking to uhh let's call him Taylor. By that point we'd been ya know actually *talking*, but I'm not one to step on anyone's toes if they’ve been dancing longer than I have, so I figured I'd take step back a bit, and I did.

But of course there's always a but. About 2 weeks after that, I saw him at a school performance sitting by himself. Now we had been only doing a streak on snapchat and slight convo for this period of time, so I didn't know if it was appropriate to approach. By intermission I can't stand seeing him sit by himself anymore. 2 minutes in and I crack up out of my seat inviting him to sit with my friends and I. We hit it off. After the show, as everyone is waiting outside, Jane approaches Taylor and it turns out that he was there to see her.

Ok now fast forward again and Taylor tells me that Jane is mad at him. I ask why and he says this: ""she usually starts the things she's going to say with, ' this is going to be stupid but' and so I said, 'No way, Jane saying something stupid that never happens' and she hung up on me"". I laughed I thought it was pretty funny, meanwhile she made him beg for forgiveness and repeatedly hung up on him for something so small.

There's other things:

She invited him to hang out with her and two other guys she *knows* are interested in her. Basically, she had them vy for her attention. None of the guys she invited have ever been friends.

**The problem:**

There's so much he doesn't know about her. He only knows myself and her from my school as he goes to an all boys school. I'm the only one who can tell him what she's really like. I don't want him to think I'd ever try to break up any would be relationship between them, I just can't stand the way she treats him as a fellow human being in general. She's toyed with so many guys in the past. Once she knowingly (I was there) danced on a guy who was not her boyfriend, despite me telling her repeatedly that it was not her guy. She didn't even turn to check. Then she acted surprised when her boyfriend almost gets in a fight with this guy and is mad at her and then SHE TRIES TO TURN IT BACK ON HIM. That's just one time. The examples go on and on. What should I do? I don't wanna see him get hurt.",01Aug2018,3

446,"I’m 18 in the USA and I worked 3 months as a busser in a fancy-esque restaurant.

Keep in mind most of them had been there for more than a year while I was brand new. Also I was cucked on my pay but didn’t know it. The reason I say I didn’t know it is because I wasn’t sure how much of a paycheck is supposed to be withheld for taxes, and how being tipped out affects pay. But then one week, I had made $200 but was only paid a little more than $70. That was when I knew they were screwin’ the pooch.

to my surprise, my parents were supportive when i talked to them about what was going on. what they told me caught me off guard. where i was living this past year was technically a basement. my room had no window, so it was always dark unless i obviously had the lights on. they told me that my depression and anxiety got unbearable because i slept in a room without a window. i had to tell my roommates what my plans were and my reason for them, one of them told me the same thing too. 

i didn’t think much of it until now actually but that not the reason for my post. coming home this summer, i decided to get help because i couldn’t do this on my own anymore. my doctor prescribed me lexapro. i took that until the bottle ran empty. i later decided that the side effects weren’t worth it, i was starting to experience depersonalization, one of my brothers has this too. so i guess it’s genetic or something. i’ve been off lex for about three days and i don’t really feel as depressed as i once was. i was originally going to stay here and just go to a community college since i lost my scholarships due to my bad grades. but i don’t really have interests anymore. every thing seems boring. i don’t know what i want career -wise now. i’m back at feeling numb.

Now, I work in politics. Pretty far on the outskirts these days (namely because I despise politicians almost universally), but there is still a nagging voice (and a number of friends) that wonders if I should consider running for some kind of office one day.

And no, there’s no one that I can talk to about my grievances since the management won’t care to think it over because they’re heavily prescribed to seniority rules (they wouldn’t care what a busser who worked there for three months and was on vacation for one month would say). 

The employees and establishment lost my respect so I don’t feel like I owe them anything. So yeah, can I just text this employer my resignation? It was all super relaxed when I got the job anyways. When I came in to interview she was at the bar with a drink and asked “what days are you available” and then I was in. What would you guys do in my position?  

Sorry if this comes off as a rant, I’m kinda flipping stressed with family and college issues and it pisses me off to have to devote any more of my time to thinking about that rotten pecker of a food establishment.",01Aug2018,1
458,"I’m not quite sure what to do. I recently started getting into contact with my estranged cousin. He is mentally-unstable and has been sending very strange text messages. Majority of the messages are vague, obscure, and concerning. He keeps talking about being a god, resentment towards everyone he knows, guns, and sends a storm of random YouTube videos and just now pornographic links. I’m not sure if I should alert his father who my cousin has cut all ties with or what. There’s nothing I can really do. He doesn’t seem like he wants to seek help, and I no longer have the time nor patience to be supportive. ",01Aug2018,1
