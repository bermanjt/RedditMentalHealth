0,"So I live far away from my parents while I'm studying in uni and only have little contact with them via texts etc, we have a good relationship and they are good parents, however when I got home for Christmas my mom asked me if I could go over to my grandparents and leave them their gifts. So I go over there and leave them their gifts and catch up with them about life. We talk politics and stuff, the conversation got to talking about a new magnet my mom bought which I mentioned and thought my grandpa would really like, (now in afterthought it was kind of obvious but I was blind to it then). So I get home and all is fine and my mom asked how it went, I told her that all was fine with them and that I told them about the magnet, I've never seen my mom more angry than this, she said I had ruined Christmas and that I was worthless and lazy as well as dumb for not ""understanding"" that she of course bought one of the magnets for him as well. I told her ""Why didn't you just tell not to talk about it then""? And I said sorry but she wouldn't accept it. I really think this isn't my fault in any way and I often just let things go and don't hold grudges but for some reason this really ticked me off, I cant look at her because I think shes being really dumb and stubborn about this. Am I in the wrong?

1,"I became friends with someone at the beginning of the semester. But as I started spending more time with him, I learnt that he was arrogant, lazy, and would try to use me for quizzes, assignments, and tests. He would constantly keep asking me to send him my study notes and the answers for the online quizzes. I had to do two group assignments with him, and he barely did any work for them. It infuriated me when he got an 82% on an assignment that he barely contributed to. He's extremely clingy and constantly follows me around. He also has trouble taking ""no"" for an answer.

That's just the tip of the iceberg. Outside of class, he's quite insufferable. He constantly talks about himself and badmouths others/things he doesn't like (ironic, because his guitar skills are lackluster). He talks as if his opinions are facts and fails to realize that many things (such as music) are subjective. He asked me to join his band, and I agreed. He later went on about how he wanted the entire band to live together in an apartment. Mind you, this was after just 3 or 4 weeks of knowing him. I have recently quite his band, telling him I was too busy with school.

I decided I'd had enough. Last week, I texted him saying what classes I was taking and what times they were so we could both be in the same classes. But in reality, I lied to him about my classes just so he would take them and I wouldn't have to be in any of his classes. He happily signed up for all the classes I told him I was in. Am I the asshole for doing this?",23Dec2018,1

I've been single for two years with some dating in-between via OLD.  
I've not had friends to spend time with or go out with for even longer.

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong that I don't even seem to be able to find opportunity to talk to people, no one seems interested in talking to me either, it's like I'm exiting in another dimension invisible to everyone else. At 35 my biological clock is ticking over, I also feel like I'm reaching a point where I'm running out of time to have fun with friends.

I've tried volunteering, going to the gym, going to dance classes, I go to bars and cafes, I go to gigs or events on my own, I've tried Meetup, but nothing seems to get results - I'm always just there on my own, either not finding opportunity to try to talk to anyone or feeling like a bit of a tit while everyone else is there with friends.

I suffer from narcissistic personality disorder and I’m going through therapy to try to get better but sometimes I just have these thoughts that I’m so much better than the rest of the people around me or just anyone in general. I wish it didn’t affect my life but it does. Sometimes I say mean things to the people I love just to make myself feel better and I enjoy it so much when I can feel that someone feels inferior to me. I always have to be the center of attention, otherwise I get panic attacks and I feel like life is not worth living. Most of the times I wouldn’t even mind if people I loved died, or I think of how much attention I would get if someone I loved died. I know. I’m fucked up. 

Has this ever happened to you? I would like to read your stories and how (if) you managed to overcome these feelings of superiority. My therapist is helping a lot but I just don’t think I will ever feel normal. ",23Dec2018,1

8,"I go to a small high school with only 43 people in it. I’ve known this friend for a few years, and we’re pretty good friends. Also keep in mind, his older brother also goes to this school too.

I met my friend’s cousin at his older sister’s birthday party. We hit it off immediately. We went on our first date a week after. It went great.

I felt like my friend and his brother had a right to know. My friend didn’t really care, he was almost supportive. But his brother was beyond upset/pissed. He didn’t reply to my texts, ignored my calls, etc. I feel absolutely terrible.

The cousin doesn’t know that older brother dislikes me now. I’m scared of when he finds out. Cousin and I went to a date just today, actually. Today is the day we hooked up. I’m scared that it’s just gonna be a mess. I really do like him. I don’t want to leave him, and he sure as hell doesn’t want to leave me.

9,"There was no one thing that was a blaring factor for the break up, but a bunch of smaller things. I’ll list them below: 


She seems used to constant attention and admits she needs it

She diverts blame to others instead of taking responsibility

She cheated on her ex and blamed her mom
(Also denies that it was cheating because her mom “made” her. Her mom didn’t like her ex and tried to get her with some wealthy pharmacist)

Her mom googled me when she heard my name

Her mom asked if my dick is too big when she was asking for advice because she was bleeding during sex (her mom’s a nurse)

Her mom pushed the guy she “forced” her to cheat with on her since she’s been with me

She digs A LOT into my past relationships, asking names, when I dated, etc.

She googled one ex and had a day with her mom, brother, brothers fiancé looking through her Facebook pictures

She stares at other guys in front of me

She says other guys are hot on TV (way more than a normal girl does)

She cried over her ex when she found out he had a new gf

She and her mom Facebook stalked her ex’s new girlfriend saying “she’s not even that pretty”

She brags about herself (also humble brags) in almost every conversation (other people have mentioned it to me)

She talked a ton about guys that have hit on her in the past (she’s still talking about guys that hit on her from years ago) and would show me pictures of her exes without me asking

She had no father figure growing up

It feels like she is expecting attention from guys and others

It seems like she thinks she is very high status and talks about how other moms want their daughters to grow up to be like her, as well as other things along these lines.

She seems very physical appearance oriented in her impression of other people
(Example: I mentioned some CEO is married to some model and she immediately googled him and said “He’s not even that good looking” and dwelled on it for a few minutes)

I can’t recall any time she has directly complimented me. She has however told me how handsome or buff some of the other guys she’s dated were. (She has mentioned that her mom said I’m the best looking she dated, but it wasn’t really a compliment from her)

She would talk about how much other girls liked the guys she’s dated

She tells her mom ALOT of details about me and other stuff


Now I know it sounds bad when you write out a list like that, but things with her were absolutely great when we were spending time together. It feels like I lost my best friend. She was smart, funny, beautiful. I would actually miss her when we were apart (something that isn’t normal to me). The chemistry between us was just awesome.

I just didn’t feel good given the things I’ve listed. I mentioned some, such as talking about all the guys that hit on her and constantly commenting on how hot celebrities were, and she addressed it and never became an issue again. Some of the things though I didn’t feel I could or should bring up to her. Like the bragging, how she never complimented me, etc.

Should I have tried to work out the rest of the issues? Am I making these into bigger issues than they are? Am I making incorrect judgements?

15,"So, I (33f) recently took on the responsibility of supporting my niece (21f) and her newborn son. I live in a small home in pretty serious disrepair and I live well below the poverty line. I've tried finding better jobs and a better place to live but I would exactly say I'm employable. I have pretty severe mental health issues and I'm severely lacking in social skills. Honestly, my niece would be better off literally anywhere else but she has no where to go. My family is pretty abusive and they care not for her well being. Things would be easier had she been willing to give the baby up for adoption but that is not my decision. She needs the baby. My boyfriend (30m) lives with me and he's not really capable of contributing financially or holding down a good job. Sometimes I think life would be easier if he were not here but I need him. He keeps me grounded mentally. He keeps me from losing myself. I know I should be able to be mentally stable on my own but I can't. We're drowning. I have too many people to take care of when I'm not really capable of even taking care of myself. I try to find better jobs but I physically can't do most labor jobs and I don't have many skills. I have crazy work ethic and I'm competent but I don't know how to get prospective employers to see that. Right now I have 2 semi decent part time jobs but they're not good enough. I keep looking and finding nothing. The area I live in doesn't have the most booming economy. I just don't know what to do anymore. My niece was homeless before she came to live with me. She's practically been homeless since 14 and now she's so hostile from being on her own and has no work history and a newborn baby. It's not as if she can work. My boyfriend I think has asd and it makes it hard for him to find jobs. I can't keep holding them up though. I recently had to euthanize my cat, who was my entire reason for living. Things are just falling apart and I don't know how to keep my family afloat. I don't know how to be better.

18,"Hello, my neighbor really neglects her cat, she leaves it outside for very long period in the cold, since last winter the cat comes to my house and I take care of it (sometimes it wasn't fed for days...) I spoke to her many times saying if she wanted to get rid of it, that I'd take care of it etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, long story short, she came to my house a few days ago, asking if I wanted to take care of the cat for the holidays, I said of course I didn't mind (also I would really enjoy the cats company as I am alone with no family for the holidays): she was suppose to give me the cat yesterday.....

&amp;#x200B;

She texted me an hour ago, saying that she might have been absent minded and forgotten the cat inside her place as she ""was rushing will all sorts of things to do to for her Christmas""   thing is, she returning in FIVE days, I looked in her door window and the cat is there

&amp;#x200B;

I called her and said that she shouldn't leave the cat like that, but she said she didn't care... and that she left the cat food in a bowl anyway, no one around has her keys (I asked her) except some other person that lives really far away

&amp;#x200B;

She is staying about two hours from here, but won't come back to open the door (as it would disturb her holiday night)

I'm really upset because I wanted to hang out with the cat because I'm alone, but even more upset that the cat will go hungry and be all alone in there, I'm sure she must have turned down the heat quite a bit

I'm in Canada, I feel like breaking her door down (I won't), doesn't anyone have clever advice about this? will the cat be OK for FIVE days?????

20,"This is a long post, fyi.  Sorry in advance.

Pretty much my whole family is utterly stressed out over the situation my dad is in, and we feel hopeless.  My dad basically got into a bad relationship after his fiancé cheated on him and left him.  At first, she seemed fine, and I got along with her okay.  She was separated from her husband when she and my dad met, so that could be a red flag, but I just wanted my dad to be happy.  She had similar interests and beliefs as my dad.  They got engaged.  She knew he REALLY didn’t want more kids (this had been a dealbreaker type thing in previous relationships), but somehow she basically forced him into having 2 kids that he didn’t want.  He keeps saying he is going to get a vasectomy and she vehemently objects to it.  It’s obvious he just doesn’t want kids and somehow got trapped in this.  When they had the first kid, her mom and sister came to live with them and has been there since.  

Now, this is a family of morbidly obese, rather disgusting people.  Her mom is on disability and doesn’t work, and her sister (who is a full grown adult but acts like a teenager) refuses to drive, work, or do anything because she has too much “anxiety.”  Slowly, the house has turned into a hell hole.  My stepmom and her family are hoarders with 3 cats and 2 dogs, and they live in complete filth.  They don’t flush toilets and get human waste everywhere.  There’s food and trash everywhere.  They have rooms with stuff piled up to the ceiling.  They have problems with rats and fleas.  My dad has gained a significant amount of weight (these people obviously aren’t living healthy lifestyles) and he basically went from a normal, active lifestyle to becoming obese.  He is already suffering from back problems, hypertension, and other worsening health issues.  I’m afraid he’s going to literally die from a heart attack.  

As time went on, my stepmom’s true personality has started to show more and more.  And my stepmom, her mom, and her sister do nothing but berate and complain about my dad all day.  Everyone is constantly yelling at him over everything and making jokes at his expense.  Everyone treats him like he’s a bad father because he didn’t want more kids, and it seems like he just checked out of his life.  Me, my aunt, and my grandma can’t ever talk to him or do anything with just him because they put so much control over who he spends time with.  My dad now works from home all week, and I can’t fathom how he would want to be in that household all day everyday.  I honestly wonder if they convinced him to do it because they get completely bent out of shape over him not spending every second of his day with his kids.  These two boys are 5 and 3, and my stepmom and her family put makeup on them.  They’ll also take photos and use makeup filters on them and post them on Facebook.  I’m not a judgmental person, but from the start they treated these boys like girls, gave them girly nicknames, and put necklaces on them.  They also take them to Disneyland princess dress-up events.  My stepmom notoriously wants a girl, and I honestly think she’s projecting this on them.  The older of the two already has behavioral problems in school.  The kids are so hyper and misbehaved that I can’t stand being around them for more than half an hour.  My dad tries to discipline them but gets yelled at by everyone else.  

It’s at the point that he makes no decisions and doesn’t even talk for himself anymore.  You can hear my stepmom in the background telling him what to say.  On top of all this, my stepmom and her family spend a shit ton of money.  My dad is already in debt, and they are going to Disneyland 3 times a year (6 people 3 times a year, not including all of the other vacations and trips they go on).  I completely think he is in an emotionally abusive relationship.  We all have tried to talk to my dad and find out if he’s even happy, but none of us can get him alone.  I honestly think he’s too afraid to leave.  I just want my dad back.  Some people have told me there’s nothing I can do, but I just can’t sit back and watch my dad’s life get destroyed.  If anyone has advice, I’d appreciate it.",23Dec2018,1
23,"So I work in a preschool. And in October during our book fair, one of the fathers with his son were looking around. He came over to get water with his child and I sit right next to the water cooler. We exchanged some words with each other and he asked me to take a picture of him with his child. I found him to be pretty attractive but didn't know who he was. The next time he was at the school he came over to get water again and was talking to me a little. I asked someone casually about him and found out he has 2 children in the school. 

The next time I saw him I waved hi to him since we had spoken a little an he said hi back but i realized his child's mother was there and did not look happy after that. The next time I saw him he was there alone during another event at the school and he kept speaking to me almost the whole time he was there. He kept coming over to get water and stood there to talk, and was just asking me random questions. The next time he was there it was during the holiday party and the kids mother was there and I was not working near there that day so we did not communicate just said hi to each other. I spoke to one of the teacher assistants in his kids room and she said that his situation with the mother is very messy and he says there not together but she says they are. And the last time he was there was the second holiday party and both of them were there. He did not really talk at first but after the show, while parents were getting food and stuff he came over and gave me water and was talking again and we spoke with other workers who were standing around. He kind of lingered around the water and was going back and fourth while the mother was standing on the other side of the room. Eventually he left and said bye. 

I mentioned to My coworker who is the music teacher who held the show for the kids, and before I could say who i was talking to he said it first. He said he could just see him lingering around and talking and it seemed like he was flirting, but doesn't know what's going on with the kids mother and how it was kind of shady how he was doing that with her around.

32,"So.. a lot of stuff has happened to me these past few months that have driven me to suicidal thoughts and depression. (i think I have, am not diagnosed though) So first of all, since my brother was like 3 or so, my parents have obviously favored him. He could no wrong. At the same time, I could do no right. Anything I did caused some trouble. I didn't want him near me and my friends otherwise I would feel embarrassed from what he would say, he puts me down athletically and academically, he tries to humiliate me to family, etc etc. For example, one time one of my cousins were coming to America and asked him about data, and my dad starting talking about how I wasted data, and my cousin jokingly says ""Is it because he's calling his girlfriend?"", and my dad types a long message talking about how there was no way I could get a girlfriend because I'm messy, fat, stupid, etc etc. And on his birthday everyone was wishing him a happy birthday and instead of saying thanks or something like that, he types 7ish long messages about how he can't enjoy life with such a terribly below average son, and making it obvious it was me. And then today he tried to turn my brother and stuff against me, so I threw a blanket across the bed out of anger and he starts screaming about how I attacked him and tries to hit me with a bat. Oh yeah, he won't spank me anymore because he ""doesn't want to touch me because I'm dirty"". He constantly tries to compare me and my friends and he started saying that one of my friends plays the violin and swims and then I brought up that I play basketball, go to the gym, run, and also play the violin, and he got really mad at me. He has kicked me out the house multiple times and doesn't care about where I go. Okay so that's some stuff about my dad, but next my friends... I used to hang out with these 5 kids, we were extremely tight. But then it turned 5 vs. 1, them against me and it got really toxic. So I asked the principal for help, but he just makes us sign stay away agreements (I can't hang out with them until June 7th, which is two weeks after school ends), and he says there could've been a different solution but I reported them instead of asking from help, but I did ask for help. That also turned one of my other friends against me, so I just lost 6 friends. And then now one of my friends is moving away, I'm never going to see him again, those were 6 out of my 7 closest friends at school, plus I got a huge mandatory schedule change because of the stay away agreement, while they get no punishment, even though I'm considered the ""victim"" in this situation.

33,"My boyfriend and I have known eachother for three years now, together over two. We met when we were both in bad places in our lives, and it ended up in me rejecting him after a month or two of being just friends and him admitting liking me. This all happened for a number of reasons.

A week or so later, he had sex with a girl we both hang around with now. He told me.multiple times that he barely remembers it and he never really liked her. 

Some time into our relationship (weirdly) it began to not sit well with me. I have no idea why it bothers me so much.

35,"Long story short, the last few months I've(20m) been dealing with cancer and shit. This girl I've known for the last year or so recently started getting serious in the summer after we began talking and she openly admitted she was interested in me. The talking progressed and in October the feels really developed between us. We soon began talking everyday texting goodmorning goodnight and all that good stuff through out the day. I eventually told her about my symptoms and how I was feeling the last couples of months and she made me want to get checked out. In early november I went and got checked out turned out I had cancer and immediately underwent surgery and such. We became even closer and to be quite honest I think it was at this time that I felt like I loved her, she felt the same towards me. After the surgery and such I was in pain and fell into a slumber of drinking. One night she got upset at me for drinking and because I explained how I used it as a means of clearing my head. She immediately became cold and upset. It took a few days and we spoke and I appologized but after that things felt different. This continued for a week till we both confronted the issue and realized that while I would be willing to make it work (Long distance she goes to school and now lives in a different state 3 hours away) she wasn't. This broke my heart. We both called and spoke and cried for a couple hours together. I wanted to break it off completely and just cut her out of my life because to be quite honest I loved/love this girl and the thought of seeing her with another guy would kill me and such. She kind of convinced me that she didn't want to lose me as a friend and I bought into it. I have her added on snapchat, fb and have her number but she no longer hits me up anymore. Its come to the point that I am the only one who initiates conversation and when we talk she'll ask about how things are going but will eventually cut the conversation short. 

 Last night I got drunk with some buddy's who came back home and i found myself drunk texting her in the middle of the night/early morning. She replied as I didn't really say anything bad just asked how she was and all that to which the conversation ended with ""Miss you drunk texting me [laughing emoji] have fun with sleeping that off"" or something of that effect. Wasn't really malicious or anything just kinda, idk felt like she didnt wanna talk. I picked up through our last couple conversations that she's been going out with dudes while we were getting really close and began expressing feels for eachother, so that sucks and broke my heart again. She also kind of expressed she has a high sex drive and with my current state from the cancer (testicular) I can't really do much now or down the line for some time and that was another factor I think pushed her away. All in all she was a really great girl and emotionally she was there for me as I was there for her but something kinda turned her off me. 

 Now in the back of my mind theres something in my head telling me to just ghost her. Delete her off my social media block the number and just move on. Theres no chance of us really running into eachother or anything so thats not an issue but inside of me I'm conflicted. She was there for such a big part of my life and she was always kind and sweet and beautiful even though she herself wouldn't believe it. Is it wrong to just ghost her? Should I tell her why I'm doing this? She most likely doesn't even care at this point about me or whatever so it'd be a lot less emotionally taxing on my end to just go through with it. I really don't know how to tackle this. For the last month I've just been anxiously looking at my phone whenever I get a notification just hoping its her but its almost never her. It's not like theirs any real girls on the horizon so I know this one is going to hurt for a while but I think I just need to cut it out of me now before it eats me up more. Am I being crazy for thinking this way? What do I do? ",23Dec2018,1

my mom lives in a townhome-like apartment w/ six adjoining units. the property management company in charge of overseeing the property/lessees is worthless (confirmed by personal experience &amp; online reviews). 

they never respond to tenant inquiries &amp; seem to have no organization associated w/ their property “management” methods. they do, however, require a background check in order to be approved to rent from them - the extent of the background check is unknown to me at this point.

this evening i overheard my mom &amp; her shared-wall neighbor comparing gut-wrenching encounters they’ve had w/ the next neighbor over. these included incidents of the guy breaking his own glass windows out from his inside, peeping up into the neighbor’s bedroom window while crouching down under the sill (as if he was hidden from detection while clearly visible), screaming &amp; yelling in his apt in the midst breaking his things &amp; throwing large furniture around (cops were called bc ppl feared he was being attacked- he was not), yelling at pedestrians through his opened windows w/ the shades drawn.

so the guy has mental problems that arent being adequately remedied - that much is clear. But lately they seem to be escalating at high pace. it could be unrelated but as his behavior has been intensifying, so have the number of calls to police from the complex on sus activity, mostly consisting of attempted break-ins and trespassing, and no one has been apprehended for any of these instances (at least 5 calls in past month from what i can gather).

it seems unlikely to me that every incident would be due to one person BUT wall-share neighbor is certain it’s all bc of the aforementioned problem neighbor. that being said, she is the only one to have has f2f interactions w/ him. plus what do i know, i’m just a third party hear-sayer.

it pisses me tf off that she has to go to bed terrified. i just got to her place &amp; staying w/ her now bc someone tried to get in her window the other night at 2am. also, last weekend a guy (keep in mind she’s never seen the disturbed neighbor guy, doesn’t know what he looks like) tried to shove his way into her house when she answered a knock at the door in the middle of the fucking day.

He became extremely pushy and started pressuring me into things I didn't want to do. He didn't take no for an answer and would take it personally. He didn't respect any of my boundaries and started asking me ""what's going on with you? why don't you want to be around me?"" When I explained to him I just needed a week of time to myself. The final straw was when I told him that my brother got into a nearly fatal car accident..he responded with ""oof. sorry."" and then started talking about how great his day was. Before this, I told him that my pet just died and my grandpa had cancer and he gave me the same response. I confronted him about it and said he was sorry and then changed the subject. I also started going through a really bad emotional crisis. My depression and anxiety was so severe I was having passive suicidal thoughts and at least 2 severe anxiety attacks a day. He was a little supportive initially, but then when I told him I was becoming suicidal, he responded with ""Oh?"" And that was the end of it. It hurt my feelings and I ended up crying about it.

46,"	So... this is really weird for me (opening up about a personal problem on the internet), but I think I need some perspective from some other people.


	I am an oncology patient of 14 years (brain tumor on my optic nerve, non-metastasizing) and I’ve progressively lost vision over my entire life (Currently 16). I’ve been on chemotherapy, radiation, steroids, you name it; the problem is that my tumor is atypical in that it is technically stage 1, but small amounts of growth can cause vision loss and threaten my life (close to pituitary gland and main blood vessels). Because of this, I’ve literally been on treatment for the large majority of my life. I’ve had multiple surgeries. And they all help, but eventually I’ve gone back on treatment. I’ve been dragged on and off of treatment.


	Fast forward to last summer (2018). I had to have a surgery to drain a cyst on my tumor (which most likely developed from radiation I had 2 years prior). I also had a small amount of nerve swelling (also probably due to radiation). When I say “most likely due to...”, this is coming straight from my oncologist, not me. After the surgery (which was quite stressful for my mom), my mom received a newsletter from the hospital that we were getting treated at that linked a study relating sugar to cancer growth. This brought her down a rabbit hole of articles linking various foods to cancer cell growth. She decided that I would, from now on, be sugar free, white (flour, rice) free.


	There are a few reasons I disagree with her decision (the decision she made for me). The first being that my tumor is stage 1. Is has not grown or physically changed in about 6 years (aside from the cyst). Technically, it is benign. This is not helped by the fact that it is constantly being treated and dealing with side effects (post-radiation swelling). So when my mom asks my oncologist her opinion on a “sugar free” diet, the oncologist tells her that there has not been a studied direct benefit of patients dieting on tumor growth. She said that keto-diet did help for stage 4 cancer (at which point they needed any help they could get) and that Keto was the only way to go. My mom more or less blocked this out and decided that her DIY diet was good enough. My diet is no processed sugar (so in her eyes, Agave Nectar is fine, fruits are fine [obviously], and any natural food that already has sugar in it is fine). Additionally, no white flour, no white rice.


	So, here I am. A few months later. I finally finished chemo before Christmas. I’m on holiday, we are in a ski resort full of wonderful restaurants. I told her that I would appreciate taking these two weeks off of my diet; she aggressively said no. I’m fine being on the diet after (it’s not that hard) but I really wanted to take one or two weeks off.


	All I want is to enjoy eating out, have one dessert over the next two weeks. I just want to enjoy the holiday and my break off of treatment. But conversely, I have literally zero control over “my” diet. Sure, I could defy her and eat sugar secretly or choose to eat it regardless of what she says, but she is quite an aggressive person and will do everything in her power to make me miserable outside of food choice.

52,"The title pretty much sums it up, but I’ll go into more detail. I’m a 25F, I have a full time job, pay my own bills and live outside of my parents home. Growing up and while I lived with my parents we generally went out of town for Christmas, since all of our extended family lives out of state. I’ve always been close to my Mom’s side of the family, but not my Dad’s, and my parents know this. 

While I no longer live with my parents, they still struggle with treating me as an adult. A good example of this is with the Holidays, and them “assuming” I’m going to go out of town with them, without asking my plans or intentions. This year I’ve been asking for the details on what the plans were for Christmas for weeks, but didn’t get them until this week. 

As I mentioned above, I don’t live with my parents. I currently rent a home with my best friend, and the home consists of myself, my friend, and her three kids ages 16, 13, and 4.  My best and I consider each other the sister we never had, and her kids are truly my nieces and nephew. I live with them, see them on a daily basis, and spend my time with them. I care about them deeply and consider them my family. My 4yr old nephew is into the joy and excitement of Christmas for the first time! I want to spend Christmas at home with my family, not out of town (would be out of town both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day) with extended family that I’m not particularly close with. 

Part of me feels like a jerk for not wanting to spend Christmas with my parents, but at the same time, shouldn’t it be my choice as to who, where, and how I spend Christmas? And how do I break it to my parents that I don’t want to go out of town with them?


TLDR: Parents assume I’m going out of town for Christmas Eve/Christmas Day with them without asking what my plans are for Christmas. How do I tell them I want to stay home instead without being a jerk?

Ok so here's the jist. Two years ago I asked my dad for a Nintendo Switch, around the time it just came out. He told me that he didn't have the money, but that I should be patient. So I decide to wait, I waited around 7-5 years just to get my first 3ds (which was my first and only console), this I didn't think this would be that bad. 7 months ago my sister asked for a Nintendo Switch. I told her that she should give up, she's not gonna get one. It had been A little over a year since I asked for one and he apparently still didn't have the money. Besides my mentality was ""I asked first anyway, so if anything I'm getting one first."" 

Fastforward 7 months and I'm now watching my dad order my sister a Nintendo Switch for my birthday. She's ecstatic, but I don't understand.

I just stayed home the whole day and drank soda. My mom (my parents are divorced, btw) didn't even celebrate my own birthday because I, quote on quote, ""spent it with my dad,"" so in her eyes, there was no need to celebrate it a second time. So I pretty much didn't do anything for my birthday. I still don't understand why he still did this. I asked him two years ago, and he told me to be patient. He said he didn't have the money, but here he is crapping, his wallet to buy my sister a switch and all extra accessories. We got into an argument about it. I don't think he truly understood where I was coming from but, he still said that he didn't have the money, but that he made a promise to get my sister one. However, that promise was made *way* after I asked for one. What I don't understand is why would you continue to pile up debt on yourself, because you made a promise like that. My sister also somewhat guilt tripped him into buy it and when I called her out on it she got all defensive and hid behind the excuse of ""He made a promise and that means he must have had the money!"" Though, when I brought it up in a car ride, a few weeks before he ordered the Switch, he said that he didn't have the money and that he's struggling to pay back some debts, but he made the promise. She was present during this car ride and heard it all, I don't know why she adamantly refuses these facts.

Fastforward a month. It's December. By this time I decided to work at my High School since they pay you around $3 at breaktime, and $5 every lunch, to work at their cafeteria and serve food. It's 6:13 pm and my dad calls my sister. He tells her to check the mail and when she does it's a copy of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game everyone in my family knows I want. It doesn't help that all my friends keep talking about how their getting a Switch and Smash Bros. It didn't help that my dad would complain that he doesn't have any money, buys my sister **2 Nintendo Switch games**, and then yells at me in Wal-Mart for asking him if he could buy me a box of pencils when he, quote on quote, doesn't have any money. It doesn't help my my mom won't even let me use my own birthday money to buy myself something nice, but I guess that's because my grades where bad... however, my sister won't stop talking about Smash Bros., it's getting kind of annoying, and it keeps resurfacing these thoughts, which I am now compiling into this Reddit post. Does anyone have any advice on how I should go about this? Are my feelings valid?

75,"Looking for advice/sugges†ions/input as this is not something I can really discuss with my family and I don't want to bring it up with friends at this point. I have been working in a job for the past 9 months, that doesn't technically require overtime but it is expected that we work 50+ hours per week (during some times of the year 60+ hours per week including mandatory weekends). This would not be a problem per say if the work was something I was really passionate about however it is not. I took this job as I am considering applying to law school and wanted to see if this was an area I am interested in however I am realizing that much of the work is very mundane and routine, basically it feels like data entry/factory work. I am now experiencing a sort of burnout from the long hours and routine nature of the work. Because of the hours it is very difficult to find time to look into applying to graduate schools, law school, and/or applying for a different job. I graduated from an Ivy League school with a pretty good GPA. I do not know what to do. I want to leave however leaving with no backup plan is terrifying. I'm also interested in pursuing some kind of international opportunities ie. peace corps or a similar program but haven't yet applied to one and these processes can take time (I know I should have anticipated the burnout and started applying earlier, which is stupid and 100% my fault). The quality of my work is going down as well so I am afraid I wouldn't get a good reference from this position (and have been told so pretty directly. I have a couple months to improve otherwise they are firing me). I don't want to rush into anything however if I don't act now and am let go in February I need to have a plan. Even if I'm not let go, I really don't want to stay longer and never planned on staying past a year. This is because I am not learning anything new, and I am considering a completely different career path. Any advice or input would be really helpful, as I am trying to see this situation clearly from an outside perspective. I'm trying not to panic but it is not working. My major is in Economics so I'm looking away from law and considering economic development/a position that makes more use of my degree. However I have tried applying to such positions before and did not find one. I also have teaching experience and speak a 2nd language so another option would be teaching abroad/au pairing/ some kind of similar opportunity. The work environment I am in is somewhat toxic, and employees are treated an expendable (I'm not the only one who sees it that way, I have read many similar things on sites such as Indeed etc.) This is starting to impact my self esteem and how I view myself in a negative way (I am trying not to let it).",23Dec2018,1
76,"Hi. I started a job a month ago working at a body shop for a known car brand. I have never worked on this field and the boss gave me an opportunity to start at a new job after being let go from my last job. 

It all started after the client arrived 45 minues late and it was 10 minutes before my time to leave work. The mistake was when delivering the car to the client, i mistook the client’s car and brought up another car of the same type. Forgot to check the plates or work order. The client’s car had a minor frontal crash and he said the airbag light came on afterwards, but the insurance note did not indicated anything related to that, but i asked the shop boss if they could check it and discard it was related to the crash. Which he did and said the crash sensors were not damaged, so the light had nothing related to the crash.

We were checking the glovebox and the manuals and warranty books were not there. Started looking everywhere and could not find it. Then, another client arrived and said that was her car. It all made sense. I acknowledged my mistake, looked for the first client car and there were the manuals, and the airbag light. And he started complaining as to why we did not check it or fixed it. Told him the whole situation, but he could not believe me because i misplaced the cars.

In the end, he did not take his car home, nor the other chick because she did not pay on time, and I left work feeling like a total loser and feeling like a useless dumb idiot.

Now, i was all alone there. I was the last person at the shop, and i felt overwhelmed by the whole situations.

7 hours have passed and I cannot stop thinking about the whole situation, and how much i messed up...

After being let go from my last job, my self esteem is not at its highest point, and to be honest, i felt like i was doing a good job up until this day. Many clients left with good comments on my service quality and follow-up (send constant pictures of their cars repairs status, so they don’t feel like I do not care about it/them). But these two clients just made me feel like crap.

Are my feelings right or am I thinking this way too much and should not feel like this?

77,"I have known about reddit for a long time and its uses I just never really had a reason to do anything other than read. Never found a true reason until now to post. I've been having a strange occurance  happen to me and I'm curious as to if it happens to anyone else. 

I've been getting random what I call signs from the world I'd say 20-25 times a week for the last 5 or 6 years. What I mean by a sign is things like music or tv or radio saying a word or phrase I say shortly after I say it or do it. Today would be a great example. I decided to walk to a construction site of a new highway they are building, the overpass looks pretty cool and I wanted to get some pictures of it and some of the machines. It's kinda cold out but not terrible and I've been putting in weight so I decided to walk, you have to leave town on a gravel road. However about a mile out is where the over pass is so it's not to far. Now on my way back today, I was rather deep in thought because I've been struggling to get by lately. As you reach the edge of town right before it turns to gravel (going out) or pavement (coming in) there is a cemetary and a song called ""I'm alive"" by story of the year starts playing and literally as I step foot on the cemetary side walk the singer says ""this town is a cemetary"" now that ties to how I was feeling and literally where I was. I have many many things like this happen daily. My girlfriend has noticed as well how often it happens, however she says it doesnt happen to her unless we are together. 

I have one more story, sorry for the long question, my best friends 5th year anniversary of his death. Now this one messes me up because my best friend died on Easter which as we know the date changes every year, so with that and being the worst day of my life I chose not to remeber the exact date before that, i just naturally tied it to Easter.  I digress, ok so that whole entire week every single day I would hear the word lily, or be working with lillies (I'm a landscaper) or see someone with a name tag saying it. I for the life of me couldn't figure out what I was being told by the world. Until the day it stopped. It was the day after my friends death day anniversary. I learned when I was putting things in my important papers box. His obituary cut out was right on top and the day he died was 1 day before that current day.  Lillies had been given away at his wake and they meant the world to me but my old apartment manager burried the ones i had with rock, so I never got to transplant them some years ago. 

So in short, does anyone else have frequent occurrences where the powers that be might be giving you signs on a daily? If so what have you concluded any advice would help.",23Dec2018,1

So J and N knew each other for a while before I ever came into the picture, as N was best friends with J’s sister since high school. Fast forward a few years later, and one night J’s sister flew off the handle and accused J and N of sleeping together. Her only real “evidence” being that they were both staying in the same city on the same night. N was in town for her hands on experience for school and stayed at a hotel, and J works in an office and spent the night in the apartment above. Both J and N have denied very deeply that anything ever happened, and J’s wife even laughed the whole initial accusation off.

Like I said, J and N knew each other and were friends before I ever came around, but recently I can’t shake the thought that I’m being lied to, based on how much time they spend together. They’ve both sworn to me that nothing ever happened between them and nothing will. I just have a hard time trusting them for some reason. J Is married with a young child and his wife thinks nothing of the story, blowing it off as J’s sister being a jerk.

Theres a lot to read, I apologize in advance

Some important things to know; I used to be madly in love with her a few years ago, but she had a boyfriend. One night I was sleeping over at her house, and she came down to the basement where I was sleeping in the middle of the night to tell me that she knows I love her, and that she realizes now she’s loved me the whole time. She would send me songs like “Friends” by ed sheeran, and say it reminded her of me. Anyways we did nothing about this, and didnt really even talk about it since she still had a boyfriend at the time. Fast forward a year and half later, I’m about 3 months into a new relationship with a girl and I decide to distance myself from my friend who i had feelings for before to not cause any trouble. My relationship with that girl lasted 11 months, and ended when I decided I still wanted to be friends with her and my girlfriend couldnt trust me (even though I would never have cheated on her, she had major issues herself but thats besides the point). Now both me and my friend are single, for the first time since we loved eachother, but my friend is talking to a guy a few years older than us whos rich, tall, smart, funny, who has his whole life planned out already. She doesnt see herself dating this guy for a long time though, so shes told me.


Now onto the reasons I think she has feelings for me...

1. We’ve madeout a couple times, once at school sober, and a couple times while drunk. The other night as we were hanging out with our other friend, we pulled over to find a washroom, and as my one friend ran ahead, she called my name, I turned around and she kissed me for a couple seconds. Last night, we were drunk at her house, and she brought me into her room, locked the door and we had sex. It was not awkward at all, and it was really good for both of us (she told me afterward). She also told me she didnt feel judged or awkward, and that it almost felt like we’d had sex before. Right before bed, I brought her to where she was sleeping and she asked for a hug, i gave her a “friend” hug. As i was leaving she asked me for another hug, but a real good one, and as I leaned in, she latched onto me and hugged me the way my girlfriend used to hug me, and didn’t let go and gradually hugged tighter for around 10-15 seconds. Today, the day after, she’s brought up the sex a couple times. It’s also worth mentioning that back when we used to both have feelings for eachother, but before she admitted she had them, we used to do this sort of thing every now and then. But last night was the first time we had sex.

2. Physical contact, and eye contact. She touches me a lot. She finds reasons to touch me, and I find reasons to touch her. Last night, we were with friends for a while and when they were there, she did something shes never done before infront of people. I was passing out on the couch with my arm out, and she came and layed down with my arm around her, and layed her head down against my chest. We then were flirting a lot and smiling and laughing together. We were recording videos of eachother, and she was laughing at my horrible jokes. At one point, when no one was around to see, she gave me this look, she starred into my eyes and I didnt know what she wanted, so I didnt do anything about it, I looked away, looked back, and as the eye contact continued, I leaned in to kiss her and she closed her eyes and went right along with it like thats what she wanted me to do the whole time. Besides that stuff, she just touches me differently than others, and when we make eye contact, a lot of the time it feels deeper than just a friend looking at a friend. I could be wrong though, but this is what my intuition tells me. 

3. Our alone time together is typically really deep and personal. We talk a lot about anything, we get really personal, and we sit next to eachother and often cuddle. I just get that feeling around her that theres something there between us, whenever this happens. Again, could be wrong.

Reasons I don’t know if she actually does love me...

1. She’s a flirt. She flirts a lot has and has a hard time understanding what flirting is (according to her). 

2. Last time I knew i had feelings for her it was because of all of the same reasons, above, except for the sex, and she denied having feelings for me for months before admitting it.

3. Things happen between us when we both are or one of us is drunk or has been drinking. Not all the time, but about 75% of the time. When she called my name and kissed me that was sober, same with at school, and we werent really that drunk last night either.

4. She talks about that other guy, the older guy to me. She shows me their funny texts, or cute things he says. She tells me about their dates, or their sex, or conversations. Sometimes even if were hanging out and its late, she’ll talk to him on the phone for 10-30 minutes in the other room. this confuses me though as she said she doesnt want to date him for a while, and is prepared to just have a “thing” with him for up to a year until theyre both ready.

88,"This is a list of limiting beliefs I have that negatively effect my life:

1. I'm unloved, unlovable 
2. I'm unworthy / not good enough
3. Feel like I'm destined to die alone
4. Repeated suicidal thoughts
5. Feeling ugly / low self esteem

Each one of these stems from the same root cause. In a past life, I was murdered. It was a traumatic death where I was drowned in a pond by a complete stranger. The last thing I saw as I died was a distorted reflection of myself in the water, and my last thought as I died was ""why is he killing me? It must be because there's something wrong with me, maybe I'm ugly, not good enough or unlovable"" and this started many lifetimes that repeated that cycle over and over again. As a result I've always had a distorted self image and body image issues and anorexia, never been able to see things clearly, always suffered from low self esteem, feeling like I'm not good enough, always afraid to get close to anyone, always afraid of life and suffered major PTSD. 
But not only that, I also clearly remember what happened AFTER I was murdered in that life. As a spirit, I watched this man do terrible, disrespectful things to my corpse, and I was so traumatized that I stayed with my corpse and watched it decay and not get a proper respectful burial, so my feelings of being unworthy and hideous amplified up to 1000000 times with that traumatic experience. I was so upset at this man that I followed him around for awhile to find out the answer as to why he did it, and I never got that answer and the more I saw him do, the more it traumatized me, it was never resolved after I decided to move on.

My lives after that and my current life have been a series of unfortunate events, a giant repeated cycle of abuse. 

My belief that I'm destined to die alone, stems from the fact that previously in this current life, I actually did kill myself, but my higher power intervened and gave me a second chance. But that experience was pretty damaging, because I killed myself because I believed no one cared about me (and also because a guy I loved left me), which also goes back to my original limiting belief systems, that I am unloved, which goes back to the original incident that caused that feeling, the first time I was murdered, that traumatic event that happened to me that was never resolved. 

There have been other past lives after the time I was murdered, where I killed myself, all for the same reasons feeling unloved and like I'm not good enough to be alive. In a way, you could also say, I am so quick to suicidal tendencies, all because I was murdered that one time, because I feel like... I'm not good enough to be alive = it's just a way of repeating that cycle over and over again, because it was never resolved. It's almost like my mind says, well, no one else is going to kill me, even though I continuously push people away and do things to make people hate me, or put myself in dangerous situations so it will happen again, and if they won't kill me, then I will just do it myself (because of extreme fear and hurt and resentment)

So obviously, you can see it's a terrible cycle to be living in and I have to let go of it. Not sure where to start.",23Dec2018,1
89,"Hello all! There's a lot here, thank you in advance for all advice...

TL;DR:

Lots of cats peeing and spraying in and around my mom's house, tried bleach water, sporicidan, pheromone stuff, nothing is working, can't get rid of the animals, need help. 



My mom and grandma live together in a house with 2 small male dogs and 7 cats (3 female, 4 male, all spayed and neutered) and my mom feeds a cat or two that are neighborhood cats (most likely not neutered) that don't come into the house at all.

I guess by the title you already know where this is going: the two dogs poop and sometimes pee in the house, mainly in my grandma's room at the back of the house, when they aren't let out fast enough or sometimes just because. But the main problem is the cats pee/spray on everything in the house. They're all indoor/outdoor and know how to use the litterbox so it's not a matter of having to teach them where to go. There's two alpha male cats, an older male cat, a ""teenage"" male cat, two female cats (one stays outside mostly and is very skittish), and a ""teenage"" female cat (the two ""teen"" cats are from the same litter).

They've peed/sprayed on the TV stand, window sills, furniture, against walls, on the front and back doors, in my baby's pack 'n' play, on the washer and dryer, the fridge, the oven (we can't turn it on now without it filling the house with the smell even after cleaning), on top of the stove, in and around the tub, on the mattresses, clothes, boxes, inside closets, on the counter tops... I honestly think the only place they haven't tainted is the cat tree. My mom and grandma clean it up with water diluted bleach and stuff called sporicidan(?) which is supposed to deter them from doing this (it doesn't). They try to get it as soon as they find it but sometimes there'll be crystallized cat urine that they have no idea when it happened. We've caught a male neighborhood cat spraying on our front door, mid-spray, so they're getting hit even on the outside of the house. (I also just wanna put in that we have no problems with the cats pooping outside the litterbox, just peeing and spraying.)

Cleaning doesn't seem to be helping one bit; just tonight I'm cleaning the kitchen for Christmas and there were three tiny containers on one end of the counter with crystallized pee under them and fresh pee on top, I clean it up, stop to make sandwiches on the other end of the counter, come back from eating and they've peed right where I made the sandwiches. The house itself isn't very tidy, it's very cluttered, but my mom works all the time and on her days off she brings my grandma to the doctor and my grandma cleans a little here and there but it doesn't make any difference in the house. (I live away from home with my newborn but I recently broke my ankle so I'm back with them until I can get around with my baby safely. I've tried helping out with cleaning as best I can but my mom likes to clean things a certain way so it's really hard to just up and clean things for her. And though she's lived like this for years, I feel like my mom is finally getting to a breaking point with other family stuff that this certain situation is just the cherry on top.)

My mom refuses to get rid of any cats or dogs, saying they need her and if they were to go anywhere else they would be heartbroken, lonely, depressed. I think if the cats did go it would mentally fuck my mom up more anyways, so getting rid of the animals is not an option at this point. I just need to know if there is anything we can do to make all of this stop besides the option aforementioned. My mom recently bought some cat and dog pheromone stuff that you plug into an outlet and helps calm the animals down and helps stop them from peeing, and also she put pheromone collars on the two alpha males and the older male cat. It seems to have helped the tension a tad but it seems as if things haven't changed. ",23Dec2018,1

He is full of good intentions and genuinely loves my mom, but again,  terrible with words. And worse, he allows his insecurities to rule over him. He often gets overly defensive, even when he truly is at fault. He doesn’t try to understand in the moment, instead tries to twist it onto others. Only long after the argument has ended will he apologize. Though he doesn’t often acknowledge his part in arguments.

I feel that if they were to communicate better with each other, they’d be able to work on it. But as it is right now, they just can’t meet each other halfway.

91,"throw away account here, I haven't been diagnosed or anything, but I've been depressed and anxious more times than I can count this past year (not suicidal). I want to bring it up to my parents but I'm so embarrassed because no one really would expect me to be this sad, lonely, and just unmotivated for anything, since the majority of people I interact with only see the facade I made of me being happy.

92,"My father in laws (40m &amp; 45m) own a business with two other people (26m &amp; 25f) who are horribly unprofessional. They confided in me and told me all the places they’ve had sex in the restaurant, including party rooms and the office, which now makes perfect sense because they’ll both go missing and no one will be able to find them for at least 30 minutes. Then, I heard the female partner ask a server in the restaurant if he brought drugs to work, while sitting at the bar and drinking on the clock. 

My father in laws live and breathe this business. It’s his pride and joy and I know he’d be just as disgusted as I am and even heartbroken.

93,"So, I've been writing stories and whenever I try to describe a character, I always have trouble describing their clothes. 

If they're wearing clothing that covers them, I usually just say they're wearing a 'jacket' or 'hoodie', not knowing there are other terms like 'parka' or 'cardigan' and stuff like that. 

I'm not a native English speaker so I'm not really familiar with the English terms for such clothing.

It would be great if you could share your knowledge about clothing terminologies, mostly the modern ones, it doesn't matter whatever gender wears it, I write about a lot of characters.

95,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

This suspicion started earlier today. I thought it would be nice to arrive at my parents house for the holidays a few hours earlier than what I told them. I get there and see that my friends car is in the driveway. I don't think too much about it since he was always around when we were growing up. I knocked on the door and wait about 5 minutes for my mom to answer. Nothing seems out of ordinary, but as I come out, I see my friend and he greets me and leaves, saying he needs to go get some stuff for the get together later.

That seemed a little weird, but whatever. As I'm catching up with my mom, she's distracted with her phone and giggling over it. She was never the type to focus on her phone. I tried looking through it when she left the room, but it was locked with no notifications.

So all this led my mind to runaway with thoughts and the idea that they may be involved somehow. I'm not sure how to approach it or if I should at all and what my dad would think about it all. It just seems so surreal and I feel like I may be jumping to conclusions, but I'm not sure what to do.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! ",23Dec2018,1
96,"I've been feeling lonely for awhile. I've had two really close friends but they moved to another province for school and we rarely keep in touch anymore. Besides those two, i've never had a main best friend that i could talk to every day. I've had people come and go in my life and at school i have acquaintances that i talk to comfortably during class but we don't really do anything outside of class.

I've reached out to a few former people in my life who i used to be close to in hopes of reconnecting again. With these people we've had decent conversations for a few days but they've all started to ghost me and i feel like i'm the one who always has to initiate the conversation. In short words, i feel like with every relationship i've had i have never received the same amount of energy i put into it.

I'm trying to be positive and think about better changes i can make for myself in the upcoming year. The people i've reached out to i remember were great people and i don't understand how we stopped keeping in touch but it sucks. I'm just getting really frustrated of being an after thought for people an i want to know if i should remain reaching out to people.

I just feel like a loser at times and it gets me depressed and anxious. I've had people come and go in my life and i try with all my energy to reach out and try to keep the bonds i've had but it always goes to shit. I hate feeling this way and i just want to be able to start fresh but i don't know how. For context, i'm 21 years old so i still have a lot of the rest of my life ahead of me and if this period in my life is just a little slump and it will eventually get better.

98,"This is my first post, and sadly it's not a happy one.  

I've known for a short time that my husband was either cheating on me or attempting to.  I've caught him in several lies that he has no explaination for.  They started out small, he said he didn't even realize he had lied.  The more time went on the bigger lies I began discovering.  Now it's at a point where he hides things from me, changes the passwords on his phone and tablet almost daily, and continues to lie straight to my face.  I'm not sure if he believes what he is saying, or if he's just okay with lying to me.  I've gone through his phone before, which lead me to find out that he had been lying to me in the first place.  Today, however, was different.  Today, I was made aware of a conversation between him and an old friend of his that he wished that he had never met me and instead been with them.  I couldn't believe what I was reading, it crushed me.  He was already working on getting drunk when I got home from work and by the time I read this conversation he was pretty inebriated.  When he passed out I went through his phone again to find not only that entire conversation, but other conversations on twitter, text, and other social media where he was attempting to meet guys for sex.  At this point I know there's no excuse for his lies and deceit.  I don't want to leave him,  but I refuse to be the person who is lied to and disrespected this way.  

The most daunting obstacle to my leaving him is that I can't readily support myself without him.  He makes at least three times what I do and pays most of the bills.  Together we have racked up some credit card debt which takes up a good chunk of my paycheck.  I simply can't afford to live on my own with the way things are.  I've been working at paying down my debt so I can save, but of course that is slow going on my salary.  I'm hoping for some sound advice on how to save quickly and pay down my debt in case, after we talk, I need to find a way to survive on my own. ",23Dec2018,1

On the way there, we started to get into an argument about something, and I told her that I had no interest in arguing with her on the way back, so I'd find a way back with one of my friends. She responded with 'Alright, I'll call the police.' Her reasoning for threatening to call the police? To file a missing persons report.

There is a very long history of my parents trying to control me in ridiculous ways, as well as a long history of abuse. This is the second time my mom has threatened to contact the police in order to manipulate me. Both times were absolutely unfounded.

I'm planning on moving out soon, and cutting off contact with my entire family. I feel it would be necessary to go to the police station and tell them that I'm moving out of my parents' house, explain the situation I am leaving, and let them know that my mom may try to file a missing persons report on me, but I am not a missing person.

109,"I (f30) currently work two jobs. 

I am a dispatcher for companies like Servpro, hospice, and after hours for drs offices. It’s boring and sometimes stressful but all in all not the worst. I make 8.50 an hr plus 1.25 incentive. So sometimes I make 9.25.

My other job is a sales associate at a store similar to TJmaxx. I size the clothes, unload the truck, put the items on the sales floor, I recover the store (go around making sure it’s not a disaster basically) I handle the register and have a lot of person to person contact. I make 9.00 at this store. 

I only worked at the store, but they were hardly giving me hours, so I took the dispatching job. 

The issue: they will not stop scheduling me for the same times. The dispatching job tries really hard to work around my store schedule because they know that job is closer to my house.

That’s another issue. The store is maybe 2 miles away, while the dispatch job is almost 30 miles away. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m getting write ups at both jobs trying to accommodate to them both but I’m going to end up getting fired if I don’t just pick one. 

I enjoy the store job because I get to interact with customers, I like my co workers and it’s close to home. 

I don’t like the store job because they are very scattered with my hours. I could have 36 one week and then 12 the next week.

The dispatching job has all the hours I could want and more at all times. And I can potentially make .25 more per hour but it’s not a sure thing. And it’s further away with less pay if I don’t make incentive.

I asked her for a sip and when I took a sip it was obvious there was vodka in it and it was strong. She tried to say that she didn't know that it was, so I asked her to stop. 

A few minutes later when I she went to take a sip I confronted her and she said it makes her anxiety( stress itching and stuff) go away and she doesn't hate my father ( they are having major marital issues. My father is an alcoholic). Then she fucking chugged it.

Through various mutual friends’ social media I saw that there was a gathering at her house, and then followed by the same people out later at a club. Bear in mind I am acquaintances / friends with all the people at this event (I could see said people in the background of Instagram / snapchats). I went to school with practically all of them.

Granted, we hadn’t spoken in a while and I was extremely busy today so didn’t manage to send her a happy birthday message until late in the day. But I thought our friendship went beyond this, and if she was upset about it, I didn’t think it would be to the level she wouldn’t ask me to join in her birthday plans. I think what hurt the most is that I saw my ex-boyfriend was there. My friend saw our relationship from its conception, and was there for me through the break up. So to see that he was invited, and I was not, upset me greatly. 


I have sent my friend a message asking why I was not invited, adding that I’m not asking in an accusatory manner, that I understand if she didn’t want me there, just that I don’t understand /why/, as I wasn’t aware if I’d done anything to warrant this.

I have this terribe feeling of 'missing out'. Not missing out on friends (im a happy introvert as of now) but rather missing out on stories and lore in video games and other media. I have no idea why, but when I find a game or tv show with allot of lore and history I feel the need to learn all of it.  I cant help but get waist deep into worlds other than our own. This only creates a massive snowball of me trying to learn everything there is to know about this one video game.

I have no reason to learn about these things, and I can say that out loud but I still have the feeling of needing to know. I feel that if I dont learn this lore or play this video game, then im missing out. I feel that I need to play every video game ever, or watch every tv series ever, and learn the history of everything ever created. I know this sounds silly, but its seriously been taking over my life. I cant go a day without felling the urge to read the wiki page for some random town in Skyrim or learn about some random character in World of Warcraft.

I talked shit the next morning assuming it was fine. I got worried later in the day when hearing no one had heard from him. My suspicions were true, he carried out his deed. I don’t know what to do with myself. I’m angry, I’m sad, I don’t know how to feel, how to process, I don’t know anything, I’m lost, I can’t help but think about everything I could have done differently. Just sharing. I just needed to put this out there. You’ll never take a suicide warning as serious, especially from someone that has done it multiple times, but they’re real, and they happen.

Me(18M) and my friend (17M) two nights ago decided to go to a girl's house and have sex (3sum) with a girl (17F) we sneak into her house and we all end up having sex. While having sex my dumb ass friend decides to take out his phone and records it her sucking his dick and me having sex with her in doggy style from behind. You see no faces or private regions and my face is blurred but you can still sort of tell it's me. It was all good until my dumbass friend once again decided to post it on his Snapchat story for a good 2 minutes but this guy has at least 2000 people on Snapchat one of them screen recorded sent it to my ex girlfriend and now I'm getting threatened of being exposed and I never did anything as in post it or record it. I'm just wondering what the fuck I should do and if I should worry because I never intended for this to happen and I'm wondering if I did anything illegal. (Also where I live 18 year olds can have sex with anyone older than 14.) I know a bunch of people already have this video although you cannot tell it's me I'm still worried because I never intended for this to happen.

One day he put my hand on his thigh, and I was okay with that. Then, he moved it to his dick, as I was trying to pull away. I don't remember if I said no or not, but there definitely wasn't consent. I don't know if I'm being a drama queen or if this was something that I'm not properly processing. I mean, it didn't scar me, it's not something that I enjoyed though, either.

On the one hand I’m happy to be back and spend time with my parents and sister (she’s 13) but on the other I find myself anxious and frustrated with the situation. My parents do not get along but are together for the sake of me and my sibling. Both of my mom and dad are great people just not together and they truly bring out the worst in one another. For some background...My moms a stay at home mom, and my dad runs his own business and spends a great deal of time out of the house. My mom does not do much besides light cleaning, spending time on the phone with her family, hanging out with her friends, or playing on her iPad. My dad comes home pretty checked out after work and is easily irritated and the two of them often argue about the same things little things. The problem is my mom talks to her friends about her and my dads relationship, while my dad keeps things within our family and often vents to my sister and I. I found this to be extremely stressful since it’s pretty much my two parents talking to me about one another... now that I’m away at college however my sister is the one who has taken my place. I don’t know what to do as my sister internalizes a lot but feels very stressed with what is going on. I suggested for my dad to stop talking to both of us and confide in one of his friends or perhaps going to a therapist with my mom. He agrees something has to be medically wrong with her and she does not use her time wisely and often complains on how much work she’s doing. I know they have a dysfunctional relationship however both are similar in that they invalidate and deny any negative feelings my sister or I have. My sister is aware of this and this is a big reason she keeps a lot of her feelings to herself. I’m really worried and don’t know what to do, she’s starting to stutter I think out of anxiety and I just want to make sure she’s okay. What can I do to help her?

I struggled with mental issues tell I was about 20 around which had my first job. Worked customer service and have helped dad with his beer company.

I am moving to a university away from my family and this makes me very happy that I got to this point, 3-4 years ago I didn't really have a life.

140,"My first semester of college I finished with 4 D’s and 2 C’s. I don’t know how this is going to work credit wise as I am not sure that a credit is given for a ‘D’ in a class. But, first a little background. Basically my parents told me I had to pay for my school myself, and that my grandmother would help me take out a loan only if my grades were good.  My grades were solid up until October when a close personal friend of mine committed suicide which fucked me up real bad. I spiraled out of control with alcohol, cocaine , Xanax, weed , psychedelics, and was skipping classes and not doing shit for my classes. My parents constantly asked how I was doing in school with my grades and checking in on my mental health, and I kept telling them I was doing fine in school and fine with dealing with my friends passing. The school’s therapist reached out to me and she asked if this was affecting my grades and if it was how she could help, and I lied and told her my grades were fine even though it was obvious my grades were in the toilet, but she didn’t know this. My advisor then had a meeting with me about enrolling in classes, and I told her also my grades were fine for some retarted fucking reason. I ended up getting some of my shit together within the last 3 weeks of school and pulling through with passing grades before my final exams except for one class, which the policy at my school is that freshman can retake a failed class if needed, so I was not too concerned and was focusing on my studying. I stopped partying during the week, blacking out, and doing blow in the school week and was feeling confident going into my exams. I failed all of my exams, and was left with 4 D’s in my core classes , and 2 C’s in electives. Jumping around a bit,  I was paying my grandmother monthly for school, and my dad told me that my grandma was going to give me back the money and was paying for my school, and he told me this a little before finals. I was obviously guilty and have been guilty and have been keeping myself awake at night thinking of how I’m going to tell my sweet little grandmother that I miserably fucked up and it destroyed my grades and GPA. I don’t know if she will be able to handle what I have to tell her as she wants to see my report card as soon as possible, and I don’t think I have the heart to tell her or my parents my situation, as I have been lying for months. I really am thinking the worst about everything, and it’s seriously affecting my mental health along with me noticing my anxiety has been crippling as of once I found out my final exam grades.

   I think I’m damaged goods. I’m 21, live in a large city, no debt, in school, and stable. I have a good group friends and my family is very supportive. I also have a trust fund so I never have to worry about money. I don’t think I could ever date someone.


When I was 16 there was this guy I would talk to from time to time I’ll call him John. I would text and talk to him sometimes for over a year. He was a senior. I briefly dated a “bad boy” senior that year named Tim . A lot of crazy rumors were put out there. That I did group sex or things like that. There were these guys in my grade who would tease me a lot. They started rumors that I was slutty.

John invited me to a party that summer after he graduated. People at school called me pretty or said I looked like I was in my 20s or that I looked like Amy Adams. But I lot of people had it out for me. Girls would say I look 40 or I look trashy. I developed quite young.


When I got to this party I drank until I blacked out. I can remember some things of that night. I had hung out with johns friends before and let them drive my car. We go there I get drunk and John gets mad at me because Tim was trying to get me to leave or something. But I don’t remember I was so drunk, but I could walk and talk.


John and his two friends ask me if I want to go back to their place and have some fun I say okay. When we’re at the house they tell me to get undressed and I do. Then they instructed me to suck their dicks. Then laid me back on the bed and penetrated me. I bleed, I said it hurts. They finished.


The following weeks they called me gross. That I was a slut. I had sex with one other person before this. I feel like this happened because I’m ugly. I kept sleeping with and sexting one of John’s friends who did that because I felt lost. He would say he wants sex with me and nothing more. That I’m annoying. I haven’t been with really any other guys since.


Guys ask me out a lot but I think if they found out I did that they’d ghost me. I’m scared all men are like this. This what I think men are like if not family. I think it’s my fault because when I asked John years later about it he said “I don’t like girls who fuck my friends” then blocked me.


Am I a bad person? Was this my fault? Will any guy want me?


Tl;dr: when I was 16 I had a bad sexual experience and am now scared no guy will want me.

148,"I can provide more details if needed, but in a nutshell I'm (24F) planning on moving out of state next year in order to get a better job and be much closer to my boyfriend.

One of my best friends and old coworker (~30F) is also planning on leaving the place where we used to work together and wants to move in with me, which I think is great! I've found an apartment in a really great location, and she's on board with it.

The first thing that made me kind of raise an eyebrow was when she suggested we rent out a three bedroom instead of just two. Technically it would financially be doable - but unless we have to use the extra room for storage or something, I'm not sure we'd actually *need* it - especially with the other financial responsibilities we both have (I'm trying to build up my savings, repay a $2k personal loan, and pay off my car; she has a credit card and car to pay off, etc.).

The second (also financial) concern I have is that she mentioned she wants to sell Mary Kay (which she's never done before) for a living once we're there. Not only does she currently have no customer base, but she's rather shy, introverted, and a bit socially awkward - all things that someone trying to sell a product can't really afford to do (not to mention it's *Mary Kay*). I'm all for her doing something she enjoys, but I don't feel it's very reliable income - especially if she's going to need to pay nearly $500 in rent, in addition to her other bills.

The third flag came up when I mentioned that my boyfriend lived in the same apartment complex (he'd been the one to originally suggest that location, but even outside that fact it's a place I'd like to live regardless). She asked if I thought I'd want to move in with him anytime soon; essentially because she didn't want to make this big life change of moving out of state and living with me just to have me move out on her *a year or two later.* This question caught me off guard, but I told her that while I couldn't guarantee anything, I didn't think our relationship would progress like that, although we'd toyed with the idea before. She made it clear that she didn't want me to feel like I had to put my relationship on hold for her sake, and I made it clear I didn't plan on making her the third wheel...

In any case, I feel like she's basing her life plans on what I'm doing/being overly dependent, and the last thing I want to have happen is for me to hold her back from what she wants to do in life, or vice versa.

Any advice?

**TL:DR -** I'm planning on renting an apartment with my best friend next year. I'm excited, but in the process of working out some details, some things have come up that I'm a little wary about (she wants to rent more space than we actually need, wants to start selling Mary Kay for a living once we move in, and is concerned I'll leave her to move in with my boyfriend after a year or two). I don't want either of us to hold the other back from anything or to be too dependent. Any advice, or anything I should keep an eye out for as we move forward?",23Dec2018,1

I eventually broke up with her over a phone call and she was bawling loudly in whatever public place she was in. The next day she told me she cheated and a friend of mine confirmed that he saw her with some other dude at a bar on a night she cancelled on me during the very short time we were “official”. She continually asked for closure and I ended up blocking her.  She showed up to multiple parties that I went to and my roommate saw her walking around our house at night a few times which scared the shit out of me.

154,"*(Wasn't sure which community would be most appropriate to post this in)*

I'm posting this in case anyone else had trouble trying to figure out what the heck just happened to them; even the ER doctors didn't get this one right.

I was sitting at my computer doing my thing with one of a stream of diet cokes I had consumed over the course of a few months (3-6 small bottles or cans a day).  I felt my right arm start to go numb, so I dropped it to my side and began moving it around next to me.  Then my left arm started to go numb, so I drop my left arm to my side and began shaking both of my arms.  A few seconds later my legs began going numb, so I stood up and began lighting kicking my feet out while also swinging my arms.  A few seconds later a I experienced a sudden, intense, feeling in my chest and numbness began spreading out in all directions (primarily toward my waist).

When this happened my mind went into overdrive.  In the time frame of a split second I decided since my right arm went numb first it was not a heart attack, so I figured it must be a blood clot.  I needed to get blood moving through my system *immediately* and bolted out my bedroom door.  I made it about 5 feet from my door when my legs gave out and I dropped to the ground, slamming my hands onto the ground in a desperate attempt to get blood moving through my system to clear the clot.

Then, as suddenly as it started, it completely vanished - I mean instantly, all over my body it just vanished.  You would think something like that would gradually dissipate, but it didn't happen like that.  My entire body was going numb one instant and the next it was not.  Once it was gone I remained where I was, motionless, for a minute or two before I propped myself up against a wall.  I began shaking as the adrenaline wore off, my legs were so weak I couldn't stand and I remained there for five to ten minutes fighting off nausea.

After fighting off the nausea I called 911 and ended up in the emergency room at my local hospital.  I explained to the ER doctor what happened and he looked at me like I was crazy.  They did all the normal things such as, checking blood pressure, listening to my heart and lungs, etc; they also took a vile of blood.  The doctor later returned and told me he believed it was pre-syncope (he believed I was in the process of feinting).

After being discharged from the hospital I immediately looked up pre-syncope, began investigating symptoms and other people's experiences with pre-syncope and syncope.  None of what I read matched what I experienced.  My father suggested it had something to do with aspartame, so I immediately stopped drinking all diet soda - and POOF!  I have not experienced anything similar in nearly a year (I had a similar experience about a month prior to this, though not nearly as severe).

I have since completely sworn off diet soda and anything with aspartame in it.

There was not an official diagnosis of aspartame poisoning, but after pouring through online articles, websites and forum posts (people posting about their experiences with certain medical conditions) the only one that fit was aspartame poisoning.

If anyone reading this has had a similar experience and was officially diagnosed with something else I would be very interested to hear your diagnosis.  :)",23Dec2018,1

156,"I have no other option to turn to, so I'm turning to the internet. That shows how at a loss I am. So, this requires some background. There was a girl I got very close to in about April of two years ago, to the point that we ended up having phone calls for easily more than 8 hours a day. We also dated briefly, but that was regrettable, and mostly irrelevant to the situation at hand, We ended up getting in fights over really stupid things, and I ended up becoming manipulative and heavy-handed. She continued growing distant, and I kept trying to reel her back, to the point that I was acting like a maniac. 

It was at this point that she blocked me, and we didn't speak for 9 months until I realized what a jackass I was to her, and sent an apology to her about two months ago. This somehow spiraled into talking constantly over text, and the other night, she asked to call. She also ended up giving me her Reddit account, which had some cringey stuff on it.(As pretty much everyone's does) She was really embarrassed, and the next morning, out of pretty much nowhere, said that she didn't want to talk anymore. The reasoning didn't make a whole lot of sense to me and was mostly a ""I feel weird talking to you"" argument. She also deleted the reddit account, which was odd. I want to keep talking to her, or even just find a way to understand. It is also worth noting that my goal with talking again was mostly to understand better what she had felt, because she had always been incredibly unclear about everything. I honestly can't believe I'm turning to internet strangers, but fuck it, it may help to get some third-person advice.",23Dec2018,1
157,"I read an article at the request of my mother about happiness coming from self acceptance.

The issue is that I'm overweight. Health is important, and I can't figure out how to think about making myself a healthy weight without freaking out about all the other stuff. Or how I'm super concerned about my social life. If I was comfortable with how I am right now, I would never talk to anyone again. I keep having this vision of me as an extremely happy obese crazy cat lady.

I just feel like my search for healthy improvement also comes with aggressive criticism that blocks me from ever feeling good about myself. How can I both improve and accept myself for who I am?

159,"Please take a few minutes to read this, I really need help on this one.

( ** Throwaway bc idk if him or his friends use reddit and I don’t want to take any chances.)

My brother got home from being out and we ended up chilling. While doing so, he showed me a fake ID he got and he was pretty smug about it. The cost of it was much more than I thought it would be, but then again I never had one.

In another circumstance I wouldn’t give a shit, however - my concern? He’s a minor. He’s been going down a road that I’m really concerned about, and my parents are very afraid as well (and they don’t know half of what I do). He has tried pretty much every non needle drug I know of (something like 12-15 in total) (refuses to try needles),  has been smoking weed every day almost all day since he was a freshmen, has sold drugs (currently not but might again for money even though he has a job). 

His behaviour has changed and most of the kids he hangs around with are decent kids but just aren’t making good choices, and are just involved in /that/ culture. He tries to appear really tough and like he’s better and smarter than everyone (mostly around street smarts, life, finances, and authority), generally is very irritable, highly values money and expensive things and wonders why others don’t, says he’ll hit or fight or do whatever if someone or something pisses him off, wants an illegal exotic animal for a pet, the list goes on. 

He is out all the time and often doesn’t text back or answer his phone and we usually never know where he is. He gets angry if he doesn’t get his way or get to do something he wants to do, and often says he will do it or does it anyways, and he’s pretty defiant. He expresses that he has no respect for rules or authority - generally he doesn’t get in trouble or anything but at home with our parents it’s a different story (I don’t blame him tbh but that’s another shit show story, I just think he could handle things better). His clothing choices have completely changed and at first he was more stylish but now he dresses like a mix between a fuckboy, streetwear, and 2chainz. He’s recently dropped money on expensive material items. I don’t even know, just so much has changed and when you connect them it just feels it’s just a bunch of little red flags, but maybe I’m just extremely anxious and oversensitive. He doesn’t think he has a problem. 

Seemingly I’m the only person he trusts to tell these things to. His friends know about all the stuff I do I’m assuming, but he has opened up a bit more on occasion. He said that he doesn’t trust anyone. It’s taken me quite a while to build his trust because once you lose it with him you aren’t likely to get it back easily (even since we were young). He doesn’t trust our parents at all and neither do I, they caused us so much distress and issues all growing up and even now, although it’s gotten a bit better (at least for me as I’ve gotten better). I am a few years older and we are becoming adults and he is my only sibling. I value having that relationship with him so much. I’m scared to lose him to mistrust but also scared of losing him due to the people he comes across or gets involved with, or the risks he takes. I feel like I’m at a loss of what to do in general. I’m going to get naloxone training soon because you never really know. 

I’m not sure what to do here. He keeps getting into more and more shit and has no plans after finishing school other than leaving home right away apparently even though he has no clue where he wants to go. His communication over the last year has changed and become a bit strange to me over time likely due to the influences around him, but I don’t know. 

When he showed me his fake ID, he was quite smug and I asked him what he was going to do with it. Basic legal adult stuff (drinking, buying alcohol/weed, whatever, idk what else you can do with an ID tbh), but there’s other issues/concerns I have with the type of ID that I won’t go into detail about.

I’m afraid and not sure what to do. I can’t tell our parents because they’ll lose their minds and he will never trust me again, and I can’t have that. Our house is already extremely stressful and a mess, and having that one trusting bond is important. I don’t want to make him angry or not trust me anymore bc idk what’ll happen. I can’t drop a hint right away to my parents. I don’t even know how soon he will use it. I love my brother so much and he would probably think I’m nitpicking and freaking out over nothing in his mind, but I just want to make sure I’m doing what I can to look after him. I love and care about him much more than I think he realizes. 

Do I take it it? Throw it away? Mind my own business? Somehow monitor him with it? Give hints to my family later on? 

Please help me. I am really nervous and not sure what to do at this point. Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.

162,"Buckle up this is a long story. I'll start from the top. Me (21F) and my ex bestfriend (lets call her stacey because it gets confusing) (21F) use to be friends for about 7 years untill recently I stopped talking to her. Basically what happened was that I started to notice how she would treat me during our friendship. During June I would ask her if she wanted to hang out together but she would say no. I was fine with it because I'm not clingy and I she was sick that week. So I'd text her back wishing her to get better soon, but then I noticed that same day I had asked her to meet up she went out to lunch with her boyfriend and completely ignored my texts. This didn't bother me since it's her boyfriend why would I get mad about this so I dismissed it. At that time I started realizing every time I'd ask her to hang out she'd say no but when she would ask me I'd say yes to her. Throughout my friendship in high school with her she would be like this ditch me to be with her boyfriend at the time in hs. It did bother me but then again it's her boyfriend. I'm not gonna be that bitchy friend who makes them choose between a relationship and a friend. During that month of June I would again ask her if she wanted to hang out but again she'd say no or that she was busy. One of those days I saw on her snapchat story that she posted a thanks to a gift she had received from an ex friend of her's. This is when I started to get annoyed because this ex friend who stacey recieved this gift from and was happly posting about it on snapchat was from girl she had a falling out with her a few months back. Basically this ex friend of my ex friend's  did something horrible to her and my ex friend decided to stop talking to her. My ex friend spent days crying over this situation and I was there for her when she was crying and gave her advice etc what a friend should do. Back to me seeing this post on snapchat that made me angry because she decided to spend time with someone who made her feel like shit over someone who was there for her.

i used to be friends with these girls (let’s call them Red and Black), they’re  drug addicts, homeless most days and criminals. i used to be a lot like them so that’s how i met them, over time i changed and stopped drugs for a while. and i was over at their house, they cut my hair in my sleep. then the next day accused me of breaking their ipad (which i swear on my soul, i didn’t)
they threatened me buy saying they’ll run through my house, kill me and my mother and family, and saying some very brutal things.
a week later i went to a party in the middle of nowhere, i went with my best friend and her boyfriend,
Red and Black were there, they tried to kill me, by setting me on fire, coming up to me and spraying deodorant and putting a lighter where the deodorant came out, my face was lightly burnt and my hair was set on fire. they then tried to bash me, but i walked off.

As the title suggests, I have an issue with losing the ability to speak when I'm particularly stressed out.

Ask me about any even semi-triggering topic, and I go mute. No matter how hard I try to get any words out, I just can't.

Now, I know this is probably definitely one of those ""see a therapist"" things.
But firstly, and most importantly currently, I don't have time for that right now. I need any sort of suggestion for a quick fix, because there's someone I seriously need to talk to in the next few days. It's *imperative* that I get to speak with them openly about our situation and salvage something from our relationship.

They're aware of the problem and always so understanding when I freeze up, but they deserve one conversation that doesn't end in twenty minutes of silence followed by a shaking, lung-constricting panic attack.

Especially now.

We both need this.

As for long term, I really don't care enough about myself to fix the problem if I can't mend things with this person. I'll likely never want to be emotionally close enough with anyone else to talk about stressful and triggering topics.

If we do manage to have some sort of conversation then I'll jump back into therapy as soon as possible for their sake. But right now I need to have this talk.

173,"I apologize if I come off as petty. This will probably be long. 



My brother and I used to be very close, despite our age gap of ~8 years. 


Hes now almost 31, and I am 24. 


A few years ago, he moved away for work, and met his wife. 
They've been married for about 3 years now. 


Ever since he met her, we dont talk as much. That's fine. He has someone else to talk to. And they are a good couple. 


I used to think my sil and I got along fine. But this evening something happened that makes me think otherwise. 


First, they live 30 minutes away from her family. They live 4 hours away from us. 


Second, they have admittedly spent the past 2 years coming to our house for Christmas. So its only fair they spend this year with her family. That is not the issue. 

Third, my brother/sil and our cousins (who also live ~4 hours away in the direction opposite my brother) got in later in the evening on Friday and are leaving on Monday morning. This limits the time we can spend with them. We are doing Christmas with them and our grandparents on Sunday. We will probably spend most of the day with them.

Fourth: I spent most of today with my cousins, and my brother and sil were invited to come to dinner at our grandparents house. They did not come (our mom and stepdad included) bc my SIL did not want to go. So, I lost a day of spending time with my brother. 


The incident: 

We were discussing what time we wanted to do our Christmas after I got back from our grandparents house. They then informed us, they were leaving at 10 a.m. sharp. They could not leave later than 10. Due to the points above, that severely limits the times we could do Christmas. Especially bc our step dad has work this weekend. 

After thinking about it, I ask if they could leave later on Monday. I was talking like 2-3 hours. My sil snaps back ""Weve spent the past 2 Christmases here, we wanted to do Christmas with my family this year.""


I was stunned. At no point was I contesting that. Nobody was against that. Disappointed? Yes, but not against it. 


The way she said it rubbed me the wrong way. And then, she goes and drives off somewhere. Comes back about an hour later, and goes straight to their room without saying anything. Wouldnt even talk to my mom who just wanted to apologize for upsetting her.  



Where I'm at:


I tried to let it go. But the longer time went on, the more upset about it I got. I'm not a person who gets upset easily. But this just rubbed me the wrong way. 


I went to my room, started getting ready for bed, and thought about why it bothered me so much. And sadly, I found the problem. A problem I dont know how to fix or move past.

See, at their wedding, our mom and her dad joked that my brother and sil have their own language. When they talk to each other, they speak in this super fast, almost like a quiet mumble, with each other. It's impossible to participate in conversations when they speak like that. 


Whenever they come to 'visit' us, they do that. They talk to each other, no matter how many people are in the room. 


The three of us have similar interests, so when they come to 'visit', we wind up doing things that are just the three of us. They talk like that most of the time were together. 


I began to realize that while they 'physically' make the drive, they very rarely actually visit with us. The only times I can have meaningful conversations with my brother is when my sil goes to bed or decides not to join us. 


I also began to think back on my third wheeling adventures with them. I think my sil let me go with them more out of obligation than bc she was cool with me being there. 


There are some other things. But those are the main things. 



I think I'd just been bottling these feelings up. I dont want to be the sister who gets jealous of her older brothers wife. But I feel like I dont get to talk or hang out with him anymore. I dont like this feeling of being the bad guy bc I want to enjoy the time I spend with him, instead of feeling like an inconvenience.

179,"Hey everyone,

Before I start, without trying to be offensive, I ask that you **only comment if you have something concrete to say, like telling me exactly what you think is wrong with me or exactly what I can do to fix it as soon as possible**. Please try to understand that I am not trying to be mean. Thank you.

I'll try to make this as quick as possible. For the entire year, up until about 2 months ago, I've been really stressed for a 13 year old I think. Stressed as in waking up at 5 am everyday and working (cleaning, studying, self improvement, tasks assigned by parents) until around 11pm with no rest. It was really quite intense who much I worked what with other pressures like my parents never really being satisfied and still getting mad at me even after all the cleaning and stuff I do. 

So, long story short, about 2 months ago I started getting really strange feelings. I feel so overwhelmed by everything. Even small things, I just get so overwhelmed. I feel like everything in my mind is a mess and everything is just a clutter. The more things I need to do and remember (like tasks and general advice) the more overwhelmed I get. So I was thinking, I need to fix this very soon. I found out about GTD because I figured my problem was that my mind was so cluttered and tried it multiple times but it didn't work for me. It just got me more stressed and overwhelmed I think and it was hard to maintain. 

Just two days ago, I just sat down and wrote down all the things I was thinking and feeling. It was really long but here was my ""verdict.""

""The problem is that there's so much in my head so I need to declutter my mind and organise everything (maybe externally instead of inside my brain)."" Which was why I tried GTD but that didn't work.

So I suppose here's the essence of my question: Is my problem stress burnout or is it my verdict (my mind having too many things inside it) and how do I fix the problem as soon as possible (please don't say things like 'take it easy for a month' or 'go see a counsellor' or 'talk to your parents'. I know of those options but I have valid reasons why I'm not doing those things.)

However, I'm unsure if the 9-5 cubicle life is for me. 

I've applied to two schools and have been accepted into both. The University of Oregon and the University of Hawaii at Manoa (using WUE, so my tuition per year is 16k at Hawaii)

I don't know specifically what job field I want to be in, but I do know that I would like to help other people. I'm really unsure of what path to go down: What degree do I get? Do I consider grad school after? Should I look into becoming a doctor possibly? Where do I go to school? My friends have told me to go to Hawaii for the ""adventure"" and a chance to be somewhere new. Staying in Oregon and attending UO at in-state prices is definitely a smarter option financially, however, I still come back to not even knowing what I want to major in. I've even considered enlisting in the military to try and find some purpose to my life, but I don't think that is the path for me. I don't mean to sound conceded, but I'd consider myself to be a smart academically (4.0 GPA) and I know that I'd be capable completing anything I pursued in life - it's just I don't know exactly what I want to pursue. 

I know that a few personal goals for my life include: being successful (whatever that means), being happy, I do want a family eventually, I want to see the world and most importantly whatever I end up doing I want to help other people and know that whatever work I'm doing, me doing it is making someone else's life better.

I apologize for the long message, I can't sleep and thought I'd type out my current thoughts. I appreciate any and all messages, I'll be actively responding to comments made. 

A big thank you in advance to anyone that reads, responds and can offer any insight in what to do.

181,"My name is Shelby and I really need help.  In a dark place and didn’t know where else to really turn to.  27, have a great family and partner.  No kids, bisexual female, abuse, rape and molestation survivor, I deal with PTSD and MDD but I know how to make anyone smile.  I still have a big heart.

I am a recovering cocaine addict and alcoholic.  I am 125 days clean today, nearly 5 months clean of coke.  I was 3 years clean and relapsed due to my mom leaving my dad and my baby siblings across the country.  I flipped out and did a few bumps.  I hate myself for it.

I have worked in restaurants and bars all my life.  Either that or babysat when I was a teen.
I was homeschooled, maybe have the education of a 5th grader, however I am very bright and beautiful inside and out, even though I don’t always believe it.

I got a job as a seasonal LUSH sales associate selling soap and gifts.  It is a dream come true.  I love it so much, it has helped me feel like I can do anything.  Been busy for the holidays, but I was informed if I am granted a secure job there it may only be part time and very few hours.  Maybe make $10-11 an hour plus some small bonuses during contests and goals.  I currently open the LUSH shop around 8am in the early morning and run to the bar from 4pm to close (sometimes not getting to sleep until 2am).  I already have had hallucinations and anxiety attacks from not caring for myself.

My partner of 3 years told me that if it’s only part time  hours at the shop, I will have to keep bartending.  We simply can’t afford to have me work part time.
The thought of having to continue this makes me want to die.  I don’t care about bartending, I don’t like it, I hate it with everything I am.  Being around booze and drugs all day is tempting and I don’t think he understands that 100%.  I hate the customers and I hate the vibe it attracts. I am done.

How do I get out?  Please please help me.
I seriously might do something terrible if I have to stay bartending.  I want to die thinking of it.  Like take a blade or something fatal to myself and just end it somehow there.
My biggest nightmare is being stuck behind a goddamn the rest of my days.  I can’t.  I love sober and healthy me and I want out.  12 years too long in this shit.

182,"Long story short, there is this guy that goes to my school. He first started talking to me over text 5 months ago and ever since then he'd be flirting with me, making me feel like I'm the only girl in his life. At that time I didn't know him very well although we had similar classes we didn't talk much, I found him attractive and from what I saw when he spoke to his friends he seemed to have a great personality. Anyways after a while he opened up to me about how he was a few girls at the same time and asked for me to help him change. I tried my best to help and did everything I could because I felt that he genuinely wanted to make a change, which he did. He ended up breaking up with them but continued to flirt with me. Flash forward to a few months later, he finds a girl he really likes and starts dating her. At this point we were still texting but all the flirting had stopped which I was okay with since he really wanted to change. I also made it clear to him that I did not want any sort of relationship with him even before he got with this girl. A few weeks into their relationship, when he was texting me he started to get flirty all over again but this time he was also being very disrespectful and made me feel like I am a slut. I asked him to stop flirting with me and to stop being disrespectful but he didn't stop. He kept going on and began to victimise himself saying it wasn't possible for him be loyal to his girlfriend as there are many girls out there who are ""much better"" and that he is attracted to other girls. I have tried my hardest to help him but at this point I don't feel like doing anything, especially after how he made me feel. I'm unsure of how to tell him to stop talking to me because every time I try to shut him out he doesn't take the hint and continues to go on and victimises himself.

P.S. I don't want to give out too much as he is on Reddit

I’m thinking of something like a 3–4 months trip to a somewhere uncrowded, spiritually sound place like Siberia or Alaska.

Basically, all I really want is to get some time with myself, think my life through, cut all the crap that has been going lately. I wanna read books I haven’t been able to read for years. I wanna drop everything down from my shoulders, and, again, live by myself for sometime. Relax. Get rid of excess. Break the bad habits. Set further goals. Get inspired. Get fueled and get back to normal life.

Any ideas on how to do that considering the fact I don’t have a lot of money? Any places, thoughts etc. I would love to read everything",23Dec2018,1
184,"This is going to sound pretty bad, but I'm seeking some help with College. I'm 31, so this is going to sound even worse to some. I'm attempting to go to college for the 4th time now and I've run into this problem again as of last semester. Each time I've gone I have made it to about 3/4 or nearly finals time and have held nearly a 4.0 each time throughout the course. My professors have really liked me and so have my fellow classmates. But I seem to fall off at this point every time. I get this far and then one day just stop going to class like I can't deal with it anymore, I then fall behind, not want to go to try and play catch up or skip the one class I missed and then just completely end up failing from there. I'm not sure what actually causes this, but it's now to the point that I know it's something to do with me. I'm just looking for any sort of advice I can get about this.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I can think of is that I get a bit overwhelmed even just a little bit and I seem to just drop everything, even if it's one lesson I fall behind on, it seems to have me fall behind on everything related to it as if I would rather flat out fail then miss something.

187,"I (21 f) have known my partner (21 m) since we were born, but we’ve been dating for over 2 years. I’ve worn a purity ring since I was in 6th grade, and while it has religious ties to Christianity, I wear it more because I operate well with boundaries in relationships and I really want to save myself for someone who will appreciate me and commit to me in the way I deserve (marriage). 

My boyfriend has been amazing with this. Incredibly respectful, always asking if I’m okay every time we do anything remotely physical (physical contact is hard for me sometimes because of some history with sexual assault). He’s the first person I’ve ever been with that has never tried to make me compromise what makes me comfortable for his own desires. 

I’m fully invested in him and this relationship. We have talked about our future and actually lived together for one summer when we had an internship in the same place. He’s told me he sees us getting married, and we’ve even discussed when would be an appropriate time to get engaged (we don’t want to get married before we graduate college). We are both about to transfer to a new college and I thought that amid this transition, a promise ring would be a thoughtful gift to remind him of how much I love him and kind of provide an assurance. 

Would this be lame? I don’t want him to feel forced into wearing it and secretly hate it. He hasn’t ever worn jewelry and I’m also worried that he might get crap from friends or classmates about it, but I don’t know if I’m overthinking it. I’ve never given a gift like this before and I don’t want to put him in an awkward position. I just want him to have something meaningful that carries a bit of significance and I like the idea of a promise ring as kind of a step into a more serious relationship. 

(He gave me a ring for our anniversary one year, but it wasn’t ever indicated that it was a “promise ring,” so he hasn’t ever given me anything like this. not sure if that matters.)",23Dec2018,1

192,"Buckle up this is a long story. I'll start from the top. Me (21F) and my ex bestfriend (lets call her stacey because it gets confusing) (21F) use to be friends for about 7 years untill recently I stopped talking to her because I started to notice how she would treat me during our friendship. During June I would ask stacy if she wanted to hang out together but she would always just say no. I was fine with it because I'm not clingy and I knew she was sick that week. So I'd text her back wishing her to get better soon and I'd get no reply back from her. Which was okay because I knew she was very sick since I had gone with her to her doctor's appointment. Then I saw that she posted on snapchat of her and her boyfriend having lunch. This didn't bother me because it's her boyfriend why would I get mad about this so I dismissed it. During that time I started realizing how every time I'd ask her to hang out with me she'd say no ,but when she would ask me I'd say yes to her.  A week later still in June I would again ask her if she wanted to hang out but again she'd say no or that she was busy. One of those days I saw on her snapchat story that she posted a thanks to a gift she had received from an ex friend of her's. This is when I started to get annoyed because this ex friend who stacey recieved this gift from and was happly posting about it on snapchat was from girl she had a falling out with a few months back. Basically this ex friend of stacey  did something horrible to her and so stacey decided to stop talking to her. After that stacey spent days crying over this situation and I was there for her when she was crying and gave her advice etc what a friend should do. Back to me seeing this post on snapchat that made me angry because stacey decided to spend time with someone who made her feel like shit over me someone who was there for her. And stacey didn't even tell me she was meeting up with her ex friend. This is when I decided I would start saying no to her if she asked to go out somewhere with her. And I did keep up with my promise ans I also started to reply with short answer to her texts.(I realise this is childish &amp; petty) I think stacey noticed I was upset with her because when I said no to her in one occasion she'd ask if she could come pick up a sweater I had borrowed from her. When she came to pick it up she looked annoyed with me but me being a bitch I am I plastered on my fake smile and talked to her in a cheerful manner even though I knew she looked mad at me. Look back I think she had asked me to hang out with her that day just so she could get her stuff back. After this situation I thought to myself I was being crazy and overreacting because we've been friends for such a long time. So I decided to ask her that same day if she wanted to go grab a drink the following day, again she said she had plans with her boyfriend. Shooker. But I didnt get mad because she had planned a day with him so I understood that. The following day comes and I'm on snapchat at night when I see stacey's story. It was a picture of her lunch with a whole group. And guess who that group was yup Stacey's ex friend's again. The one's who made her cry for days straight and yet she completely dissed me for them. Then I saw on her Instagram she posted a picture of them together captioned something along the lines ""a sweet reunion.""  I was done at that poiny I decided I didn't want to be friends with someone who was pushing me away for other people. I decided not to reply to her in the first week of July. ( spoiler now its dec and I still haven't talked to her) Two weeks passed by and I started to feel guilty so I asked another one of my best friends who we'll call her jessica if I was overreacting about the whole sit3. Jessica knew all the info of my friendship with stacey, btw they hate each other and can't be around each other. Jessica asked me ""what has stacey ever done for you?"" That's when it hit me what has she done for me I've been the one doing everything. I've gone to all her theater performances she's been in (and I HATE THEATRE ESPECIALLY MUSICALS), I'd sacrificed myseld to go far to watch a musical with her for a class assignment because her boyfriend didn't want to go, everytime she was emotionally distressed I was there, I lied to my parents that I was sleeping over at her house just so I could instead stay at her boyfriend's house who she was house sitting for, I went to a club that I knew I was gonna hate because of their music but I still pulled through and even danced all night to music I did not like and guess what her boyfriend did not go because he doesn't like clubs. I could go one and one for how much shit I've done for her, it's so hard for me to make a list of things she's done for me. I admit she was there for me one time I was emotional and she did throw me birthday party but that's about it. Now without thinking too hard I could easily make a list about how bad she was of a friend to me but I'll point out the top things. During that month of June she completely ignore me when I texted her that I was feeling depressed never did I get a text from her asking me what's wrong or if I was feeling better. I never open up to anyone and she knows this so it was hard even telling her that I was feeling depressed, but during that time I ignored it because I didn't want to look weak. In June I graduated from college and she didn't even attend my graduation, I did give her the option of attending and she didn't because she found it awkward if she had gone with her boyfriend and sat next to my family. She couldn't even come to my graduation because she felt awkward she didn't even think about the fact that I went to all her stupid theater performances even though I hated theater. Or that I went to her mother's boring graduation and that I felt awkward with all her family there. That's why I decided to stop being her friend, yet I didn't block her number or unfriend her from any of my social media. In the end of August I was lurking and found out she had unfriended me from all social media including playstation! Since I was still friends with her I could see her post and I saw that she had taken the time to delete every photo I was in her Instagram. (What a bitch!) Oh and btw during June to August this bitch was posting petty ass stuff about me on her Instagram when I didn't even post anything petty about our falling out. After that I just began to hate her I just want to call her out on her bs. I unfriended her ass on social media too and took down all the pictures she was in. Don't tell me I could have talked it out with her in the beginning because I didn't feel like I should have been the one to reach out to her and ask her what was wrong that's what she should have done with me.(back in hs we had a similar fight but I actually reached out to her and worked things out eventhough she was wrong in that situation) I would have calmly told her why I was upset and would have tried to resolve it with her but she obviously didn't care about me and never reached out to me. Instead she decided to be petty online and unfriend me. I guess that's the type of perseon she is I was her only friend all she had was me and if you want to count her boyfriend. I didn't have a problem cutting her snake ass out of my life because unlike her I still have friends I can rely on unlike her who I was the only friend she could open up to. I think about this stupid drama constantly I just want to move on from her. What do I do? The worst part is that we go to the same university 🙄 thoughts? Advice? ",23Dec2018,1
193,"For obvious reasons, this is a throwaway account.  So to explain what's going on, my friend will raise his voice at me somewhat often. This wouldn't be a problem but due to my social Anxiety this throws me into a state of wanting to cry but being too scared to actually cry. The last time this happened was just half an hour ago and I'd decided to just hide in the bathroom for a good ten minutes before thinking I was well enough to be sitting with him. 

I know the first suggestion for this would be to stop hanging out with him, but due to some unfortunate events in my life I live with him. Going to my room is also out of the question because I sleep on the couch.

If you're wondering what he says when raising his voice, it changes depending on what's going on. The most common topics though are: me being wrong about something, me gently moving his cat away from something she shouldn't be messing with, me accidentally saying something, me doing something that mildly annoys him, and me simply enjoying something he doesn't like.

I realize now after typing this out that he doesn't seem like a friend to me at all. But we've supported eachother through our worst times and he feels like a brother to me. He's mentioned before that he can be a bit testy when he hasn't had a smoke, but I'm starting to doubt that because every half hour he's outside lighting up a cigarette.

Really I just need advice on approaching this situation, because I hate when it happens and I feel like it's going to ruin our friendship one day. As a side note, I'm also seeing a therapist for other problems going on in my life. I'd bring this up with them, but their office is closed until the new year and I feel as though I shouldn't call the emergency line for something this mundane.

198,"*I am sorry for the long post, but I feel like it's necessary and this is the first time I've sat down and wrote out my thoughts. There is a TL;DR at the bottom.*

My father has been contacting me (M25) the past couple of days asking to see me for Christmas. We've spoken on the phone sparingly here and there, but I haven't seen him in person for almost a year and a half. He keeps calling my phone or messaging it saying he wants to see me to give me money for Christmas and get something to eat somewhere (Not even mentioning he wants to see my sister). I am conflicted if I should go see him or not. I would like some advice on the matter. Additionally, I don't want to accept money from him either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some childhood memories I have of my father. My mom and dad divorced when I was young. I almost have nothing, but bad memories with him. (Chronological order, to the best of my memory)

1. When I was 4-6yrs, I go around my house greeting inanimate objects on the weekends. I'd say ""Good Morning"" to them (Weird I know, but I was kid). One weekend, I climbed my bathroom counter and greeted the overhead light. The light dislodged and fell to the counter smashing into pieces. This woke my dad up and he grabbed me by the arm and flung me onto my parents' bed and proceeded to beat me with a belt. He kept me there for a while (An hour or so?) and would intermittently come in and hit me with the belt through the blankets. 
2. When I was in kindergarten, I fell and broke my arm while playing on the jungle gym at a park. My dad was there playing pick-up b-ball with his friends. I ran to him crying after I had broken my arm. He told me that he wanted to finish watching the game he was watching his friends play. (He was an X-ray tech then, and still to this day. So, he knows a broken arm when he sees one.)
3. When my parents divorced, my dad would rotate women out of mine and my sister's lives (Me: 8-12yrs old? Sister: 4-8yrs old? I'm guessing here). My parents would have us on alternating weekends. Every other weekend it seemed like he had a new woman draped around his neck. Sometimes he would even skip over his time with us and not take us for multiple visits in a row. My sister and I were never comfortable around these women, but were expected to treat them like they were our own mother.
4. Around the same time my dad was meeting these women, he took my sister and I to a motorcycle expo of sorts. We spent the whole day at the expo exploring the place looking at bikes and what not. Eventually, my sister and I grew hungry after our day of walking around. We asked our dad if would take us to get food. He told us to wait a little bit. So, we waited, after a while we reminded him that we were hungry. Again, he told us to wait. This cycle repeated for hours; all the while he explored the expo. Eventually, my sister told me that her stomach was starting to hurt from being so hungry. We abandoned our dad and started looking for food to eat. I managed to collect free food samples from vendors to feed her while we waited. When we found our dad again, he had't realized we left.
5. My sister, dad, stepmom, uncle, aunt, and I were driving out of state to visit family. We brought my dad's lap dog with us. We stopped at a rest stop on the highway to use the bathroom, feed the dog, etc. The dog managed to flip its food dish while eating. My dad told me to clean it up before walking away to use the bathroom. The dog mauled my hand while I was cleaning the mess. It left my hand bleeding profusely and swollen. My stepmom just shrugged and said I should've been more careful cleaning. My uncle and aunt tended to my wounds .
6. When I was in middle school, I had my heart set on buying myself a video game that I really wanted. I knew I saved up the money in my piggie bank that I had at my dad's I went to the piggie bank one weekend and discovered almost half of my money missing from it. My sister and I checked her bank and hers was almost empty. Too scared to ask our father about the missing money, I quietly withdrew the money I needed for my game and bought it when I was back with my mom. Fast-forward to my next visitation with dad. He discovered that my money was missing (cementing in my head that he was taking our money) and began to yell at me. He said I had no right to have taken that money and was, in fact, stealing.
7. My sister wanted breakfast and decided to make herself a bowl of cereal to eat. When my dad found out, he yelled at us for eating the cereal. From then on, we always had to ask if we could eat certain foods. The answer was almost always No. We never did anything during the days visited, except just roam the house or watched DVDs from his collection. He would make big meals for us to eat late at night, usually around 9pm-11pm. But only after having us wait almost 12 hours or more **from waking up** to eat. 
8. We were visiting my stepmother's sister one summer. My step-aunt had a big pool for her kids and us to play in. My dad and I were rough housing in the pool with my cousins. I jumped onto his back, piggyback style, and something made him snap. He ripped me off his back and dunked me in the water violently several times. On the final dunk, he held me under for what seemed like an eternity before letting me up. The look in his eyes said it all. 
9. When I was a preteen, one weekend at his house (around the time cell phones were becoming a thing) my dad was sick with the flu or a cold. The weekend was winding down and 5pm was approaching. 5pm was the time my dad was supposed to return us to our mom. My dad told us he was too sick to drive. This turned into an argument between our parents when we called our mom. Neither of my parents knew where the other lived and smartphones weren't a thing yet so directions couldn't be given. We always met at a police station for pick up and drop off. My mom purchased for me a basic cell phone to use and I was calling her from the basement; giving her updates on the situation as to when we'd be getting dropped off. The plan was that my step mom was going to drop us off after she got out of work at around 9pm-ish. My actual mom was calling my dad's house phone between calls with me arguing with him. My dad got fed up with me calling my mom from my cell. He came downstairs from the living room and demanded that I hand over the phone. I said ""No"" on the grounds that he wasn't paying the bill and therefore couldn't take it. He proceeded to take the phone from me by force. He pushed me onto the couch and pinned me to the couch by shoving his knee into my chest; while prying the phone from my hand. This all happened while my little sister watched, crying. That was it for me and refused to visit his house for years. My sister didn't go back either. The police got involved too.
10. Jump to me in high school. I played on my football team. Football was the only sport my dad would support me in. He never attended my wrestling meets, nor track meets. Also, my dad is notoriously cheap. He would routinely show up to my football games after halftime so that he wouldn't have to pay the entrance fee. (They stopped charging after halftime). One game in particular, we were getting blown out by a team. I was on the sideline and saw my dad walk into the stadium. He looked at the scoreboard, turned around, and left. Later that night, I called him and confronted him about it. He denied even being at the game at all.
11. Again, my dad is a cheap person. He would refuse to help pay for normal child expenses, such as my football cleats for example; or my sister's gymnastics apparel when she was in gymnastics. Whenever I asked him for help financially (which I rarely did, and only would ask if I had to) he would make a big ordeal about how he never has money to help out. Yet, he would go on lavish vacations or have new sports memorabilia in the basement. He owns a sports car and claims to own over $10,000 in firearms. My most recent financial issue with him was that I asked for $500 for summer classes for college. It was $1000 for the classes and I asked him to split the cost with me. After much fighting and arguing, he thankfully helped. Additionally to the college issue, I have been in my university for 3.5years and he has yet to come even visit my college. He and my mom both live about one hour away in two different cities, but my mom manages to visit a few times a semester.
12. This past spring, I had planned a visit to Alaska (a once in a lifetime trip for me) to visit a friend in the military. I started planning it in January and was going out in mid-May to visit. I get a phone call in late April from him asking me if I wanted to visit family out of state for his birthday in early June. I told him that my trip to Alaska was already planned, creating a scheduling conflict. He asked me if I would cancel my trip. I told him that I wasn't going to do that. I already had non-refundable money sunken in. Additionally, our damaged relationship didn't let me care enough. He then proceeded to try and guilt trip me, saying that he only turned this particular age once. That was our last contact until a few days ago. 

TL;DR My dad wants me to visit with him for Christmas. He also wants to give me money for Christmas. I have almost exclusively bad memories with him and am conflicted if I should allow him to see me. I don't want his money, but he thinks by saying that it would sway me. I haven't responded to his outreaches. What should I do?

203,"Hey guys,

So i’m in a situation where I feel like the bad guy. Long story short, I had hooked up with my friends ex right after they broke up( I know i’m an asshole), but we cleared the air. But when he did find out, he punched me out in front of our group of friends. Very weird situation for me but we cleared the air and we were friends again. 

Fast forward to recently, this guy had gotten a job where he works with me, but now recently, every time I work with him, I just remember that whole situation and I get in a ‘Mood’. I realize it but I just feel down, mad and just don’t want to talk to anyone. I seem push offy and don’t even acknowledge people talking to me. But today, he had brought up punching me and how it was funny. I found that NOT funny the tiniest bit. So i got in one of my moods, and i pushed away all my other co workers. I’m not sure what to do, I honestly just needed to vent. 

Thanks for reading",23Dec2018,1
204,"Ugh! This whole incident happened a couple days ago and is still bothering me. I think the only way I'll get some closure is to rant about it and hopefully get suggestions or support from you guys...

I'm currently a high school student at a school with a little over 100 students. All the staff go by their first names and interactions with them can be very casual. I've been trying extremely hard in school recently and have been receiving constant praise and compliments from teachers and our principal. Our principal can be strict and shows a lot of tough love to students. She's great, but it takes a lot to earn her respect. After a year at this school as a contributing  and decently outgoing community member, our relationship was good and I felt very accomplished knowing that I was able to earn her trust and (I think) respect.

This happened incident happened on Friday, as classes were ending for a 3 week break from school. My boyfriend and I were helping clean up the school for the break. We ended up finishing our work in the commons area and headed to one of the rooms to grab my stuff. He wanted a hug, so we started hugging, nothing more. We got fell against the wall weirdly and broke out of the hug, but it appeared that I was pinning him against the wall. It looked very bad, but was innocent.

At this moment, our principal walks in and freaks out, assuming that we're making out. Of course she's seen this before, but I'm a star student and leader; she wouldn't have expected this from me. She said something along the lines of ""woah, alright let's not do that right now. You can do that on your own time and not here. Feel free to go up to the gazebo (nearby location off school grounds) and do that there. Here is not the place"". I quickly explained that we were just hugging, but I was so panicked and caught off guard that it sounded very unconvincing and my voice was shaking. I have moderate anxiety, and totally freaked out. She responded saying that she was a teenager once too, and she knows what was happening. My boyfriend and I grabbed our stuff and ran out of there as fast as possible. I felt all the blood rush from my face, and I was close to fainting. 

I have no idea what to do now... Since we have 3 weeks off, I'm hoping she forgets ASAP. I'm honestly really traumatized by the event and am having some trouble kissing my boyfriend because that's the first thing that comes to mind. I'm decently close with the principal, and I don't want this to ruin our relationship or her views on me as a person. I'm so scared and worried about what impact this will have on my school life. I needed to talk to her about something, but I honestly don't think I'll be able to do anything but avoid her completely. I know that she's not mad and that it'll all blow over, but I'm so freaked out. No one that I've told understands how much this event has affected me. 

Thank you for reading, and I appreciate your suggestions and support :)",23Dec2018,1
206,"Before I get into what's happening here, I want to say that I was not necessarily upset when my gf wasn't invited. I figured they wanted a really small wedding or what not. I get that weddings are expensive and I understand that it's up to the bride and groom to choose the guests. That being said, I am not complaining that she didn't get invited ( though I thought it odd), I'm torn because I found out she wasn't invited because she's black.  
Another friend of mine called me up tonight and told me this. He said that the bride to be was telling him that she didn't want people of color at her wedding. He got rather upset at her on our behalf and felt like I had the right to know. Well I am really upset and hurt. The groom and I grew up together and we've basically talk everyday for 21 years. He's the kind of person who included everyone and never wanted someone to be left out (like absolutely for real though). He often tells me how much he likes my gf and how great her and I are. I want to ask him about it but I don't think he knows that his fiance feels this way. 
To say that I am conflicted is an understatement. I need advice or guidance of some sorts. I want to ask him why my gf wasn't invited but I feel like that's setting him up for failure because in some sick way, I want him to question it too. I want him to know what his fiance said but I fear she is going to lie and have him turned against me. I want don't want to lose my best friend but I don't know if I can stomach being around his fiance anymore. 

I don't know if I should talk to him or just be quite. I never really liked her, she is sort of a space cadet and has a lot of really odd behaviors. She treats him well and that is why I never said anything about bad about her because it's not my relationship therefore I don't want to rock the boat per say.  They are happy together but he also defends her regardless if she is right or wrong. She isnt very rational and that's why her and I often butt heads. I am basically up against an irrational woman who I fear will end our friendship because she may or may not be racist. I am  confused and just unsure of how to proceed from here on out. 

If anyone has advice or similar experiences please reach out. If I am being irrational or over dramatic, let me know. ",23Dec2018,1

fast forward to the last month: my mom find out when she going through his phone that he kept cheating when they been ""ok""(after the surgery) and she lost it on him and he even told her he is ""tired"" from her.

she already filed divorce request

it seems she's lingering on that thought

the reason i say it it becuse she said this is her chance out of this unwanted marriage (long story) and i will be pissed if she will staying with him after that and have to live with the guilt and the untrusful piece of shit

210,"Hi Reddit. As the title says, I am a binge drinker. I have been drinking since I was 18 (now 26) and have been blackout drunk more times than I can count and I have lost countless days of my life being too hungover to do anything except lie in bed. There is a long list of embarrassing and regrettable incidents directly caused by my drinking. I am fully aware that I am a problem drinker and need to stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the first time I have reached this conclusion however. I have tried and failed repeatedly to give up alcohol. The longest I have been without alcohol is 6 weeks. It always happens the same way; i'm out with my friends who are all drinking and having fun and I end up forgetting what I decided to do and I have a drink. This time I want to give up for good. I am done with alcohol. I already exercise regularly and I recently quit smoking for good so in some ways I do lead a healthy life. Alcohol is the biggest obstacle I need to overcome however. I am willing to make some significant changes if that's what it takes to stop.

211,"I drove 8 hrs with my family to Denver to stay at my grandmas for Christmas. We used to do this every year, all of the cousins would come over (16 kids, 26 people total). I haven’t been able to go for a while due to work, but I was able to go this year. I guess over the past three years I’ve changed so much I don’t belong with these people anymore.

I have clinical depression, I’m on two different antidepressants. It’s slowly improving, but is definitely still a nuisance. Nobody here knows except for my dad. A large group was having a conversation about how depression isn’t a real thing etc. That made me extremely uncomfortable.

I’m also bi, I’ve only came out to my two best friends, and my extended family joke about how ‘being gay isn’t right’ blah blah blah. 

All of the cousins keep joking about suicide, nobody knows that I am 0/3 on suicide attempts.

Anyway, I don’t really know how I’m going to get through this weekend. I can’t be around them anymore. Should I come out and tell them I don’t appreciate how they speak about people? Should I ask them to stop talking about suicide? I really don’t like to think about it because it puts me in a dark place. Do I just suck it up at wait it out?

So background story, I live with my mom and my sister, I'm the youngest one around here, my dad died before I was born.

So here's the problem, she won't listen to me.

My mom is a very old mother, she is around 60 years old, she about to retired.

I keep asking her question about her job and her activity in her office, but she keep ignoring my question, then I asked her about her bill, job, retirement. She keep ignoring me.

The question is am i pushing her too much about her life and our family?

Second, she keep playing the victim card and the blame card.

This is explanatory, she keep playing victim card on me.

Example:

Mom : you should be careful about the radiation in you're phone

Me : I know mom, I know it's harmful

Mom : Then why didn't you wear you're anti-radiation glasses?

Me : because I don't know where it is 

Mom : (she is walking to the bedroom)

Me : (scream louder because I thought she didn't hear me) BECAUSE I DONT KNOW WHERE IT IS ( well actually not too loud).

Mom : ugh you won't listening to me. 

Me : ¿¿???????¿8283(_!_!

As you can see the example there, it really is annoying that even my sister have to join the drama because my mom told her that I am the one who is being annoying.

Is there any solution to this? Please help me is been like this since 3 year

213,"Hey guys, just looking for some general advice and thoughts here.

I (20F) am living with my partner (23M), and have been for maybe five months now. He moved into this house in February this year with his housemate (24M). They both have their names on the lease and pay equal amounts of rent (shared between us all). 

The lease ends here in about 2 and a half months and we both want to keep living here. We love the house, it's close to work, university, friends and theres so much public transport around. The only thing is, we would *much* prefer to live here without said housemate. Nothing against him, really, the house is just kind of small, and we'd like to have more of a private life, if that makes sense. 

Housemate has had made no hints towards moving out when the lease ends, but also hasn't made any hints to staying. We've said that (and have been) we've been looking at new places but with little luck. The house we're in now is the perfect size for us both (and our two cats) and having him around is kind of a drag. He's very mopey, doesn't clean up after himself whatsoever, has multiple people (and three partners) around all the time, sometimes staying for days at a time. He has claimed the main lounge as his own, and we have had to transport all our things into our bedroom. Whenever we are trying to watch something on TV, or just sit together, he will come and chime in with no concept of an inside voice, and complains when we leave a few glasses in **our** space, while he leaves trash all over the lounge. 

Today we had family over, and I had to scrub every surface clean of dried sauce, tidy up his lounge area, etc. 

I don't want to be rude to him about it obviously, I want to settle it like mature adults because that is what we all are. I'm just worried that by having my partner and I sit down and talk to him about it, he'll stay out of spite, because that's the kind of person he is. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; lease is ending, partner and I want to keep the house but minus dirty and loud housemate but are unsure how. ",23Dec2018,1
214,"I'm afraid that the person that I am will hurt anyone close to me, so I have cut communication with all of my family and friends but one, and I don't let people get close to me at work. While I recognize this is self destructive, I can't bring myself to try to get better (invest in therapy, potentially medication) because there's nobody left to get better for, I'm not worth improving, and there's nothing I want to do with my life besides wait to die. I made a promise a long time ago that I wouldn't commit suicide, and it was to someone who affected my life very heavily, so instead I just....wait, and waste time. 

I seem to swing between two extremes. On one side, numb and uncaring, where I can't draw connections to certain emotions like love or sadness and just do what needs to be done for the ""right thing to do"" in any situation. Especially if that involves telling the people close to me that I can't feel anything for them/about them, which is ""the right thing"" because if they leave me I can't hurt them any more than the separation will. When I'm closer to this side, nothing really sinks in - I put down my dog and didn't feel anything, I attended my grandfather's funeral and it didn't mean anything to me until I swung back to the other side much later. The emotions of others stop being important as well, and I've hurt a lot of people by being callous and uncaring. 

When I'm closer to the other side, I form deep emotional bonds with people (scared of them getting hurt, caring about their safety, wanting them to be happy) but it feels like it comes from a place of possessiveness, or a desire to control or hurt someone else, and when I'm like this I get very very jealous of others around them taking my place in their life. I make big and important promises in the moment that I mean 100%, that I can't keep and am not interested in keeping when I swing back. It feels like what people describe as ""love"", warm, caring, etc, but it has so many objective warning signs that I can't possibly call it that.

The worst times in my life have been when one side either uses or suppresses the other for a goal - I've hurt people really badly during these times. I manipulated, lied to, and emotionally abused people for sex while suppressing the ""do the right thing"" side, and I threw up every morning for 8 months while suppressing the jealous/possessive side to try and have a normal, healthy relationship until I broke it off because I still couldn't feel anything for them. As for one using the other, I decided to ""fix"" someone to try to make up for the people I've hurt by pretending to be in love with them and pushing them to make positive decisions for me/for that relationship. They're doing well now, on a good track, so I think it worked, but in retrospect...not okay.

I found through experimenting that self harm can bring me back to a more centered mindset with healthy pieces of both sides (something about the shock and lingering sensation of burning lets me regain control of my actions before they hurt someone other than me) but obviously that's not a solution and probably contributes to the problem. It also makes for awkward conversations with people who see me without a coat/long sleeves/shirt/long pants.

For the last few years, I have been living almost entirely alone - ""I can't let myself hurt anyone else"" and ""I don't deserve positive relationships for what I've done"". The empty side is totally fine with this, but when I swing back the loneliness, fear, and desperation feels like I'm starving and no matter how much I eat it doesn't get full. I then latch on to one person near me and obsess over them, and that helps, but I'm not so far gone that I can't see that's messed up. Plus, the desperation makes me do and say things to keep that person from leaving me, which is it's own whole guilt trip (""are they here because they care about me or because I made them stay"").

224,"This sounds terrible, I know. My ex boyfriend (23M) is one of my closest friends and he has been seeing this 20 year old ninny for maybe 3 months now and they have decided to go long distance. I (24F) think this is absurd ( he asked my opinion) ; I know it isn’t my business and if he is happy then I am, but he literally doesn’t see that he is with this girl as an emotional foil and distraction to the mental health problems he has been having recently. We had a very intense relationship but understand that because we live 800 miles away from each other (for school, and now for work) it can never be anything other than friendship (he only comes home for the holidays). He likes her but just got out of a bad engagement a year ago (they got engaged and then she decided to move to Nigeria to volunteer for 2 years and they tried long distance) and then jumps around bed hopping for months (he is a serial monogamist so it is a big deal for him)  only to meet her when he was feeling completely alone. I told him to stay single and his new therapist told him to stay single but found this girl who has never had a relationship before, or sex, or anything and now she is in love with him and he likes her. He is now leaving school to work 4 hours away from her and they have decided to stay together and he will visit her. 

I know it isn’t my business but I am furious and I told him so (he did ask for my advice). He spoke to me 2 weeks before making that decision asking if one of her core beliefs was a big enough deal breaker to dump her! Yes! If you can’t take that, dump her! And when I called him out on it he got upset and defensive over her. Of course you like her, she looks at you like you hung the stars in the sky and she makes you feel wanted when you are at your lowest! It isn’t fair to this girl. They have only been dating for 3 months (4 extreme max if we are counting them just talking “as friends” ) 

I will admit that a part of me is salty as well that they are together in general but considering we live timezones away from each other and he has no intention of returning to my state nor do I ever want to move to his, we both agreed that regardless of how we felt for each other we would be friends and promised to always be there for another.  I had a very similar experience to this girl years ago and it certainly didn’t work and I don’t want her to get hurt, she is sweet girl and is completely young and naive.

Earlier this semester, I was planning to take a leave of absence because I was dealing with depression and my psychiatrist was convinced that I had a thyroid problem but she wanted me to go to a specialist and I didn’t have the money to pay for all these checkups. I don’t have a job on campus because no one has hired me, I’ve applied to multiple jobs and had meetings with deans in order to find a job but no one was hiring on campus. I was also afraid of getting an off campus job since I struggle a lot with school work and I was on academic probation once and getting on it again would cause the school to put me on mandatory leave.

I decided to take the semester off and work back home, where I had a job guaranteed, but my parents told me I couldn’t stay there if I wasn’t in school and basically told me I couldn’t live there so I was forced to go back on campus. The entire semester I barely scraped by in terms of money.

I came back for winter break and decided I would work the entire break to make sure I had some money for bills for next semester. I was supposed to go in today but my dad basically told me that I couldn’t work at that place because they always put me on the night shift (it’s a fast food restaurant) and I end up getting out around 2 or 3 in the morning. He said he wasn’t going to be waiting for me until that early and I told him he didn’t need to (it’s 2 blocks away from the house). Then he told me that this is his house and I will do what he says or I won’t live here at all. I know he’s serious because he kicked me out once before but I desperately need the money and he doesn’t seem to understand. I have bills to pay for next semester plus personal bills. I currently have $2 in my bank account because auto-pay for my phone bill took the rest. I really don’t think it’s even about the job I think he has control issues and wants to control my life, but I don’t know what to do. I desperately need the money but I have no where to stay if he does end up kicking me out. I’m in the Southern California area if that means anything. I also don’t have any friends in the area that I could stay with. And I just really don’t know what to do.

It’s a film and people can like and dislike what they want) but she accused anyone who didn’t like it of being sexist and racist and against having women and people of colour being the stars of the film despite that never being brought up previously. Someone criticised the actions of a character, who was a woman,  in the film. She then said that the person was being sexist . The person responded by saying that gender had nothing to do with it and if the character were a man they still would have thought their actions were stupid. The lady then responded by saying she didn’t believe him and thought subconsciously he was making that distinction based on gender. 

Other obnoxious behaviour on her part includes complaining that not enough is done to support people with mental health issues whilst simultaneously complaining about people she works with who have autism for having poor recognition of social queues and slagging them off. Anytime anyone disagrees with her on any subject she drops back to the argument that they are mansplaining and being sexist.

Am I being petty in disliking this person or am I being reasonable? If I’m being reasonable how do I deal with their behaviour?",23Dec2018,1
228,"Hi so I know this is a common problem many people have but I honestly don’t know what to do. I went to college for 1.5 years and just never declared a major.  Absolutely nothing sounds appealing to me major wise/career wise.  All throughout my life I’ve always been very driven and hard working but I never really figured out what I liked to do/wanted to do.  The thought of having a career for the rest of my life sounds absolutely awful to me.  I didn’t always have this outlook. In high school and throughout my life everyone everyone told me of how they thought I would become some successful politician/lawyer/doctor/CEO/Business owner/etc. I always thought that myself but no career has ever stood out to me. I also lost my drive since starting college even though I still work hard and get good grades (3.95 gpa) and I have no motivation to go to college I still find the power to get everything done. Anyways, I even took a career &amp; life planning course for a semester and it didn’t really help all that much.  We took a bunch of personality quizzes and talent analysis and stuff like that but nothing stood out about that class in general. If anything it made me more confused because it told me I could major in almost any major &amp; have a career in whatever I wanted but I don’t know what I want.  

To conclude, I don’t even know what question exactly to ask but I guess my point is how did you find out what you were passionate about? How did you become successful in what you do? Have you ever experienced a period in your life where you felt overwhelmed and how did you come out of it?

244,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

so, I'm not quite sure what exactly is going on, what I should do, etc,  but here's  a bit of context:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 13years old younger brother. Since I'm in college abroad there's kind disconnect as in I don't really know who he hangs out with etc etc. From before college though I know that he spent a lot of his time just playing video games and on his phone, and kind of turning into a nerd really (I'm kind of a self-conscious person myself, so I definitely don't want him to become one or even get worse. Although I don't know how social he really is or isn't. He doesn't talk too much about it and is in general quite secretive with is time, with worries me more). 

What I'll talk about in a bit will seem quite judgemental, so I just want to preface this with the following disclaimer: I don't really judge people by their hobbies etc, and don't really judge the hobbies themselves either. However, I know that some hobbies and activities are being judged quite a bit by others, and since I don't want my brother to become ostracized, anti-social, or whatever, I am judging him by the same factors, or, I guess, potential factors.

He still has good grades, but to me that's not an excuse for anything; he has enough brains for school ""by default"" (And it's, what, 8th grade or something? That should be easy enough anyway), it's not like it means that he spends all of his time being productive and whatnot, because he \*definitely doesn't\*. I personally have had immense troubles with procrastination and it's taken me a \*LOT\* of effort in the past 1-2 years to get a better grasp on myself and become more disciplined. As stupid as it sounds, I know how difficult laziness is and I'll do anything to not let him become lazy even if I have to drill it into him by force (Not a good method, I know, don't worry.)

Now, from what I gathered since I came back for winter break is that he more or less stopped playing stupid video games (I \*think\*), which is good. However, he listens to BTS (K-POP) (Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against people liking K-POP or whatever, I just know that Western cultures usually aren't that receiving of young people immersing themselves in more Asian pop culture. From what I gathered, there seems to be a lot of bullying going on in American high schools, with people taking part in some kind of Asian pop culture being easier targets too. Idk how it is back in Europe nowadays, though...), and, worse, my parents recently found some manga that is definitely his when cleaning the house. And that's what really worries me, because of multiple reasons:

* I'm pretty sure that reading manga is still considered a very nerdy and/or weird thing to do in Western cultures, especially at that age, where everybody is judgemental as fuck.
* Manga just isn't for kids, man. Sure there are some but I feel like it's this very slippery slope where it's *way* too easy to read more and more violent &amp; pornographic stuff. The manga he was reading is called ""Real Account"", idk if anybody here knows it, I don't, but flipping through it it did *not* look like something a 13yo should read. Quite violent, *very* demeaning towards women, tldr just dirty/nsfw. I don't want my brother to become some kind of fucking pervert.

If he was a bit older, 17 or something, I don't know, I would feel more at ease because I'd trust him more with making decisions he is aware of, and I'd simply trust that he is also aware enough of his actions to not be influenced easily (in this case, an example of influence would be perversion.)

But he's not 17, he's 13. Literally just hitting puberty, where people are the most easily influenced.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the thing: I don't know what I should do. I don't really want to confront him about it, because I'm sure he'll just become more secretive then and won't ever talk about it and just hide what he does. I can't really try to talk sense into him in the sense of simply being aware of the content of the material he consumes, because I'll just come across as the annoying controlling brother. But I don't want to just leave him be either.

&amp;#x200B;

A tiny bit of more context: Good thing is that it's not like he's hiding in his room all day or something. My parents say he's out with his friendgroup quite a lot. However, I don't know what his friendgroup is like.

Since he's been out a lot with them my parents are worrying about him doing ""bad stuff"" such as drinking or making out with people or whatever - I worry about the opposite, that he becomes some kind of loner.",23Dec2018,1
245,"First of all our friendship has never been sexual, I am a straight female and as far as I know my best friend is too, and we're both in our late 20s so we're past that age of experimenting and being foolish etc. She has never spoken about any history of girl-on-girl encounters or even mentioned about anything along those lines, and we are both very open-minded outspoken people and I believe she would've definitely told me if she was even just slightly interested in girls.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway the story goes... I was staying the night at her place last night and we were both laying on bed, both really drunk. Then she started taking my clothes off, then hers, then started sucking on my nipple then went down on me. And the weird thing is, I wasn't grossed out by it,  I was just a bit confused and shocked. And this morning everything was normal, we were talking as usual and not a single mention about last night's incident.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know what to do... I know for sure I'm not sexually attracted to her... but it makes me wonder why she did that? I don't know if I can brush it off as just a drunken encounter because I would never initiate anything with a girl even if I were drunk off my face. Has anyone been in this situation? ",23Dec2018,1
246,"So I told my mother I would go to hers for a late Xmas this year, if it was OK with her. The reasons for this are twofold: a) I do not drive and get fed up being reliant on her for transport at Xmas. Since there is no public transport, I am reliant on her to pick me up and return me home afterwards. b) I don't usually enjoy Xmas all that much since it is usually just the two of us and she will often be very distracted cooking the meal and I tend to find myself staring into space while she tears her hair out over the cooking. This situation is much improved if she can persuade one of her friends to drop by but that is not always the case. 

So I really fancied a change this year and thought I would go to my auntie's instead. I asked my mother, if it would be OK with her (I said this phrase several times to make sure she was onboard with all this) that I would see her after Xmas this year and that way I could make my own way to hers and back, on the bus. She seemed surprised at this and initially expressed concern that I would be on my own for Xmas. Then she seemed to 'twig' that I had other plans and asked if I had something else on, which I confirmed, though I didn't say what.

The next time I talked to her I was a bit confused and thought I had told her i was going to my auntie's, when in fact I hadn't. So then it came out that I was going there, which was probably a bit awkward for her since they haven't really spoken for years subsequent to a fall-out over the inheritance money from my grandmother (my mother doesn't speak to her brother at all, and they will likely never speak again).

So when we spoke about it further she was then saying she would have to get back to me about Xmas now as she had friends coming. I asked her if they now had priority since we had agreed I would go to hers after Xmas. I had said 'after the 27th' which she had mis-heard as 'on the 27th' (we very often have mis-communication and disagreements about all sorts of things).

We managed to work out that I wouldn't be able to get back from my auntie's until the 27th so it would be better to go to hers on the 28th. So far so good.

Yesterday I thought it might smooth things over if I offered to provide the pudding. But now it seems she is not going to to provide an Xmas meal! Here is our exchange:

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I can try to get an xmas pud or something for the 28th if that's any help.

&gt; cheers x

&gt;&gt; Hello love,

&gt;&gt; yes whatever you can bring would be good. There won't be much left over from my Christmas meal by 28th so it might be omelette and chips or fish pie or something like that. I have squirty cream if you can manage a pud, if not I have frozen fruit.

&gt;&gt; Hope you have a lovely time.


&gt;&gt; Love

&gt;&gt; Mum 

WTF??? Is she seriously going to serve up omelette and chips when the rest of the nation will be sitting down to leftover turkey???

She is *so* un-christmassy, that one year when I asked her were we not going to have a tree, she said 'oh you're not wanting a Christmas tree are you???', as if I was asking for something really outlandish. (She tends to take a dim view of traditional things and sees herself as a free spirit who is not tied down by conventions.) I don't mind so much that I always have to help out with the cooking, and sometimes will just do it all myself as it is actually less stress and hassle for me, but could she be any less festive?? This reminds me of the time she grumpily said she was going to make beans on toast for Xmas when she was in a bad mood about it. I just want the same things other people have. It was bad enough being brought up without a father or any brothers or sisters, but it really sucks that I have to practically plead with her to get her just to do a bit of a roast and some veg. It is also kind of relevant that I am getting on the underweight side and could actually benefit from being fed up a bit. I don't mind helping out and even bringing food if needed but is it too much to ask for something a bit more seasonal??

Here is the reply I sent her:

&gt; Do you need me to bring something Christmassy to eat, in that case? I'm not much enthused about coming to yours for a late Christmas if you are not actually going to cook a Christmas meal.

Maybe I just need to accept that if I'm not going to be there for Xmas day I have no right to an Xmas meal, but I cannot see the point in going down otherwise. I thought we were going to have a 'late Christmas' but it seems she is just treating it as a regular visit. Maybe she is pissed that i'm going to my auntie's, but she will never say if so.

Any advice please? TIA.",23Dec2018,1

I’ve been working at my current job for about 4 months now it’s a warehouse job and it pays very well compared to my last job and for the first few months it wasn’t that bad, I didn’t really like the job, but it was bearable

However back in November I bought a new car, although I wanted a used one do my payments would be less my parents insisted on a new one.

Right after I bought my car that’s when the job started becoming worse, I hated waking up and going in, my bosses (which has been confirmed by 3 different people) have been “messing with me” like telling me my productivity is down even though I’m working while everyone else is standing around.

So now I just despise coming to work, I’ve started looking for another job, but it’s just been difficult because I need to make my car and insurance payments.

I’d rather let my car get repossessed and ruin my credit and all that just so I don’t have to work here anymore or work three shitty jobs to pay for the car.

I plan on going back to school next year for a better career, but in the mean time I just feel stuck and stressed, and although I’ve never had mental health problems I just never seem happy anymore, just angry and tired.

257,"Happy Christmas ya'll. 

So yesterday I was with some friends, a few of them said I looked great which was a good thing but something really stood out for me. One of our school friends may dabble in underground narcotics and be a pretty mid-level player. This is not here nor there, we went to an inner city school with a wide variety of social classes so youre bound to know someone. I don't do drugs myself but whatever.Anyway I made the comment about how do you even go about becoming an established drug dealer, imagine me trying to get money off someone that owed me. My other friend from school commented how I'd be in the business for 20 years and still be at the bottom of the food chain. It really hit me. Obviously I don't care about being a drug dealer but just the perception a friend would have of me. I'm a really laid back guy, I just don't care for confrontation and I don't get worked up by things but yet clearly my friends view me as a weak and pathetic character. I have very little success with girls so obviously they pick up on this passivity as well. I'm a bit bummed out you know.",23Dec2018,1
258,"This is going to be a depressing post, so be warned.. but I need help.

A bit of a back story: I’m a registered nurse, and I used to work in geriatric rehabilitation. People died there as well, but you knew they were old (80/90 years) and they had a fulfilled life and most of them told me that if they would die now, they would be happy with how their life has been. So if they died, I had peace with that.

Currently following a program in the hospital where I have a 2 year contract and switch between units every 6 months. At this point I’m working on lung oncology (lung cancer unit). I see so much misery around me and I’m really struggling with how to cope. People around me are dying, 50 years old, in a lot of pain, horrible stories like, ‘4 weeks ago I had a backpain, and a week later I knew it was lung cancer which spread to my spine and now I’m in so much pain I can not get out of bed and can not feel my legs anymore.’

I see their families struggling as well and it just breaks my heart. It also makes me think about my parents, who are older than the people dying around me. I would not know how to handle it when one of them would die.

On top of that: 2 of my friends lost their mom in 2 weeks time, their moms were also around the age of 50/55.

I would like to know how you guys cope with these kinds of things. I talk about it to my SO, my mom is also a nurse so I talk to her too. I’ve known my colleagues for 3 months now and don’t feel comfortable enough yet to talk to them about it, cause when I do, I break down crying. Any nurses or other people who can tell me their experience with these kinds of things?",23Dec2018,1

264,"My son's father disappeared out of our life about 5 years ago.  We weren't married and I have no contact with part of his family.  He was in the middle east with the military for the 1st year of my son's life.  Then he was around for about 6 months and taking me to court to prove he wasn't the father and then when the paternity test showed he was, he tried to get custody.  The week before we went to court that time, he sent me an email that said he was moving to Texas.  he was gone for about a year and a half and then moved back and took me to court again.  Another full year of back and forth and he was supposed to start having overnight visits with our son.  He refused (after court and winning) and soon disappeared from our area for good.  A year later, we got a Christmas card and that was the last I heard.  The part of his family I am in contact with also has no idea where he is.  He is a military veteran and may be in a nursing home due to a disease that he has (I don't want to give out too much info).  I want to know where he is and if he is still alive so I know what to tell my son.  My son is almost 10 and for his entire life it has been just the two of us.  He does not remember his father at all since the last time he saw him, he was not yet 5 years old.  We were supposed to get child support but I don't think his father is capable of working due to his illness.  My son could be getting some part of his father's social security disability check but the last I heard, the social security place did not have an address to send his check to.  And if he can't get a check, my son can't either.  I know I am bringing up money a lot but it is not the most important thing, I just want to answer those questions before they get asked.

265,"warning for depression/suicide talk a bit later.

I (19f) have been living with my parents since I graduated. It took me nearly a year to finally get a  job that sucks, but at least pays for gas. 

Lately my friends have been talking about rooming. The parents of one of my friends, codename Ann, are planning on moving now that shes out of school. They are willing to rent out their current home to us, once they move, for $1500 a month including utilities, which for the area and house is a great deal. It would be me, Ann, and two of our other friends living there. 

At face value it sounds great, good price, predictable roommates I've known for years, but I have a few problems with it:
1) I don't like Ann and Im worried Ill start to hate my friends by living with them. Shes not a bad person, but we worked in the same department at work for a few months before I had to move positions. Im pretty introverted by nature and of the opinion that ""do what you love and youll never work a day in your life"" is wrong, youll just end up hating what you used to love. Being around her all the time made me hate her and I dont want to be around her anymore. Whos to say the same wont happen to my other friends too?
2) My current mental health. I tried to kill myself when I was 16. I know its not healthy but my only real reason left for not trying again is my cat and my dog. As far as Ive thought for years, as soon as theyre gone Im gone. I don't have anything else worth it enough to stay. If I moved, they would not be able to come with me, but I cant imagine living without them and they are a big source of comfort in my daily life. 
3) I dont have very much money. Ive been told Im a great worker but I get nervous at interviews and so have a lot of difficulty getting jobs. As I said it took me almost a year to get my current job which is causing me a lot of back pain and other issues. If I have to live I think I should get therapy but I havent because I dont want to spend the money. I drive almost an hour each way to get to work and with the way its scheduled Im hard capped at 32.5 hours a week. I didn't expect a chance to move out so quickly so I dont have a lot of money saved up and it would be much harder for me to save at this job while also paying rent and food costs. I already pay other bills.

Should I take the opportunity for cheaper rent and good roommates at risk of losing them as friends? Should I stay home and save/find a better job while I am of an acceptable age to do so though I may have to pay more in rent down the line? I dont know what to do. I dont think nows the right time to move but Im scared of the repercussions of not doing it.",23Dec2018,1
266," 

I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve had these issues ever since I can remember. The first time that I recall is when I was about 7/8 years old and the boy I liked gave me a flower and hugged me and instead of happy I felt terrible. I am now 20 and this has happened EVERY SINGLE TIME a guy reciprocates my feelings.

Let me elaborate a little bit. I catch feelings for someone, I am super happy, he starts to show interest in me, we flirt a little bit, text, etc., I am still super happy and then comes the obvious next step – he confesses his feelings for me. This is where the error in the program occurs. Everything I’ve ever felt for him disappears. But it’s not just that. I get overwhelmed with a wave of absolute panic and even disgust towards the situation and the person. It’s not anything rational either! I’m not thinking “Oh, I feel bored now/He’s not that cute/I’m scared he will hurt me”. Nope. Everything that’s left in my suddenly anxiety-driven mind is “Run! Get out of the situation as soon as possible! Run! Get out! Run! Get out!” It’s absolutely insane!

At that point I always reject the person (as nicely as possible, I try really hard not to show the not-so-mini panic attack I’m having) and possibly stay friends with them. There was only one time when I made myself get into a relationship, because “Maybe if I am actually in the relationship, I won’t feel that way. Maybe everyone feels this way in the beginning (although I knew they didn’t).” Bullshit! I lasted about 2 weeks before I couldn’t stand it anymore – I was so anxious I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat (lost about 8 pounds for the two weeks), I was all around miserable, so I finally broke up with him. He was so hurt and I felt so fucking bad, but also like I was able to breathe again for the first time in 2 weeks.

I have no idea where this comes from. I have a supporting, loving family, I’ve always had good friends, never had a guy disappoint me/break my trust or anything like that. I’ve been having some self-esteem issues the past year or so, but before that I’ve always been confident enough and this was still happening. 

It truly sucks and it will be much appreciated if someone can give me some feedback. Any ideas why I might be experiencing this or how to overcome it? Has anyone else gone through something similar? (How) Did you get over it?",23Dec2018,1

268,"I really need some help— I’m not sure what to do, I want to take him to a hospital because I feel like this is starting to get out of control and become kind of scary. Any advice at all would help.


I’m just gonna jump right into this.



A few nights ago I was laying in bed next to my boyfriend, when suddenly I felt the bed shaking— so I look over and for a second I see him shaking violently before he shot up completely out of bed and started screaming. I quickly got up and started yelling, “What’s wrong? What’s going on!?” And tried to hold him because he was falling over and just kept screaming at the top of his lungs. 

I’ve never heard a man or anybody scream like that, it was pure terror.  My first two thoughts were that he was having a seizure, a stroke maybe even a heart attack? 


I put my arms under his and hugged him from the front to hold him up because he was falling over and I kept saying, “It’s okay, it’s okay!” To try and calm him, it worked; he stopped screaming and was just breathing hard— but he started to slump in my arms and his back was to our dresser and my back was to our bed, so I didn’t want him to fall against the dresser so I pivoted to try and get him to land on the bed.


But instead it startled him or something and he pushed me away and got into a defensive stance? And started to almost scream again but instead he looked right at me and growled. I put my open hands up and said, “It’s me! It’s okay! It’s me!” And he kind of grunted and crawled into bed and pulled the covers over himself.


I was silently freaking the fuck out so I grabbed my phone and went out into our living room and flipped all the lights on— it started to make sense what was going on so I didn’t want to spook him again, so I was making sure all the lights were on so he could see.


This all happened within 5 minutes— to sum it up, I went back into our room once I saw him kind of sit up in bed. He held a full conversation with me with his eyes open for 20 minutes, I thought he was awake until he kind of looked at me and asked, “Were we just talking?” He also didn’t recall anything that just happened, at all.



It’s been four days now and it’s been non stop every night, we’ve slept in separate rooms for the past three.  He’s probably only had a total of five hours of sleep for the past four days and he can’t seem to form sentences— when he talks it’s all mashed together and he cannot for the life of him control his body movements since night one.


Think of a super hyped up kid, he’s super hyper and can’t hold still. But he says he feels exhausted but when he tries to lay down his mind just won’t stop and he cannot hold still. 


Tonight, I locked our bedroom door, (with him knowing) and tonight for the only thirty minutes he slept ( which was around 4:00AM), he had a dream that I cut off his beard when he was laying out on the couch and in his DREAM state he WALKED to the bedroom door and tried to open it. He jingled the door handle multiple times and I woke up from my sleep just staring at the door— I admit I’m starting to get nervous and extremely uncomfortable. He walked away from the door and at one point I got up and found him laying out on our couch and I asked him what he was doing— that’s when he told me he was dreaming and went to get into our bedroom to get something in his sleep. 


I’ve asked if we should take him to the hospital, he said no, there’s nothing that they can do— that it’ll pass eventually. But right now, I’m very concerned for his health considering he hasn’t hardly slept in four days. It has less to do with the PTSD and more with his health as far as taking him to the hospital.



Some important points:

- This is the month of his friend that died in Iraq, today’s the actual day. We believe this is the actual cause of this PTSD episode.

- First time this has ever happened in the year we’ve dated and lived together.

- He takes medication before bed that’s suppose to help him sleep and help his PTSD and it isn’t doing anything. We’ve even tried taking drug store sleeping medication with it and it absolutely does not work.

- He’s made an appointment at the VA this coming Thursday— but he has work Monday-Friday. His boss knows what’s going but this has definitely worsened and I know for sure he cannot go to work on Monday if this magically isn’t over today. 

- He is a recovering addict and this will be his FIRST year dealing with his friends death sober. It’s been eight years since his friends death. 

-  He’s reached out to his Sponsor who also suffers from some bad PTSD and he says this is normal, but I’m starting to wonder when it isn’t going to be. I texted him tonight letting him know what happened and asking if there is anything I can do.

- His counselor who knows everything says that this is normal and it will pass— and I believe that but I’m very concerned about his health right now.






And lastly I’ve already been told by his counselor to absolutely not interfere with him when he’s having an episode in his sleep as it could end badly— like him taking a swing or something. Which I 100% understand. Just that first night I didn’t know what was going on at first and thought he was hurt or something and I was about two seconds away from calling 911.




Alright, that’s pretty much it, I’m super frazzled so maybe I missed some things— I’m freaked out and worried for him and me. Any advise would help tremendously and if you guys need more information on something I’ll provide it. ",23Dec2018,1

Recently I don’t think my dog is doing so well in my dad’s care and I’m not sure what to do about it. About two years ago we sold our house and my dad moved into his girlfriends house with my two dogs, let’s call them D and L. His girlfriend already had two little dogs of her own.  This was a big change because they weren’t able to run and play as much and didn’t seem as happy as they used to at my other house. 

About a year ago D passed away from a tragic incident which I was never really given a clear story of (my dad said it was from a grooming van).  Obviously this was hard on L since they were always extremely close. 

I don’t think my dad or his girlfriend really pay a lot of attention to L , and they focus all their attention on the little dogs. For example, her little dogs are allowed on the couch, but L gets yelled at for being on the couch. He’s very shy too and will not push his way into attention as the little dogs do.  Also when my dad got treats out for the little dogs, he didn’t give L any who was sitting in another room. 

Now L seems depressed every time I go visit. He lays in other rooms away from everyone, his eyes are bloodshot, he excessively licks his feet until they are raw, and just genuinely does not seem like his happy self.   Also, as I was trying to put detangler spray on his coat, and he was shaking which was something I’ve never seen him do before. He’s always been a nervous dog, but not to that extent. 

I’m considering taking him to my apartment with me and my boyfriend but am concerned about taking him away from other dogs since he’s been around other dogs his entire life. We have a cat but I’m not sure if that would be the same for him. He is an absolute sweetheart and I know wouldn’t hurt the cat, but obviously the cat has to like him too since the cat is also a rescue and very nervous as well.  I’m also moving in 5 months and not sure if moving him around that much would be bad for him. My sister also offered to take him but she’s moving into the city in a month and we’re not sure if the city and elevators would be too much for him and he wouldn’t have any companions during the day. 

I would greatly appreciate any advice! Thanks guys!

TDLR: My dog doesn’t seem happy after moving to his girlfriends house and my other dog passed away. They don’t seem to pay attention to him and I’m debating if I should take him or not.

273,"Hi all, I hope everyone who does celebrate is having a good start to the holidays. 

I don’t have a good family situation, just me and my single mother. My family is pretty broken, one of my brothers is a recovering drug addict and the other is waist deep in debt. We don’t even do much for Eid (the religious holiday that we celebrate) since our community is so small. But the spirit of Christmas and all really is beautiful. It’s one thing that we really fail to capture, we’re terrible at giving these things the excitement it deserves and really capturing the essence of togetherness and joy. My mom has been feeling pretty down, and it’s hard to cheer her up. Our extended family is dysfunctional, one uncle has a wife that’s crazy and broke my parents marriage and has tried to cause me harm, the other has a son that’s disabled and their marriage is falling apart. 

I don’t have much myself but I gave back to a family in need who was struggling to buy their kids gifts for the holidays. Race, religion etc doesn’t matter to me, I just wanted to make them happy. It alleviated some of this. But I can’t shake off the feeling of being alone. In general, I have very few friends. All my friends went off to college and forgot abt me, and I had to stay in our hometown because I couldn’t afford to move or leave. And also because I have to take care of my mother.

let me write a story, it could be a love story, it could be not

""

once upon a time, there was a guy who named ulfr, wanted to be great, he wanted to.... he... he didn't know what he wanted, he liked to know the world, learn everything he could out of this world and try to do what other people simply called ""impossible""

he got a lot of talents in himself, he learned a language by himself, he could tell beautiful stories, his imagination was strong, just like as his skills, he was smart, he always could figure out ways that other people couldn't do them.

everywhere that he went and talked about his ideas to other people, they simply weren't that strong to understand him, he should go his path by himself

he was harder than stone, tougher than the north wind, nothing could stop him, he believed in his own morals and greater good, he wanted to follow a path that he somehow knew it existed but somehow he couldn't do it

in his fellow teen years, he would cry, he he got broke, he felt he needed love, he just wanted comfort but he couldn't get it. he lost his abilities, after years he lost his self-esteem, he became weaker and couldn't do anything

after a couple of years that he gathered his strength back, he went to university, he could manage and do well on there and overcome his life again but there was something

he met a girl that she had the same ideas like him, she wanted to escape this world, she wanted to lead, create and do things right and eventually leave this life cause it was a misery.ulfr knew that we, the humans, are limited. he knew that his feelings are just some chemicals that after he dies none of them mattered, he hated death, he hated nothingness and he hated loops. he wanted to follow that route but what could he do? the animal part of him just wanted to eat, sleep, have sex, fun, and wanted to feel the love, love... love was important for him

this girl by the other hand, she was smart. she was superior among other ppl, she wrote a ton of articles about the human mind and brain, she did a lot of experiments and she was very good at it. she just wanted to leave this world, she hated to be a human, not those kinds of hate that would kill somebody or anything, she helped people a lot but she knew that this human beings will die one day, no matter how good or bad, how strong or weak, how rich or poor, they will die.

ulfr didn't know what to do, he always wanted to be in a relationship with her and try to achieve things together, she was okay about the relationship but she wasn't fun. she believed that "" its stupid to have fun, we are limited but we could overcome our limits and situation and achieve greatness"" she didn't want to marry, have children and live the ordinal way that every human being had.

ulfr on the other hand, he wanted to have fun. every time he asked about this stuff she told him that "" our lives are not about ourselves, this stuff, they are just limits, they don't have any meaning, I don't persuade you to go this path but if u want we could get there, its ur life, ur choice, doesn't relate to me so I don't care ""

ulfr liked another girl as well, she was sweet, not that smart but kind , beautiful and funny. like other people, she wanted to struggle with life, not a lot. she was modest and she believed in equilibrium, like ulfr's dad and mom, like every other human in this world. he knew if he chooses to be with her he would be the happiest man in the world, he could form a family, travel and explore the world, feel the love, and die peacefully

he wanted greatness but he may have to make sacrifices, should that happen? he wanted to have love, have peace, but he is not sure that should he get it or no, is it right or not..

ulfr didn't know what should he do, should he go that pacifist route or the \_\_*Greatness*\_\_ .

281,"I am 26 years old, and I became a camgirl last year to supplement my income. I worked in retail management for 5 years and have been trying to go to school a couple of classes at a time for years now. I’ve been on food stamps, I’ve had my electricity shut off several times, and I’ve just flat out ruined my credit by being poor for the last 6 years of my life. I always got hit on at work and it honestly just annoyed the hell out of me. I couldn’t wait to work until I was successful enough that this would not be an issue. 

One day, with $11 in my checking account and rent due in a couple of days, I logged into chaturbate out of morbid curiosity. I saw what some of these girls were making and I wanted that for myself so bad. So I started broadcasting. I immediately made $100, and I had somewhere to be so I shut the camera off. I came back the next day with more time and made $300. In a few days I had enough for rent, plus a little extra. 

I kept doing this for months until I realized that I was losing money when I was working at my retail job instead of camming, so I quit. I feel so free now. I control my hours, my client base, my success. My self-esteem is also at an all time high because people tell me I’m beautiful literally every day. I run it like a business and I choose who and what I say yes and no to. I have literally doubled my income, and it’s still increasing slowly. Now I can go to school. This is life-changing. I signed up for 15 credit hours next semester and I paid in full immediately. I’m graduating soon and transferring to a better school where I can finish my bachelor’s.

I told a couple of people at work what I was doing, but no details, and I only told two people who I trusted. This was a mistake. Apparently, word got around. My stage name was found out, they found my Twitter which has nudes all over it, and some people have watched my shows (which is crazy to me because I blocked the entire state from viewing, so they went to the trouble of getting a VPN). I am not in a super big city by any means so this is pretty juicy gossip to some. 
Unfortunately, my brother is an employee who works overnight where I used to work. I don’t think the news has reached him or he would have talked to me about it, but it’s been pressing on my mind. 

I have told my family that I do online tutoring, I said I choose my hours but I try to do it as much as I can and it’s enough for my rent and bills. They have believed this story up to this point and haven’t had any questions, however... I’m moving soon. My lease is up at the end of the month and I found a nice 3 bedroom house with hardwood floors and new appliances in a great part of town for a really good price. But, even at this really good price it’s obviously not something I could ever have afforded before and the tutoring story really doesn’t explain my way into a 3bedroom house. I have come up with more and more lies in my head to cover this up, but I’m tired of the charade. I want to just live freely. 

I want to tell my family so, so bad. I am not sure how they will react though, and once I’ve told them I can never go back on it. I have nightmares about it going wrong, I worry about my father asking himself where he went wrong with his little girl. I stress about my mother googling “what is a camgirl” and being mortified. I sweat when I think about my brothers coworkers and the remarks they’ve already made about wanting to date me, what crude talk will he put up with now? I love the way my family sees me now. They talk about being proud of how driven and hard working I am, how much self-respect I have and what a good head on my shoulders I have. I don’t want that to go away, but I also want to be able to be free with my family. I’m so sick of cringing every time they come over, asking myself “did I hide my ring light and my tripod?” Wondering, what if my brother goes into my bedroom and finds an ungodly number of dildos under my bed? Why on earth does my little sister have 11 dildos?? I digress. 

I just want to tell them. But I am so conflicted...

TL;DR I am a camgirl, I’m worried my family will find out through gossip soon and I’m moving into a house I can’t explain being able to afford. Should I just tell them?",23Dec2018,1

283,"More specifically, he's definitely turned on by whatever we're saying we'll do to each other, and we're both excited about trying all sorts of things together, but when I'm e.g giving him a blowjob, he'll probably ask me to just stop and cuddle after a while. We're great at communicating, we talked about it, and he's saying it's because he can't seem to allow himself to feel pleasure.

I've had multiple sexual partners before and I've had a lot of success with pleasing them, and he's definitely attracted to me. At times, when the atmosphere &amp; circumstances are right, I can give him amazing orgasms, but nowhere near often. We've been together for almost a year, and in this year he figured out just how to drive me crazy, and I love it - and he loves giving me pleasure too, but when it comes to me reciprocating, he'd rather go for intercourse &amp; finish quite quick.

We're currently experimenting with whatever we can to get him to relax, focus on the pleasure &amp; not feel like he has to come quick, but it's still difficult. I feel like each time he's trying to go for it and he ends up not enjoying it he'll stray even further and not look forward to it. He had the same issue with his ex. I know it's mostly a psychological issue, but does anyone have any experience with this? Any clue as to what we could maybe do?

TL;DR My partner can't seem to allow himself to enjoy sex, doesn't feel much pleasure when we do go at it although we've tried a ton of things and we want to fix this. It's mostly psychological. Any advice?",23Dec2018,1
284,"I'm 24M, gay, and I've always been interested in straight men. Most men around me my whole life have been straight obviously and I am straight looking myself and do get told I am by people. As far as acting goes, I'd say I'm pretty straight acting, but I do have 'gay' interests as well for sure. When I came out at 19 and began using gay dating apps it became quickly clear that gay men are much different in general. Most guys look stereotypically gay, have ""gay face"" etc., which just isn't what I personally prefer - not trying to bash. That isn't how I look. Straight men have their own kind of look and personality, a specific kind I know that I'm looking for in a partner. Straighter acting gay men are rare and it usually feels like they're faking it when you meet them in person and it's a big turn off, however I have still enjoyed my time with some guys that are gay. Mostly for their body not personality. When things end they don't end well though, guys act catty, and it puts a big damper on how I look back on my times with gay men. I sometimes feel more of a ""clash"" than an ""attraction"".

Eventually, after 4-5 years of being on gay dating apps, I got bored or tired with just waiting for a real straight acting gay man near me to come along and started looking for actual straight men too. I have been for the past 5-6 months and I've made some contacts, though mostly for sex and I've had some flirty chatting. However I moved across the US (North to South) with my family last year (my step-dad who I live with is unaware I'm gay) and we moved not knowing anyone where we were moving to so I haven't gotten the chance to meet any of my straight contacts yet for one reason or another. I definitely will be though soon especially when it gets warmer. Which leads me to my point - where could a relationship with an actual straight man even go from there? Is anything serious past a fun fwb/netflix and chill kinda deal possible?

Because now that this is all happening I can't help but think about the possibility of potentially dating or marrying a straight man. I have zero idea how that would even begin to ""work"", but I'd even thought about having an open relationship/marriage and allowing him to have sex with women periodically so long as he stays loyal to me. This is definitely a very taboo area of discussion I realize lol. And not at all ""normal"" to say the least. I would just need to compromise.

Because this isn't about trying to turn a straight man gay or ""wanting what I can't have"", **it just is what I like**. I need a man who understands that. Being a gay man means being attracted to men and most men (like ~95% or something)...are straight. Not to mention typically straight men are just genuinely more masculine. So I think it's kinda wrong in a way to limit yourself to just the gay dating pool/treating it as though the other 95% of men aren't even an option at all. Dating apps specifically do not allow communication between straight and gay men, cause -most- straight men don't want to be shown guys of course, but I know first hand that when making an advance on a real straight man their answer isn't always ""no"". -Some- say yes. And sometimes guys that initially say ""no"" will come around to it after.

I'm torn between wanting to find a ""true gay love"" (if ""true"" even exists?) with a straighter acting gay man and a ""respectable love"" with a straight man. If that kind of true love does not even exist or is spectacularly difficult to find, why bother with it? Cause I'm 99% sure I've never felt that way towards a gay man either, they've all been straight. I feel like maybe I'm the only expert on the subject since I'm the one doing the dirty work here, but there's my situation and anybody who wants to chime in go for it.",23Dec2018,1

I only have a 2 true friends and usually I hang out with them, but yesterday I got invited by my friend to join him with other friends of hin that I barely knew. At first I was pretty shy and anxious, but then I got drinked a bit and I started getting comfortable. The night was really fun and I had the opportunity to meet new people, have fun and just be myself. Like for the first time in a while I GENUINELY enjoyed being around people I didn't know. Yet at the end of the night I got overwhelmed by a strange sense of melancholy, like if the night didn't go as it was supposed to. Even now, the day after, I doubt myself, like if there was a part of me that wants to stay in his comfort zone to not risk being rejected or hurt. During my childhood and early teens I've had bad experiences regarding social interactions, so for the past few years I isolated myself and avoided every social interaction. So now I find it really hard to open up to other people because I fear their judgment. But now I have this chance to make new friends and I REALLY don't want to waste it, but at the same time I know that if I don't get drunk my anxiety would limitate me a lot.

291,"I’m gonna begin by explaining what happened. I’ll try to be as brief as possible. 

Growing up, my family was quite poor and my parents often worked 12-14 hour days to make ends meet. More often then not, my little brother and I were home alone, and since we were only a year apart, we became super close. Once I became a teen, I started getting involved with the wrong crowd, and my little brother followed my influence. To make a long story short, these new friends introduced us to a sh!t load of different drugs, and by 16 (little brother was 15) we were hooked on coke and doing all types of things to support our habit. One night, we decided to steal our parents car so we could rob a convenience store 10 mins down the road, then go score some blow. Sounds crazy, but when we were desperate and stupid. We took the plates off the car, and headed down to the store at around 1 am. After we got the cash, we ran back to the car. As we were backing out, our local Police department was pulling into the parking lot. We peeled out of the parking lot and headed towards our neighborhood. We lived in the same apartment for nearly our whole life, so I knew our area pretty well. Figured I could lose the cop there before things got out of control. We were flying through this neighborhood at 80 mph when someone started to back out of their drive way. To avoid them I overcorrected, and lost control of the car. We hit a tree directly on my brothers side, and he died almost instantly. I spent the next two years in juvenile detention, until my 18th birthday when I was released. After being released, I cut all ties with my parents bc I can’t even look them in the eyes at this point. I miss him everyday and regret this day every single moment of my life. 

It’s been over a year since I was released, and I want to talk to them again. I don’t even know how to begin starting a new relationship with them after something like this. I was thinking of leaving an apology letter and my number in their mailbox but i don’t even know what to say. I’m pretty sure they won’t want to talk to me. Is it even worth trying at this point?

Not a day goes by that I don’t think about it. After 3 semesters of college I was placed on academic probation. And not because I was skipping class or being lazy. I was too stupid to do the work. I should never have been accepted into University in the first place. I only took regular classes because of my disabilities thus I was unprepared for university level work from the beginning. In addition to not being able to keep up with the pace of college. Despite going to all of my classes I still ended up nearly flunking out of college. All because of my lack of academic preparedness.

To be fair I didn’t really expect anything. I wasn’t perfect in high school (or even middle school for that matter) B/B+ student in both. School has always been a struggle for me. I wasn’t a fluent reader until middle school thanks to my undiagnosed dyslexia and ADD. There were nights where my parents would stay up with me half the night doing homework or reading with me while my brothers were asleep. 

There was no way that I was going to be able to tell my parents what was going on because they were going to yell at me which wouldn’t have solved anything. They knew that I had a disability and how hard school was for me. They just didn’t let me drop out of school because they wanted to preserve their image and look good to their friends, neighbors and colleagues.

Our relationship has always been a bit fiery. We love hard but we fight hard too ... we both probably have anger issues and get nasty when we're mad. We both resort to name calling and low blows (we know exactly how to push each other's buttons) and in full disclosure, I've been physical with him before (pushing at him or hitting his shoulder when he has turned away from me). I'm pointing this out because I want to try (as best I can) to share both sides of the story. 

Anyway, we've always fought (and always made up quickly) but last week one of our fights got out fo control. He was accusing me about lying (and I wasn't) and I just lost it; I took his phone out of his hands and threatened to smash it. 

He went nuts and next thing I know, he's choking me. I honestly can't remember all the details, it was such a blur. At one stage I was against the wall and then, next thing I knew, I was on the kitchen island looking up at him. 

Then as quickly as it started, it was over. I wasn't really hurt, just sore around my wrists and throat ... but I was in shock and raging mad. I started packing my bag and I was ready to leave when I heard a quiet voice apologising and telling me how ashamed he was. 

Typing this, I know it sounds so cliche. It's what always happens, I know, and part of me can't believe I didn't tell him to f\*ck off. 

But he has never been violent before ... and I shouldn't have taken his phone. And I love him, so I told him I forgave him and not to worry about it. 

I tried to move on, but on the inside, I was so mad at myself. Everything was playing out like a bad movie script and I felt so ashamed. I was one of those women I never thought I'd be, one who didn't respect herself enough to leave...

But continuing with the story, I was determined not to bring it up because I told him I forgave him, so I needed to commit to it ... but I'm weak. We got into another fight earlier tonight and I brought it up, and this time he was less apologetic. He kept telling me over and over that I needed to accept my responsibility for what happened, that it was both our faults. 

I couldn't handle it. I told him no, I don't accept that. I don't believe that me taking his phone justified him choking me. It wasn't right, I behaved poorly, but I did not deserve to be hit and that I couldn't believe what he thought it was justified. 

I asked him what he would say if our daughter came to him with this same story and he said he would ask her what she did to provoke him. 

I told him I would never forgive him if he talked to her daughter that way and then I shut down. I was so angry with him I couldn't speak, so I sat there as he packed up his stuff and left. He told me I was ending our relationship by having this conversation, that I was calling him an abuser and this was the end of the relationship. 

The fight continued a bit longer by text, with him continuing to tell me I need to accept responsibility and with me telling him that I felt ashamed I didn't stick up for myself and leave. Then it ended with telling me:

*""You will not accept any wrong doing. You never do. In your head you're a victim of domestic violence and I'm this abusive guy and you did nothing wrong.""* and then *""This marriage is over. I don't want to be with someone whose ashamed to be with me""*

And that was it. He's staying at his work and I'm home alone wondering what to do. I'm soooo badly torn between 2 sides of myself: 1. the side that loves him and is now wondering if I'm overreacting. I was at fault. Maybe I should never have brought it back up. 2. the side of me that is screaming out loud, ""what is wrong with you!!!"" If this was fiction, no one would want to read this because it's so predictable. I'm ashamed of myself because I thought I was a proud independent woman, what am I doing here. (And now I'm back at side 1 again, questioning if I'm overreacting ... something he always accuses me of doing. He says I have a victim complex and secretley, I think he might be right.) 

Anyway, I guess I'm just looking for an outside opinion ... some thoughts to help me cut through the haze. Thanks in advance for your time. ",23Dec2018,1

So for the last past months my mom is being extremely sad and stressed and my dad and her are fighting all the time. Today on the verge of christmas eve she just told me that the only things that make her happy are me and my sister. My dad is an absolute asshole and my mom is always the victim, even when he does something like: he breaks a plate and it's her fault for being upset at him and not cleaning up.

 The thing that upsets me the most is that she always tends and asks of his well being and he couldn't even once think of her. Like she does all the work around the house and takes me and my sister to school (cuz we live in a suburb area) and still he is the one who does all the work, because he earns more I guess it's his logic, because my mom does more hours of work per week.

Anyway I want some advice on how to make her happier. I just want to do something nice for her especially now on christmas.

316,"My best friend has been dating someone for a year and a nine months now. During the nine months I'm been aware of this relationship, met with his GF and spoken to him about the relationship (asked how it's going etc) I've noticed certain things that I think fall under controlling behaviour on her side and I just want a second opinion to ensure I'm not going mad before I bring it up with him. Her are some things she's done that have put me on red alert:

* She demands that he spend all of his free time with her (between working and sleeping) which has lead to him lying about his whereabouts on the odd occasion (saying he's helping his Gran when he's actually with other mates) and me only getting to see him once a month (if I'm lucky).
* On the occasions she's aware that we're meeting up she won't let us meet alone, someone else has to be there (usually herself) despite the fact she's aware our relationship is sibling-like and has been for the last ten years.
* She demands he buy her things all of the time and has tantrums when he doesn't until he eventually relents. 
* She's starting to demand that he doesn't engage in 'dangerous' activities. For example she hits the roof when we go airsofting and he comes back with minor bruises. She also won't let him join my SCUBA diving club, not because of me, she just doesn't want him going in water that's deeper than your average pool. 
* She won't let him move out of his grandmother's house and in to a flat unless its with her. He, my twin brother and I have been talking about sharing a flat for the last few years as best he won't share a flat with his GF right now due to the small amount of time they've been together. She hits the roof if he mentions getting a flat with both my brother and I.
* She'll guilt trip him in to attending her families events, such as weddings, to trying and get him to change his mind about getting married and having kids (something he's said he never wants). 

Is this textbook controlling behaviour or am I reading in to it too much?

As I started spending more time with him, I realized that he was arrogant, lazy, and wanted to use me for tests, online quizzes, and assignments. He would constantly text me throughout the entire semester asking for my study notes &amp; answers to quizzes. I had to do two group assignments with him, and he barely did any work. It infuriated me when he got an 82% on a group presentation that he barely contributed to.

Outside of class, he was quite insufferable. He constantly talked about himself and badmouthed people/things he doesn't like. He talks as if his opinions are facts and fails to realize that a lot of things (i.e. music) are subjective. He was also incredibly clingy, following me around everywhere I went. At the beginning of the semester, he asked me to join his band, to which I agreed. His guitar skills were lackluster, which only baffled me as to why he was so arrogant. He later talked about how he wanted the entire band living together in an apartment next year. Mind you, this was after only 3-4 weeks of knowing him.

I decided I'd had enough. I quit his band by telling him I needed to focus on my grades. I didn't want to confront him because he's verbally aggressive and doesn't like taking ""no"" for an answer. So last week, I texted him which classes I was taking and the sections I was in. He happily signed up for all those courses.

327,"(sorry of my English is not the best.My native tongue is Spanish)

My brother always had poor taste in women, usually picked the craziest, most obssesive girl of the pack but with V we thought he had won the lottery. She was responsible, nice and she was a great mom with her two girls from a previous marriage. 

My mom, a single mother herself, was excited that my brother was taking the father role in this tiny little family, even if she always wanted to him to marry first (she was traditional that way, but she was open minded at the end).

Anyway, after a year dating, she got pregnant. We were excited again, it was my mother's first grandson and my first nephew. We were always nice and welcoming but then some issues started to appear. First, she did not like the family dog to be close to her kids, my dog is a big black lab mix, a bit scary looking and at first a bit uncomfortable around children (she never had the experience before) but she was kind and lovely. Still she didn't like it and demanded the dog to be outside when she visited. We didn't comply. Our dog is part of the family and she didn't even try to make the dog comfortable around kids (we even hired a dog trainer!)

Later, when my nephew was born and my mom went at their request to help the first week, she said she was ""bothersome and meddling in her business""

Then she demanded my brother to stop giving money to mom (my mom has a hearth condition that doesn't allow her to work) and pay the debts he acquired with me when he was unemployed (for example, I took a loan in his name and let him use my credit cards and such)

The relationship started to deteriorate so much that at some point, my bro had to wait for her to go to the bathroom to call me or our ma because she did not like ""how close we are"". 

She says it is shocking to her that we are so close because she herself didn't have a dad and her mom had some alcohol abuse issues and neglected her and her siblings during their early childhood. However I know people with even worse family background and they are not as mean as her.

The latest thing she did was take my brother's phone without his consent and blocked me and my mom from his texting apps. I realized that when I tried to reach him and he was not answering. He later confirmed that she did that. She has access to all his social media apps too.

I am worried about my brother. He tries to be justify her in everything but my gut tells me he is standing all this shit because he is afraid she will not let him see his son anymore (she pulled something similar with her other children's dad)

I feel sad and left behind. My brother is my hero, the only father figure I have besides my late grandfather. The fact it's been almost two months since we had an actual conversation pains me. I am leaving my country , alone for the first time for a long period of time and he doesn't even know that. My mom is staying that time with my aunt whom we adore but she is lately under so much stress that I am worried to leave.

330,"OK, you know how we (as in, pregnant women) can get fiercely protective of specific foods in the fridge and pantry? Even if we don't want to eat them right now? 




How do I get someone (who's never had a pregnant woman in their life before) to replace the damn Roses chocolate boxes they've annihilated in the last 2 days? 




Back story: Xmas is a very tight financial time of year for us, so we plan ahead and get one of the hamper services to help with groceries. We pay roughly $50/mo to ensure we have all the food we need over Xmas/new years because I cannot go shopping with huge crowds. I'll naturally freak out. 



Anyway, the hamper usually includes some treats we don't regularly buy, like fancy chocolate. I also squirrelled away some extra coin to buy a large box of Roses chocolate specifically for Xmas day. It took me 4 weeks of stashing coins I found and change from grocery shopping to afford this box. I wanted something special for the kids and husband to enjoy on Xmas day. 




My uncle, whom we currently live with because finances are stretched to the limit, decided he'd have a sweet snack of the goddamned chocolate I'd bought as well as the hamper pack. 



I'm also pregnant, otherwise I wouldn't be so upset about this. 




I got up tonight because my 2yo had a bad dream. After I got her settled, I walked to the kitchen for water, and there I see the pantry wide open and my chocolate gone. Again. 



It's just gone midnight and I'm furious. I'm exhausted from growing a baby, but I'm ropable over this. 




I'm tempted to go wake him up and yell at him, but that's not a good idea. Don't want to wake up the kids. Or husband. 




I just want to cry. I can't afford to buy another box the day before Christmas. It was the one special thing I was going to have this year.

I made a conscious decision to stop watching porn. Its been six years now and when I look back, I see a habit I out grew. 

Society tells us all men watch porn, most women too, that porn is normal. If you’re cool with porn - you make sense and if you disagree, you’re pretty much unrealistic and crazy.
Has anyone looked into the side effects of watching porn? Long term and short term? 
Maybe researched with an open mind and intention to learn what is actually healthy for us? 

In addition to personal repercussions, what about the effects on our relationships? If we need to create lies to cover up watching porn - is it not a form of cheating?

I am only talking of watching porn not masturbating. Masturbation is healthy.
Self pleasure and self intimacy is healthy. Understanding your body and learning what you like through self exploration and orgasm is healthy. You do not need a computer monitor or phone screen to masturbate. Porn can become distracting, being too ejaculation focused.

I can only speak from my own perspective; if a man isn’t on the path of looking at and ending his porn habit - He’s not for me. I openly do not consent to sex if he watches porn while in a relationship with me. I’ll be here as he works through whatever he needs to, to end it. This is my own personal boundary. I am currently dating someone now who 100% respects my beliefs as they organically shadow his own.

We all know there is a mass amount of humans out there who do not wait to have sex in a relationship and who also engage in porn. It’s important to be with someone who shares your same morals and values. Not one type being better than the other - just different. 

The reason for this post;
Are there any like minded individuals out there? Men and women? What have you gained watching or not watching porn? This a mature conversation where we each have a different opinion and a different truth. Please honor and respect that other people hold truths that may differ from your own, while not attaching their worth of a person to your disagreement. Have an open mind — This is the way forward.

I made my way up by taking challenging classes and working after school to improve my grades. After the the first semester of 12th grade I got the news I was accepted into the college that was my number one choice. It was a gorgeous campus, had great academic reputation, and some friends I knew.
Every thing was fine I accepted the offer, I paid the 100$ to start the process of entering the university, and a month and a half before I join my parents tell my I have to move to india with them and study in India.

My college hours are 6 days a week, 12 hours a day and when I get home at 6:00 pm, I go to my room and study. This is my shitty life, the education I’m getting feels like it won’t even benefit me, it’s just all shit. 
I’m lost I don’t know what to do.

342,"I love my dad, he did the best he could but he was very abusive and I cannot be in the same room as him without getting into an argument. He's an alcoholic, hot headed, stubborn, motherfucker and says shit that's Franky, whack. Because I'm an adult however I do not hold too many resentments, he was a shitty dad but he did the best he could. We don't ever see each other but send each other cards for holidays and I'm fine with this. We love each other at a distance and it's frankly best for our relationship. However I will be seeing him at Christmas. There are three points that I know he will jab at and I'm not sure how to respond by being direct but without starting the usual argument, sometimes he just pisses me off.

First one is going to be about my hair, I naturally have very pretty red hair but I color it all kinds of colors because it's MY fucking hair. Currently it's platinum blonde and it's beautiful but I know he's gonna say, why would you color your hair it's beautiful the way it is? This hits deep because he used to make comments about me wearing makeup and I'll never forget the time he said I looked loose because whatever I was wearing. It really stuck with me.

Second will probably be a comment about how he wishes I still believed in Jesus. I do not, I live my life by doing the right thing because it is simply doing the right thing not because I'm afraid to burn in hell that I don't.

Third will be politics...that one...last time we got into an argument over politics it was because he watched a documentary about how Obamacare was built to fail or something. Just nonsense, I can't argue with someone who believes in things that aren't factual. It's like how scientists refuse to debate with flat earthers because it's just ridiculous.


Anyway Reddit, anyone have any advice on how I can respond directly, respectfully to my father without getting into the usual argument? I know that there will be a point that he will get real drunk and that's usually when I make my exit. I have a window that I want to work with and getting angry and all that hurts my soul. My father isn't a bad man, he's not a good man either, he's just my dad and I just want to have an ok time with him at Christmas. Thanks in advance!

Over the past year I was learning how to create websites and design them. It started to be a hobby of mine lately. I would like to turn my hobby into a source of money. I'm 16 and I live in a middle class family. I am also into fashion (everything from hair to footwear, watches, and overall cloths in general). The problem is i need some cash to buy what I like. My parents can give me money but I don't like taking money from anyone, even family. Yeah I take money for food and essentials but I feel like I don't deserve the money when it comes to spending it to stuff that are not necessary, I have to work for it. I want a way to make money from creating websites and make money out of it.

I’ve been pretty introverted my whole life but as of recent I have been making an effort to catch up with old friends but either I mess it up and misinterpret their actions towards me as being romantic (which is quite dumb on my part, I shortly realize they’re just being nice and this is what a friendship is supposed to be like) or I offer to get together and it’s always “oh well I’m [insert excuse here]”

348,"A couple of weeks ago, my child had a check up with his doctor, he is 16 months old. His doctor was a bit concerned that he isn’t saying many words, just a lot of babbling. She referred us to a speech therapist for a second opinion. We went to the first consultation with the speech therapist and she did a few tests on my son. We brought him into a room packed full of new toys, new books, colours, table, chairs, etc. Needless to say, he was sooo distracted. She asked him all these different types of commands, commands that I know he does at home no problem and he wasn’t listening to her at all. He was bouncing off the walls with exploring the new toys. After the assessment she told me that she had concerns that he didn’t respond to his name, didn’t understand simple commands and wasn’t making good eye contact or engaging. I broke down after the appointment, according to her, my son was showing concerning signs regarding his development. After I calmed down, I continued on with my day, now hyper aware of his eye contact, name response and comprehension of commands. His attention span throughout the rest of the day was leaps and bounds better than her assessment, but we were back at home. Is it normal to assess a child’s comprehension in a room full of new toys? I felt my son may have had an unfair disadvantage, but she is the professional. The therapist recommended therapy, which I am willing to enrol him in, but she is selling her business, this is not covered by our healthcare system. Could this be unethical to get business? Or is her assessment completely standard and I should trust her opinion? ",23Dec2018,1

352,"I have a friend on the edge of our social group. More a friend of a friend. She's nice and friendly, sensitive but a little wild. She's not someone I want to become close with. I have never socialised with her one to one for example and have only seen her at social nights out a handful of times.

She is going through a failed marriage. She is still with her husband and doesn't want to hurt him as he still loves her. In the meantime, she has fallen in love with my best friend who has no interest in her other than to be a fringe acquaintance, but she messages him constantly. He's polite and replies but has become tired of her messages. He's a caring guy and is not the type to tell her to stop. She knows he isn't interested but gets her fix of happiness from him when he messages her.

He has a lot going on in life without a needy fringe acquaintance taking up his time like this. So I allowed her to confide in me about her marriage and about my friend to try and steer her away from him.  She opened up more than expected and I learned she has a lot of issues that I'm not qualified to deal with. I tried to give the best advice I could including for her to seek professional help.

Since then she messages me often. If I don't reply straight away (because I'm not a big messager) she tries to force me to reply by following up with messages like ""Is everything OK?"" or ""Sorry to bother you"" or by starting a completely new subject altogether. She calls me multiple times when she's drunk (I have never answered). It's becoming tiring. To the point where I haven't replied on over a month.

I don't mind keeping her as an occasional acquaintance. I want to address the situation with her but without being an asshole. She has had a tough life and is going through a rough patch and I sympathise but I don't want to be her therapist or close friend. She has a lot of friends and is always online on WhatsApp so I'm sure my friend and I are not the only people in this situation.

355,"Hello reddit.

So this is an ongoing issue that have been going on do a smaller degree the past two or three year but recently it has been going too far and i don't know how to deal with it.

Sometimes my mother will get angry over seemingly nothing and will just burst into this sorta tantrums. this has allways been happening for as long as i can remember but it has gotten so bad lately, that i would call it borderline harassment. the outbursts are usually not directed at me but at my father. 

A few years ago i moved to my own apartment do to my studies and have been living on my own in another city, im talking with my mother allmost every day over the phone but when i get home and i hear what she is saying to my father i get really angry and i struggle to keep my calm. This is not normel for me since i tend to be a really calm person.

So yesterday morning 22.dec my mother woke up and ate brakefast with my father, he was about to go hunting (his hobby that he tend to do when its hunting season) but then she angrely shouted at him a bit, she calmed a little and my father asked he how to close an app on his phone, then she had another outburst calling him stupid and an idiot. 

At this point i got out of bed at and intervened asking he why she coulden't just talk nicely, then she told me that it was non of my business and that it was a privat matter basicly saying im not a part of the family. At this point my father would interject say that ofcouse it was my business, this is when things went the rails. She rushed out of the room yelling that she would just move then and locking her self in their bedroom. I stood outside calmly trying to make he understand that i was worried about her but i got no response.

I havent talked with her since. and the longer i w8 the angrier i myself get,becouse she tried to neglect me form the family, and all i really wanna do now is to just leave and drive back to my apartment and just cut my contact with her. But i just don't think that would be the right thing to do.

Have any of you guys been in a simular situation and how did you resolve it?

356,"I have a dog who is about 20 months old. He is a rescue, born a street dog in another country. We have had him for over a year and a half. He's a big guy, about 100 pounds, and very strong. I love him dearly. Let's call him Muffin. 

I've been taking him regularly to dog classes and enlisted the services of a good trainer. This has helped him to become an obedient and well behaved dog (nearly all the time). So much so that people sometimes shout out to me on the street what a great dog he is when sitting calmly, heeling, etc. Did I mention that he has a sweet heart? I love the guy. 

But sad to say he has a dark side and it is pretty intense. He gets afraid of people sometimes. At least a half dozen times, he has tried to attack people for threats that he alone perceives - just the person moving his hand a certain way or... something. Each of these times he was either muzzled or effectively restrained by leash, so nothing bad happened.

On two other occasions, he did bite and draw blood. These people were my mother and father, and didn't sue me. But anyone else could have. 

I live in a small city, and there are always a lot of people around in the streets in my area. Furthermore I have kids and my mother lives upstairs. Also my mother, my wife, the kids and I have active social lives and also work that involves people coming over. We have learned how to manage Muffin by putting him in a crate or an outdoor pen to keep visitors safe. However there is a persistent possibility that something will go wrong with the system we have and a stranger will be with Muffin at the wrong time. 

Several months ago, after my mother and father were bit, I decided that we couldn't keep Muffin, and began to try to rehome him. We put in a lot of effort over a few months, but never got any interest whatsoever. This even though I was putting the best face on the situation. In hindsight, ethically I should have written in big bold letters that he is aggressive and a fear biter, because that's the unfortunate truth. 

Meanwhile, I was continuing with the training, and he was growing out of his puppyness. His behavior was improving. I decided to wait and see whether his emotional troubles would get better. Maybe we could keep him. That's what I wanted. Have I mentioned that he touches my heart every day, the lovely guy?

However, recent events have showed me that the fear issues, and his propensity to attack out of fear have not gone away, nor are they likely to. Just last week, I ran into a friend on a walk, and while chatting, this friend gestured with her hands. Suddenly Muffin lunged. It was hard restraining this big strong dog, but I had control. Had something gone wrong with the restraint -- leash breaking, bad reaction time, who knows what other factor -- he would have bitten her for sure. 

So I come to the conclusion that I can't keep the dog. And rehoming is an extraordinarily remote possibility. I think there are some experts out there who have what it takes to keep him and the rest of society safe, but unfortunately there are a lot more dogs that need this care than people able to give it. 

So I'm left looking at a grim option, whose euphamistic name begins with E. In the state where I live, given the fact that he has bitten two people already, any citizen could report him and there would be a legal injunction to euthanize him. I can't believe I'm contemplating this. When I was younger I never imagined I would be in this position or would seriously contemplate causing the death of a beautiful, sweet, healthy animal because of behavior problems. But I feel that I am currently exposing my family, friends, and community to real risk. Not to mention risking me getting sued or even jail time for knowingly having a dangerous dog. Which he is. The beautiful guy.

Me and one other worker are an excellent team and it’s a bit of a joke that when we work mornings (5/7 mornings a week) there isn’t anything to do the rest of the day. It’s not untrue...

But I’m also a student. Next semester I have 15 hours of class but 20+ hours outside of class just to get all the work done and study. It’s a very difficult semester ahead (Higher level STEM courses) and each following semester, including summers, will be like this until I graduate. 

I feel exhausted. I failed 2 classes this last semester because I didn’t have time to study because I worked so much. I’m already shit at chemistry, but now I have to retake organic chemistry. It’s not like I can NOT work, though. After financial aid I still usually owe $1500-2000 out of pocket. But my bills take up half my paycheck each month (I live with my boyfriend, his parents pay 90% of our rent). They are things like remaining rent, Internet, electricity, tuition, etc. We stopped using central heating/cooling (in Texas) to save money. It sucks.

So I put a ton of effort into this job that pays me less than $8/hour and I work constantly to try and keep up with bills, and that in turn causes me to fail the classes I pay so much for... I’m also severely depressed (possibly bipolar) and have been looking for therapy, but most therapists around here aren’t taking New clients until the semester starts up.

But maybe I can stop giving a as much of a shit about my job so I don’t exhaust myself every time I go in. I actually really really love my job and the mom and pop owners. I like my coworker and manager. It’s a great place. They just don’t make enough to pay me what I need, so I can’t stay forever even though I love the work.

I recently completed my first semester at University and got a 2.0 GPA. I thought my dad would be understanding because of the organization I'm also enrolled in but he was not at all. I understand his disappointment and I am also disappointed by my performance academically but he is now thinking (and probably will) not pay for my next semester of college. I have a few options but I think no matter what I am screwed but ill get to those after I write about my relationship with my dad.

My dad has always been strict about my grades and consistently for the past few years used sending me to college to threaten me over breaks or during the year. It's gotten to a point where I'm mentally exhausted and don't want to deal with it anymore but I also feel like maybe I'm in the wrong. I just wish he would be more understanding because a lot of people do poorly in their first semester at this University especially if they are in the organization I am in. I don't know how to talk to him about this and I don't think its healthy but I could be wrong. I know that he is known for being a narcissist as well as having a toxic personality but is he displaying this behavior towards me?

For my options:

\- Take out student loans and continue to go to college, try to be as independent of him as I can be. (This scares me because I don't know how student loans work and I feel like I'll be in crippling debt for years.)

\- Move across the country to my ex-girlfriends dorm until I can get a job and apartment and try to go to college again. (This would probably make me most happy but is also the scariest option)

At 24 I have achieved more than most and I am completely dissatisfied with it all because all I want in the world are for my parents to look at me, and say they are proud of me, that they love me and that they will always love me....like normal people do in movies.

And the longer I live in this world and the more I accomplish, it'll just eat at me. What's the use of getting so much if your own parents aren't proud of you.

Outside of class, he was quite insufferable. He constantly talked about himself and badmouthed people/things he doesn't like. He talks as if his opinions are facts and fails to realize that a lot of things (i.e. music) are subjective. He was also incredibly clingy, following me around everywhere I went. At the beginning of the semester, he asked me to join his band, to which I agreed. His guitar skills were lackluster, which only baffled me as to why he was so arrogant. He later talked about how he wanted the entire band living together in an apartment next year. Mind you, this was after only 3-4 weeks of knowing him.

I decided I'd had enough. I quit his band by telling him I needed to focus on my grades. I didn't want to confront him because he's verbally aggressive and doesn't like taking ""no"" for an answer. So last week, I texted him which classes I was taking and the sections I was in. He happily signed up for all those courses. In reality, I lied to him about each and every class because I don't want to be in any of his classes. Right now, I'm relieved that I won't be in any of his classes next semester (I confirmed this). Am I an asshole for doing this?",23Dec2018,1
372,"(Quebec, Canada) I'm literally shaking writing this. I discovered it back in July, we had a hard conversation about it and he swore (swear in past tense, french candian, don't judge me please) that he would never store any more pics of naked kids on his PC. A few months later, i had some suspicious, approched him again about it and he started crying, telling how bad it is from me not to trust him.

Well here we are today. On my 18th birthday, with a lovely girlfriend and going for a business school degree, and coming back from a depression, that my life seems to heading for a downhill. I'm not working right now since I want to focus on my scholarship, so I'm really dependant of my dad. If he goes to prison, I won't really have a place to live anymore. I learned a few weeks back that my mom would die in less than a year, she's staying in the hospital until her last moment... 

My dad often told me that he wouldn't mind dying. He is clearly depressed and refuses to go see a psychologist. His mother (my grand-mother) has a brain cancer and doesn't much time left. Just a shit storm of bad news actually. So if I had to turn him in, he might commit suicide, making me lose both my mom and my dad in 2019, where I just turned 18. I'm too scared for my life to fall appart if I turn him in. Please guys help me, I'm on the verge of crying rn and I just can't.

373,"Hello, reddit. I made this throwaway to ask some advice, because I really don't know what to do anymore, and I'm hoping that perhaps someone will have an idea on how to move forward. I'm on mobile, so I apologise for any formatting issues.

I'm a 21 year old college junior, and for the last year and a half, I've been having episodes. I don't really know what to call it. From what I've read, it's not panic attacks, at least I don't think it fits the description completely. When it happens, it usually starts with uncontrollable twitches and movement in my legs and hands. Sometimes I can tell myself it's in my head and make it stop. Other times, it will stop for a while and get worse and worse. At its peak, I'll tense up in a ball with really bad racing, repeating negative thoughts for up to a minute, usually repeating horrible things over and over to myself. My whole body convulses, and I just repeat words and stutter and have no control over anything, and I feel very extreme emotions, swinging between extreme anger and being so sad that I'm sobbing in seconds. Then suddenly every muscle in my body relaxes and I feel absolutely nothing at all. I cycle between these for hours. It's exhausting, and it usually only stops once I pass out.

For a while, about a year ago, the only way I was able to cope with this was through self harm. I would hit myself, until one time I slammed my head into a door frame and knocked myself out. I also would drug myself with NyQuil to knock myself out. I no longer do these things, and have developed some healthy ways to distract myself if I can notice it's starting.

Last May, I started seeing a school counselor, but they mostly just tell me that I need to have better self care. That has definitely helped, and it's no longer an every week occurance, but these episodes are still happening, for seemingly no reason, every few months. I don't know what to do, and I don't know what is wrong with me. I'm thinking about seeing someone outside the school, but I don't know what to tell them. Like, yeah, I have scary episodes and I don't know why? Has anyone else had issues similar to this? I'm just very lost. I appreciate any thoughts or discussion.",23Dec2018,1
374,"Some context: I occasionally like to seek out artists online who post their work and commission information (i.e. Tumblr, Reddit, etc.) and pay them to create art for me. It's a fun thing I like to do sometimes with my spending income, I think it's nice to have something I envision created by an artist whose work I enjoy while supporting a freelance artist with my money. 

Recently, I commissioned an artist. I sent payment to them over Paypal, and they sent me a confirmation email saying that they received my money, and that I would be receiving a sketch and update very soon. 

This was back in November. It's nearly been a month and a half now, and I still have yet to receive any form of update from the artist. I've tried sending multiple messages on multiple platforms, but all have been ignored. 

I should mention that the artist looked very legitimate. They had multiple social media platforms, and had numerous active followers, as well as an extensive collection of their own original art. I had no reason to believe they were a scammer. 

They had mentioned that they were busy with multiple commissions, so I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I am a patient person, and I know that these things usually take time to be completed. However, the fact that they are ignoring my messages and have not given me any form of update at all for a month and a half, closing in on two months now, after having taken my money is worrying. Worse, I see that they are indeed active on social media, so it's not like they haven't seen my messages.

I am honestly unsure of what I should do. Does anyone have any advice for someone in this situation? ",23Dec2018,1
375,"Hello everyone! So I’m a sophomore in University who is incredibly passionate about mental health advocacy. As a social work major I have found a club that works directly with our school’s counseling center that is primarily run by students. To get in, however, you have to go through an application and interview process, here is where the problem presents itself.

I had found myself in a toxic relationship that ended in my girlfriend sleeping with my best friend. With her past history of abuse, one of her ways of handling disputes between us as a couple was to tell our entire group of friends about all of our arguments while I preferred to keep things in house. She soon began to get involved in my support circle and before I knew it the general consensus was that I was a bad person and whatever my side was, it wasn’t important because of the tears my now ex shed. Seeing my mental health decline as a result of being ostracized but kept on a string, I left the group of people to better myself and find others who were more supportive, the issue is not everyone appreciated me ending my connections with them.

Here is where my issue now lies. One of my ex’s best friends is on the executive board for this club, meaning she is partly in charge of interviewing and screening applicants. She had told my ex in the past that regardless of the interview she gave, once she became an executive board member she would make sure she got in. This worries me, however, because this girl hasn’t hid any disdain for me and I am absolutely certain that this same personal bias will find its way into my interview process. I have tried to remain civil with this person, but after occasions such as her screaming “You fucking suck Bepis_Inc!” at me across campus, I fear that I may not receive the fighting chance the other applicants have.

I feel as if talking to the president and the other e-board members and giving a brief and professional reasoning of this fear is the best route to go, however, I fear that it will negatively impact me as a candidate since it may make me seem I’m more trouble than I’m worth. What should I do?

**TL;DR** Ex’s close friend who hates me is partly in charge of screening and interviewing applicants for a club I’m interested I joining. She has shown bias towards accepting her friends in the past and bias towards her enemies as well. How do I get a fair shot.",23Dec2018,1

I have a crush on a guy at work for two months now. Literally the first day I saw him I was attracted to him. I kept seeing him around and uncovered the weirdest thing but I won’t go into it. 

When we do bump into each other he puts his hand on his neck a lot. I’m thinking he’s irritated that he keeps bumping into me? Lol it’s not intentional though but anyway! He looks at me a lot but other times when he’s near me he’s kind of nonchalant so he’ll look in a different direction or will adjust his clothing and look away.

One time I held the door open for him and he said thank you and was pleasant. I don’t want to read into anything but this has happened before and the guy in question DID NOT like me AT ALL! (A painful rejection haha)

Last week I was leaving the office about to walk to the lifts and he was walking in the same direction with his colleagues. As soon as he saw me he darted across the floor and his colleagues were asking him were he was going. He looked back at me twice but I just ran into the lifts and started crying like a big baby!

I don’t know if he likes me and I don’t want to read into anything and get hurt again. I really really like this man and would love to get to know him!

I’m 21 and he’s 3 years older than me (I think). I did think about maybe sending him a message on Facebook or something to let him know I like him. But as were work at the same firm I don’t want to risk it.

391,"So, this has been a difficult year for us, my children and I haven't been in the Christmas mood at all. I lost my job and its been hell. I needed something to fill up my time, since im on my Christmas break till the new year.


I was thinking some volunteer work would be a good way to pass the time. We did some work in a nursing home and a homeless shelter.


I also chose to visit shutins, and basically spend time with them. Keep them company . One of the people I visited was this 50 year old divorcee. She is a heavily depressed woman who hasn't left her house in over 20 years.

So I went to her house and she was just so happy to have company. Seriously, she just jumped and hugged me for almost 15 minutes as soon as I walked in the door. So we sat down and talked for almost an hour or so. She told me about her husband and everything and why she hasn't left the house. She said it was because she was ugly. She believes herself to be deformed and scarred. The charity organization warned me about that beforehand. But objectively, she isn't ugly at all. She's actually a really beautiful woman. I told her she was pretty and that made her cry with happiness. 


Anyway, long story short, once my hour was up, I quietly dismissed myself and she started screaming and crying at me not to leave.


But I explained to her I had to pick my daughter up from school and could only stay for a couple extra minutes. When I did, her tone changed. She started holding onto my arm, rubbing my bicep, touching my chest, she even unbuttoned the top button of her top. I left because I was uncomfortable, she told me to come back any time.


So, this woman I volunteered to help is trying to seduce me. Ive considered going back. But I mean, She's obviously emotionally scarred. Would it be wrong for me to do so?


So would I be the asshole if I go back to this woman's house and attempt to make a move on her?

That year was terrible, and it felt more like a warzone than a home. My moms had threatened to kick me out multiple times for small altercations we had, she would always throw ultimatums in the air, meanwhile my older brother could throw and has thrown many tempter tantruns breaking things and always has my mom in his corner. There have been countless moments where she has taken his side on arguments it makes no sense to me. An example would be one time my brother had his music on really loud( we share walls so it bothers me ) and i would ask my mom if she could ask him to turn it down because everytime i would ask he would throw a mini temper tantrum and act like hes doing me favour and doesnt have to turn his music down despite it being late at night and I have to work the next morning, and knowing this my mom would leave me to 'deal with it myself' whereas if she wanted the music turned down she would have no problem asking him herself. My point being is that she seems to not care about my wishes or see things from my point of view. Fast forward half a year and i decided to get the hell out of that hell hole and go back to finish my degree. While i'm moved out i find my mom has divorced my dad and in a very immature selfish and hurtful way toward my father ( she basically had been contacting some guy overseas for over a year and finally decided to go visit him and have sex with him right after she told my dad to leave) she had constantly threatened divorce in the past but this is thr first time shes acted upon it and now my dads living on my own. To summarize.. My whole family is fucked and toxic as shit, my mom never showed me much love or appreciation when i lived at home and only ever complained or seemed burdened by me.

I have the option to go back home for christmas, with my brother and mother, go to my dads new place for christmas, or stay at my place alone for christmas.  None seem ideal, i dont want to go to my old house because my moms a cunt and itd be weird spending it with my dad at his place, im also not on best terms with him as he also has treated me unfairly in the past but its clear to me hes depressed and is trying to better himself and has apologized for hid behaviour in the past.

397,"So I'm 19, worked for about a year and have 7k saved up (had more but travelled for a bit) and now I am stressing out even more about what I want to do with my life. As the title suggests I'm torn between the 3 main paths that I see mentioned all the time.  
  
I don't particularly want to do a trade, because personally I feel there's more potential in having schooling or military experience, but there's afar smaller time investment than military, and smaller money investment than college.  
  
I would like to go to college, but student loans sound miserable hearing everyone's stories and, although I feel I could pay it off relatively quick, debt isn't really something I like. The social aspect though, as the title suggests is, I think, the biggest thing that draws me to college. It seems so easy to meet people and I feel I wasted my opportunities in high school. I have many friends right now, but I have never had a girlfriend and college seems like a good environment for networking and meeting friends and whatnot. I don't want to spend 40k just meet people though. But I think I have an idea for my major (computer science or CIS).  
  
Military seems compelling because both my grandfathers served and my older brother and they all have a successful life. The security clearance, plus training, plus free college after seems like a great deal. But college would definitely be different at 24 compared to 19, and I feel like financial reasons probably aren't the best reasons to serve idk. Again there's a social aspect here but the time investment pushes me away. And I don't know why making friends/girlfriend seems so important to me, but I feel like if I do military it's like signing off being single for the next 4 years of my life, which is embarrassing for me to say because it's ridiculous that I'm putting potential to have a relationship at the top of my priorities.

I’ve always been absolutely engrossed in animation: from Disney to Ghibli to Tomm Moore’s work to 90’s era Cartoon Network, you name it, I lapped it up. I developed a strong sense of admiration for Moore, Nick Park, Rebecca Sugar, Glen Keene, Chris Sanders, Isao Takahata and Brad Bird, who made me feel like animation could be a legit job.

But I was a stupid teenager and young adult, pushed my passion to the wayside and studied Social Work instead. Don’t get me wrong, I love it. I’m interested in people, hearing their stories and trying to resolve their problems. 

But Social Work isn’t my passion. Recently, I’ve been told that I should consider dropping out of my degree and transferring to an Animation BA instead. But I’ve no arts qualifications, have little resembling a portfolio at the moment, and I’m frightened of the consequences of dropping everything I know at 25. 

I’m sick of feeling like I’m doing the wrong thing, and I wish I was stronger at doing something about it. So I’m guessing I need advice.

TL:DR: I want to be an animator but doing an unrelated qualification and idk what to do. ",23Dec2018,1
405,"**TL;DR** 
I've wished for a PS4, already been told that I'm not getting one (not as a joke like ""oh you're not getting one). Parents have done this before, but I still got what I wished for. How do I prepare myself for a disappointment?

Right so first of all, I made a new account cause what I'm about to say is going to seem petty as fuck so here we go. Also, I live in EU so we don't open presents on the 25th in case anyone wanted to know. Also not giving away my age, but I'm not a little kid, but also not a grown up yet.

So I've been wanting a PS4 for ages, and my parents have already told me that I'm not getting one. Even my sister who I'm really close to knows. Yet I've still got a slight feeling they may surprise me with it. I'm struggling with depression and anxiety and all that, but am doing better, getting better grades in school etc. I do deserve one, but my parents don't have the money for one I've been told and this Christmas I've also been told that we're not doing a lot of presents (which I'm fine with, I just want that PS4 so badly)

Even though I've been told I'm not getting one, I still think I may get one. So my expectations are higher than I want them to be. I'm sure enough that I may get it, as they've done this before. They've told me I'm not getting what I wished for, but then the last present I've been surprised and gotten it. So it's not impossible.

But what I'm asking now, is for help. How do I prepare myself and expect a big disappointment if I don't get it?",23Dec2018,1

She then proceeds to tell me how this guy just came over even though she didn't want him to, and while they were in her room he had pinned her down, held her hands above her head and pressed down on her chest. she kept trying to tell him no and he wouldn't get off of her. she was trying to fight it but he wasn't budging until she mentioned that she had a taser in her purse, and that was a good cue for him to leave.

410,"I'm on the verge of losing it here.

I moved my mom out to live with me 3 years ago. She had breast cancer, was by herself 1000 miles away in a low income housing project and I started to panic a bit. She was threatening to not go through with treatment. After 2 or 3 trips back home within a few months and not being able to concentrate at work any longer, I made arrangements to move her in with me and my wife. The arrangement was for my mother to stay with us for 6 months to a year and then find her own place. My wife agreed, encouraged it and helped me prepare the house for her. 

My wife cheated on me (later found out it was the second time) the week I was away packing my mom's stuff up and moving her. She moved out without warning 4 weeks after my mother moved in. It is mostly unrelated to this post as our marital problems predated my mother's cancer. This changed mom's arrangement a bit.

The first few year went by without issue. She made it through the rest of her poison, chop &amp; burn and is now cancer free. She was a big help in adjusting to the single dad life. She helped around the house, made dinner, baby sat, etc. We were greatful to have each other.

By the second year the daily arguments started. I had lost my job and was home a lot. Her oxycodone use leftover from the cancer &amp; started to become a problem. It was causing a severe case of IDGAF. She wasn't caring for her health. She wasn't leaving the house other than to shop. She wasn't making any new friends (she had me to bombard). She wasn't looking for her own place or filing out applications (most of the places she qualified for had 1-2 year waiting lists). She stopped helping around the house and started being a complete slob. Many of the arguments she would start when my son was there and I would have to go into my room with my son to get away from ber. She had been depressed for many years and it was getting worse fast.

I started dating again around this time and like all friends (male and female) I've had throughout my life my mother started to interfere. I'd ask her for privacy to netflix and chill (i was unemployed but not completely broke for a few months) and she'd force herself into the mix, would start world war 3 type arguments if I asked her to get lost for a few hours. She facebook friended one of them. Talk to them about my ex wife. So, that's pretty much nixed my dating life for now.

Fast forward to year 3 (this year). I now have the best job of my life. Because of my unemployment and and a few late rent payments my landlord didnt renew my lease. I was seriously tempted to move out and leave my mom behind. But me, being the softie I am,  rented a larger house with the hope of putting some space between us. Also the new house I rented was on a lake and our yard is backed up to a park. My hope was that she would get out, enjoy nature a bit and maybe make some friends. 

I made an agreement with her that the only way she could stay with me is if she started to make changes. Stop the oxy or get into rehab, get out of the house more, start going to survivor groups - church, crafts, senior center, etc.  And, most importantly, to start seeing a therapist.

I got a family therapist to help us. My mother is a former scientologist so this was like going to see the devil for her. The therapist said she was passively suicidal. Needless to say she did everything she could to sabotage and not to see the therapist and finally cussed her out and refused to go anymore after a few months. Any of the good advice the therapist gave me to try was also news from the devil. This was the tipping point for me.

She spent the entire summer couped up in the house. She started really abusing her oxy prescription, she would sleep 16 hours until 1 or 2PM just so she could double up her dosages at night. She is now running out of oxy before her refill. She refuses detox or rehab. She got diabetic foot ulcers (from 20 years of careless sugar management) in August and is not caring for them properly even though there is a real risk of her loosing her foot. She kept getting the cast wet and walking unnecessarily on it. Her doctor stopped putting the casts on and she now has a less effective air boot. Its reinfected and no end in sight for it. I bought her a knee walker and she outright refused to even try to use it. I can't care for someone that refuses to care for themselves. 

She is having a negative effect on my life. I am severely stressed and always on edge. I'm having a hard time concentrating at work again. She has become a nasty person and says and does unacceptable things around my son. I feel if she doesn't leave I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.

Cutting to the chase, I don't know how to get her out of my house. She did not update the waiting list on the two low income apartments she applied for years ago. Her doctor found an assisted living facility with an immediate opening for her but she refuses to go because 'they will take her $700 social security check'. I have been trying to persuade her, guilt her, have friends talk sense into her about taking it to no avail. She redirects, avoids and starts world war 3 type arguments when I broach the subject now. Its too late for her to find her own apartment. It's so bad I am considering staying with my ex wife temporarily. 

I still love her and don't wish to be estranged from her. I moved out in my mid 20's and we had a mostly decent relationship after wards. I know in my heart we would be able to get through this without hating each other. I don't know if i could deal with the guilt of evicting her, but there doesn't seem to be any other option.

Please help!

At the beginning he was gentle and funny but then kinda start flirting with me, that really makes me feel uncomfortable because I am not looking for a serious relationship, I just wanted someone to talk.
So I was ignoring the questions that he asked me like ""do you have a bf"" or ""have you ever been in love"". I was joking about random things sending him funny stickers and stuff, then he just texted me: ""you must have a bitter life is you like treating people like shit and I doubt that exists such a masochist person capable of tolerate you"". I freak out and ask him if everything was alright and he told me it was a joke, also that he really doesn't like that I was treating him ""indiferent"".

I get my tuition paid for when I got to a state college, I am taking advantage of a guaranteed admissions program where I can get immediate admission so long as I get a B average at a community college.
That means I’d have so start my classes at the CC p soon after I come back to make sure I get in Fall 2020.
I will have to pay the tuition for the CC because it’s better to save them paying the tuition on a 4 year rather than a CC.
I do not have a car, or would be able to buy one before I go.
I do not have a license and may or may not get one before I leave.
When I get back I will be EMT cert. and will get a part time job as an EMT in my area.
I can apply for a housing fund through the national guard.

421,"  

I have had a tumultuous life and was on the verge of giving up altogether. In some serendipitous timing right after taking a break from a dead-end, expensive, educational endeavor, I happened to get laid at a party. I am by no means pro-life or religious, but I don't know the words to describe the pregnancy besides ""godsend."" I was so happy to learn of my change in trajectory. 

I was not aware until after the fact that the man involved was married with his own children. When I discovered I was pregnant, I located the father and made a mutual agreement at my prompting that there would be no further contact whatsoever. There was no sense in ruining his family and my own with all the emotional roller coasters that could be expected from disclosure, when I had full confidence in my own independence in raising a child. 

For personal reasons, I am not interested in finding a mate in the near future. Should a father-character present itself at any point moving forward, that would be as serendipitous as the pregnancy itself. I am not looking, and an outsider would probably say that I am avoiding it with intent. Not only do I have a constant source of income from a trust fund, but my daughter has inspired me to go back to school with a focus toward finding myself a decent job. It has been a success and I have job security. 

We're doing great and we have a good home, and I am happy with our life together, as is she. However, she is entering the age where she recognizes ""daddies and mommies"" from daycare. I anticipate inquiries in the near future. After several years of motherhood, I have yet to come to terms with what to say to her, how, and when. My intent has never been to conceal the truth from her. But I what is the most sensitive way to present it? 

I don’t care about my pride or my feelings. What is best for my daughter?  I am looking for any advice, anecdotal or otherwise, on how to present to her the reality of why she has only one parent.

435,"Let me start of by saying my relationship before the last one was terrible. He never devoted time to me or never put in the effort and always put his friends before me. He spent more time with them than me, and he always made excuses as to why he’d never call, text, etc. (All of this time would be devoted to video games btw) 

That was not only the issue, he was also controlling, manipulative, emotionally abusive, just everything you can think of. 

My current relationship is making me question some things. My boyfriend has a friend circle, that he’s had for many years and they are really his only “good friends”  that he’s known. This one friend of his, has made sexually suggestive comments towards me and it makes me uncomfortable. Now, wouldn’t it make complete sense to just drop that so called “friend” of his after he disrespected me, AND his “friend?” (Bf’s “friend”) I mean, am I wrong for thinking that? Because if that were me, I would drop that person. He says he cares, but it seems otherwise. 

“I’ll have a conversation with him” and he did...OVER TEXT?? Like, seriously? Am I being pushy or too much?? I don’t know. 

Now, over the holidays my bf is up in Missouri to visit family for Christmas. Obviously, he’s going to be busy the whole day which is COMPLETELY okay, it would be crazy to not to think it was okay. I want him to spend time with his family. 

However, after not speaking to me for quite some time, (little conversations here and there, which again, I completely understand, he was with family.) he plays games till 5 am with the same “friend” that disrespected me. Calls him, everything after not speaking to me at all. 

It was getting rather late, maybe around 12:30 am, and I needed to get up early for work tomorrow, so I gave him a heads up that I need to go to sleep. (Usually he calls me every night before we go to sleep, and we sleep on the call.) and he says “do you want to call?” And I was just already pissed so I said “up to you” because I needed to go to bed now, I have to get up early. He replies “in a bit”  because playing with his friend that disrespected me and talking to him til 5 fucking AM was more important?? After he didn’t speak to me all day? So I tell him I’m going to bed because I had to, and that’s that. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way? 

Oh and not only that, I was in a relationship with one of his friends before him (am I proud of it? No) but we had a huge set back because some things, he has a big problem with me speaking to him, (my ex, my bf’s friend) but he happily still converses with him??

I can’t afford a psychologist, and I don’t want to go to one as it is money consuming and time consuming. Christmas is tomorrow and I feel anxious and annoyed when I just want to be happy and I know I’m not gonna have a good time tomorrow because of all this stress and anxiety. 

I don’t even want it to be Christmas I just want to get in a room, lock the door, and be alone overthinking.

How can I overcome this, hate being sad and stressed. I wake up tired every day even if I sleep over 8 hours and I’m only 22. ",23Dec2018,1

There's something that I would like to talk about and I really need everyone's thoughts on it.  
When a person knows his/her goal or dream and he dreams of achieving it every single day, but he just can't fight or go for it, What makes a person do such a stupid thing? In another word, what's holding him back from fighting for it when he knows and he completely realizes that his/her life will get messed up if that dream hasn't got achieved? It's very odd I know when you know the right path but you just can't take it for some reason you don't know..   
Your thoughts on this matter might be very helpful and will be very appreciated.",23Dec2018,1

He always makes fun of me/harasses me for no apparent reason. I was just playing a game on my computer when he came up an turned it off, while filming the whole thing on his phone.  When I asked why, he said because it was funny and offered no apology.  Earlier today, I was trying to use the XBOX and he kept shouting ""hey cortana, turn Xbox off."". Hr literally went at this for fifteen minutes to no avail until he finally gave up and just sent over to the Xbox and turned it off.  He also enjoys just shoving me/hitting me/anything generally annoying.  What's really annoying is that he gets all the sympathy.  His parents are super protective of him, as he is an only child.  He also has many social and physical issues, as he is morbidly obese.  Because of this, I can't complain about him, as everyone will call me a bully despite the fact that he, a full grown 20 year old man keeps picking on me, a 16 year old scrawny teenager.  Every time I try to call him out he lies and says he never did it. Usually his parents come over and tell me he has social issues and cannot be held accountable for his behavior too.

My mental and physical health has improved dramatically in this time because I fought like hell to get better point blank. My friend always cheered me on and gave me some good advice and listened to me on my darkest days, so in a way I feel like I owe them.
They let me know how unhappy they are with life and other personal things. I did my very best to give them some good advice on how they start to do small things to change their life around and for the better. Every single positive thing I mentioned would get knocked down with a negative reason why they can’t help themselves. This went on for a few months, but I stayed patient because I believed that if they saw me getting better and healthier, that they would somehow be inspired to want that too. I’m finally admitting to myself that this person with a truly loving heart, just doesn’t want to get better and although they complain about how bad their life is, they choose not to change it. I can’t sit by and watch it unfold like that  anymore. The worst part for me is to see their child watch them and learn that withdrawal from life and not getting yourself together is how things are done.

460,"I'm in an Instagram group chat with a bunch of other girls, and two of the girls there were talking to each other prior for a few years. Occasionally it seems like they're rubbing their relationship in the rest of the chat's faces(probably non intentional but still nonetheless). Example/s:

- We're in an art community where it involves ocs/original characters. One of the girls(I'll call her B) bought the other(I'll call her O) an oc she really wanted but O didn't know until B had to tell her to get her to stop bidding on it. Cue the next 15 minutes of the chat just them sending each other hearts and how much they platonically love each other.

- O is visiting England, where B lives. She found out she'd be visiting her in October maybe? And she'll be seeing her in March/April. The closer we get to the date, the more I see them posting about how much they can't wait to see each other and posting all over their stories how they're gonna hug each other so hard(""cool beans dudes !""). 

- Constant inside jokes. They talk to each other in another dm with just them/ them and B's bf, and sometimes their humour and jokes n shit leak into the main gc. Cool, no one knows what you're talking about, it gets annoying after the 4th time it happens, keep it in your seperate dm. 

Overall, it just seems like they show favoritism towards each other over everyone else. They don't treat anyone else like how they treat each other, and I get it's because they've known each other longer but it just seems inconsiderate at this point. I'm thinking of telling them O(since I've talked to her more often and she tends to reach out more) how I feel about how they act, but at the same time I think I'm being selfish because they've been friends for around 3-4 years, ofc they'd act like this.

461,"1 month ago my brother had a kid with his ""girlfriend"" (they're not actually seeing each other and she doesn't really think to highly of him, I just have no idea what to call her) and over the past couple of months, since we found out about the pregnancy, me and my mum have been getting to know his girlfriend (lets call her Jenny).

Just so you have some context about what the people I'm talking about are like:

Jenny's family are pretty horrible people who have treated her like shit since she was born, she had to be taken away from her family at 14 because of how bad they where but she eventually went back to them and now lives not too far away from them. From first meeting my mum and pretty much every encounter since she has said that my mum is great and that she is glad that she will be part of our family.

My brother is pretty psychotic, hes always had a temper and used to beat me up occasionally when we where younger but I always dismissed this as just what older brothers do. He moved out 2\~ years ago and I don't have much communication with him but my mum tries to keep me up to date with what hes been doing, he struggles to keep a job and doesn't really talk to many of his friends anymore.

My mum has gone through shit to keep us happy, we've been on the brink of poverty and she would still make sure that we where okay with enough food to keep us full and to make sure that we always had a roof above our head. She once told me it got to a point where she would hope that we wouldn't finish all of our food so that she could eat our scraps because of how little money we had. I had no idea how bad we had it when we were younger because she always wanted to make us happy and didn't want us to worry.

&amp;#x200B;

The baby has been a bit ill for a couple of weeks and is being looked after in the hospital, nothing serious apparently but just to be safe they're keeping him there. One day my brother turned up at the hospital completely stoned and (unsurprisingly) the staff at the hospital informed child services about it, they were extremely close to taking the baby away and my mum had to drive him away from the hospital to make sure that the baby would be okay.

My mum was obviously extremely upset with my brother and told him to get his shit together which he wasn't happy about, he told my mum that it was essentially her fault and that if she wasn't such a shit parent then he wouldn't be like he is.

This isn't the first time hes done something like this, once on holiday my mum made a small remark about how she knew that he gave me weed once a couple of years back, my brother thought that I told her and had a go at me saying that he could never trust me with anything, my mum quickly tried to defend me by saying ""it was obvious"" which it probably was, I mean, we lost our dog while smoking and busted in to our house to get my mum to help like, dude wheres my dog? My brother went on a tangent about how shit my mum was at being a parent because of that too.

My mum is usually quite chill about drugs, she does nag my brother about how much he does drugs and has said that she doesn't want me doing drugs but she hasn't really ever had a go at me for smoking that once. Just to note, no one in my family does drugs other than my brother although Jenny and my mum do smoke (not weed).

The shit which my brother has put my mum through is unbelievable and the amount of bullying that he does to people is disgusting, before when my mum was talking to Jenny they talked about how abusive my brother is to both of them (hes not physically abusive but it's still hard to deal with) and they where surprised because they both thought that he was only like that to them and didn't know he was like that to anyone else.

Anyways back to the story.

2 days ago my mum went to see my nephew and Jenny in hospital with my aunt and while they where there Jenny said she hoped she would be out of the hospital in time to go to secret Santa with the rest of the family and said to my mum that she was looking forward to spending Christmas with us, that was the last time my mum has has spoken with her.

Last night after secret Santa my mum got a text from my brother saying that he didn't want my mum to see the baby anymore and that Jenny didn't want to talk to her anymore, additionally I got a phone call off my brother where he said that if I wanted I could go over his for Christmas but that my mum wasn't allowed, my brother has never called me before or ever wanted me in his life so I think he only called me to spite my mum.

Jenny has blocked my mum on Facebook and isn't responding to my mum's calls, my mum thinks that its all her fault that my brother hates her and that she is a terrible parent, I've been trying to comfort her over the past 1 1/2 days but shes so upset and wont stop crying. I don't believe for a second that Jenny doesn't want to talk to my mum anymore and think that my brother has taken her phone or something but I have no idea what to do, I hate seeing my mum like this and my mum thinks shes an even worse parent just for making me upset over how upset she is. She doesn't want to get me involved and she feels shitty that my brothers even trying to get me involved and thinks that this is all her fault for getting me involved.

So what the fuck do I do, do I try to talk to my brother in person to see his side and see if their is anyway of fixing this? Do I try to talk to Jenny to see if she does actually want to cut communications with my mum? Help me.

TL;DR. My brothers a psychopath and I think hes trying to make sure that my mum never sees her grandchild again I need help to try and fix the family before it's too late.",23Dec2018,1

This is because my mom and dad were alcoholics and drug addicts. 

I was also raised an only child, but have three sisters. When it comes to my mom's side of the family, I've always been told that they wanted nothing to do with me when I was a baby, which is why i live with them. But my mom's side of the family took in my older sister and raised her, and were very well off financially at the time they took her in.

Literally for years it was almost radio silence from people like my mom, dad, and her entire side of the family. But when my little sister was born, she was taken in and accepted almost immediately. She is 8 now. We have the same dad. 

But when I was around 12, they started sending me birthday and holiday cards all of a sudden, talking about how they loved and cared about me. And when I was 14 I got to go on their family trip to Disneyland for my little sister's birthday(four days after mine) but only because my mom told me about it and I asked if I could go. 

Now lately they've all been trying to repair their relationship with me and I'm not sure what to do or if I should try. They don't understand me at all, and honestly I feel more like an outcast around them, or like I'm different from them for some reason.

469,"If you struggle with self-destructive tendencies, then you know how insidious, frustrating, emotionally and psychologically demanding and unbelivably frustrating, emotionally-draining and adverse it is to go through such habits day after day, minute after minute, even if it happens when you do not even realise it or when you have been used to that kind of habit for a long time.

And I am one of them and I am frustrated and tired of this bad habit. I do realise that sometimes, the darker side of the human mind can be beneficial (there is a belief that those with higher IQ scores are more susceptible to anxiety, depression and even doubt). Systemic doubt, self-awareness, critical thinking and so on can useful tools to counter or combat against potential ""positive"" qualities if done the extreme or used incorrectly - hubris, arrogance, rage, egocentrism, ignorance, and so on.

(on the other hand, sometimes these things are useful too depending on the context. Nobody likes an angry person but sometimes that anger can be cathartic and makes the person feel more active and assertive than keeping it all in, for example)

But this constant habit of berating myself in every thing that I do, no matter what it is, no matter how much I try, no matter how I do, it is always as if my own Default mode network is already determined or written on stone to turn it against me whether it is through slow, subtle and insidious taunts and nudges of self-doubt and self-criticism, to the most painful forms of constant self-berating and petrifying forms of self-hatred. 

This constant exposure of painful psychological self-harm is annoying and really done harmful because it makes me feel that I am incapable of anything, unable to do anything and incapable of controlling my own body and mind. Most of the time I just want to burst out into a lot of anger and rage because of how frustrating and demanding and painful it is to keep with all of these habits (and more often than not, the efforts of my actions are often lackluster as a result and those said results will even reinforce those self-berating habits and the cycle continues) but even that I am sometimes unable to do so because my mind is constantly berating me, making me unless to express myself; or often try the best I can to contain it all inside like a over-pressured gas canister that is very close to explode (to the point that I want to cry and get angry but cannot feel anything anymore. I try to want to feel something but the more I try, the more I cannot. Maybe it is a learned habit to avoid further emotional harm to the point that my own body and mind have turned to numbness as a result). Or sometimes I am unable to express anything because of the learned habit of internalising everything as if I have zipped my mouth shut from ever saying anything even when I really want to but I somehow cannot as if my own body and mind have adapted to that mentality that a zipper has become a part of my own body and mind.

In the end, this whole storm of emotions and feelings are often painful and agonising and trying your hardest to get out of that situation is even more agonising because it feels as similar as an addict who going through withdrawal. Sometimes the self-destructive pains feel paradoxically like a relief as if hating myself is the only way I will feel that I am in control (even though I do not actually feel like I am in control) like a person who does self-harm and cuts himself because the body release endorphins which are natural pain killers; or because it is the only place I am familiar with, my own adapted mind wanted me (or demands me) to go back to that mental prison again (sometimes this habit goes back and forth so much it is as if I am in learned helplessness mode)

I often feel like I am a prisoner who is unsure whether to plan my escape or not. Sometimes I feel like there are two sides inside me fighting for dominance and control with the superior person being the more controlling and harmful. Often times, I make myself cut off from the rest of the world or end up ruminating or thinking in patterns that I know are pathological and make me stagnant and unable to act or doing anything but end up doing it anyway. 

I am annoyed, tired and most of all, I am angry. Very angry because I cannot take it anymore and for once, even though I really do not like it, this anger seems to be the only thing that is making feel like I am actually doing something or at least even feeling something ",23Dec2018,1

He also hasn't dated or had sex with a girl in almost a couple years, but always talks about girls with my body type.
He graduated last year and doesn't drink often even though he's legal now, but whenever we do he's all over me, and the next day tries to downplay it. I guess my question is, should I try to pursue it, and how? Is there an easy way to show I'm interested? His brother doesn't know we're poly and it might be too much, but he's so attractive it drives me crazy. Any advice accepted lol",23Dec2018,1
482,"Reasons why i suspect this:

About 2 months ago when she moved in I offered her the air mattress to sleep on until she got her own bed. She accidentally popped it and agreed to pay for it (I was borrowing it myself from a family member). Since then not only has she not even asked how much is the bed but she has gotten a new tattoo, a new piecing, bought a bed frame, and made plans to get more piercings.

From giving her my old bed (recently got a new one), to splitting the rent with her, to letting bring her rabbit - I feel like I've done a lot for her that she has been appreciative of.

Her room is unreasonably messy. I've talked to several times about how cleanliness is important for us to avoid pests but no change. I found a roach in my room the other day. We agreed to split chores. For example: take turns doing dishes every week. It's been a week and half since the sink has been full of dishes. She cooks for herself and for others by washing the dishes needs and putting them back in the pile dirty. She leaves trash around the house that could easily be thrown out

Her excuses: I'll do it eventually, I'm super tired after work, I'm sick, I don't wanna ",23Dec2018,1
483,"Close college friend and myself drifted apart naturally and didn't speak for about a year and a half.

2 months ago, friend randomly messaged me asking if I wanted to hang out. I said sure, and we made loose plans to hang that week. When the day came, I didn't hear from her. Being too awkward to message and ask if we were still hanging out that day, I kind of just left it. She never did get in touch, and I ended up not hearing from her again.

Now it's been 2 months and I'm kind of bummed out that we never ended up reconnecting. Feels awkward messaging her though because it's been so long again.

Long story short I want to message her asking to hang out, but don't know if that would be okay at this point. Would it be weird to send her a quick message just saying ""hey man, hang out over the holidays?""

We used to be good friends as kids but I've kind of outgrown him now and so we don't really have anything in common, i try my best to be nice to him but it kind of feels like a one way relationship in that he only ever wants to do stuff that he wants to do, ive tried telling him, hiding, unplugging the internet but he always finds ways round it, one time after i unplugged it he made me go outside to watch it on his phone because it was the only place he could get signal, i try hanging out with everyone else but they encourage him and dont get that i hate doing it.

490,"I have a job that I’ve held down for a few years, but avoid doing anything social with my colleagues.  I am anxious socially to the point I avoid getting to know anyone so I don’t have to feel judged.  It also means I have no connections or networks, and have problems trusting others.  I fear the stigma as being known as the guy who still hasn’t left home in his 30s.  

I do my job ok when speaking to customers since I know they’re not there to talk about me at all (i’m a call centre worker).  But the moment someone in-person asks me how my day has been I do absolutely everything to ensure the conversation doesn’t go anywhere near the “I live with my parents” topic, to the point I shut down the conversation with close ended answers.  I think several steps ahead in avoiding conversations that lead there.  (e.g. if on a break I hear my teammates talking amongst themselves about where they live and going over to each others’ place, I leave the room to ensure I dont get involved with that line of questioning).  Lying about my home life is no longer an option though.  I found that it was hard to maintain the lie. So I just avoid avoid avoid.  If my workplace shut down tomorrow and everyone was made redundant, despite me working there for about a decade (same role, never went higher), there’s no one I’d miss.  Can’t get hurt by a loss if I don’t connect with them!

My parents are always arguing about somesuch crap and they’re not pushing me to go out.  Dad has a gambling problem but with no job can’t lose money anymore.  mum has a hell of a lot on her plate, always has with dad, and I love her but it’s become more of a codependency arrangement with her and me. They’re both getting on in years and I don’t know if mum can handle dad on her own without me around.

But I want to leave.  I don’t have anyone I feel I can trust to discuss moving out of home for the first time (because it means I have to tell them I _live_ at home).   But I feel stagnant.  I feel moving out and learning basic life skills would help me grow.  I can cook my own pre-packages meals off the shelf and do my own laundry.  A lifetime of no socialising means I have some savings to last me a couple of years of renting even without a job.  Sharehousing is completely out in my mind though as I can’t stand the thought of having to deal with people I don’t already trust.  
I feel I am gullible and naive, all stemming from my inexperience at life.  I always think I am going to get screwed over _hard_ when making connections with people.  I wish there was a class for people like me, so I could also be with others learning basic life skills.  And I don’t mean online.  I basically just lurk everywhere online, like a ghost.  I wish there was a “Failure To Launch” class I could attend, so I at least know I am among others stuck in the same boat that hasn’t left port.

My issue is that I am so, so sick and tired of everyone complaining to me about ""having"" to be with their families for the holidays and such. Now the reason I add my age, is because I have found this ridiculous whining is often done by people around my age. These are people who know what I am going through, know this is a holiday I will be spending alone, and know how much pain I am in from losing my husband a few months ago. But somehow still have the audacity to complain about their **choice** to go home and spend the holidays with their family. I don't want to be a jerk, and I don't want people to feel like they can't complain about trivial things (we all do sometimes and that's fine) but it is such an insensitive thing to do to me at this point in my life and I just can't handle hearing about it anymore.

493,"So my sister (22f) and her wife (21f) have been married since March. My sister and I have always been very close. We shared a tough childhood, and so we’re each other’s best friends pretty much.

My sister and her wife (“Madison”) don’t always get along well. They bicker constantly, though my sister assures me that they aren’t like that normally (apparently only when I’m around?). But my issue isn’t with the bickering so much as it is with Madison’s rudeness and put-downs.

Madison often gets short with my sister for silly things, and will scold my sister often. I usually just ignore it, but sometimes she is very mean and I have a hard time keeping my mouth shut. I used to be in a verbally abusive relationship, and the way Madison talks to my sister reminds me of how my ex used to talk to me.

I’ve talked to my sister about Madison before. I tell her that she doesn’t deserve to be talked to that way, but she insists that Madison is just upset for some reason and that she’s in a bad mood. I’ve tried to tell her that’s no excuse for the way she treats her, but my sister continues to defend Madison.

I have a hard time knowing where to draw a line. She’s not beating my sister up or calling her bad names so it’s not as easy and straight-forward to know when to say something. It hurts to see my sister just put up with the things Madison says to her, but I’m often conflicted as to whether it’s any of my business or not. The times where I have said something, Madison gets mad and my sister always comes up with some excuse for Madison’s behavior.

494,"My father and I have had a very strained relationship, stemming from when I was young and he left to Michigan while my mother entered rehab for her drug addiction. Though after a year or two we began to keep contact a couple of times per year.

 After a visit last year in which I was shown only childish and disappointing traits (living with his parents at 41, still going to casinos, not keeping a job for more than two weeks, flaking, being extremely rude to others without remorse) that I did not want to continue on through me, I decided that I was finished answering phone calls just to be berated about the choices I and those around me make.

After I blocked his number he spent nearly a month talking down to my mother about what I’ve done, screaming at her if she’d pick up and insulting her if she wouldn’t through texts. I’ve told her that I don’t think she should bother talking to him, but without much assertion since I don’t know the full extent of what he’s saying towards her.

I’m a high school student, and he recently sent me $100 in a card for Christmas. The money is extremely valuable for me since I don’t have much myself to spare, and he knows this- likely being the reason why he sent it specifically. There was no writing by him in the card.

I’m being told by a majority of people that I would be wrong to not thank him for it. Including my mother, and my grand parents on his side (who I still talk to). I’m worried that doing so would lead him into believing I’m willing to connect with him again.

Would it be incorrect to not thank him for it? If I do should I block him without allowing to reply? If I don’t do that, when would it be correct to block him again? I don’t want to continue contact with him anymore, especially considering how he treats my mother.

Bonus: My grandmother on his side is asking me to thank him for it, what would be the correct response to that?",23Dec2018,1

Hi,

Im a 11 y/o girl currently living with my mum, and 2 younger siblings. I've always liked to be alone at home, but it's hard to be alone now. One of my hobbies is video games, I really like meeting new people on games like fortnite and r6s. My mom doesn't like the fact of me not having real friends, only Internet friends, it's hard to make friends in real life, since I don't know anyone with the same hobbies as me. My mom is strict with bed time, which is 11pm on the weekends and 9 on workdays. 80% of my friends have a different time zone, which makes it hard to talk to them. I've always had a bad self image about myself, but I feel comfortable talking to people on the internet, people dont judge me there. I've always wanted to live with my dad, because I would have anyone bother me since dad is always at work, but he has a new wife who I don't like at all, they have a daughter as well, who I care about alot but my dad's new wife doesn't really like when I go near her. I don't go to my dad's place often because of it, only holidays. My dad cares about me alot, and I care about him as well but he can't see that I don't like his wife at all, so I just keep it to myself. I've been thinking about moving to his house, but at the same time I just think of school and how much work would it be for him, he works at night 60% of the days so it would be too much work for my dad to drive me to school every morning. I don't know what to do, who to talk to or just to something. Can anyone give me advice?",23Dec2018,1
499,"I was thinking about how sometimes rich people pay off layaway accounts at Walmarts near Christmas and it started me thinking about what I would do with that kind of money. I realized I'd like to bail out (nonviolent) people who might be in jail  because they're too poor to pay bail. Sure enough, when I checked the rolls at my county jail there is a man who has been in there for almost 2 months for lack of a $100 cash bail payment, accused of failure to pay child support. If anything is likely to be the ""crime"" of poverty, this sounds like it to me. I was thinking about bailing him out. I have a couple of concerns.

1. If he's been in there for 2 months he's probably lost whatever housing he had: evicted, car's been towed, even if he was homeless before he no longer has his gear. If nobody he knows cares enough about him to collect $100 over the course of many weeks then he likely doesn't even have a friend to stay with. He certainly doesn't have a job. So might he be in an even less safe situation on the street in the winter with no possessions or support system than in jail?
2. I fully assume he would skip bail and I would lose that money; it is an amount I can afford. However, would I be in any way legally responsible for him if/when he does that?

Is this a bad idea? Should I just give $100 to a related charity (I have one in mind if I go that way)?",23Dec2018,1

507,"So I'm beginning to start a proper career as a writer. For the last decade, I've gone by a nickname. For the sake of this post, let's say my full name is Annabeth Wright and I've been going by Anna Wright. This nickname has followed me through a small stint as an entertainer: regional acting, a gig here and there at renn faires, through several short films, and is just a name I feel comfy with. I intended to keep my nickname/acting professional name as my pen name when I started sending things out to contests and submissions.   


Then this thing called the Blacklist comes out for this year. It's a list of scripts sent in that are the most popular unproduced scripts out there. It's basically a huge step to getting an agent (if you don't already have one) or a film produced. I skim the list of screenwriter names and. . . That's when I see Anne Wright.   


It's not exactly the same. Technically, I can still register in the guild with no issue. The rule is you can't have the exact same name, not that you can't have one that's similar. The problem is this: what if we get confused for one another? 

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it, I've got 3 options. 1. Stick with Anna Wright. It's not against guild rules.  2. Go with my initials, A.N. Wright, which are taken by a small time author and tbh sounds kind of clunky as a name. 3. Go by ""AA,"" my childhood nickname, be A.A. Wright instead. It's sweet and sentimental - plus, it'd probably help avoid any initial bias in the genre I'm shooting for, which is well known for being sort of cruddy to women.

Friend got into a relationship a few months ago (maybe 5-6? Idk the exact time frame since he hid it for a bit) and as things progressed it's become obvious this girl has only caused him problems, we (our whole friend group) would help him come to a solution with ""this week's problem"" and that's continued for a while, and recently it started happening more than once a week. She has been pressuring him to marry her and have a kid. Things have gotten to a point where he feels he has to hide our conversations from her. She said something to him about him needing to make sacrifices so that they can have the money for a kid she's pressuring him to have. Today he came to us and was talking about selling off his steam account to one of us for some money and we all kinda jumped in and said, no we aren't and that he should leave her because she's been nothing but trouble for him. Getting mad at him for fixing his car instead of getting a new one, getting mad at him for doing things he values and it seems like he's been broken.

512,"Hey new to this reddit but wanted to get others advice on a thought I have . I Live in Glasgow and for years I have walked to work past the same people and seen the same faces and unfortunately these faces are homeless people, its only a five minute walk and in that five minutes I see at least 6 different people with their sleeping bags looking like they have just given up with everything , I watch as people just walk past them not looking in their direction, forgetting that they are human beings going through such a hard time , these same judgmental people have no idea why they are there , what got them there and just don’t stop to think about it . Unfortunately I am one of those people , well I am hoping to say I used to be. I walked past a young person maybe 20ish today  and on their board at the top I said  “please don’t judge me because I am homeless” , I didn’t read anymore was too busy Christmas shopping . I carried on shopping for a few more hours and headed back to go home but the top line stuck with me throughout my day and when I was heading back they were still their. I went in my pocket to gave some money as I know they need it but I felt as though giving money wasn’t enough . They were grateful of course but ultimately still homeless , still going through the same shit , still having to sleep in the freezing cold on the hard ground and with people walking by ignoring them as if they are contagious as most of us stuff our faces and swap presents throughout the Christmas period and this has really stuck in my mind .I Came home and had a thought which is . What would you do coming up to Christmas . I have a wife and 4 young children and I thought of going back to the person with the board and asking if they wanted to join for Christmas dinner my only concern ( me being judgmental I suppose ) I have 4 young children and a wife . I don’t know this person I have never spoke to them but bringing a stranger into my home is a concern not because they are homeless but it’s a stranger , 

I just don’t want to be that person that just walks past anymore don’t want to be that judgemental guy but finding it hard to be honest as all that goes through my head is what if .. . But that top line on the board is really made me think

I'll keep it short but this post has a few moving parts, and I'm rushing because it is happening right now.

 It's daily. We live in a house split into 2 units (upper and lower), my partner and I live in the upper unit with 2 cats and have for almost 3 years (landlord changed this past year), the neighbours came when the new landlords did) The bottom unit is WT, MT, Son, and Baby and it has been extremely loud every day since. I have called the police twice because I honestly thought the kids or SOMEONE was being abused the house as there was non-stop banging for probably a solid hour and screaming and yelling. That's not even the first instance of that but I was worried.

 I have PTSD from past abuse and the constant banging and crashing (as I said - daily - and multiple times a day) sends a spike of adrenaline to my heart each time and makes my stomach clench. The kicker is the second time I called the police, a few days later WT happened to be at my boyfriends work and confronted him at work and said, ""Can your girlfriend stop calling the cops on us? I already have Child Services on my ass"" to which he explained my PTSD and she said it was her Son banging and screaming (Note- My Partner works at a video game store... She was there buying Son a game) and had the audacity to say ""At least [video game] will keep him quiet for a while""... Like WTF? You reinforce his bad behaviour by giving a distraction not any sort of discipline?

 I won't complain about the baby crying and screaming, that's normal, but I don't know what to do. If her kid has behavioural problems that aren't being fixed, calling the police has done nothing and my landlord has said when we told him, ""Theres nothing we can do, call the police next time it happens"" (otherwise the landlord is very sweet, I don't want to paint him in a bad light). It's house shaking type destruction going on down there and I have no idea what to do. It feels weird talking to them, the first time I tried I was walking by and said hello and smiled, WT and MT BOTH didn't say anything, wave, or even smile back. Justs scowled and stared.

What can I possibly do? The only advice I can find online is for the upstairs neighbours being loud, not vice-versa.",23Dec2018,1
519,"Backstory: So here’s the situation. I hate my upstairs neighbors. When I moved in 6 months ago I didn’t expect the walls to be paper thin. It’s a two flat and the upstairs neighbors have 4 ghetto ratchet jerks who blast music all throughout the night at the randomnest times. They smoke weed also and it’s bad weed and can be smelt through the vents. I’ve knocked on their door before at 5am to turn their shit down but they never came to the door.  They also slam the door extremely loud like they want me to hear it.

Anyways what happened was I took molly this weekend. When I got home I was just chilling but it’s funny cause mdma makes your dick shrink. I was in my room, and I took a ruler and measured my flaccid penis for fun and 5 seconds after I did it I heard laughter like hyenas upstairs. Heard movement like dude telling his buddies some funny shit that happened. And more laughter. Thing is I have one window on the end of my bed. with a curtain but maybe a camera could see through the side? I was looking for holes in the wall but can’t find one, and if there was it would be extremely small. I don’t know. It was silent for a good while and then right after I whip my dick out and the ruler the laughter comes... it doesn’t feel like a coincidence. Please help me read this situation correcty",23Dec2018,1

521,"My aunt invited me over to attend a Christmas gathering dinner thing with my mom's grandma's side of extended family but no farther than that. My dad won't be there because he's been married to someone else for a long time and isn't close to my mother at all anymore.

In the past I used to be weird and a bit wack sometimes I'd be uncool as far as I can remember but that was a long time ago. The only reason I know I'm the family outcast is because we had a gathering for the first time last year and I was on my own smoking weed. I'm not complaining though it'd be nice to be close to family like normal people I suppose. 

I've been an outcast my whole life and because of this I'm not good in social situations at all, I don't know how to react most of the time and it interactions feel fake unless we're close. I have nothing going for me, I dropped out of high school, have had one job for a month and another for a week, and recently got arrested. I don't live with family. Despite all this I'm still kept up with the time, events, and news I just don't know how to not seem weird. ",23Dec2018,1
