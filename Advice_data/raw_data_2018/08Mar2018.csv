0,"I live at home I’m 23 and have no real direction and it terrifies me. I know i ain’t the only one who feels this way so there’s solace in that, but it still doesn’t change my situation. 

I live in the suburbs in SoCal but want some change. I feel like i’ve been babied by my parents and want to come into my own. See who i am when I’m on my own. 

Problem is that I don’t want to be alone though. I always envisioned myself living with my good friends but post high school my friend group just started slowly dwindling. 

So now i feel like my options are to just do craiglist randos, however there isn’t really a goal I’m chasing. I wouldn’t be moving for a job, it’d be just cause. I have an associates in accounting (no real interest in taking it further) and very little money. 

Any advice on what to do? Has anybody been in this position before? ",08Mar2018,3
2,"I am a white Canadian, raised Christian (barely) but am pretty much Atheist. My fiances family is from Guyana, but her and her siblings were born in Canada. They were raised Hindu, but like me, she is pretty much Atheist aswell. We will be doing a Hindu wedding, completely by her parents demand, even though we would rather have a small, ceremony and party, no religion. We are doing the wedding her parents way since they are paying, and totally insist. It is just easier than starting a fight, and I am able swallow my pride (beliefs?) for a couple days. 

However, I have been thinking about the future, and the children we plan to have one day. I have never wanted to raise my children with religion, and never planned on christening/baptising them. However, I know her parents will want to do the Hindu version of this.

How do I tell them that neither my fiance or myself want this, without it becoming an issue? 

edit: So you know how her parents feel about their ways/culture.... when they discovered she was dating me, they kicked her out of the house, and didn't speak to her for months. They called me some very nasty names in the process, and even tried to lock her out of their house to prevent her from getting her things. Since then things have settled down and we all get along.... but it makes me worry about future confrontations.",08Mar2018,6
3,"So this is going to be a long one. I am a former electrical engineering student who now got admission in Architecture school. I couldn't keep up with the grades so I had to change my path. 
There are a few problems I have, I don't know if they are related or not but here they are: 
1. I have no friends and I don't call my family often ( so I am alone)
2. I have porn addiction.
3. I have addiction to some games. 
4. My talking skills are not good.
5. I have a crappy part time job.
6. I am overweight ( lost 10 kg last year but I think I gained it again)


I want to be a better person but don't know how. I spend 20 hrs at home. I try to change but can't. ",08Mar2018,2
4,"Some background: I grew up in an environment where it was hard to get out of the house and gain a lot of experiences. This was in part due to my family's style but also because when I was a kid I was anxious and didn't know anything else. I mostly stayed home, did schoolwork, and watched TV. When I was 17, I started going to community college and it took me until 19 to start to come out of my shell and become more independent. But some problems were that I didn't have much direction in life because I had no friends and no network, and therefore no information and I didn't know where to look. I finally decided to major in Computer Science when I was 21, and started developing skills like finding good resources, etc. Since then, I've transferred to a good school but some things like being overweight and having poor study habits have kept me from finishing my bachelor's.

Flash forward to now, I just need a handful more of classes, but I won't be finishing my bachelor's until the end of this year when I turn 26. And when I look at this, this feels extremely daunting and depressing. I'm disappointed at myself for being so lost in life. I have no social skills (never had any friends or relationships), no work experience, and it feels like I've been trying to catch up in life since forever. It feels like I can tell myself that I've only been on a positive slope, but it feels too little too late. I've tried to ""man up"" and just get my stuff together but when I think about myself a couple months from now, trying to apply for an internship as a 26 year old with no experience it feels absolutely dreadful. Is there any hope for me?",08Mar2018,8

6,A few weeks ago my football coach (who also coaches lacrosse) asked me to play lacrosse during the spring. I’ve never played lacrosse but I thought I should try it out because a lot of people have told me i would like it. Well after a couple of  practices I absolutely hate it. I don’t have any passion for it like I do with football and I don’t want to continue doing it. I already have sprained my knee from practice. I talked to my parents and they agree that I should quit. I am just not sure / nervous to talk to my coach because he coaches football and I feel as if he will think I am a quitter. Does anyone have any advice on how I can tell him I don’t wanna play anymore? ,08Mar2018,2
11,"I (18) am 158 days clean from using drugs. I have gone to rehab and done all of the programs to get out there but I also suffer from depression and anxiety and have self harm issues and have had a few suicide attempts. I am in a relationship with a girl (17) that I used to like a lot over laat summer and was trying super hard to date her but she wouldn't date me because of all the substances I was using. Even though she is prescribed xanax for anxiety and smokes weed nearly everyday. 

A few weeks ago she sent me a text asking about how proud  she is of me for getting sober and how much she misses me. I responded and said we could chill as long as she didn't use any drugs when we hungout or get super fucked up before we hungout. We ended up chilling and having alot of fun and hooking up just oral stuff. We then hungout two days later and hooked up again but afterwards she had a flashback from when she was raped. It was a very intense situation and i did not know what to do I couldn't comfort her at all she was just screaming and crying. I had to restrain her from self harming. The flashback lasted about 45 minuites and then she just kinda snapped back to being her normal self.

We are both suicidal and suffer from many mental health issues but we get along very well. The issue is one of us is always trying to cheer up the other one often and it's usually me trying to help her. My anxiety has gotten much worse since I took on this responsibilty. But I love hanging out with her and really enjoy talling to her when she isnt losing her shit and im not losing my shit. We have chilled a few more times and nothing bad happened but my friends don't think she is a good influence on me. Im not sure if I should keep seeing her its really hard to not because we with both be hurt if we stop talking and we make each other geniunly happy which neither of us rarely are. 
Also she's about a 9/10 and being generous im maybe a 7 at best.

12,"I'm a 23 year old guy. I've been to therapy for many years and take psyche meds.

Recently I asked out one of my classmates. Well, we first went out to a bar and then things sort of fizzled out. I then asked her out for coffee and she said sure. And then I never heard from her again. I could tell she wasn't interested.

The other day I walked past her and she completely ignored me.

I don't know why, but I have this extreme anger. I feel like I'm going to blow up. I feel like punching her or slapping her. Or spitting on her.

Now, I know all of these things are horrible and I shouldn't do them.

But why do I feel so compelled to do such a thing? Yes, I've been rejected by women countless times. No big deal. But this person just makes me ferouciously angry. I feel so angry at her rejecting me. I know she is entitled to her feelings. I know not everyone is going to like you. But I still can't escape from these feelings of anger.

I stay far away from her. And yet, it just keeps popping back into my head, this anger I have towards her. I feel so furious.

And it's starting to scare me. I'm so scared I might do something. I've been staying away from alcohol. What seems to keep me grounded and sane is marijuana. Everytime I smoke, I realize all my anger is stupid and I should just move on. But when I'm sober, I just feel this massive anger against her.

I feel so ashamed of my thoughts and feelings. I can't believe I feel this way towards a woman. It's so pathetic and shameful. And I think maybe I get off on that shame? I don't know.

I do go to therapy. I do tell my therapist all this, and yet I can't seem to find a solution.

I don't know how to stop feeling so angry and bad all the time. I wish I could just move far far away and forget this person. But I still keep feeling angry that she rejected me so coldy and shittily. 

I just feel like a really bad person and I don't know what to do. I know she did nothing wrong and that I'm the bad person in this story. ",08Mar2018,2
13,"I have my mindset on moving out but I have a few questionable predicaments. 
(LONG POST)
I am a hispanic girl moving out of my very strict mother's home. I will be 23 next month. Full time student. Part time job. Divorced Parents.

I am planning to move out with my boyfriend. Financially, we have sufficient money coming to support ourselves. He has lived on his own for almost 4 years. Dated him for 3 of those years.

Here's the major problem: 
I cheated on my boyfriend a few months ago with guys online. He asked me to stop and I said no. Upset, he one up'd me by bring a girl over to his house. We broke up for two months and saw other people. Thinking he never wanted to be with me again, I told my mom everything (minus me cheating). We started talking again in January, and have gotten back together ever since. 
When I told my mom I was talking to him in January, she kicked me out. (In the spur of the moment, I forgot my house keys) Yet, because of my father, he told me to go back home and put up with my mother.
I do not have a good relationship with my mom. I understand she got upset to protect me and when I told her I cheated on him, she didn't believe me. All my friends knew and even my older brother. 
My boyfriend has told me that I have to be serious about being with him and moving in... he told me that if I pull that stuff again, he wants nothing to do with me.

My mom told me when I left that, if I leave, I am not welcomed back home.

So,  I plan to move out in two weeks.
I have been planning since February. My boyfriend made an expense plan, and time schedule.

Am I making the right choice???

14,"Hey guys, I work with a girl who I took interest in quite a while ago (btw, were both girls). I feel like there's something between us, but I'm absolutely unsure - I've never been in a position where I had to ""flirt"". My last relationship was very abusive and since then I lost my confidence when it comes to women, so I'm not sure if I read the signals wrong. I'll make it short for you guys:
She rubs her legs against me 
Aims for a lot of body contact 
Texts me pictures of herself 
Starts writing, deletes and writes something short
Brings me coffee at work to my desk 
Does that sound flirty to you? It sounds to me but please keep in mind after my last relationship I completely lost any sense for relationships. 
So now I'm asking you guys: what should I do? We're going to a club with (my) friends this weekend. I've not really reacted or done anything so far, and it's been going on for some time.

My(14/F) best friend(15/F) and I started high school in August and since school started my friend has been having a lot of issues getting her work done. I’ll organize this in pleasant points below: 

• We’ve known each other since Pre-K and she’s extremely intelligent

• She did well in elementary school but starting having slumps and procrastination issues in sixth grade 
• Slumps got worse in seventh grade
•She hit eighth grade and failed the fuck out of one class(Earth Science) And procrastination issues got worse 
• We hit high school and the procrastination takes over and her grades go down the toilet
•Her grades make her depressed
•She says when she looks at work it hurts her head
•She is in therapy and is on meds but neither seem to be helping (Says the meds make her feel nothing)
•Her Mom is not helping by constantly yelling at her and just not being supportive. At all.
•Today she texted me saying she was sobbing and having a panic attack over her grades and work and then went silent; her boyfriend and I freaked the fuck out but she turned out to have calmed down, prompting me to make this post.

So yeah. Can I have some advice on how to help her? I really want her to beat this because she’s very bright and passionate about music. Help me please! Thank you!

18,"I recently came to the realization that I may have Obsessive Love Disorder. A personality disorder stemming from abandonment issues and low self esteem.

I recently began talking to a girl i really admired. She was a very accomplished person in spite of several obstacles she had encountered over the years. I admired that she was a strong, positive and kind individual. I began to chat with her on facebook. We'd joke and opened up about personal problems we were having. She opened up about an abusive relationship she as leaving and I opened up about how I was struggling to help an old friend of mine who was suicidal. The conversations we had were very deep. She got me to stop smoking weed which i never thought was possible and invited me to her church. It seemed like a healthy friendship was forming. 

But as time went on I leaned on her too much for my own comfort. I had the habit of texting her while i was at work because it helped me deal with a job i hated. I depended on her contact to keep my mood happy, which i now see was unhealthy and unfair. Eventually I confessed romantic feelings for this girl, she reminded me that she had left an abusive relationship recently and didnt see me that way. She said it was no longer a good idea to open up to me because i'd confuse my feelings (she was right)

I'm not proud of it but as i struggled to help my friend I continued to try to contact this girl. Even after she explained all that to me. I was in some kind of denial. I was addicted to the reassurance i got from talking to her. Like talking to her was this confirmation that I was worth something or there was something positive in my life. It was very selfish and foolish. But this is how bad I was.

One day I messaged her and she gave me a one word reply. It trigger anxiety in me at work so strong i felt like i was going to break down crying at work. I didn't understand what was happening to me. I thought that maybe the stress from helping my suicidal friend was bleeding into everything else but it wasn't. It was me being obsessive and NEEDING reassurance.

At this point I was falling deep into a depression, i was definitely completely drained from helping the friend i mentioned. I had spent 6 hours one day getting him into a rehab while at the same time having to try to understand that i need to leave this girl the fuck alone. I felt this need to explain to her what i was going through, that i wasn't being myself. Maybe i really thought it was the stress from helping my friend or maybe im such a piece of shit that i used his problems to justify me bothering this poor girl so often. I'm still trying to understand it.

after my friend was finally getting professional help i was debilitatingly depressed. I talked to my family members about everything going on and it was my mother in california that finally explained to me that i was being obsessive toward this girl. 

After all that shit, after all the times the girl told me she needed space i was BARELY realizing that it was me being obsessive. That it was me being a toxic person. I was in some kind of denial I think. there was also a post on here that told me the same thing. But the night my mom explained that to me I realized that if i cared about this girls well being i needed to remove myself from her life. And i did, I deleted her off of facebook and instagram. I sent her a message saying I recognized that i was crossing a boundary that i shouldn't. I explained that if i keep seeing her photos on facebook i'll want to talk to her, that m romantic feelings werent going away and that she didn't need me trying to talk to her when she didnt want to talk to me. I explained the best i could at the time and im not sure if she understood what I was trying to say. But I left. even then a week later, seeking reassurance again i tried to apologize, hoping i didnt hurt her feelings by leaving. 

She said she 'didnt know what i could possibly have to say to her' and said to leave her alone. again i recognized i was doing bad and felt ashamed of myself. so i deleted her number, i told her i was deleting her number. and i havent talked to  or seen her since. i kow if i try to find any loopholes to try to talk to her it will be a stalkerish thing to do. ire fuse to do that and dont ever want to make her feel unsafe. it hurts that i turned into this. i feel like a monster honestly. 

But I think/hope i did the right thing by removing myself, it would have been better to just leave her alone but clearly there's something going on with me psychologically. I'm not proud of it, i dont want to keep that part of me. Its been unusually hard to let go. I catch myself thinking ""maybe i can apologize and she'll be my friend again"" but i have to remind myself that being obsessive is the worse thing for her. and I NEED to fix this part of me. Its so bad I wake up from dreams that I was talking to her or texting her. Its so fucked up.

I'm going to see a therapist soon, but i'm struggling with a lot of depression and anxiety as i await the appointment. This situation makes me feel like some kind of creep. The vision I have of myself right now is far from flattering. Yet a step to fixing this is somehow supposed to be learning to love myself from what ive read.

given all this information i need to know how to let go and move on. and more importantly i need to fix my low self esteem and abandonment issues so that it doesn't happen again. i want very much to change, i do not want to be the person i just described ever ever again. If anyone on here has had a similar self struggle and has had any bit of success in getting over this obsessive behavior, that clingy need for constant reassurance... please tell me what helped you change. because i want very badly to change. I'm not proud that i have this toxic insecure side of me and as horrible as it sounds i need help in learning how to let go. I dont think that friendship is salvagable but the thoughts cross my mind to try to rekindle it. which is obviously a bad idea. 

I need advice on how to forget, move on and improve who I am so this doesn't happen anymore",08Mar2018,3
19,"I apologize if this is not the right sub for this. I don't know what a more appropriate one would be.

This did not happen tonight. It happened two nights ago. The most I've done since the incident is doze off a dozen times an hour until it's time for work at 5:00am.

7:30pm two nights ago I was just settling in at home after work. I am temporarily hosting a family member of mine to get her back on her feet - she went outside to have a smoke. As soon as the door closed, I heard rapid gunfire. It was loud. It was close. She rushed back inside hysterical and crying. I grabbed her by the arm and put her in the safest place I could think of - the laundry room between my washer and dryer (the only place that would be walled off a second time compared to the rest of the open-floor style apartment). I blocked her in and called 911. 

The horrifying part is the time it took. It took 8 rings for someone on the other end of 911 to pick up, and the time between the rings felt like an eternity. After they took my information...they said goodbye and hung up. An officer called and was getting verbally angry because nobody was answering the door he was pounding on... which was in a **different** apartment complex all together. 

Come to find out, someone had gone onto their balcony and fired off an entire magazine from their pistol. Security found shell casings on the ground and turned it into the police. The complex management denies anything happening, with a TL;DR version of ""We didn't find evidence, we have no proof anything happened"". That means this psycho is still in the apartment next to me. 

I can't calm down and I feel so uneasy. My desk is right next to the window and the way this apartment is laid out there's no other place for it, which makes it so uncomfortable to be at my desk. I still have 1/4th of my lease left (3 months). Breaking lease early would be the equivalent cost of 6 months rent plus a lost deposit.

20,"I went to Mexico and made a complete idiot out of my self. The third day we were day drinking (I’d already told my best friend that I can’t handle tequila, but his response was “Fuck it it’s Mexi”) and I’m a girl so I’m a light weight. 
So fast forward I’m 8 shots deep and I’m blacking out. My friend gets mad when I black out so I don’t know if I was subconsciously trying to hide it but I started saying “my diabetes is acting up” (I do not have diabetes nor do I have any recollection of this) I was falling over and throwing up and sticking vehemently to my diabetes story apparently. 
My best friend is so pissed at me and I do not blame him. When he told me this happened, I WAS SO EMBARRASSED that I felt like crawling out of my own skin. I have no memory of it which makes it even worse because people probably think I am so fucked up to fake diabetes (when actually I had no clue what was going on.) Will I ever live this down?

26,"Hypothetical situation:

Some high-school students thought it would be cool to rent an apartment near their school. These students are juniors and plan to rent this apartment for the next year (when they would be seniors). One of these students would turn 18 over the summer before senior year, allowing him to rent the apartment under his name.

The purpose of this apartment would be to throw parties. These students plan to have tailgates at the apartment before every football game on Friday, and throw parties afterwards. They also plan to throw parties on Saturdays when there is no game.

This apartment will be financed through their fellow seniors (and some juniors who they think are cool). A large group of 'members' to this apartment club will pay low monthly rates (about $15/month) to remain in the club. A cover charge could also be instituted for party visitors who are not members. Students would likely also sometimes skip classes to come here.

I posted this on r/legaladvice and got negative feedback (potential blow-backs through getting evicted, or even suing the parents). One of the major concerns was noise complaints, so I came up with this solution:

What if we didn't throw any parties here, we just threw kickbacks? (A kickback is a low-key get together where a small group of people are just hanging out, perhaps watching a game. Really more of a pre-game type thing, and no loud music or huge crowds like a legit party)

This way, there would be no risk of getting a noise complaint, and the landlord might not even know we were throwing these kickbacks.

What are your thoughts on the idea? If we ignore the fact that this is probably a terrible idea and is bound to get us in trouble, how can what ideas to you have for setting this up with the least risk? What steps should we take to make this happen?",08Mar2018,2

Lately, shes mentioned that her mood is really bad and that suicide seems ""friendlier"" and tha shes deeper in the hole than she was last year. Im really really worried about her. Obvioisly, i dont want to kill herself, but i dont know what, if anything, i can do all the way from California.

I'm 21 and a girl. 

These days I spend days hiding. Avoiding doing things, going out. Skipping class a lot because existing is hard. I’ve finally rationalized that I truly, deeply am an affront to humanity. 

Even making the proper psychiatrist/psychologist appointments are a huge task for me. Just going there is a huge task and it doesn’t make me feel any better, honestly…because…hey. They don’t label it as BDD because it truly is that bad for me. 

I do not know how to reconcile the daunting fact that I might be so ugly and messed up looking that I may attract attention. Being an object of disgust is horrible! 

There is many types of ugly I’d say. Many cute types for sure…then…I don’t know. The type that people are actively offput by. I think I’m that. Especially for a girl. Because I look unhealthy and unyouthful, somehow, as well as creepy, probably. :/

So I'll talk about my experiences for context here. Totally optional but I wanted to be open, skip to the end if you're not into this. I just want to lay down how I know what I know, etc.  

~~~

Anyways, let me start early on. 

When I was a teenager, happy but oblivious, I had confidence.

Reaffirmed by always being called smart and effortlessly acing every class, kept afloat by random compliments about one thing or another...it was the only time in my life I got them. Beautiful hair, beautiful eyes—even had a few other girls obsessed with them. Grandpa said that I was good looking but would be stunning if I lost a few pounds. Others said, rather meanly, that if I didn’t have my blemishes I’d be almost pretty. I thought there wasn’t that much wrong with the way I actually looked.
Turns out I aged incredibly poorly in the 5 years after this. But I’m getting ahead of myself. 

I never dreaded the outside world or being looked at. I just was. Except, I had no reason to be content because I was actually very awkward, a fashion disaster, had terrible skin, and gave out all the wrong vibes.

Was called “creepy” when I – scared out of my mind – went to the front of class for a presentation. By a girl that…literally went out of her way to talk to me so many times before.

Was cornered by a bunch of bald, oddly pale guys and asked “hey when you gonna shoot up the school??” oh my god… 
But I didn’t think anything of it till later. 

Prom. The beginning of my downward spiral. The point where I realized something was wrong with me. 

My friend introduced me to what she said was the kindest girl she ever knew…and this person? A sweet beauty. She shot down all the self-deprecating things I said, called me a lovely, pure-looking heart breaker. I wasn’t wearing any make-up besides my foundation, nor was my hair done. Was just wearing a nice blue, flowing dress. 

And for the first time in my life…I got male attention there. But something felt wrong.
The sweet girl found me again weeks later at school, cringed in disgust, and said “you looked…different.”
Turns out that I only looked so good because everything there was a bit dim. Or so that’s my theory. 

Night and day. One smooths away my imperfections, the odd lines of my face. The other is unforgiving. Yes, yes. I know. Everyone's flattered by good lighting but with me it's downright absurd. 

When I went into college my confidence flaked away and I begun to connect the dots. For a long time I had blamed being forever alone on being a tad shy, fat (0-20), with bad skin but…this year, 21? 

I lost 40 pounds and now I’m at 147. Other girls envy the f--- out of my “beautiful bombshell long legs” and my perky, big chest. However, my dormmates who said that I was fine at 190 are still saying the same thing. That I’m at my best, aggressively trying to make me stop losing weight even though I’m still a tad too stout (5”6). Bit of a belly. Poor waist definition. Chubby as sin arms. 

Basically they make me worry that my face is just getting more f’ed up  looking. After all the plumpness is supposed to make you look younger, right?   Why are they so against me losing weight? 

So. Basically. Outside of the “dim” context I still have never been hit on by any guy. I’m a girl and I’ve never been hit on…
I’m eternally struggling with my skin and I don’t know why but I basically always look… f’ed up. Like a smoker or something? I’ve gotten that comment twice. Online. So not only do I have red scars, I have tired-looking, droopy skin. And it certainly doesn’t help that I constantly feel horrible and fatigued.  

As for other issues…red/dark marks, sallow skin, nasolabial folds. The nasolabial area is a huge problem—for whatever reason it’s a straight, vaguely defined line and for whatever reason it seems like there’s a deposit of fat on my lower cheek that’s aggravating the problem. I have otherwise rather poor cheek volume. 

I’ve been taking care of my skin for 2 years now and diligently. The acne and smoothness has improved…but yup. I still look like a person who doesn’t give a f----. Even though I spend hours giving f---s. Intensive skincare regimens that without, my skin gets several times worse.

Anyway.  
Now for more recent events. I remember sitting on a log at the foot of a beachside cliff in the early evening. Every guy passing by, often hot as sin, smiled, or was concerned for me, offering me help, and all said “hey”. Random guys. Talking to me. And I was in an oversized t-shirt btw. Never in my life had stranger guys actually talked to me, been so friendly. The vibe was just so…so…different. Like I was being acknowledged.

Again. All because it was dim out. 

Oh. Another guy I knew? Saw me in dim lighting and said “Oh my god, you look so refreshed and…younger. Did you get highlights?” I didn’t.  It was just the lighting. 

I have a lot of experiences where I suddenly look hot and guys aggressively try flirting with me. All…in dim, flattering lighting. 

~~~

Then out of  this context, in normal bright lighting, I’ve gotten nothing but odd, sometimes unsettled-looking stares. People turning 180 degrees in their seats (like on the bus or in class) just to gawk at me. Baristas stopping their work.  During an overcast day, a guy walking by me giving me a look of disgust. (I smell very nice btw)…. 

Very, very unnatural occasions for someone to look at me or give me those kind of looks, basically. They have to go out of their way to do that.  

It isn’t like I look at people first. I really don’t. Then I’ll meet their stares and sometimes they’ll awkwardly gaze back – especially if they’re a guy and don’t give a f--- - or look away.  

The worst part is that I can’t even say I’m stunning or something. I’ve gotten some negative feedback. 
My best friend of my entire life…she had never insulted me before but I accidentally said something that annoyed her and she said “oh no, _____, you NEED to wear makeup. Your undereyes remind me of Oprah’s, they scare me sometime.”She meant it, too. And she’s a very anti-makeup, au-natural person. Yup. 

So I got confirmation from a friend that I actually do have a huge problem. One that even she can’t overlook. Taking a close look, it appears like my undereyes are kind of hollow and the eye area is weirdly gray/dark. The eyelid droops a lot more than it used to. 
I look so very…sickly. Again I feel that way. 

There is a slight chance that another guy loved hanging out with me but allegedly said “I could never date her, too severe of a jaw. Shame.” Wow. Singling something out makes it seem like some huge deformation…

~~~

Now. Am I nitpicking out all the negative experiences? Nope. I’m not. Let me tell you about the first and only time I’ve been complimented since high school (aside on my legs/chest by other girls).  

This year…One time sitting under shade waiting for the bus two adorable little girls ran up to me and told me, “Hey miss, you’re so pretty!!” And they hugged me…and later on their grandma said “but wow. You’re beautiful.” It was the first time in my entire miserable life anyone had 
ever called me beautiful. 

So. Yeah. Shade. 

Compare to 3 years ago when…I was working with my friend at a boys and girls club and was standing outside in the overcast weather, and a boy guessed me and my friend’s ages. I was “5000 years old” while my friend was “21”, perfectly accurate. He liked us just about the same. 

~~~

So. Chances are…I actually look incredibly fucked up to the point of being a circus sideshow attraction, as well as much older than my age. I know what it feels like to be an attractive person and by god that’s not how people treat me normally…

And in the past year the burn of being alone has worn away at me because, hey, I know what it feels like to have a deep, electric connection with someone. 

For a school project I had to actually get into contact with this famous, incredibly successful attractive person who will stay unnamed…and I made a friendship with him online. We talk for hours for a time sometime. Known one another for many months now and he still goes out of his way to talk to me.  

“Wait, ____...I still don’t get it…you saying that you’ve never had any romantic encounters? But I’ve never had so much fun with someone in my life. Not even sure if I’ve ever had a better connection with anybody either, at least platonically. I don't get it...” 

Man, has he gone on about it a lot. And surprise, surprise. He shows it. We have shared endless laughs and good times together. We know everything about one another too--we just click. There's no ulterior motives to our friendship, it just is, we talk about anything and share our lives. And it’s true. I can be a charismatic person over text or voice but…I guess the way things have gone have made it hard to show this side of myself in real. In fact I’d say I’m quite tense most of the time. Haven't even had one good conversation with a guy in real because, well, there's never been a solid chance. Or an invitation to. There's that and I'm...terrified of being a bother or scaring someone...I'd prefer to be alone forever then take that risk. 

I even have a complex where despite the weight loss and arguably improved acne, I've even gotten worse. 
So...you can say to me that I could improve but basically I've gotten it in my head that there's no improving. That I'm stuck. And I have no idea how to reconcile looking like this. I really don't. I look so awful and unhealthy and...just everything...

34,"So a little back story, I have lived in this house for 3 years. During those three years i have seen the normal increase of 3% a year. Over the summer last year my leasing company was purchased by a company that's less than ""invitational"". 

My lease is set to expire in a little more than two months. I just got the renewal prices and there is an increase of 14.64% over last year! I know there are no laws that govern how much a landlord can increase the rent. But GOD DAMN!

 I have a three bedroom house and its just me and my dogs. This house is cheaper than,many single bedroom apartments in the area. 250 yards away from the house, they are building a new highway that isn't set to be completed until 2021. 

Can I negotiate with tue leasing company? I mean they have a damn monopoly in the united states so they can probably just bully me around. 

Should I stay? I can afford the increase, but my entire raise will have to go directly to the increase. Im so frustrated right now.

Do i have any other options?


Here is an email I sent to the leasing company:

Javier,
Let me start out with a blunt question. Are you kidding me? You are trying to raise the rent of my  property 14.6%? Do you not know that they are building a new highway less than 250 yards away from this property? A project that isnt set for completion until 2021? A project that makes even the shortest daily commutes from this property difficult? Did you not know that SRP just sent out a letter saying that there will be limited access to the street, sidewalks and even driveways for the next SIX months on the street this property is located on effective March 14th. I should be getting a rent decrease! Is this how this company treats a long time resident? Does your company always raise the rent 14.6% a year? I knew this day would come, but I was expecting a normal 2-3% to cover inflation. I would like to speak with someone as this is clearly a mistake on your end. 

Please call me at 480 xxx x5x4 any time this week from 8 to 7:30 so we can discuss this. If this is truly what your company increases the rent every year, I refuse to stay. I have never missed a rent payment. Never have I been late on a rent payment. Rent had always been paid on or before the 1st of the month. And this is how i am repaid. Good luck renting the property out when you cant even get to it due to construction.",08Mar2018,2
38,"This is kind of embarrassing, but here goes:

I learned how to burp on command by inhaling in a very specific way and then releasing the air. This was at first a novelty, but the hilarity has since worn off. I am having issues breathing in the normal way again. 

Every breath I take now ends with a miniscule but audible burp that I am having trouble controlling.

I have no idea if this is a mentap thing or muscle memory.

My question is, how do I break out of this habit?",08Mar2018,12
39,"Hello. Quick bio: I’m 27. American. Been out of school about five years and working the entire time. A couple of months back I decided to apply to graduate programs for communications, media, advertising and the like. I have work experience around that stuff but I’ve never had a formal communication/media/advertising job. I applied to a bunch of programs here at home and overseas and got into most. 

I really want a good amount of workplace engagement with this, ie people with experience in the field teaching the classes, opportunities to be in a workplace as part of the degree, practical skills like how to set up a camera, etc. 

Most of the programs feel like they are heavy on theory but not much on the professional stuff I outlined. But I did get into Sciences Po. Their degree had a lot of the features I wanted. I also did study abroad and think an overseas experience would be an interesting thing to have. But Paris cost of living is way up there and I’d be in a foreign country and need to learn french (my french is non trés bon as it stands).

But today I learned I was offered a full ride to a graduate program at my undergraduate alma mater. It’s close to family and in the US. I also am not sure the degree has all I want in terms of professional and practical experience opportunities. 

What should I do? Up until today I felt pretty firm about Sciences Po but this new thing just throws a wrench in it all. 

Thanks for bearing with me. ",08Mar2018,2
41,"Alright I am getting tired of my mom being like this. I am 20 and I have been with her for a year, she is 39. I met her at a birthday party. It was my little sister’s (19) bestfriend’s birthday party, which it’s her mom. When I met her it was kind of a love at first sight thing. We exchanged numbers, we started going on dates, my parents didn’t know. It started going more serious and my parents were pressuring me to go out and talk to girls.

I told them I met a nice woman and they asked me to introduce her, I stalled it for a few days, until I finally introduced them. Yeah they already knew her and seemed kind of upset when I introduced her. So after dinner I went home with her and soent the night since it was saturday and I don’t do much on Sundays. I came back home to pick up some stuff and my parents told me I should end it with her.

I got pretty upset about that and asked why and my mom said she was just using me and the age gap is too big. Now ever since they don’t talk to her much, my sister is very friendly to her when she’s around and my mom is the one who dislikes her. My dad doesn’t really care he is neutral but tries to be nice to her it’s just my mom.

It has been like this for a while now, my mom isn’t aggresive towards her or doesn’t directly insult her but she makes crude jokes and is passive aggresive.

Td;Lr my mom still dislikes my girlfriend because she says the age gap is too big and because she is using me ",08Mar2018,2

43,"So for context I am 19 year old female from England. 
Up until about 3 years ago I had no care in the world! I was popular with my friends, great family life and at that point had never experienced any form of anxiety. 

I now live away from my home town with my girlfriend (who is great for me) I don’t speak to any of my old friends, I essentially pushed everyone out of my life including my parents who love me dearly, but I only see every few weeks.
I have in the last few years developed this very strong social anxiety (I am not diagnosed)
I’ve always been a very bubbly, charismatic person thanks to my dads great personality but I now tend to hide from everybody because I feel deeply shitty about myself. This is something that I feel has ruined the old me and I’ve craved to be the person I once was but now all I can seem to do is care what other people think. 
I’d something so much we looks at me funny my whole persona changes and I get gloomy/ dead faced and just overthink it.
I tend to get awkward in situations where people ask me questions and I freeze. 
The only person in the whole world who fully understand the way I’m feeling is my wonderful girlfriend who does nothing but try to help me, but it’s gotten to the point where I feel anxious about what I say/ do around her even after 2 years of being together. I’ve told her the way I feel and I think I upset her that I’m feeling awkward around her because she and I both know she’s been my rock throughout this.

44,"Friend's boyfriend lives on disability allowance and has no education past high school (I think he may have high school, not sure). Has never worked a day in his life.

Started off saying that his ""industrial"" laptop is being hacked by the government and an image regularly appears on the screen. Like a cyborg ""hacker"" image. Sort of 8-bit like. Also his phone is being hacked and resets at intervals, which he blames on the government taking a keen interest in him.

His girlfriend has seen this 'hacker-cyborg' image herself appear on his laptop screen. The reason I say ""industrial"" is because of the way he calls it. It's just a normal Windows laptop with some padding.

Cue several months on, he is ruining his girlfriend's laptop and desktop. He ruined the desktop and when he ruined the laptop, I managed to remotely fix it so she can have a working computer at least. Then the boyfriend gets very angry, telling her that he told her not to turn off or change anything on the laptop. It dawned on me that he is actually trying to mine Bitcoins. On all their shitty devices. This is fine, it can be a hobby or it can be serious.

Proceeds to fuck up both their lives, hoarding animals (dogs, rats, insects) while living out of a garage. Beloved dog runs away and she ends up just telling the person that found the dog to just keep it, to which the finder agrees. Weird move as it was like a child. Part of the family.

Boyfriend says he finally got a job (didn't even know he was looking) in Canberra (capital of Australia sort of). They end up moving to rural Australia near Canberra. Like to a farm. Boyfriend still refuses to this day to say what job he got. His girlfriend is clueless and just accepts the whole 'I could tell you but I'd have to kill you' thing.

I know ASIO (Australian spy shit) accepts recruits regularly but surely they can tell people who they are working for. This is not 007, mostly administrative jobs. Also surely ASIO does not hire people with nothing more than a high school education.

So she moved to the middle of nowhere to live off his disability allowance, not knowing what the fuck is going on. And neither do I.

45," I need help. my uncle (who lives with my grandma)  is abusing my grandma. My grandma lives in Fresno CA. ( It wouldn't let me just add Fresno as location I had to choose the University). My parents have been keeping records and documents as much as they know how regarding interaction with my uncle and grandma. The police in the city refuse to go inside my grandma's house to do a welfare check. Despite my uncle being a convicted felon, despite his physically assaulting my mom at a baby shower just a few weeks ago (police were called), and despite his history of domestic violence. The police want to wait outside the residence and have my mom go inside alone and check on my grandma. She can't do that because my uncle will hurt her again. There is so much to this situation I couldn't write it all here. The elder abuse group also won't do a welfare check either. My parents need help. I don't want my grandma to die because my uncle is not taking her to see her cancer Drs. Or giving her medicine and feeding her unhealthy food.  Please help. I love my grandma. 
My parents were taking care of my grandma at their house ( in riverside, ca) until my uncle begged my grandma to go to the house in Fresno. My mom began driving to Fresno again (she had done this previously to my grandma staying with my parents) to take my grandma to the dr, giveher  cancer medicine , got her a hearing aid, her food and clothing etc. my uncle is unable to drive because he doesn’t have a liscense and my grandma also can’t drive so my mom was the only one who could do all these important things for my grandma.  Then my uncle manipulated my grandma ( she has early stage Alzheimer’s which makes her paranoid) into cutting off contact with my parents. So now my grandma is not going to the dr, my mom keeps calling dr office and they say she never shows up. My grandma is living with a my uncle who has stolen her money, cut off her ability to call anyone and does not take care of her or take her to the dr.

However, he can also be a very rude person and can come off as an asshole, I think it's his anger and sadness speaking and he really doesn't mean it. Maybe it's a cry for help. Also, he's done some inappropriate things at school as well and I have been inclined to support him less and less. I think about it for hours and whenever I try to defend him in any way, those actions are brought up and I can't help but agree with the other party. 

Recently, he and a friend of mine got into a verbal fight because the kid was trying to (allegedly) punch him (and this kid is a pretty big guy, so he can beat anybody up if he tried) and after some back and forth yelling, it ended up with him crying in the corner. I felt terrible because I don't want to see anybody being brought to tears for something they may not be able to control (for the most part). 

I think he's reaching his breaking point because most teachers hate him as well so he has very little support at school in general. What should I do?

I've been working since before I was out of high-school, and now at age 26 I finally enrolled into a university abroad. My courses start coming October, but I have no idea how students earn money while having enough time to attend mandatory classes and study for them too? 

All of my friends and acquaintances who chose to go to university after high-school had somebody to support them financially, so I have no idea how do people manage it without that. I mean, even part time jobs can sometimes (or often) interfere with a mandatory classes schedule? Others, again, barely bring enough to pay for food and rent... 

So, how do people do it? I really want to devote my self to my academic career. It was always a huge dream of mine, because the field in which I've enrolled was always my biggest interest in life and my most dearest hobby. However, it requires an academic path, a degree, to work in it properly. I had to keep it a hobby, since I had to work to keep me and my mother afloat; but I guess I am getting too personal now. 

Nevermind.

I use this good a few times a year and suck it up and pay the price. It is NOT a necessity good though.

I recently helped out a friend on a project and they tried to pay me. I told them I didn’t need payment Bc I didn’t do it to get paid I did it to help a friend. I gave the money back and he was grateful for my help and touched.

I HATE asking for things from people, as I don’t want to appear like a user or moocher. I genuinely value my friend.

The thought crossed my mind that “hey if he wanted to give me a benefit pass to use that good that would be awesome and would mean a lot to me” but I don’t want to come off like I helped on his project to get a pass and mainly, I don’t want to be an asshole and abuse my friends and their privileges. I know some employers complain about people they barely know or just people always trying to get a benefit pass and how annoying it is. 

I’m not sure what to do? I gave the money back, just reiterated that I helped as a friend not as a paid employee Bc I value my friend. However now I’m not sure if there is a way I can bring this up without sounding like a dick.  Is there a way to bring up a benefit pass as “payment”? Thoughts? Advice?

If this isn’t the place for this, I apologize. Maybe someone can direct me elsewhere. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest and see if I could get some advice.",08Mar2018,2
65,"Hello, as an introduction I am 21 years old and have had MANY jobs. From being an Internet Manager for a Dealership to being a 911 Dispatcher, I’ve never found that place I can nestle into and call it a career. I’m currently working as a Teller for a Credit Union, I’ve recently moved to the city and I figured if I’m going to rent an apartment they’ll want a reputable work place and what better to show I’m good at managing my money, than to work at a bank? Millennial mind, yep! I drive 1 1/2 hours everyday to and from work, and I make $13.50/hr thus, I probably make $10/hr because that extra change is going towards gas every 3 1/2 days on average. I took a few days off work to explore the restaurant world, the world of servers. I’ve been reading threads on here and servers may have it rough, but damn, some make so much money that it’s worth it. So, with my two days of freedom I had a lot of interviews. One of which was 0.5 miles away from me and they seem to be busy, another at a golf Resort they weren’t too busy but then again it was on a Tuesday around 1pm. Not only am I money worried but listing my employment to a possible land lord, I don’t want to look like the child that I am and list “Fat Willy’s,” just because, I know how that may look considering my previous employment (not shaming-just putting myself in a different mind set). I’m having a hard time contemplating if I should stick with my current job and have guaranteed funds every two weeks or try something new and fucking hope I can earn enough in tips so I don’t suffer on $7.50/hr. I’m sure many of you have overcome this obstacle, which is why I came here. ANY advice please, good/bad I don’t care! ",08Mar2018,4
66,"Hey all. I graduated in 2016. I've spent the last 2 ""lovely"" years living at home with my parents. I'd like to move out and have the experiences I need as a younger adult that are defining to my life, however my finances make me second guess this decision.

74k in student loans

42.5 in salary

1380 per month as the median rent price in Denver

I've been fairly aggressive with my student loans (last half year of my salary went directly to paying them off). I'm curious when the growth of moving out overrides the math of living at home.

67,"Quick background, I’m a freshman in high school and one of my friends from middle school was recently diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma. She didn’t tell me directly and we haven’t spoken in person really since middle school (because we went to seperate schools). 

She’s been undergoing chemo for the last 3-4 weeks.

i have her on social media where she’ll occasionally post about being drained, sick, and just devestated from the chemo and i feel absolutely horrible for not saying anything before. i figured i’d wait until she tells me, but she avoided it for the most part (i don’t blame her). She still never messaged me personally, even though everyone knows. 

I feel like a total asshole for putting myself in this position and I want to message her, somehow. I don’t know how.

68,"throwaway account because I dont need anybody knowing this about me

some backstory:
last year I met this guy and we basically became enemies, for whatever reason. we were at each others throats. not in a super serious way, because we were both young (still in high school right now) we were super mean to each other, but made up over the summer because we felt bad about our behavior

anyway, when school started back up again, he tried talking to me. my normal demeanor is just either cold/indifferent, sad, or mean so it seemed like I didnt like him. he just stopped talking to me and I emailed him a couple months later cuz it was bothering me and he understood, but we still avoid eye contact or talking. not cuz we hate each other, but rather its just awkward

anyway heres where I need advice: I cant stop thinking about him? I dont talk to him, he doesnt even look at me. Ive been seeing him a lot more which is weird, but we still dont talk. I guess being his friend would be nice but these thoughts are bothering me. I just imagine us being friends and having friendly conversations but I just want peace. its been almost constant. I also get that feeling you get when you have a crush but I really dont know him at all? I guess its like a friend crush but god knows I dont have the energy or desire to keep this up. I try and do my homework and hes there. I do anything and hes there. its just so weird and I hate it! I feel like in real life we might not even get along super well but I dont even know because I dont know him! at all! Im actually starting to think he doesn't like me... and yet I have these thoughts! thanks in advance redditors",08Mar2018,2

70,"So, I   have been working at this cute local business for a few months now. As I   have been working, I   have started to notice some really rather shitty things my owner does. He breaks MOST minor (under 18) laws. He does not give minors a break every 5 hours.. Gives them over 40 sometimes 60-70 hours per week.. and makes them stay past 11 o'clock. This is highly illegal in my state. Also, he pays me 5 cents under minimum wage. Also, when he hires someone on, they don't get minimum wage until after training. They get 20 cents below it. It gets better.... He REFUSES to pay overtime! He has employees that aren't even of legal age to work (although they are his family..) and he doesn't pay them at all. And they work up to 50-70 hours a week. He is so understaffed. Also, there are a lot of things wrong with the working conditions. I   am thinking since the building is so old, there might be asbestos or lead in the building. Also, he removed our oven and where the chimney used to be, is now just a gaping hole in the ceiling. And many roof leaks. So, I   am going to report all of this to the government/health inspectors. But I   have absolutely NO idea where to start. Also wondering if I   could sue. Does anyone have any idea how I   can get this to be put to a stop? Where can I   start who should I   get a hold of?

71,"I'm a 24 year old female and I can't understand why I've been single for such a long time. It really gets me down. 

It's frustrating because I think I am following the standard ""advice"" that people give to someone who is seeking a relationship!! They always say, ""Get a hobby"", ""Have your own life"", ""Focus on your goals"", ""Always look nice"", ""Don't talk about your ex"", ""Be positive"", ""Be confident"". 

I am literally doing all those things……………..

[ I have hobbies. I'm an artist- my paintings are actually really good. I also love fitness, so I run long distance, intensity interval train, spin, hot yoga, lift, etc. I've got my own life. I have friends. I work two jobs that I really like- part time as a mental health therapist for children, and part time as a server at Hooters. I've focused on my goals- I want a Master's, I'm finishing the degree now. I want to win a swimsuit pageant- My show is 25 days out, I've put in the work for the past 6 months and I'm ready! (FYI, the pageant not NPC, I do not have extreme muscles) I look presentable when I go places. I dress in clothes that fit me well. I'm not into a lot of makeup but I always put on some mascara, blush, lip color and a tinted moisturizer before I leave the house.  I don't talk about my ex. I dumped him well over a year ago and haven't spoken to him since. I'm a really positive person. I rarely complain and I don't get offended easily. I'm not the most confident person in the world, but I definitely like myself and don't come off as insecure. ]

I just can't understand why I've been single for over a year. I accept initiations to go on dates with guys. Even if I'm not super enthusiastic, I'm open minded and I still give them a chance. None of the dates have went well. The guys have been been disrespectful towards me, some had obvious self-esteem issues, some were just wanting something casual, some lacked goals, etc. Some seemed nice and did like me, but with those few there was absolutely no chemistry. I was on Bumble and Tinder for a bit but after a bunch of bad dates I felt like I had seen enough and deleted the apps. 

I'm not religious, but I've only ever slept with one person (a long term boyfriend) and I wouldn't want to sleep with someone unless we had a meaningful relationship. I feel like guys assume I'm ""playing games"" when I don't want to sleep with them on a third date, but it's just not something I'm comfortable with. I wonder if that is part of why I'm single? I hope it isn't, but I'm not going to settle or do things I truly don't want to just to find a boyfriend. 

Everyone tells me to ""Enjoy being single"". Ugh. Of course I enjoy aspects of my life, like my friends, family, work, the gym, making art…. But I would like a meaningful relationship and I do not enjoy being single. 

How did you guys find meaningful relationships? Do you have any advice for someone who wants to find one? If you ended a meaningful relationship, how long were you single for until you found another one? The fact that I'm putting myself out there and trying but it isn't working is so disheartening. Reading this, is there something obviously wrong with me that you guys can see and I can't?

73,"Hello, all. So I'm a new member but I'm pretty familiar with Reddit bc my brother and ex both are/were on it daily. Im not sure if anyone will see this or if ill have to go to a more specific community but I was just posting for some advice, shit, maybe even some encouragement. I'm sorry in advance for how long and boring this is going to be..

So, I'm turning 21 in July. I found out I'm pregnant.. I've been pregnant before. My boyfriend (ex now since the end of September) was very supportive the first time around. It was made clear that the decision was mine and he would be there for me no matter what. We were in love and talked about our future and being together. Well, I decided we, especially I, wasn't emotionally or financially prepared for another person totally reliant on me. So I exercised my right to chose. Anyways, I have depression. I have always suffered from it and it comes in waves. When my father passed away the summer before last, I went through a really awful time in my life as expected. I worked really hard to progress to where I was last summer. I had built up the self esteem and motivation I lost and was back on track for the most part. Well after the abortion, I got awful again. It creeped up on me until I realized that I was becoming toxic. I was self harming, completely emotionally dependent on my partner, and just overall awful. So I realize why we broke up. It takes two, but overall I wasn't healthy which made us unhealthy. Well, we officially stopped talking over the month of December. And then began having this thing where we'd have fun together and it would be happy and lovey dovey like before the abortion. He would express to me that we didn't work out, but that he didn't think he'd be able to love anyone as much as he loved me. It just felt right when we were together.. Well, on the 4th, we had an amazing time. It was fun with dancing in the kitchen and cuddles and just fun. Fast forward to the 11th.. we watched a movie and I left. Nothing sexual, just hanging out. On the 12th, I found out he started dating someone on the 11th. After their first date. They're still together and she posts pictures of them together and he seems happy. Well I told him I was pregnant and he ultimately said he wanted to be updated with appointments but he didn't want a part of our baby's life. That we didn't work and he didn't want to tear a kid between us. An excuse, I know. He's very good at always making things come off like he's a god and does no wrong. All I'm really asking is a man's opinion. Will he change his mind? Am I crazy? Or maybe just some encouragement. I don't have anyone to talk to about this and I'm falling apart trying not to think about them or the fact my baby may not have a father. I'm still very much in love with him but am thinking realisticly.. any comments will be appreciated.",08Mar2018,1

but i can’t stop with my tooth, i’m constantly licking it, trying to wiggle it, and going to look at it every 5 minutes and brushing my teeth.

90,"Look at bolded for what I need advice on down below ˅˅

Explanation:
Whenever I'd ""hang"" with someone I'd noticed how people communicate with each other succinctly without much thought time and prep. But sadly, I can't relate to that, since, most of the time I'd talk is when answering a question. This has led me to be a rather lonely person, not because I'm disinterested in human interaction, but at that time I was just happy with myself(10 yr old me). But now I'm a 16-year-old and I've come to realize how excruciatingly lonely I am. Nowadays when I attempt to enter a conversation, I, for the most part, can't contribute to the conversation what so ever, like my mind doesn't compute an adequate response for whatever occasion(as in any almost any occasion). People easily develop a relationship with a person and say things according to that.

For example: When you're with a group of friends, you'd probably say a joke. Meanwhile, my mind almost never develops a remark/response that intrigues their humor/understanding).

_______________________________________________

**Summary: Basically what I'm looking advice/help for is how do I fix myself into developing responses and how to fix my ability to advance in conversations rather than being unappealing.**

(Also, what subreddits should I post this too? Would r/metalhealth or anxiety work? IDK how to cross post)
_______________________________________________


Edit: Also Also, when speaking about humor and friends, I mean generally speaking. I've tried talking and being with many people, but for the most part, people are disinterested (understandably considering my incapability to be useful, instead I would be wasting oxygen if I were with them)

Edit #2: Also Also Also (Just for clarification), It's not that I'm looking at the wrong people, cause as I said before, I'm incapable of showing my social worth, therefore I'd be required by no one

91,"My ex and I split about 16 years ago. We have a 17 yo daughter that up until three years ago we had shared custody. Ex was abusive physically and mentally to both of us. Daughter and ex had falling out 3 years ago and ex gave up rights. MIL and daughter had falling out about 4 years ago. No word from MIL since and only about three messages from ex. Daughter has tried to make amends but gets nowhere. It’s been very painful and upsetting for her. MIL was abusive physically and mentally towards ex while growing up and later daughter.

Yesterday, one of the extended family called daughter and told her that MIL was dying, in coma, and on life support. Eventually daughter decided to go see MIL. MIL, while old and frail looking, was in hospital but not in coma or on any machines. She was very with it and alert. A lot of the family was there and most blatantly ignored daughter. MIL started crying when daughter arrived. Never apologized or anything of the sort but did say she loved her. Daughter was asked to leave by nurse (not sure why) and daughter decided to leave hospital despite pleas from family that have ignored her for years.

Found out through mutual friend that MIL had died that (last) night. No word, message, text, etc from anyone. Eventually tonight, I found the obit on the local funeral homes site. Daughter not sure if she wants to go or not, but if she does go, she wants me there with her. I told her I would do whatever she needs me to do. 

I am not going to tell her she cannot go even though I fully expect it to be quite the spectacular shit show this family is well known for. We have talked about things off and on throughout the day. She is undecided about going because of many of the same reasons I have concerns about. I have suggested that maybe she might want to go to the grave after wards to say her goodbyes.

Any other suggestions? Any thoughts on ways to make this easier on my daughter? She doesn’t want to send flowers or card or anything. I’m not sure she even wants to see any of them, especially after how they were at the hospital... but I think she wants some sort of closure. ",08Mar2018,17
94,"I’m in love with a girl. We are very good friends and she knows I like her, but she doesn’t like me back. She recently just got out of a relationship and she is still hung up on that guy. I believe that there is no reason to date if you’re not looking to get married. And this girl is just so amazing, she has like this motherly nature and this maturity that makes her so perfect. It would be an honor to be with her.

I’m writing this post because I’m stuck. I’m not sure if I should continue being friends with this girl because every time I’m with her It feels so good. Just like how someone addicted to cocaine will never get over their addiction if they still do coke every few days. I too will remain in love and fall in love with this girl every time I hang out with her. But, I don’t want to leave her. And even if I do cut her off, I’ll still see her in school and we have mutual friends so almost every day will just be a reminder that I cut off the girl I love and that im still in love with her.

Aside from that, I hope that somehow something will happen and she will fall in love with me and if I cut her off the chances of that happening probably drop near zero. After high school, she plans to go to college in europe. Ive never been good at keeping friends and I know we will drift apart if not completely. I’m pretty sure I can get over her after high school, but theres a part of me that doesn’t want to. I imagine that far in the future when I’m financially stable and all I will go and find her and ask to marry her.

My parents always think of me as an academic overachiever, and have expectations to match. Naturally, I took the Accelerated Calculus entry exam.

I failed it. Exactly why is irrelevant. I was notified of my failure through an email that only I recieved.

I've withheld this news from my parents for the past week or so, as they're still furious at me for scoring low on a History test. Now, I don't know how to tell them. If I do so now, it'll only add to their anger. If I wait a while, they'll be angry that I waited so long.

Some of you might suggest sitting through their anger and ranting and getting it over with. That's not an option for me. My parents frequently get physical when angry. It's nothing serious, just some slaps here and there. Regardless, I don't want that to happen.

So my boyfriend and I have dated for over two years now. He is still in Uni trying to finish his degree but every year it seems like another year gets added on. He wants to continue to live at home with his dad well rent is cheap which I understand but meanwhile I am being an independent woman paying my rent, my insurance, etc. Where I am living now is not big enough to have a roommate and I don't really want to move again, wait a year or two, then move in with him.
But whenever we talk about it his answers always feel so vague. We talk about a future, marriage, family, but it definitely feels like I bring it up more than he does. I am watching all of my friends settle down, move in together, get married. I don't want to rush things but living in this city is expensive and I feel like I am expected to just wait well he finishes school. He also keeps talking about changing his degree and adding on another two years which puts us at 27/28 when we finally move in together and dating for 4 years by that time. Meanwhile I too want to go back to uni to get a degree but I am not financially capable of doing so well living on my own.

My love for him is resilient; it's still there, alive and passionate, and deep down I know that if given the chance, I would've swallowed my pride and self-respect and dismissed his infidelity for the sake of still seeing him. 

But now he has moved on, naturally of course. As for me, there is no respite to my despair. Family and friends are progressively fading from my vision and the world feels like it's shattering steadily to an inevitable end. I'm not unfamiliar with depression but this time it feels bound and permanent. 

I was so deeply in love, the world revolved around him and only him and I have given so much of myself to him that I have lost sight of who I am. It's that kind of love, the kind that can empower you to the highest degree as well as destroy every ounce of your being. 

Psychotherapy and SSRI's didn't work this time around. My journal entries and drawings consist of only him now. My entire life is still eclipsed by his existence and it's ruining everything: my job, school and my relationships with my family and friends. 

How can I fix myself?How can I stop feeling this way? Why can't I get over this person? I dont't know why I'm so deeply affected. I don't know how one person cause all of this. It's hurts so much I try not to cry in the subway on my way to school or to work and it's gotten to a point where it's affecting my grades at my uni. 

I want to be strong. I want to be independent again. I want to not give a fuck about anybody else like I used to but I can't. Everything reminds me of him and everything feels like it's falling apart. I'm very sorry if I went off tangent several times throughout this post but I just need advice. Time hasn't done anything at this point. I don't know what else to do.",08Mar2018,2

101,"Hi, well my life has felt like I hit a wall of sorts. I'm 22 going on 23, I've been working since I've been 15 at various places and recently left my last job for a new job because I wasn't happy and on top of that they caused me a lot of frustration there. I've been working at the new job for about 3 weeks now and it's not that I hate the job it's more it's not what I want to do. I attend college classes when I have time and money which normally means I can only do 1 or 2 classes per semester if I'm lucky (I receive nothing from fafsa because my parents make too much money and don't fund me in any way and I don't receiveany scholarships because my GPA isn't the best either even though I am working on it, but it is a slow process) I've thought about quitting the new job since the second day even though I'm fine with the work just I feel almost burnt out. I want to take a nice vacation but between student loans, and other living expenses and bills I can't see me being able to quit and still survive longer than a couple days, I barely make it as is even with living at home still. I'm not sure what to do, how I can bring happiness into my life, how to push myself to pursue my goals. It's like I hit a wall and I'm forcing myself to move every day. I tend to find myself going out on the weekends to try and enjoy myself some even if it's only temporary as well I play video games and have also started to attend the gym more since that's something some have recommended. Thank you for any advice given to me.

Edit: this whole thing has also moved my mind into darker places that I've ever been, and the going out even if it does damage my financial state keeps me not as unhappy as I would be otherwise. ",08Mar2018,5

Long story short, if she can’t comfort me while my friend is ill and all I need is emotional support.. isn’t that a huge red flag and maybe I should think about divorcing her? Like I’m kinda in shock that she reacted this way. ",08Mar2018,2

106,"So I have a friend who doesn’t have many friends, and on top of all that, she’s pretty depressed. I used to be depressed, so I felt pretty bad for her. We eventually started hanging out, and she got clingy quick. It’s gotten to the point where she no joke follows me all the way to my classes. She waits by my locker each morning. She will not give me any space. She’ll also say really depressing shit out of the blue.

 I want to help her, and I try, but last year I had another friend who was extremely depressed and suicidal. I did everything in my power to help him through his depression and keep him alive. The school knew about his condition, but they didn’t do shit. He didn’t go to a therapist either. Getting him through his depression was the most stressful thing I’ve ever done. He is actually doing great now. The thing is, last year was so stressful and I just can’t do that anymore. I can’t be a therapist for my friends anymore. It was terrible for my own mental health. 

I do want to be friends with her, but I can’t fucking deal with her following me to all my classes and to my homeroom, and I just can’t be someone’s therapist anymore. I want her off my back. Am I an asshole for feeling that way? Last year I saved someone’s life. He definitely would have killed himself if it weren’t for me. I emailed him letter after letter each day trying to get him to stay alive. I can’t do that shit anymore. It was so stressful. She wants me to be around her 24/7, and at the same time she doesn’t want to be around my other friends. She pulls me away from all my friends and takes it personally when I don’t want to talk to her when she’s following me awkwardly at all times of that day.",08Mar2018,3
107,"I'm 21 years old and currently live with my parents, not really out of the ordinary. I work as basically an assistant-assistant manager at a hardware store and make a little under 30k a year after taxes, and I've got about 11k saved up in the bank. I don't have a degree of any kind and I've been working at this store for the past four years.

My situation is this: A very good friend of mine accepted a job a couple hours drive from where I live now, just over state lines in a state I'd much rather live in than the one I live in now. He offered me and a few other friends of mine the opportunity to move in with him and rent a house.

This is something that I want to do, but it's also something that I'm desperately scared to do. I've got about three and a half months to prepare to move if this is something I'm serious about doing.

Only major complications for this are 1, I like my current job and my boss has me on track for actual management opportunities down the road. 2, I've haven't applied for or gotten a job that my dad didn't help me get my foot in the door with and the only thing I feel I really have to offer is ""four years of retail experience"". 3, I don't know the first thing about living on your own.

Essentially this boils down to two choices for me. I can keep doing what I'm doing for a little bit and live inside my comfort zone and eventually move out when I actually feel like I'm too old to reasonably live with my parents. Or, I can take a risk, move somewhere I've never been, find a job that will likely be a step down from what I'm doing now, and try and make my way in the world with a couple good friends to have my back.

109,"So an odd situation came up for me tonight that I am particularly angry about. I very much wanted to report it to the police station, set some kind of no contact or to have it on record. But I am unsure this is going to be an option. At this time it appears to just be slander, although it is hard to not feel like it is some form of harassment.

Backstory about myself:

I am a Nurse who suffers from mental illness. I have anorexia, generalized anxiety disorder and depression. This summer things came to a head and I became so unspeakably unwell that I had to go off work and even be hospitalized. It was the sickest I have ever been in my live. Recovery has been long and difficult. In fact this is the second year in a row that I have had to have sick leave. Its been a combined year of not being able to work out of the last 2 years. That doesn't even speak to the hours lost because I can only be on modified work, which I so regretfully was force to extend 3 more months.

I still struggle a lot but I am doing really well in treatment. It is safe to say that the last two years have been unspeakably difficult on so many levels. Relevant to this situation, it has resulted in substantial financial strain on myself and I am still struggling to catch up on bills.

So this is what actually happened:

Today, my nephew messaged me on facebook, out of the blue, telling me that he heard I was in REHAB FOR A COCAINE ADDICTION. What the HELL. I flipped right the blip out and made him tell me who said this. I get it out of him that it was his MOM AKA MY AUNT. This lady in question? I have not spoken to in YEARS.. Perhaps longer than 5? I have never had any issues at all with her! I don't know why she would even talk about me as we are practically strangers.

The only reason I could consider this happening is that she HATES my mom. My mom in the last two years has no contact with her after she made threats to her(shes a nurse too) she even threaten to go after her nursing license. This is because of a situation where my Aunt messaged my Mom who is a mandatory child abuse reportor that her husband had punched my Nephew in the face leaving a black eye. She knew that my mother had to report, and when it happened she flipped out and blamed her for everything. She started threatening and starting shit with her after that. The last thing that happened, her and her other sister basically accused my Mother of elder abuse for having my Grandfather help with renos around the house, which she gave him money for! She has been helping and giving my Grandfather money to keep a roof over his head for the last several years now.

But that has nothing to do with me until now when I get this message. I go from 0 to 100%. I call my mom and tell her what happened and get this ladies phone number off her to set the record straight. My mom is so sad and apologetic. She said we heard this rumour back at Christmas that your Aunt was saying this and we asked your Grandparents to put a stop to this. You were so unwell at the time that we did not want to jeopardize your recovery, so we didn't tell you. Normally I would be upset for her keeping this from me but she was right... For once.. I had some difficult things happen to me while I was ill in hospital, that I am still having difficulty coping with. I couldn't and can still barely cope with it. Its hard to explain my state at that time, but having to fight another battle would of been crushing for me. It was the right thing for my mum to do. Only she thought that would be the end of it.

Anyways.

So I call and confront this lady asking her why her son is saying that she said this. Of course, she denies having said it stating ""I only told them that you were in rehab"". Uh okay, rehab for WHAT? Drugs? Your facts are wrong lady. Where would your son get that I am in rehab for Cocaine Addiction from? She's laughing at me because I am so angry, I tell her this isn't funny, I'm a regulated professional, these are lies and I take these kind of statements seriously. I tell her I'm seriously contemplating legal action. I say if she didn't say this, I'm sorry, but I defend my emotional state where I am basically extremely upset, not swearing at her but so very clearly angry when she points it out. Who wouldn't be upset about this especially in my situation? I've been through more than enough! This lady is literally laughing at me on the phone ridiculing me saying that her disabled son made up the part about a cocaine addiction, that I should know better. Ridiculing me: ""Spectacle, Spectacle! Hes got a DISABILITY"" ""He makes this sort of thing up"". I set the record straight with her, telling her how I'm disgusted by the rumour considering how sick I have been and that I am receiving THERAPY for ANOREXIA NOT THAT IT IS HER BUSINESS, AND I AM NOT IN REHAB FOR COCAINE ADDICTION. I'm asking her why is she even gossiping about me to her son about being in rehabilitation, how is that appropriate or their business? I don't know her and she isn't even on my radar. I end up hanging up on this bitch. I call my mom back to do some firm fact finding, giving this lady a very slight benefit of the doubt that it was her sons mistake.

So, yeah. Call my mom back. NOPE. My grandma corroborates my nephews story to her. The story that my AUNT told HER. MY GRANDMOTHER, that I have a cocaine addiction and that I am in rehab for it. I call my Grandma and she says the same thing but also tells me that she said this to my Grandpa!!!!!!! I asked my Grandma what excactly she had said. My grandma says that she told her, that she has 'sources' that I am in rehab for cocaine addiction. What. The. Fuck.

This lady by the way, works as a sterilization tech at the hospital I was treated at. Idk where the hell she got this information from or if she made it up. But I'm not going to lie, I have half a mind to call the hospitalization for an investigation that my privacy hasn't been breached? Can you even call it the story is a complete lie?

Who the fuck does this sort of thing?

SHE LIED TO ME ON THE PHONE AND SCAPEGOATED HER SONS DISABILITY ON TOP OF THAT. WHAT KIND OF MOTHER OF THE YEAR DOES THAT??????

In case you can't already tell I'm livid.

From my limited research this appears to be a civil matter. I have screenshots of text messages. I have recording of my Grandmother telling me what she had said, and she fully supports me pursuing. I'm broke. I want justice. What are my options?

Is it possible to file ANYTHING at the police station?

What I want is basically any sort of extremely strong message sent that there are consequences for behavior such as this and it ends here and now. I want her to fucking sweat and I want her know she fucked up. If there is an ounce of morality in her heart, I want her to feel like SHIT.

It seems like my options are the following:

A) Consulting a lawyer, paying money for a cease and desist letter. How much would this cost, is this a humiliating enough course of action. Could I force her to apologize verbally or in a written statement.

B) Suing her ass for slander

C) Calling this deplorable human being back. Asking herself to explain why my Grandmother and Grandfather are saying that she said this.. Allowing her one last opportunity to confess and APOLOGIZE, while I lay it on her thick how disgusting her behaviour is to spread lies about me while I am legitimately ill, and for throwing her disabled son under the bus. AND TO TELL MY ENTIRE FAMILY I HAVE A COCAINE ADDICTION, AS A NURSE, WHEN THAT ISN'T TRUE.

I'm only a little bit sorry for the caps. Please someone help me out in deciding a proper course of action.",08Mar2018,1

(I'm not very attractive myself so I thought I'd never had a chance with her.) Anyway, fast forward a year and some to my junior year (now). The whole summer I tried to do almost anything to lose weight which didn't work so much because of my lack of motivation. It ended up leading to deoression. I stopped eating alot, missed tons of school, and finally lost a little weight. (A little off topic but I'll get there.) I'm friends with her brother and I've been trying everything to man up and talk to her. Her brother and I talk consistently and are actually really great friends. I even tried to get him to tell her to message me first. I know, pathetic right? Obviously it didn't work and the day I was actually willing to talk to her, her brother texts me and says;
Him : Dude, guess what!
Me : What?
Him : We're related.
Me : How so?
Him: Our great grandmother's were twins.

134,"16 now, I was 13 when it happened. Basically what happened was I went to a friends party and he invited me and two other kids to spend the night. Earlier in the night one of the kids staying the night broke his nose earlier but didn't want to got to the hospital. They eventually decided to take him to the hospital, it was like 4 in the morning and he woke them up and everyone accept for his mom and me. (Reason I didn't go was because the kid who got hurt, was and still is my closest friend, he didn't want me to because he knew I'd make fun of him the entire time, which was true) Anyways so it was about 4:15 and they were all gone, and they lived fairly far away from the hospital, about a 30 minute drive. Basically I was watching tv waiting for them to come back, and his mom walked in to the room in a robe with a bottle of vodka. She started offering me some drinks of vodka and as any 13 year old boy would do, I said yes. After about 30 minutes of drinking and watching tv she started rubbing my back. I was drunk off my ass obviously, after about 15 minutes of massaging me etc. She asked me to take my pants off, and drunk 13 year old me accepted, and then bada boom bada bing. The next day I woke up with a serious headache, and my mom picked me up at about 9. I ended up telling my best friend, the one I mentioned earlier, a few months ago.  

Now that ive explained the story, I would like advice on how to tell my parents without them losing it, or any annoyingly deep conversations.  Although I do recognize the latter is pretty unavoidable. I would really rather not make a real serious issue of it.

I've always prided myself on being incredibly honest, which is why I'm even thinking of telling them. Like I said I really don't want to make it some grandiose issue. Reason being it happened 3 years ago, nothing they can really do, and I'm afraid they'll end up feeling guilty. I mean yeah, I definetly didn't like it, (as much as I thought I would at that age) and it really sucks. I mean I know how I feel when I even think about it, and I really don't want my parents or siblings or anyone in my family wanting to feel anything like that.

After more than a decade of clinical depression, later ""demoted"" to Persistent Depressive Disorder (as defined by multiple doctors and psychiatrists, not by myself), I eventually hit a point about 4 years back where I just mostly feel... nothing. Not happy or sad or angry or anything, really. I can amuse myself, and I can enjoy activities, but I don't get any real sort of emotional response from much of anything. And for the past couple weeks I've really realized that this might include having lost my ability to empathize.

Or maybe I never had it? My depression started around puberty, and apparently depression can cause issues with memory- and I remember very little from before then so I can't be 100% sure.

The thing is, a couple weeks back a friend of mine attempted suicide (and failed, luckily). And when I was told, I felt worried, naturally. But when it was immediately followed with finding out that everything was okay and they were going to be fine, I just kind of put it out of my mind and focused on other things unless it was brought up. Now, I definitely care for my friends. But I know I should have felt *something* at that, right? Even when they were back to full health and I saw them again, all I felt was more like it was good we were able to hang out again.

I can sympathize, I think. As I've gotten worried and I do honestly always try to help when people are unhappy. But it doesn't rub off on me, and it's always too easy to forget and move on. I don't like it.

Does anyone have any similar circumstances? Or know of ways I can ""flex"" my empathy muscle to work on it?  
I want to be a more normal person.

137,"If this is the wrong place to post this let me know!! 

I live next to the worst people.
I have never met them but I know literally everything about their lives because they won't shut up. Or turn anything down. I know what shows they watch, what video games they play, who hasn't done the dishes, who didn't wait for the other at the elevator... Everything. 

This couple had an ugly break up the first week they moved in... which culminated (a few days later) into a physical fight that I ended up calling the cops on them for. The guy was arrested but was bailed out by the lady a day later. (This was the first weekend in December). Cops even suggested that they should break up. They did not. 

Since then they have fought at least weekly and broken up multiple times. The guy even moved out for 3 wonderful quiet days. (And then moved back in at midnight on a Monday) 

I have called the cops multiple times to no avail. And sent audio clips to my landlord with no response. (Only one warning was issued  far as I can tell, which helped for about a week). CPS even come out and nothing has changed. 

Are there any other ways to get them to shut up? Or get them kicked out? 

This has caused a legitimate hit on my health because I'm hardly sleeping since they like to fight from anywhere from 11 pm - 7 am cause fuck everything. And the stress is insane because I'm just waiting for it to escalate to violence again every time they start fighting. 

I don't feel comfortable talking with them directly because this dude is volatile and the lady will never slow down enough for me to say anything to her and also I don't actually want to talk to them because I kinda hate them. But something has got to change and there's gotta be some sort of anything that can force them to stop or kick them out. Or have I exhausted all my options? 

(And yes, we're applying to other apartments but I don't have a steady income right now so idk how long that could take). 

tl;dr 

my neighbors won't stop being loud AF fighting and / or watching TV / playing video games and I can't get any authority figure to take care of it since December. Any other ideas? ",08Mar2018,10
139,"This girl and I have a thing we are quite interested in each other. We have been on a few hangouts/dates. But 4 days ago, she completely ignored my text didn't even open it. I think it was because I wasn’t giving her a break from me and acting overly interested (Interest from normally at 60:40 to 30:70 ratio). Me on the right side of the ratios. I haven't texted her or anything after that text she ignored I just left things like nothing ever happened. I was thinking texting her tomorrow saying, ""hey, let's go to X for a coffee on Saturday, what times good for you?""   

Should I say that or just live my life like she never ignored me and see what happens, see if she comes running back. I don’t want to give up and move on just yet because I really like this girl. I want to break the ice somehow from her ignoring and see if she's still interested in me now, before I go to the same event as her every Sunday because it would be awkward trying to talk to her if she ignored me.

143,"I am living with my boyfriend and he owns his own house. We are dating a year. Prior to me living with him his unemployed friend was living with him for a year. His friend is on welfare, never leaves the house, doesn’t clean up after himself and now is refusing to shower after long periods of time. By long I mean over two weeks. You can smell him whenever he comes downstairs. He goes out once a week to collect his welfare and has EXPENSIVE takeaway delivered to the door. He plays video games all night. 

My boyfriend’s friend has now been living there for two years. Six months ago my boyfriend gave him six months’ notice to move out. Its now 2 days past the six month mark. He has made no attempt to move out, or get a job etc. I should also mention he cut off all contact with his family and friends. My boyfriend is charging me $560 a month in rent and his friend $250. I work a full time job. It’s low paid with a lot of unpaid overtime. My boyfriend said his friend let him stay on his couch before for six months so he feels indebted to him. But his friend is now here two years at this point.

 It’s affecting my life because my friends and family don’t want to come over because if the friend comes downstairs he stinks and interrupts conversations being condescending and put down to other people. He also moans about how sick he is and huffs and puffs really loudly. He plays up being the victim a lot. My boyfriend has spent the past few days trying to help this guy get accommodation etc with no help from him. He has just played video games. From what I can see he has no intention to leave ever even if he got another place to live. I should also mention my boyfriend has an 8 year old daughter and this guy is staying in her bedroom and he knows it. He was told the child needed her room back six months ago as shes too old to share a room when she comes over with her dad. The child is even getting upset at this point by this 38 year old man’s behaviour. Any advice would be appreciated.",08Mar2018,40

I'm stressed about money. They do pay me monthly, as a stipend, but it isn't enough. I'm supporting my fiance, whom is also finishing up his master's, and myself in a foreign country. Granted it's Canada, but still. He did support me quitting when I first wanted to stop, but now he's also telling me to finish my degree.
I have depression that renders me useless when I don't get ahead of it. To be honest, I'm constantly depressed, I can try at the slightest things. I'm having anxiety attacks more often as well. I have a constant feeling of needing to prove that I can go and complete my degree. But the work is not what I wanted to do so my drive is shot.
I give life advice to friends about it being okay to take their time getting a degree and they don't have to prove anything. I'm constantly saying do what makes them happy, but I'm not even doing that myself.

155,"Hello, I might give too much details because I want you to understand the situation as much as possible and thank you beforehand for the advice too. 

I'm a 19 year old ""highschool"" student, had to miss about two years for medical reasons so I'm a bit behind compared to people of my age but that's not something I personally mind much, though others seem to. I always thought I wanted to do social sciences related career, I also didn't know what I was good at or liked and this was the option with most options later on for university. **Note that in my country we don't have specific subjects we can choose, we only have three options with subjects already chosen so there isn't that much variety.** Not too long ago there was an education convention, with universities offering help etc and I realised how much I like programming so I got adviced to look into software engineering, and the more I look for the more I seem to like it. 

I asked some teachers for advice on this because my subjects are not the best to get into the career, but it is doable. However all they say is ""that's not for you"" ""you're not gonna make it"" or similar, even got the typical ""engineering is not a women field, are you sure you want that?"" and it's just really demotivating. I do gotta admit this year I have a huge mental block and it's being harder to study and because of this they belittle me a lot and treat me as if I weren't able to do anything myself. 

I've started doubting myself like, maybe this isn't for me and they are right; maybe I can't make it. I am scared, I don't want to take a bad decision, I don't want to disappoint myself or my parents. What if I indeed don't get treated as good for not being a man?

160,"Hey people of advice
New to reddit so bare with me, registered because I was searching for advice.

I've been with my girlfriend coming up to 7years now, our first few years together was amazing, immense together. 
I was 16 when I first got with her and she was 24. 
The age gap is big but we've always had things in common.
We've been arguing nonstop constantly for the past 6-7months.
We had a little break from each other for around a month and I moved back in, we have petty arguments, like this morning I didn't have anything planned so I was going to lie in, but I was poorly yesterday so she got up to feed our dog so I could relax.
She had an extra hour before work this morning so she expected me to get up for her since she did yesterday for me. ( The dog comes in our room and wakes us up in the morning for food). It was 20minutes before she had to get up to get ready but conceded to scream at me before even asking me nicely to get up for her.

The house is under her tenancy and she  always threatens to kick me out, she knows I don't have a supportive family and whilst not in work due to health issues I can't support myself at all and would become homeless. 

I listen to her but I just feel like she doesn't listen back, I feel like she thinks I owe her something?

This woman was my first love and I'm finding this so rough!!

I hate how she uses the house as a weapon against me and if I say no because I do pay my way for bills,food etc their has been times she's gone outside and shouted to our neighbours to get me out the house.

I love her to bits but I don't know if it is or I'm just here because I don't want to be homeless.

Thank you all for reading, I'm 21 years of age now and I'm in a massive emotional wreck lol.

Money has been very stressful whilst I'm out of work, she works 4hours a day, so I had the ""big"" income.
Finding it very difficult to find work as I don't have much qualifactions,I just mainly get production work.

Thank you again Advice

162,"I need some help: I’m struggling with flashbacks to a bad sexual encounter and have heard about my ex’s new girlfriend, which in retrospect devalues the last year of our relationship. This comes at a time when I’m generally under a lot of stress and which makes it hard for me to cope. However, I do not want to share any of this with my social circle. I think I need the anonymity of the internet as a sounding board and I would love to get tips for how to cope with it in the short term. 

More than a year ago, my (F) boyfriend (both 31 at that time) and I broke up. We had met during the last year of our respective degrees and maintained a long-distance relationship for 6 years. Apart from the issue of long distance, another key issue was the kids question. He wanted to have them, I didn’t. At year 5 of our relationship we virtually broke up over the decision, knowing it was the rational thing to do, but we both struggled with the decision emotionally. We even went to counselling together and decided to still maintain the relationship with him stating that he starts to consider that other experiences in the relationship may outweigh not having kids. In hindsight, this was stupid. 

Some time after the almost break-up, he got into trouble at work for poor performance, was ultimately kicked off his team and switched to a different team. We put discussions about our relationship on hold to get him through this tricky time. Around April, he found a new team, moved into a new apartment and flourished in the new situation enjoying live in the city rather than the suburbs. At that time he also met his new girlfriend. 

Our subsequent time was okayish but strained: In the summer, we went vacationing together in Europe; in autumn, we went on a company retreat with my employer, but I felt that he did not get along well with my colleagues so we spent most time away from the main site and roamed the beaches together. Shortly after the retreat, I visited him for several weeks and he pushed discussions about the future of our relationship. I had another year to finish up my PhD before working full-time again. We had repeatedly discussed that after starting to work again, I would move to the States switching offices to the city where he lives. He also signalled that he does not want to live in the States forever and return to Europe at some point. 
I told him that the continuous discussions on a meta level are putting a strain on me, and that I’d like to just live the relationship again and enjoy common activities. Instead, he basically lived his life and I was welcome to tag along. We had some good and some catastrophic outings with his new friends including his now girlfriend. I liked some of his friends, just not many of the new additions. I engaged in social platitudes with my boyfriend about these new friends even though I wanted to scream at him for how insane the interactions with them had been. 

When Christmas plans were drawn up, I felt somewhere far down on his list of priorities with him spending Christmas with his family, New Year’s at an annual social event and then a skiing trip with a set of his friends. I was welcome at Christmas with his parents and the skiing trip. I told him that it hurts me feeling the least of his priorities, and he responded he’s sorry, he hadn’t seen it that way. At the same time, our roles started to reverse: there was increasing pressure with my thesis to maintain my work contract. My boyfriend wanted specifics about our future. But the general plan about me moving to the States was still standing and I couldn’t give him more specifics until I started working again. 

During the Christmas break, events accelerated fast. I spent Christmas with his parents, made him a personal gift illustrating that I value the relationship and look forward to a common future. He went on his New Year’s trip when he got word that his grandmother was sick. She died and her funeral was scheduled during the time the skiing trip was supposed to be. My boyfriend still set his friends up in the skiing hut, then we met at the funeral. After the funeral, the plan was to drive to where I live (6hrs from his parents/funeral place) and him flying out 2 days later back to the States. I asked him not to come if we are only going to discuss the relationship again and rather make a clean cut there and then. He insisted to come. 

When I still had anticipated to drive back alone, I had mentioned to his parents that I wanted to drive by my grandfather’s grave on the way back since it happened to be shortly after his birthday. My grandfather was the most important person in my childhood and I was highly protective of sharing that moment with anyone. I did not want my ex there in that state of our relationship. He was pushy, we went. He wanted an immediate step-change in our relationship, I told him I could not abandon my PhD and work contract, I would not even have a visa for the States. At night, we had terrible sex. He wanted, I felt obliged, I don’t think it was fun for him, either. Afterwards, he quipped something about the qualities of my next boyfriend. I felt hurt, powerless and told him as much. Are we broken up? Yes, we are. It was the middle of the night, I needed to go to work the next day, so I could only move to the couch. The next night I spent at a friend’s and I texted him to leave the key in the mailbox when he left for his flight. 

That was in January last year. I have not had any contact with him since. He wrote me an email and a letter which I did not respond to. His family reached out to me and we exchanged some pleasantries, but ultimately, I decided to block everyone and move on. What I had not anticipated is how the last days of the relationship had affected me. My grandfather’s grave and my studio had been my safe spaces. In the weeks after the break-up I felt weird in the studio and I could only sleep on the couch. I still have flashback to the bad sex. Before that relationship with my ex, I had been abused and was struggling with intimacy. My ex was very patient and made me work through it. But that feeling that my wishes did not matter at all, and the terrible sex without a condom just tore open that can of worms. In the past year, I broke-off interactions with two men because they were approaching flirting and dating territory and I could not bear the thought of having to be intimate with someone. I am 32 and I feel like I should have worked through this. 

Two days ago, I googled my ex’s name to see where he had ended up. I think it was motivated by the general thought that now would have been the time that I would have moved to the States and the pictures that I had painted for the career change, our future and adventures together had been on my mind. I saw a public social media account in which he had posted about his girlfriend. It was the girl he had met when he changed work teams. Last year, when we had broken up, I had felt angry and exasperated because while I had supported him through his struggling times, I did not feel he had done the same for me. He had made many hurtful comments. However, I had rationalized that this had been a tough situation for him, too, and his actions were a product of the general conditions of our relationship. I thought the fall-out from our relationship is primarily my problem and something I have to deal with. Now, I am wondering whether his behaviour was more intentional and I feel really betrayed. When he was around his now girlfriend he basically turned into a mean girls high school character, and now it seems that he had actually become one rather than play a role and turned the remnants of our relationship into a cruel game of deliberately hurting me. 

I have never spoken with any of my friends about any of this. It is important to me to have a professional appearance, and I always put my ex in a good light with them. I have a humongously important deadline coming up that affects my career and financial security, but I am suddenly overwhelmed with feeling small, powerless, ashamed, disgusted and lacking any efficacy. For the first time in my life, I called a crisis hotline, but the talk rather only made the puzzle pieces of the story above even more salient. And now I have a very hard time shutting all of this out and focus. I hope that just writing it down makes me acknowledge it and then push it aside. But if anyone made it through this litany and has advice on how to cope with it in the short-term, I welcome feedback. ",08Mar2018,3

Not everyone gets this opportunity so I should be thankful I’m one of those who were given the chance to tour cities and countries.

I became so curious with the site, I opened it and did some thorough scanning on all its features. Man, the ladies in the site are absolutely gorgeous, no doubt! Aside from meeting the women, I can also enjoy a tour in the city where the event will take place. This is just perfect!

But I’m still hesitant to take part in this kind of travel. I want to give it a shot, like seriously! Give me advice please, I badly need it! Thanks for the replies!

169,"So, there is this group of friends I've been hanging around with for a few months now,   

They tend to mess around lots in the chat, like removing people when they disagree with them etc... One day I said I was seeing my other friends from high school, they removed me from that chat because of it, I messaged one of them asking why and if they could stop, I told her about how I've been struggling with anxiety and depression ever since I was 15, (I'm now 20) and how they really helped me overcome it and how they mean't allot to me. She said that they where only messing around and they added me back, they said they mess around all the time but don't mean it, So I decided to try and join it, just messing around but not meaning it.   


So anyway another day came and one of them posted a picture of there dog in the chat, I was bored and decided to edit it, I rubbed out the dogs face area, not thinking and only experimenting and messing around with the photo editor and posted it in the chat. So they removed me from the chat again, I didn't think anything of it. So after 2 days I asked one of them if they could add me back and she ignored me, I then noticed that I could still see the other chat and they where all saying stuff like, ""Just ignore him"" and ""can someone tell him to fuck off"" and ""I cringe every time he messages"" and ""That's so fucked up"" also ""That's so weird, and he's weird"", they where also complaining about when I mentioned to them how I used grindr once and how it was a horrible app, (I'm Bi) and they started complaining about that too.    


So I asked them why they where saying all of that and they said that it was a bit weird what I did but they said they don't care about it anymore and didn't mean it, said they where only messing and that I should stop taking everything so seriously. My anxiety went right up again. 

At this point I don't know if I went over the top a little or is it them?  

I'm just so confused, it it me, or is it them?

170,"Hey there, 
So I met this girl and fell in love .. kind of. We had sex a few times and it was pretty amazing. She said she never wanted anyone more than me when it comes to sex - that felt good.
But beside that she's just an amazing person with amazing talents  and interests.

But she doesn't want a relationship. She will go clubbing on the weekend and doesn't want me to be there as well because she wants to feel ""free"" since she's single and is scared of just clinching to me.

I'm unsure how to deal with the situation. It's her choice and that's fine but I still have strong feelings about her and thinking about what she said and might do makes me feel pretty bad.

Any advice?",08Mar2018,1

176,"This will be long, so please forgive me in advance for the essay you're about to read. 

I'm 22F and have been with my OH since I was 16. The last six years have been messy and majority of our relationship has been bad over good. He has physically and verbally abused me on numerous occasions and yet my fear of abandonment and loneliness made me stay. I stuck around each year cause when we were good, we were really good and I'd store every little detail and relive those moments in the bad. 

Three years into the relationship I caught him sexting other women and despite my hurt, I forgave him and stuck around. He has this way with words where he'll make me feel so guilty, like it was my fault he looked elsewhere and he has used his words against me in the most powerful way. He has broken me and made me a shell of the person I used to be. 

I think back now with sadness because I didn't leave then or the first time he ever laid his hands on me. I feel shame and weakness. I feel stuck. 

Last year I found out I was pregnant and gave birth to a beautiful little girl. She is my absolute world and even though everything I've ever been through is terrible, she is my little miracle. After her birth I found out my partner was going clubbing behind my back. I was hurt that he wasn't truthful and suspicious as well but again I stupidly forgave him, wanting my child to grow up with two parents in the same home. As I have struggled with many issues from my parents splitting. 

Tonight I found him sexting again and I know I'm completely done. All the hurt and pain he's ever caused me has pushed me to a final point where I need to leave not just for me but for my daughter, so that she can grow up and witness true love. 

My issue is that I live with him and am dependent on him financially. I have no where else to go and need to think of my baby before anything. I'm scared to go to shelter as I have no idea what it'll be like. I do have family but there over an hour away and im worried OH will come and cause trouble there. Please don't put me down or say hurtful things as I have told myself the same things over and over again. 

T L ; D R

He is terrified of not being able to sleep and also worries about getting dependent on sleeping pills. He can be very logical, but with this I just can't understand his approach.
He'll often take the pill and then spend hours on his phone, or just decide that he'll need more without trying with the small does, or he'll take a smaller dose than normal and lie in bed for hours and then complain that it isn't working.
I want to be supportive, and I really feel like I could help, since I have very strong feelings about sleep hygiene. I know part of his problem is his approach, and getting rid of the fear of not being able to fall asleep. But when we talk about it, he agrees with everything I say, and then doesn't do what I suggest.

We all started with lots of enthusiasm and did really well and our first year and then life happened we all started to get busy with other things and weren't has driven as we had been to start. Ebb and flow is normal.  

Anyway, we have all kind of being on an unofficial brake for I guess  about 6 months, messaging every now and then, but not meeting and rehearsing like we used too ( mostly because we all really busy with work). 
And the she announced that she's disbanding the group and actually retiring from performing altogether, and I'm so low key devastated. 

She's started a group where she's selling most of her costumes, including her (very expensive/ new/ custom made) costume we each had made/ hand made for our group, and it's kind of hitting home that she isn't coming back.  
I was visiting her about buying a few things and then messaging a really close friend saying along the lines of ""omg I'm so sad,it's all hitting home, and I thought she would come back but now I see her selling all of her group costumes and I don't think she will, and I'm sad"" blah blah ( slightly more eloquently than that) - and had a start thinking omg am I in the right thread, what if I sent that to her by accident, and *then* I thought, maybe I should send that to her by accident, it might be nice for her to read and know how much she'll be missed?",08Mar2018,3

The front door to our apartment is identical to the one I had at home, where I lived since I was a baby and until October. The front door has a bolt, and quite often I automatically lock it when I come home. This is because my mother (who was the only other person in the house) insisted I close the bolt every night before we go to bed, so now I do it instinctively.

Today I did so, and my roommate couldn't open the door when he came home. Luckily I was sitting in the living room so I jumped up to open it. He started yelling at me - he thinks I do it on purpose to piss him off! He said, ""either you're doing it on purpose or you're an idiot"". What an asshole!

I live in a flat with 3 other people. We're two women and two guys. None of us knew each other before moving in, we just rented separate rooms and have a shared kitchen and bathroom.

Over the past few months strange stuff has been happening. Food has consistently gone missing from the kitchen and fridges, stuff seems to get moved around. Up until last night when someone took some cookies from the fridge and clearly shaved their beard in the common bathroom's sink. Now here's the funny part, neither of the two people that can shave actually shaved.

I doubt the two girls took anything, especially because some of their food has also gone missing. The other guy is REALLY gay, and he really doesn't seem like the guy that would steal food, not to mention he also had food stolen from him.

That leaves me. I never had anything big taken, however I never leave anything prepared that could be taken (lost stuff so far have been cookies, pieces of cake, leftovers). I know I haven't taken anything but this has gotten so bad that I've actually started thinking that I might be sleepwalking and eating stuff without remembering it.

But then that still doesn't explain the stubble that was left in the bathroom.

We had a few homeless people and junkies breaking into the building's staircase, most times they either shoot up on the stairs or sleep close to the entrance. Would it be that unlikely that one of them somehow got a pair of keys from an old tenant and is now able to get in the flat?

Someone moved in around a month ago and all was fine until suddenly we started getting people ringing our doorbell. All my flat neighbours said they too received people ringing their doorbell and asking to get in so they can go to Flat A.

We thought nothing of it until officers came one day to ask to see Flat A. Inspectors came and asked around and told us not to open the door anymore. Next thing I hear, someone has broken into the apartment and we start seeing people climbing the flat to get in.

Our flat block is located in the middle of a residential area and a lot of people have reported this to the police and council. We have been told that police and council know about it but that's all we know. Our landlord has told us to report it to the police whenever something suspicious has happened.

197,"Scroll down for TL;DR

Backstory: moved 8hrs from my home (that I moved to to be with my husband) to help take care of my sick mother. This involved us moving in with her and my step father till we got jobs and an apartment. My step father had sexually abused me during my childhood, but she chose to stay with him even after finding that out. I didn't have contact with her until I learned she was sick. Anyway, we moved in on December 20th, my husband got a job, but I was so busy taking care of her and finances were okay enough to allow me to put off getting a job at the time. We spent pretty much all of our savings getting down here to where she was... but we were told we didn't need to worry. That, in exchange for helping her and being here, they'd house and feed us till we got on our feet. Flash forward to January 19th and my step father messages my mother on Facebook to tell her he's leaving her for another woman. That was it. He didn't come back. Made a new Facebook and tried to get our power and water shut off for no reason. My mother was a mess and I nearly killed myself trying to take care of her and pretty much baby her to the point of having to sit up with her till she fell asleep. I was exhausted... I slept maybe 2hrs a night. Wasn't eating regularly due to stress... Then on Tuesday of this week I wake up to her and my grandmother carrying her stuff out of the house. That's how I learned she was leaving to go be with him somewhere she refused to tell anyone about. I cut her off completely. I've been devastated. That she'd go back to the person that violently abused her daughter is unforgivable. I'd given her a 2nd chance she didn't deserve after she chose to stay with him. After he left her, she begged us to not find an apartment but stay with her instead. She couldn't afford to live here alone and didn't want to be alone in an empty house. The problem is... we are still here. In the house she abandoned. With her animals she abandoned. The rental agreement is in her name and his. The rent is past due and all of the bills are due. When she was here, she paid the rent and we paid everything else. We cannot afford to live here on our own. So my question is... what would you do if you were in our shoes? We don't have the funds to move back home, and I don't want to pay her bills. I'd rather try to find a low income apartment and try to piece our life back together until we have enough saved to move back permanently. We have a very limited amount of time to get something figured out and get out of this house..  So any tips would be so incredibly appreciated.

TL;DR 
Moved in with my sick mother to care for her. She left to be with abusive step father, abandoned the house and animals. Now we're left here with all the bills due that we previously split. Not enough money to cover everything. Need to figure something out fast before we're evicted and/or utilities are shut off. ",08Mar2018,0

Wife cheated multiple times. Finally walked out. It was a really bad break up.

Had shared custody of 2 kids. I tried to be the parent that gets them ready for life and be stern. Mom wanted to be their ""friend"".

One has Aspergers, one only slightly. It is sometimes difficult to have conversations with them because of that.

Now 4 years later they are all coming down to visit her family. The boys want to see their new sister (daughter with new wife). We have plans for them to visit.


I don't know if I want to see them. I don't know if I can handle the pain of seeing them again and them having them leave again. I do admit it I do have some resentment towards them for picking her after all she did to me.

I am thinking of telling them I do not want to see them.

I realize this could be one of those moment in life when you look back and say I screwed up. If I say I don't want to see them I may never again see them again. I also might have piece and move on with life without them. I am concerned I may also bitch them out from all the built up resentment and also make it worse and they wont want to vistt again.

The industry is tough on its own but when you have to constantly deal with incompetent people and an angry boss, it starts really coming down on you. People quit because they are unhappy and we have no one to cover for them. Then we have to pull long hours last minute. If you haven't guessed, I work as a security guard in a high-end condominium. I am super good at this job. I am great with customer service but can also be firm when needing to be. I'm very detail-oriented and my memory is exceptional. I'm good at but it's not making me feel fulfilled anymore, although not sure if it ever was. So with the all these constant stresses, I also have to deal with very demanding residents that nag, question and berate me about my job. I have done so much for this condo and it's staff but I rarely have any acknowledgements, just a lot of bitching from my boss about how incompetent everyone is. I don't want to do it anymore.

However, I am on standby and don’t care to cover for people with emergencies. Should I tell my boss? She’s very fond of me and she is disappointed and angry in them.

205,"I recently started working at a new company, and met a girl that started about two weeks before I did. 

We didn’t really interact much during the first week, but eventually she started wandering into my area, and talking with me a lot.

She started doing things like showing off pictures of herself, mentioning her ex still messages her, (though she says she never replies), hugging me, and just generally spending a lot of time around me. Once, I did something that made her laugh, and she bit her lip afterwards, but I was oblivious until someone else pointed out she was flirting with me. 

When she found out she was a little embarrassed and said “since when is talking flirting?” but still manages to wander out and hang around me one some days. It has become an inside joke between us, and she’ll often say things like “oh don’t stand too close!”, suggesting we hold hands when going to lunch jokingly, and just generally joking about flirting.  

Some days I don’t see her much, but we usually have brief moments of banter, and then there are days she quite obviously comes out just to see me. She came out once complaining of being cold in her office, but then I walked by later and her window was open, as it was rather warm out. 

I’d like to make the most of these little moments together, and try to subtly flirt with her, though I’m not really the greatest at socializing. Apparently I’m doing something right, ish, but I could use some pointers. I really like her, but often freeze in the moment and have great responses 10 minutes after the conversation ends. 

She uses the time clock in my dept, so I see her at least four times a day, usually more. There is also a soda machine in her dept, and I usually grab water from it several times a day. I’ve thought those would be good times to drop by briefly and chat for a few minutes, but I’m not 100% sure how, haha. I don’t have a work reason to interact with her in the workplace, so it makes it a little difficult to have an excuse to talk to her.

I lived a very sheltered life in high school, only playing video games, eating, and getting by in high school. Now, I'm in university, and I feel so far behind everyone else. Everyone seems to have a passion, know way more about life than me, and so on. Being a sophomore, I believe that last year was the first year where I started living real life. I learned how to talk to people last year. Like I said, I'm super behind everyone else, and have developed super bad habits, as well as no passions, talents, and hobbies. I'm often mean to my parents, even though I know that I'm here in life because of them. I haven't worked for my spot at all. I also have a lot of deep seated psychological habits, like being judgemental, and comparing myself to others. All I do is work on school so I can graduate, and sit at home feeling sorry for myself. When I look at others, I don't know how I can bring myself to come out of my shell and become who I want to be. To be honest, I don't even know who I want to be. I feel so pathetic compared to anyone else. How can I make myself better? Where do I start? Should I change my mindset? What should I do? I'm so confused.

I attended a university last semester that was 6 hours away and I loved the Independence but didn't like the school itself. I was unhappy and depressed so I moved back home and attended a community College where ive found a girlfriend and have many friends and im much happier. The issue is my parents, they like to give me a curfew and require me to come home from my Girlfriends house because they worry im a burden in their home and that we will get sick of each other. They aslo worry about drunk drivers on the road and me being out that late which is understandable but I don't understand how they let me be on my own 6 hours away. They say that now im in their home I have to follow their rules which includes disclosing what I do with friends, why im going to certain places and what me and my girlfriend do. My mom also is very critical of my physical appearance and compliments me one minute and then tells me my face and hair look like shit and I need to get something done about it. Im sick of being micromanaged as a 19 year old adult. Every time I ask to grow and have independence they just laugh at me and say im naive.

217,"I am middle aged . I  was brought up in a protective environment. Parents were narcissists. But  loved me, they did,  in their own fashion. They wanted me to be always with them,  for their own insecurities . The same goes for my brother too. 

My mother does a lot physically , for me, still does. But like an ignorant illiterate she had crushed my feelings. She many a time behaved more like a mother in law. Would not recognize any of  my efforts. I would say that she did these more out of ignorance than out of spite, because she herself was/ is self unaware and is a pampered daughter. ( Yes,  today she is proud of my achievements , though she does not vociferously proclaim, but unknowingly she has snubbed and invalidated my efforts many a time)

Now this is my back ground.

Could be my lack of concentration or lack of  self confidence,  as I have had plenty of negatives in my life. Yes,  today I stand tall having climbed over all of them.

218,"I'm 21 years old and currently live with my parents, not really out of the ordinary. I work as basically an assistant-assistant manager at a hardware store and make a little under 30k a year after taxes, and I've got about 11k saved up in the bank. I don't have a degree of any kind and I've been working at this store for the past four years.

My situation is this: A very good friend of mine accepted a job a couple hours drive from where I live now, just over state lines in a state I'd much rather live in than the one I live in now. He offered me and a few other friends of mine the opportunity to move in with him and rent a house.

This is something that I want to do, but it's also something that I'm desperately scared to do. I've got about three and a half months to prepare to move if this is something I'm serious about doing.

Only major complications for this are 1, I like my current job and my boss has me on track for actual management opportunities down the road. 2, I've haven't applied for or gotten a job that my dad didn't help me get my foot in the door with and the only thing I feel I really have to offer is ""four years of retail experience"". 3, I don't know the first thing about living on your own.

Essentially this boils down to two choices for me. I can keep doing what I'm doing for a little bit and live inside my comfort zone and eventually move out when I actually feel like I'm too old to reasonably live with my parents. Or, I can take a risk, move somewhere I've never been, find a job that will likely be a step down from what I'm doing now, and try and make my way in the world with a couple good friends to have my back.

I like to try and understand the general consensus for most topics but It seems popularity=fact for a lot of people which makes me sad

Let's say, there's a really good album but it's in a genre of music that isn't well received by most. Most people will just say it sucks without giving it a chance because of the genre it's in.

Or for another example, lets say there's a really really powerful character in general and you put that character up against a more well known popular character but isn't as powerful. 
everyone will just automatically choose the one that's popular not the one that's actually stronger.

It's something like that. I always think about what (I think) most are thinking regardless of what's true and what isn't.

225,"I am in the brink of giving up and I have no idea where else can I ask for advice, honestly I don’t think my problem can be solved, I just want to rant. 

I have been seeing a girl for seven years and we really do love each other, we have known each other since high school and right now she is struggling in life. She is severely depressed with a bad case of anxiety disorder that makes her refuse to do any job that involves coordinating with strangers. Right now she is working as a part time tutor which can barely cover her daily needs. She does enjoy the work but really hates the commute and her employer never pays her on time. She currently lives in a place she hates but she is unable to move out because she won’t be able to pay rent. 

She pretty much tells me she wants to die every single day, how pointless her life is, and how she has no future. She is stressed every single day and it shows, she gets mad at every little thing and keeps telling me she wants to commit suicide. I know how selfish this sounds like but I can’t bear this anymore, the texts from her that contains nothing but complaints and suicidal messages are driving me insane. I love her and I don’t want to lose her but I can’t even help her financially because I am still finishing my study. I don’t know what to do. I want her to just get a job so that her life is more stable but I know I can’t force her. I can’t even tell her anything negative because I don’t want to push her over the edge.

 I feel like she is getting closer and closer to committing suicide and I am very afraid. On the other hand my mental health is getting really bad to the point that I am contemplating suicide myself just so that I don’t need to deal with this anymore. I am tired of her complaints, I am tired of her overreacting, raging, about every little things, I am tired of her suicidal messages, I know that if she kills herself it will be my fault because my effort is not good enough. The one thing that can solve her problem is her facing her fear and get a job that actually pays well but I know she can’t do that, she would sooner kill herself because it’s easier.

I have no idea what to do and probably there is no solution but I have nobody to talk to about this problem, I just want to get it off my chest. I can't just walk away from her because I know for sure she will kill herself if I do. I feel like I am responsible for her life and every single day feels like defusing a time bomb. I just can't take it anymore.

226,"So today in school, my two friends and I are playing cards in the last row during history class. That was when I briefly looked at the laptop of a girl that sits in front of me and i noticed that she was checking her Wattpad account. So stupid me got the great idea to look her account up and check out the things she wrote. A couple seconds later we're looking at a fanfiction she wrote and we're laughing our asses off.

So even more stupid me calls her name, turns around my laptop and asks her if it's okay if we read that, all while giggling like retarded 5-year olds. She just says ""please stop"" and turns around again. This is where I realized i fucked up. I immediately close my browser. My buddies are now searching for the fanfiction too but luckily they didn't memorize the name.

A couple minutes later, her friend turns around and just says ""WTF?"", and I ask her what's wrong. ""Your snapchat story?"", she replies and I start laughing again. For clarification, I had stickers of their heads and I put them on animals with the caption ""Old McDonald had a farm"", as a joke ofcourse. We often joke around how her friend looks like a giraffe, so i choose that and for the girl I picked a sheep, because I figured they are less offensive than a cow or a donkey. Great logic, I know. I still removed the picture. (It was only seen by like 5 people at that point but that doesn't matter)

It's 10 minutes until class ends now and I notice the girl is sobbing and her friend is comforting her. I stopped playing cards,  I couldn't pay attention to the lesson. At this point, I just felt terrible. Class ends and she immediately leaves the room. I follow her out.

I catch up to her and apologize, tell her I'm sorry. I ask her if we can talk, but she just walks right past me to the stairs. I was never in a situation where I pissed somebody off that badly before, so I didn't really know what to say. I just say ""I'm sorry"" and ""please"" over and over again. She tells me it's not funny and I should go back to class now, and so I do. (We now have religious studies, a class which she doesn't attend, but I do)

I immediately text her how sorry I am, that I crossed a line. How I don't want her to be sad because of me. She tells me all about how that Wattpad account was a part of her she was really insecure about, because she was afraid people would react the way we just did. And that picture I put on my story as a joke, she tells me how this is the first time in her life that she has felt comfortable with her body and I had to ruin it all and she doesn't need that. I apologize again, tell her how sorry I am. The last text I sent her was ""I don't know what else to say besides 'I am sorry' and 'I crossed a line'. Sorry for ruining your day"". She does not reply.

I don't know what to do now, that girl was a great friend of mine. I am currently struggling with depression and she was the only person I could talk to about literally anything. She is just so relatable and nice and I made her cry, probably made her hate me too. I really don't know what to do next. Should I text her again? Tell her that I'm an asshole and that this is the most disgusting thing I did in my life? I'm afraid that I am about to lose someone I deeply care about and the only person that could relate to me. Help me please.

Found my friends Wattpad account and posted a ""funny"" picture of her on my story. She started crying in class and I think she hates me now. Don't know what to do.",08Mar2018,10

228,"Hi Guys! 24[M] college studendt here.

My parents wanted to go on an exotic vacation, so they booked a flight to Bali in April. My father got an important job in the meantime, so he cant go, and he said i can go instead of him.(We have the same name, that's why only I can go instead of him.) If they cancel the flights they dont get back any money, because they bought it at discount price. The terms &amp; conditions clearly states that.

I'm okay with that, my mother planned out the vacation well, she really want to go, I'm also curious about that place.

Problem is my girlfriend of 6 years is really aginst it. When this thing came up I started searching for a flight for her also, the hotel would be paid by my parents, she only had to buy a plane ticket. For her a vacation like this, is more like a honeymoon destination, not a family vacation place. She stated that the two of us should go on vacation without parents, we live our own lives, they live thems. She's working full time, getting a good salary, saving up a lot, but don't want to pay for a vacation when it's not exclusively the two of us.
I can only plan cheaper vacations, my internship salary is low, i got other priorities now.

Gf already booked that I made the wrong decision. My mother dont want to go alone, so if I dont go with her, the price of the vacation stays in the airways pocket, and she'll be sad.

How can i make the least harm now? Is it okay that I go on vacation with my mother? Is my gf right or wrong? Help me, I don't know how to deal with this kind of drama.",08Mar2018,2

I took a career test with my therapist and none of the shit that comes up is anything that I would be good at or even interested in.

I'm taking remote classes with Moscow State University so they can give me a certificate proving my fluency level and until then I feel iffy about applying for jobs that give Russian language as a prerequisite. 


 I'm not qualified for too much right now tbh so that makes finding a job that's not a crappy sales job even harder, and I'm not really sure which angle to take when looking for a job or even what kind of jobs to apply for.

230,"Long story short, my father is a stroke victim so he doesn't have the ability to take care of himself. His sister takes care of him. I didn't really see her at all during my childhood and lived with my mother during my teenage years. I technically live with my father now but I take care of him (pick him up from falls, clean up when he shits on himself or the toilet, try to keep him from cooking since he forgets things are on the stove, etc).  My aunt lives down the street and fixes the meals since obviously we can't leave much food at our house. My younger brother also lives here.

She kind of treats me like a child. Which is an issue when I'm 22. She still takes my things, even things I've bought, to try to ""ground"" me, when my ""room"" isn't perfectly clean (it's an unfinished basement with a dresser,  a bed, and a TV stand). I'll admit I'm not the cleanest guy of all time, but its a basement. I have to ask to have any ""company"" over (you know what I mean), even a friend.  

She sometimes  tries to find me jobs, except they will usually be pretty awful minimum wage jobs like cashiering  at a grocery store, except she will tell them I can work any hours any day which usually results in her needing to drop me off, she then takes almost the entire check I make and says she needs it for gas money and me using up her time, even if it'd a 5 or 7 minute drive. Which obviously  leads to me not working very hard then getting fired since I know I won't actually see any of the money.   (So you know I'm not exaggerating, I made about 800 at my last job and only saw 50 dollars of it). 

I put family in the tittle since my uncle seems to silently agree with everything she does, and even pulls the strings at times. 

Last thing is I'm working on my second degree (it's an electrical engineering thing) I realized my general studies associates degree was useless and I figured even with just an associates in electrical engineering it would lead to more opportunities, and I can get it by the end of spring semester next year. I asked if I should quit school since I was wondering if it was worth it to stick it out here for 1 more year or just try to find a full time job and move out as quickly as humanly possible, even if the job is awful.

Since i am not attractive i started to become a little more on defensive with her, so people couldnt have any AMMO to bully me even more.
A month Goes by And i start to text her- which happened for 7 months - And mostly we talked about what would we do after High School And some deep shot And She would reply ""hahaha"" or ""lol you're hilárious""(which couldnt mean her interest or Just lack of things to respond).
In sophomore year we stopped talking at ALL but her seat was aligned with mine(i was 4 seats behind) And sometimes i would start looking at her, because i was Discovering my feelings for her, And most of times She looked back at me And give a flirty Smile but i was such a Coward that i would try to look away because i thought She would think i'm a creep(that i might be :/).
In senior year my deram became going to the best college in my state(most people in my School didnt even try to take the admission test because It was easier to take the university of my city), since It was that hard i started to took some extra preparatory classes.
For my surprise that cute girl also was there-she was one of the 6  out of 140 students of my classroom that wanted to Go to that college- , we began to talk again And this time i wasnt as deflective in conversations as before(because we were away from the School enviroment) And i Felt She was kinda flirty but i dindnt think It was intentional-just her way of making people feel good around her-.
It was all flowing really well until the results of the admission, She got accepted (in the graphic design course) but i wasnt (law school).So -i think- i was the First to congratulate her And also Felt devastated because my dream was crushed And the girl i like is moving to the capital of my state(aka:land of handsome Mens And the Netflix And chilli with cheeses And wine).

My first job after graduation had its ups and downs. I didn’t mind it, enjoyed it at times even. After 2 years at that job got a bit stale and I got promoted to a new position. It was great for about six months but then I felt overwhelmed and overworked. I began to resent it and was completely burnt out. I ended up at the dr. for a stress rash that covered my torso and legs in splotches. My husband wanted me to find  a job that I wasn’t working late so much for his sake and mine.

I found this new job, in the interview it seemed to be exactly what I’m looking for. After 3 months they handed me a bunch of extra work. I have found myself back in the same position. Stressed, working late, hating everything in general. 

I know I’m not doing as good as I could. Partially because this was not what was really sold to me in the interview (but that’s normal I guess). I have a bad attitude but can’t help it. People are getting frustrated with me, which makes me even more depressed since I really want to do a good job but can’t bring myself to do it. I know that I should work even more hours than I am right now but my husband is begging me not too.

I realized now that accounting is not for me, but I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t trust any place to be reasonable anymore. Kind of a “career depression” if that makes sense. It all looks bleak  since this job that looked great on the outside turns out to be terrible.

I’ve been thinking about taking a “career breather”. Taking a job that is just something hourly and basic to focus on my mental health and figure out what I want to do. It’ll probably cut my pay in half but my fiance agrees we can afford it (It’ll be admittedly tight). I worry about being overqualified, about what others will see in me taking a way lower job, or if I’ll even actually like it. 
Despite all these worries it’s what I keep coming back to.

I liken it to being on an island and seeing a boat flying the Jolly Roger coming up closer and closer, gradually, from a distance. Of course, when she is in the room with me I feel nothing but anger and rage.

I know there is no good outcome to this situation and that a horrible breakup is inevitable. As I told you before, my wife and I have completely different personalities. She is a maniacally driven workaholic who seems to believe that money and material success will ultimately make her happy. She is a classic narcissist (as well as borderline, paranoid and somewhat bipolar) who grew up in a violent home and area. She is mean and callous and exhibits bullying and manipulative tendencies.

She is pretty successful in her professional field and is a real go-getter, an extroverted networker. I am quiet, unassuming and somewhat childlike (but far from childish). A young lady of my acquaintance once told me that I had an ""innocence"" about me.

I grew up in an all-male institution and as a result am very quiet and guarded. Many women who know me (including my wife and mother) say that I am secretive and somewhat sneaky. While I do not exactly agree with this, I do admit that I do not often reveal much about myself to anyone. I do not know why this is except that I find it very bizarre that anyone would want me to tell them what I am thinking deep inside, what someone said to me in a conversation not involving the questioner, or other random details about my life.

I am not trying to hide anything from anyone - I am just a quiet, introverted person who is wary about revealing very much about my inner feelings and inner life (so why am I posting? I am at my wit's end and have nobody to talk to).

In any event, ever since I was about 48 or so, I have come to feel that I am a failure in life. You may or may not believe this from my writing, but I am (or was) a very, very intelligent person. I tested genius level on IQ tests as a child and could have graduated from high school and college very early.

The reason I did not was that my school did not believe in this type of accelerated education. So, strangely, I was an indifferent student throughout my school years because I really never had to expend much energy to maintain an A average. While my friends and housemates went to mandatory study time, I read comic books or listened to music. I simply was not challenged at all, especially during my junior and senior years in high school. I pretty much didn't even go to class senior year.

Still, I graduated third in my class and was able to gain admission to an Ivy League school. There, I struggled academically at first but improved my concentration and work ethic. I was not an academic star but was able to graduate on time. However, despite having a few friends and being involved in some activities that I liked, I was extremely isolated because I could not find anyone to love or, failing that, anyone to have sex with. Pretty horrible situation to be in in college where guys and gals (at least some of them) hooked up with each other on a regular basis.

Even though I was a musician and an athlete, I was overweight, ugly and clueless about how to relate to the opposite sex. Not a great combination. I don't know if any woman was ever interested in me, but if they were, I had no idea and wouldn't have known what to do about it. I considered myself a loser because I couldn't get a woman.

I didn't have sex until three nights before graduation, and didn't have a relationship with anyone until I met my wife three years after that. I was greatly attracted to her spirit and of course her looks, but doubted her motivation for wanting me. I thought she was very intelligent and personable, but the fact that she had been a teenage mom had given me pause.

Combine that with her insane family and scary background and issues that rivaled mine, and that even from the beginning I noticed some things I just didn't like about her, I continued to date and become serious about her.

Why? Well, I was inclined to believe that I had to ""settle"" for her - note that this is in quotes. Even though I regret getting married because much about our life together has been hell, she is not someone I consider inferior. Just different. We came from different worlds. It's just that I felt it wasn't in the cards for me to find someone who might have been compatible.

When you're a man with a deep need for love and affection (as well as the sex drive of a jackrabbit) but don't kiss a woman until you're 22 and don't have a girlfriend until you're 25, you start to believe that if you don't find someone - anyone, soonest! - you will be alone for the rest of your life. I knew lots of men in that situation, guys in their 40s and 50s who simply had nobody in their life, and they were sad, bitter, defeated people. I didn't want to be those guys.

Despite opposition from my family and meddlesomeness from hers, I felt that we could make it. But despite being together for more than 25 years - I don't think we have made it. We have been at each other's throats (and it's getting worse and worse) since the beginning, and I have grown tired of her domineering, bossy personality. She has gotten tired of my sullen, sometimes furious reaction to her personality.

She sleeps downstairs in the living room; I sleep in the bedroom (her choice, not mine). Our finances are in a state of crisis because although she makes a lot of money (when she works; her work projects are sometimes intermittent) I have been unemployed a lot, I am still undercompensated, and she likes to spend money.

She has threatened to divorce me many times, and I have refused to cooperate because I wanted to raise my kids. In absolute terms, the younger one is about to graduate from HS (2019) and I would not ultimately mind a divorce. But I still fear the nastiness and absolute hell the process will unleash as well as the prospect of being one those lonely, bitter old men who have no chance for sex, love or companionship.

It terrifies me, really, and I don't want to be one of those losers. In my life I have already spent too much time there.

I have had some really bad breaks in life, and I am angry and bitter about them. I have also squandered or potentially squandered opportunity. I hate my job and am so depressed about my personal and professional life I can hardly bring myself to go to work. And it is definitely hurting my job performance. I simply am very bored and preoccupied and cannot concentrate on my work.

I have tried counseling on and off for years with varying degrees of success. I have two counselors now - one male I have seen for a year and a female I just began seeing. I don't know if they will help in the long run, but it is good to be able to talk with someone so my head doesn't explode. The psychiatrists won't give the the medicine I think I might need because of another health condition. So I can't even take any drugs (not that I want them, but I am so desperate I will try anything).

But I can still see beauty and good things and good people. I am not mad at the world. But I am miserable. And save some time from about 1995 to 1998, I have always been miserable. I hate my life. I don't have a marriage, I don't have a sex life, and my professional situation stinks. If I didn't have kids, I seriously would think about killing myself.

I am not suicidal but I do have suicidal ideation. I have definitely given up on life, because I don't see any way out of this mess. I really do not care whether I live or die, because I feel like a useless failure who can't get anything going. I feel my life has been a waste, and I don't want this life anymore.

Does anyone have any suggestions, observations?",08Mar2018,6
245,"To start off, I’m very promiscuous. I’ve been this way for a while because I like sex as a way to deal with my inner turmoil and depression. My friends used to joke about me being a “slut”, but they didnt mean it, because they didn’t know that part. It was all fun and games and I was fine with it. After all, wasn’t it the truth?  I had sex with just about every guy I came across that said I was pretty.  But I draw a line at willingly cheating with my best-friend’s bf. I loved her too much to do that.


One night I was at a party she put together.
I was only a little drunk but I was really tired so I told her I was leaving. She said I should not leave because the party was barely started and told me to rest in her bedroom for a little bit and come back when I was ready. I agreed and went to her room and fell asleep.


About 15 minutes later the door opened. I thought it was my friend and was shocked to see her boyfriend. He locked the door behind him, sat down on the bed, and started talking to me. I casually talked to him too but I wasn't stupid. He had showed interest in me before and I knew what he wanted but I wasn't about to betray my best friend. Before he got the wrong idea I said I was going back to the party. It was too late. He wouldnt let me leave and kissed me. Normally I would've loved this opportunity but I cared about my friend more than I cared about myself. I pushed him away and told him I wasn't going to do that to (his gf’s name). It wasn't any use. I was still slightly drunk and I'm very petite, and no match for his very athletic build. He pushed me on the bed, covered my mouth, and had sex with me. Afterwards, he told me that “it wasnt rape  If you enjoyed which you probably did because you are a slut. No one will believe I had to force someone so easy to have sex with a guy like me.” I was crying and asked him how he could do this to my friend? She was going to be hurt if she found out. He laughed and said she doesn't have to, then left. The rape didn't bother me as much as the fact that I would lose my best friend if this got out. Too ashamed to face her, I snuck out of the party. 
 

Long story short, the guy bragged to his friends that I had sex with him and it got out.  My friend and him broke up, but she was devastated. She confronted me by my locker one day. She called me a bitch, an ugly whore, and told me she knew being friends with a slut would bite her in the ass one day. I asked her if we could go in private to discuss it. Then I said I didnt have a choice in the matter. Of course, she didnt believe me and said regret sex is not rape. She slapped me and left.


All of the girls are bullying me. Calling a whore, prostitute, making comments like,” If that filthy slut ever hooked up with my boyfriend, Id kill her hahaha!” No one will talk to me. Sometimes boys and girls will shove me, slap books out of my hands, stuff like that. I once even overheard the boy who raped me saying “...yeah and now she’s making up stories. Who would have to force a girl like her who will fuck anything and everything she can shove in her pussy? Shes crazy! You got to look out for girls like that.” To his group of friends.

I haven't been to school in 5 days. Im too scared and hurt and I don't know what to do.

249,"Recently my SO and I broke up, and now I'm just caught in a confusing drift of how I can meet someone else, as I did before meeting her. Honestly the only way I met my ex was through work, and now I've learned my lesson about dating co-workers and such.

I don't start college until this fall, and I have no idea what I can do to meet other people and possibly find someone special. One side of me wants to believe these things take time and I shouldn't be rushing it, another side honestly wants the affection that I had from my previous relationship. It's hard going from having affection, then to not having it at all (and to be more personal, it was hard when my ex just suddenly went cold on me and didn't want to see me at all, for reasons I have no idea. She just said she didn't like me anymore. Then we broke up).

People always tell me that I have to put myself out there and meet new people (by people I mean the answers I got from this subreddit from throwaway accounts like this one), and honestly I have no idea how to do that. Honestly I'm stuck, I have the friends I hang out with now, I go to work, and I stay home. Those are the only things I currently do in life. ",08Mar2018,5
251,"I [24M] am probably about to be hired in a job that's going to pay me out the wazoo, plus handle all of my insurance. I'm gonna be living pretty comfortably, and I'm very generally lucky to have gotten to this point.

My friend [22M], on the other hand, is a really unlucky person. Just about everything that could go wrong in somebody's life has gone wrong in his life at least once. He had an accident before I met him that left him with a mobility disorder, and I haven't asked for any details, but apparently he can't get any insurance that will actually help him handle it.

I'm pretty sure if he moved into whatever home I get, I could say he's a romantic partner and get him on my insurance, but I'm not 100% sure that it would work or that it's legal. I don't have any qualms about pretending that, and I feel like I ought to help somehow or another. I'm a person who takes relationships slow, so it's unlikely I would get an actual romantic partner I'd want to claim on insurance anytime soon.

253,"Hello all!i kinda got into a predicament last night! So, without further ado, I was at my job doing my thing just came back from my break. We had about an hour and half left before shift ends, so my boss tells me and my co worker to find this guy named bob who runs a department that we gotta take stuff to towards the end of the night and he’s gotta let us know how much to bring and and when to bring it. And thats about all we had left to do for the night. And me being a fairly new employee (3-4 weeks) i went along with because ive never met bob and itd set me up for a easier time if im ever alone and gotta run stuff in. So off we go to talk to bob. Well we get to his department and hes busy helping a customer so he just tells us to hold on a minute, no big deal right?
Well this is where it gets dicey, the general manager comes over and asks us what we’re doing, so we tell him we’re waiting for bob cause we have stuff to run in. He asks us if we need two people to do that? We look at each other kinda confused and say no i guess not, and he proceeds to tell us “okay well how about you guys get the fuck outta here then” this is where i kinda was blown away, so him being head honcho of the place we just listen to him and start walking outside where we usually work, well my co worker was talking to me about it while we were walking out and our GM was escorting us more of less to the doors and heard us talking and thought we were laughing at him. So he tells my co worker to go clock out and leave so then we start walking towards the station where you clock in and out and im walking a bit further ahead because them two were getting into it a bit, he then asks me if i was laughing and i told no no one was laughing and thought i was calling him a liar so he told me to clock out and i said why i havent done anything, so he says well no fucking shit you arent doing anything you were standing there! (When i was waiting for bob) so i kinda try and explain to him what happened and he cuts me off and i ask if i can speak and he says no you cant youre gonna listen and then i tell him this is 100% unexcept-able  and that you cant just keep cussing and talking down on me and that i want to file a complaint. He kinda shrugs it off and says send in your damn complaints ill be waiting to read them. Then he tells me to clock out and leave so i do. Idk if a complaint will do anything or even if i can get my job back but am i wrong for standing up for myself??

255,"I have been sat next to a young girl at work for nearly four months now and she’s honestly making my working life a misery. She talks non-stop all the time and distracts me from my work. I have mentioned this to my manager and he hadn’t done anything. I now wear headphones and flat out ignore but yet she still talks at me.

She asks me questions constantly that she should already know the answer too. There is about 4 other people she could ask but she can’t be bothered to get up and ask them (she herself has insinuated that). She can’t be bothered to learn so she just asks me things all the time. Sometimes it’s the second I walk through the door and even whilst I am on my break. I have been told her repeatedly to ask someone else but she won’t leave me alone. 

She has no social skills at all which is fair enough but  seem to have any clue how disruptive she is being. She’s incredibly loud and takes things out of context quite often. Her loudly repeating what I have said out of context across the office is making me look foolish. She talks out loud regardless of if I am listening or it making it look like we are talking rather then working. 90% of the time I am not even listening to her. 

Today I got so overwhelmed I snapped at her several times. I really can’t take anymore of her and so my question is: do I have the right to ask to be put at another desk? This would involve someone moving and sitting next to her. I just feel like I have ‘done my time’ as selfish as that sounds.

257,"Here's the story. 
I liked this chick and I told her, this was last year and she had a BF. I backed of a bit and we just spoke as friends. Anyways, last day of school last year, she told me she was falling for me, she still had a boyfriend at the time, but also said that she didn't want one because it was our last year of school this year and wanted to focus on it. I understood and we decided to be friends.

Fast forward to this year, she is in my class, and one day a mutual friend told me she broke up with her BF but apparently it was really bad break up. I didn't do anything, but then our school was having a Valentine's day ball, and I asked her to it and she said yes. The day came and we had a great time, I mentioned that we should do something out of school and she said not so soon which I guess is understandable. 

Here's the problem, at the moment I feel like she is being super distant we're in the same class and we barely speak, I don't know what is going on anymore, I know I need to be patient but I still want to speak to her but I feel like she's distancing herself. I'm not so good at conversation and if the other person does not atleast try to make an attempt I give up, this is also the case when message, she would reply with one words or stuff like that, we spoke more in the holidays then we do now which I would imaging ten opposite to happen.

258,"3 days ago I ordered a Dell refurbished laptop with a pentium 2.56ghz CPU. Checked the order form and specs were exactly as I ordered with an expected delivery date of 21/03/18. Yesterday I received an email saying It would be delivered today at an unspecified time with no option to deliver to neighbor or change time. I was a little annoyed because I would have to take a day off. Today my laptop arrived I boot it up and noticed it seemed slower than I expected. Check out the specs and it is a 1.6ghz CPU. Contact customer service and eventually talk to someone who claims they meant up to 2.56. So by their rational I'm lucky to get a CPU over 0.01ghz. and My only option I have is to take another day off for them to collect it. I double checked my order form it says intel pentium N3710 (4C, 2M Cache, 2.56 GHz, 6w) I look at outlet.euro.dell.com inventory some say specific CPU speeds others say up to.

259,"I hope this is the right sub for this. So, today in one of my classes, a lecturer gave us all balloons. Some people were excited, some were not. Anyways,he said the topic today would be stress management.  He told us to blow the balloons to be as big as we want them to be(we each had one balloon). He then told us to split into two groups: one is for ppl who loves balloons(A), one for ppl who hates/are scared them(B). So, we did.

Then he told group A to squeeze their balloons as hard as they can until it pops. He told them to do this in front of group B. Cue the loud poppings and ppl screaming. Group A is having fun, but majority of group B are covering their ears and retreating to the back of the class. This went on for about 5 minutes. Then, I noticed one of the girls in group B is crying. Like, full blown sobbing. She's covering her head, sitting down on the floor, sobbing. Her friend is beside her, trying to comfort her but to no avail. She's fucking terrified. Every single time a balloon pops, she's visibly shaking. The lecturer saw this happening but ignores it.

Then, he turned to group B and told them to pop THEIR own balloons. Keep in mind that most of these people can't stand balloons. Some can't stand the sound, some just fucking hates them in general, and some, like the girl, are absolutely terrified. These people are barely holding their own balloons. Now obviously majority of them refused. But the lecturer presses on saying things like ""You have to overcome your fears"" ""This is stress management"" ""It's not a big deal, if group A can do it so can you"" ""You'll feel so much better after you pop them"", shit like that.

Group A is having a blast so they keep on telling group B to just pop them already. Eventually, some of them did it. Then it comes to the girl. She's crying and shaking her head, while the lecturer calls her out in front of the class and keep saying things like ""It's just a balloon"" or whatever. Eventually, her friend grabs the girl's balloon, pops it, and brings the girl out of the class. She's probably pissed at the lecturer. Everyone in group B was forced to pop their balloons. By the time they finished, literally 5 people in the room are fucking crying and the rest of group B are down. 

Normally, I wouldn't be so concerned if everyone was having a good time. I can see how this could be a stress management activity. But what I saw today was that it doesn't help at all. Sure, group A are having fun but what about group B? I mean, if people are literally crying and rocking back and forth on the floor shouldn't you at least stop? And maybe don't force people to do something they obviously hated? Yeah, overcoming your fear is a great thing, but it's not gonna happen overnight. Nor is it gonna happen in one class? And forcing people to overcome their fears (or calling them out in front of the entire class) isn't gonna make it any better. 

I feel so bad for the girl and the other people in group B. One of them is my friend and she started crying as soon as she went back to her seat. I thought this activity was supposed to reduce our stress or something but i feel like it's adding a whole lot more stress on other ppl. Idk i feel like the lecturer crossed a line. Is doing this okay? Am I overreacting over something silly? If it's not okay, what should I do about it?",08Mar2018,35

My original idea is just the word “Somehow”
New idea is “Somehow I’ll be”

Which sounds better?

There’s a bunch of different meanings behind the tattoo, but it’s mainly in reference to “Somehow I’ll be strong” which is a song lyric in Disney’s Hercules. I don’t want the full lyric though, because I want it to be open ended. Like that no matter what it is, somehow I’ll get through it. ",08Mar2018,1
281,"My friend today got into a fight with the class bully.

The class bully threw chairs at him, wrecked his recently broken hand and kicked him in the balls.

He didn't think my friend would stand up after all so he ran. He hid in the doorway and when my friend got into the doorway he smacked the Door onto him. There's a large hole in the door now (From my friends face).

Should be the bullies fault? Well, no.

He (Bully) has 6 friends that totally lied about it and said plain out lies.

Now my friend is in risk of getting kicked out of school for something he didn't do. We (7 people in total) tried going to the principal but he believes only the bully and told us to fuck off (literally...).

Were heartbroken at the fact we’ll have to kill our child, me especially.

287,"Ever since my mother got married to my step-dad and had three children, she hasn’t really done much with her life. Of course when they were younger, being a stay at home mother was beneficial to raise them. But now they are teenagers and she isn’t “needed” like she was, but she refuses to go out and get a job.

My step-dad makes decent money, but he has to work A LOT of overtime to keep my families heads above water. His job is pretty physically demanding and involves shift work, which alone is pretty draining mentally. 

It would be a bit different if my mother was a productive person, but for the most part- she isn’t. She doesn’t really do much with her day. She mostly just lays around and watches television. Once in a while she will clean the bathroom, and she does keep up with laundry, but that’s about it.

The house isn’t in the best condition either. In fact, I’m pretty sure our back deck should be ripped apart and replaced. I don’t believe it’s safe. It’s very old and has never been replaced as long as we’ve lived here, and the house wasn’t brand new when we moved in. If they were to sell this house, I’m certain they would not get much money for it because of the state that it’s in. My mother could be fixing little things here and there throughout the day (new paint jobs, fixing holes in the wall, etc) but she doesn’t... she leaves it up to my step-dad to deal with and he never has time to do it.

She seems really unmotivated when it comes to my siblings too. My youngest brother is pretty athletic and she doesn’t go to any of his games. She didn’t go to a single one of my games when I was younger either, which really hurt my feelings and I would imagine it hurts my brothers too. She doesn’t seem to want to do anything other than watch YouTube, my littlest brother actually came to me for help because he was worried about a test. I helped him study and I could tell he really appreciated it. If my sister does artwork on the driveway, she will just quickly look out the window instead of physically going outside and looking. 

Those are just some examples, but it’s just really frustrating to watch her do nothing with her life when I know she’s capable of doing SOMETHING. She doesn’t have any disabilities or any reason not to work. She just doesn’t.

Any advice on how to handle this matter?

289,"So a couple months ago I was on an icy roadway and swerved to avoid the person in front of me. I successfully avoided her vehicle and got myself off the roadway. She claims I hit her car, and proceeds to show me that her license plate cover thingy is cracked (haha). My car isn't damaged, but she insists. She takes a picture of my license plate and now she's trying to get her insurance company to hunt me down. The police already confirmed my car has no damage. BUT I'm a complete idiot and scraped roughly the exact place my vehicle would have had to hit her about a week ago. I do have a photo of my car from the day of the incident but it's super dirty so it's not great evidence. How do I prevent this crazy woman from ""winning"" when I finally do let her insurance company see my car? 

I'm currently thinking my options are:

1) repair the damage before showing the insurance company, which means screening their calls for who knows how much longer

292,"So I [25M] have a friend [25F] and we have know each other since school (14 years) and we’re best friends we’re are really close spend a lot of time together go out together and I’m close with her family also.

Now as I said we have know each other for a long time but we have only been as close as we are the last two years and back in September 2017 I told her that I liked her more then a friend  and that I wasn’t asking her out I just wanted to let her know how I feel about her and she told me then that she was open to it or as she put it “the door is open” 

(now for extra context the reason I didn’t ask her out is because before she had been in a relationship for five years and broke up with her partner June 2016 he was unfaithful and because of that she has been as she put it “scared and broken” she also suffers from depression and it’s hard for her to love somebody like that ever again and long before I told her I liked her she mentioned she doesn’t think because of what’s happened to her she’s ready for a relationship and she just needs to work on fixing herself again so this I why I didn’t ask her out and I’m the middle of all these she’s had to deal with 2 deaths in her family so I didn’t want to pressure her because if this also)

Now in the same month of September I noticed she started becoming more relaxed and comfortable around me for example sometimes she would FaceTime me in the bath completely where I can see her breasts and she wasn’t bothered she’s even sent me multiple nude photos and videos and asked me what I think which if you can imagine started become slightly confusing why she would do it but I wouldn’t complain after all it’s the girl I like doing it.

Not long after that came another occasion we was hanging out watching Netflix till late and as I was leaving I gave her a hug she after hugging for a while she turned her face and we started kissing on the lips then she finished smiles and said “well guess I should go to bed then” so I hugged her again then went home it stayed on my mind because I started thinking “maybe she’s ready” but didn’t mention anything just yet

Now few days later same thing hanging out till late talking Netflix all that now this time it was different she kneeled down in front me while I was sitting down and started giving me a blowjob then finished that sat on my lap and started dry humping after she got off and apologised again I didn’t question it hugged her then left she later sent me a text apologising and I just said it was fine. Then a few days later she sent me text asking how good she was with her blowjob and we make jokes about it and stuff still but it never really got sexual again.

This all was in September 2017 new year started her grandfather passed just before Christmas and she was hurt and upset and I would always go around to comfort her help her though it and stuff and as she got better we started doing what we normally did like hang out together go for dinner normal things friend do.

Now before I never said it got sexual again this was literally until yesterday something happened it was late and again she started giving me a blowjob this time she was doing it for a good 20 mins strait then after she stopped pulled down her pants literally climbed onto me and we started having sex for the first time.

Now when we finished she got off out clothes on and just was looking at the floor I asked her “what’s wrong?” And she started crying and said “I’m so sorry I shouldn’t have done that” I just looked at her and she said “your so nice and you’ve done so much for me and I just don’t want to hurt your feelings because you don’t deserve it” and then she went on to mention how she just doesn’t think she’s ready for a relationship still and when I heard it I felt a little hurt because I thought after all this confusion she’s telling me this now because I started getting clearly from her actions she’s close to or she is ready but then she started saying “the thing is I haven’t said it but I really like you also” and I asked her “since when?” She said for a while she was thinking about it and she likes me more then a friend but she doesn’t want to ruin something good because she’s being impatient and said ”the thing is I really like you and I’m not saying we can’t be together Because I’ve never closed the door it’s open but I know I’ve still got some fixing to do on myself before I step into a relationship as much as I like you I need to fix myself first” and I just sat and listened to her and she said to me with tears coming down her face “you probably hate me now and your probably thinking I’m a bitch but I know your too nice to say it and I’m so sorry because I think I’ve messed around with how you feel” I said to her that that was rubbish and that I like her a lot because I really do and I just hugged her next thing we know we just started kissing again then we stopped and spoke about it some more and I told her that I believe she’s worth the wait and she just hugged me for ages and didn’t let go then I went home leaving her house at like 5am in the morning.

The next day she texting me in he morning we was having casual chat and she was saying she’s happy we spoke about what we did yesterday and I asked her “can I just say one more thing” she relied “you can’t say whatever you want” so I sent her this text message:

 “Thanks but yeah (friends name) just basically for me all in all I really like you a lot and I’m like really really serious about it and yeah we have spoke last night and even before then about things in your life before so I know everything you have been through and how you’ve been heart broken and dislike the idea of love and relationships and all that again I get it like I told you I understand you so I know you need time out from all that and like you say to get back to that right place I know how your life’s been and we’ve had countless conversations about it so.

But yeah like that’s it really and the reason I just wanted to be honest with you is because in all seriousness falling for you and feeling that type of love past friendship isn’t not something I actually planned (friends name) it just seemed to have naturally happened like that and now I can’t really help how I feel hence why I’m telling you all this because I don’t wanna front about it or try hide that fact I do even though I’ve told you before and I know you know I do anyway

And again I know you’ve gone though a lot in the last couple of years emotions flying everywhere and heart pain with lebert your grandfather your ex the depression no job and all that you struggle with.

I think I really want to say is that like where friends good friends or whatever level of friends you want to call it but from my side you basically taken that position of best friend of course I’d love for it to be more right at this very minute but like I say I’m patient and if that’s what will shape a ruff Diamond and get the very best (friends name) then I’ll sit back and watch as it arises and I support and back your decisions. Like now I know your extremely important and special to me so your at the top of the pedestal and it’ll always be that way whatever happens and directions life goes because I’ll always say you was my friend first not a ting a wanted to link but an actual friend and you can see from how long the friendships been genuine and we’ll always be friends that’s for sure but with how I feel I just wanted to say that like and if I did happen I just wanted to let you know that I would work though everything with you because with some things it takes a good while to get over if ever because some people don’t get over some of those things and some of them you might not either and I get that and I get you as a person and respect what you do and I just like you a lot as you are.
 
But just know like with 100% seriousness if it is something that ever happened in life I just think that the way you are and the way I feel this standard of being treated like a princess is a constant thing that doesn’t stop because how I feel is genuine and I don’t want to be just all talk because really and truly we both no words mean nothing from experience so I’ve always felt like my actions match what I say so what I’m saying is for me I could never hurt you and that’s off the basis of what I said before for me you’ve always been my friend first one of my best friends if not the best so the idea of losing you as just a friend never mind anything else already hurts that’s why I know and I know like yeah I use to like you in school but then there was really no substance to it that was just a childish crush and since we gotten closer over the last two years then we use to be originally I was hanging out with you and only looked at it as this is my friend and she’s cool to hang out with nothing really more to it but I’ve just seemed to have over time just thought your literally like mad special to me and yeah there’s no denying I would love to take it up another level but that’s not always possible but you know what I mean like to me it doesn’t change that I feel your a special person and my favourite person to be around with moretime the person I wanna talk to everyday and would prefer to chill with.

And like the idea of what you’ve experienced already I just hate the idea of you feeling like that which is why I guess I’ve always tried to be bring positivity around you and not that I can take away pain that you feel but try and make you atleast happier then you are and it’s something I’ll always try to do wether that’s friends or whatever direction simply because your just special to me (friends name) in every single way possible that’s because your a star you say I don’t see what you see and I don’t disagree with that and that’s probably why you say you need to fix it but I know for a fact you also don’t see what I see that’s a beautiful wonderful caring girl and one day I’m going to prove it to you I’ll make you see the same thing I see that’s a princess without a doubt your nothing less then royalty” 

I sent her that and she said that’s so sweet and she really liked what I had to say and thanked me for always being there for her.

Now I really like her so much she means the world to me and I do so much for her but something I know how long it will take before she’s better so you think I should wait for her because I really want to be with her.

TL;DR: basically if this is too long for you my best friend told me she really likes me and she’s interested in me but because she’s still recovering from her last relationship doesn’t want to go into one right now but told me she’s open to us being together but it’s just not now because she needs to repair herself I’m saying should I wait for her if I really like her?

303,"I am still kind of torn on whether or not I even care, but I guess it could not hurt to look for the tools to understanding myself a little better. I am in my 20s, have never even put serious effort towards intimacy (let alone having sex) and I understand most people seemed to have figured it out in their teens but I guess I am something of a special case here. It is not that I could not get intimacy if I wanted to, I am flirted with often in public, I am told I look good (I work out regularly and I get lots of compliments on my eyes), and I can charm most anybody with very little effort. I have even got a few pretty straight forward offers, but I am just not really sure about it which I will explain more below.

There are a few known factors at play and first in foremost is that I am pretty sure I am somewhere on the asexual spectrum. I have a low libido and very few things I consider sexually attractive and I am also not really 100% sure what those things are or the best way of going about figuring that out. I have some general ideas of some things but much of it is a loss on me. On the other hand I do not think I am very picky either. There are not many things that are a specific turn off for me either as long as somebody looks healthy enough (so basically not so skinny the ribs stick way out and not so fat one can not even clean themselves, most other things are a non-issue). I mean I think I have some general preferences, they are just not very strong preferences and even my strongest preferences I think there are exceptions for. It is just getting turned on in the first place that is the problem.

I have trust issues with touch. I have hyperesthesia and thus it takes time for me to get used to being around somebody before touch is anything other than horrible for me and my touch boundaries were not very well respected as a child so I just have a very hard time letting people touch me at all (even my parents have to ask permission before getting a hug), and if somebody gets too pushy and jumps the gun that is it I can not be around them anymore. It would take a good amount of trust in somebody for me to actually agree to intimacy and even then I might be rather uneasy at first. The most I have ever done was give platonic massages but even that is just really hard for me and requires trust (though I am a natural at it and am told i have healing hands). I have heard they have rehabilitation courses for this but I am not sure where to find them and there are some touch-positive groups but not that I can easily get to where I live.

I am not very social. I can easily spend six months without interacting with others and I value my alone time. Most people want to interact all the time, but I am just not that type of person and it starts to feel clingy and needy and from what I understand this gets even worse when it comes to romantic feelings for others. At most what I could do regularly is be around somebody without actually interacting (just both of us doing our own things with maybe occasional conversations) but even just once a week of serious interactions in person can just be more than I feel like doing (online is a bit easier, but even that gets old with me). I mean if they are into the same projects as me that is different as I can always use a helping hand, but most people do not seem very interested in actually trying out the stuff i am into, they just like to hear about it (I do many different things really and am always up for a new experience but most commonly and recently I do bushcrafting, self suffecienty projects, and all sorts of projects involving making my own stuff, from melting down metals and scrapping electrontics to studying mycology and growing various plants and fungi. Most people find my projects interesting, but few actually want to get involved either because they prefer other easier activities or feel themselves not smart enough to keep up with me (which I do not get that line of thinking in the first place, learning is best done by trying and failing until eventually success is achieved, but people just sell themselves short all the time instead)).

I also do not really fully understand flirting. Like sometimes I catch on but a good chunk of the time I think people are just being friendly and then after the interaction is over somebody says something like ""you're a real lady killer"" and I am just like ""wut??"" XD

I have tried online dating and that has just not gone well. I mean I have gotten one or two promising results with people I still consider friends one of which has even helped me better understand flirting by sending me links and things that explain it but otherwise I guess I am just not cut out for meeting people that way.

I guess I just do not want to wait around and waste my youth only to find out when I am well past my prime that there has been much I am missing out on. Even if I find out I really am not into any of this as much as it seems now I guess it was not much lost to try.

304,"Apologies in advance for the block of text, and many thanks to those who read to the end! I’m very lucky at this moment to have TOO MANY options career wise. I never expected to find myself in this position. Anyway, here’s the deal. I currently work for a small/medium sized oil and gas company in an administrative capacity. I sit at the reception desk, but my job comprises many other office management duties as well. My salary is just under $50,000/yr. I don’t have a lot of responsibility, I don’t have to take the job home with me at night, I have health benefits and 2 weeks paid vacation, free food often at work, I love my coworkers, and I am lucky enough to be able to get up and walk around often in the course of my duties (I’m not stuck staring at a screen for 8hrs). I was not looking for a new job, because I am quite happy here, but there are a few changes taking place which have brought about new opportunities. The first change is that we are moving offices, and the new office space will have an exterior reception area, making it necessary for someone to be there at all times. The reception role is going to become much more structured, with scheduled breaks. This will make it impossible for me to complete many of my office wide responsibilities which involve moving around the workplace to make sure everything is in order. I am not interested in staying at reception in the new capacity. I proposed the creation of a new role which would comprise just the office wide duties plus administrative support for the project team, but the company is not interested in taking this route.

Instead, I have been offered two new roles with my current company. One is assisting the procurement department, the other is creating workflows for our project services team. Both will be far more computer oriented, and will come with a bump in pay (closer to $60,000/yr). Out of these options, I am leaning toward the procurement position because the team is smaller, and my lead would be a woman that I have come to admire – I could learn a lot from her and she is well respected in her field. I have never had ambitions to get into procurement, but this company treats me well and there is opportunity for advancement in that department.

If these were the only two options this would be much simpler, but alas, there is a third. My partner’s family is opening a medium scale craft brewery this month. My partner has taken a lead role in sales with the brewery, and they would like me to come on board as their marketing manager. This is exciting to me for a few reasons. The first is that my partner and I have always dreamed of working together, and our current life plan is to save, save, save, so that we can open a small business together in the future. The second is that while I have always had an interest in marketing, and have performed marketing related duties in other jobs (my last position was Marketing Coordinator for a garment factory), I do not have any formal education in the field. As a result of this I have found difficulty being hired into marketing positions that are not mostly administrative. To me this represents a huge opportunity to do something I have a passion for, and to prove myself in the marketing space. The downsides of taking this option are that the pay would likely not be as good long term ($50,000/yr to start, room for growth if the business does well but still, the industry is simply not as flush as oil &amp; gas), the risk associated with both my partner and I working for a startup, and the possible interpersonal difficulties of working with family. The immense pressure of being in integral part of a start-up business both scares and excites me. It would be excellent experience for when we eventually star our own business.

I’m so torn. I have talked about this with my therapist, my parent, my siblings, my friends, and I still don’t feel any closer to a decision. I know that my current job is excellent by any standard, and is the kind of place that I could stay at for a looong time and advance my career, but its not an industry I feel passionate about. The company is doing very well, and seeing huge growth even in this difficult market, which makes me hesitant to leave. On the other hand, working with my partner is something we have both wanted for the 11 years we have been together, and a marketing manager at the brewery I would be able to really flex my marketing muscles and work in a field I am interested in.  I’m hoping that advice from a stranger will help me see things through different eyes, and give me some perspective. What do you think I should do?

I work in a major professional corporation(5000+ employees). About a year ago I filed a sexual harassment complaint against a man who works in the IT department. I was told it was dealt with, and only had to pass him in hallways. My whole team is being moved, so today they came and moved our computers while we were working. He’s one of the people moving computers, and now I’m afraid to go to my desk.

308,"I had a dream that has triggered a crazy maelstrom of emotions that I can’t deal with and I want to get some feedback, if possible. I don’t know if it will help but maybe some objectivity will put a damper on my problem. 

The other night I dreamt I was on a large stage. I was on a stage style stair/ladder type thing I think and the theater/audience was huge though I couldn’t see them. I was playing this very complicated role and mid play I just walked out. In my head I said “fuck this, I’m done”. Everyone just stared, dumbfounded while I walked off stage and out of the theater. 

I don’t act, have never acted, have intense debilitating, stage fright, I have no desire to be in this sort of position. In the dream I was calm and self assured I was absolutely comfortable where I was. There was zero correlation with reality except that I was me. 

Again normally I wouldn’t attribute this to more than an overactive imagination because I have that in spades - it’s one of my favorite things about myself. But it was pointed. And I have been able to do nothing but ruminate on it since. 

So lay it on me. ",08Mar2018,1

I am having the worst time of my life, I am extremely indecisive on what I want to do in live, I can't decide whether I want to solely earn money for a while (retail, etc) or go down the educational route and do something I am passionate about (graphic design, however I have no qualifications or anything to do with this, I just enjoy it in my spare time)

I am getting no luck with jobs, thinking i've smashed an interview, feeling great awaiting for that e-mail saying 'can you start Monday?', to instead receive one saying we have found someone else. These jobs are ranging from office jobs to your average supermarket. I need to pay my mother £200 rent a month aswell as £100 in other bills. Luckily I have some inheritance to go off.

311,"My dad is very strict and I feel as though the main reason he's upset is because he likes my boyfriend. For one, I am not that cool, in fact, I'm very introverted and nervous/shy around others. I'll speak out if I feel comfortable around people but not in crowds or around strangers. And second, I'm not that attractive. I mean some guys say I'm a little thick, but I have glasses and bumps on my face, I'm not really into getting my nails done and my hair. So it's usually in a ponytail or a lazy bun.

So forgive me when I say, if I like someone, I can't help but be clingy towards them. And if they like me, I don't want it to stop. My dad likes my boyfriend because he's in college, has a job, a car, and etc. but he has the rule of no sex, and definitely no sex in the house.

Simple rules. But there's a problem, I'm still fucking two other guys. And it's not that I want to... it's just in my head when I tell myself I'm not with them anymore and they even tell me let's just be friends, we end up still fucking right after... I just can't help it...

---------------

Basically that's why my dad threatened me. My ex came over and I couldn't focus, I kept telling myself we aren't together anymore. And the first thing I said is, ""Do you want to fuck?"" He even could tell I was just being nervous and he said if I want to just be friends it's fine. And we hugged and next thing I know... we are fucking on the living room couch. And my dad came home and walked into the living room screaming what the fuck and kicked my ex out.

He was so pissed and counted the 3 guys he's walked in on me with this month and said that's it. I can't live here anymore... And he's not even asking family to keep me, he's already packing my things. I tried calming him down but he just cusses me out and says I'm a disappointment.

I feel the biggest reason he's mad is because he despises my ex. My ex got me on weed, he's a drop out, has no steady job, steals, has cusses my dad out. And he loves my boyfriend which makes him feel like I'm hurting his friend by hanging out with his worst enemy.

- My dad is petty like that

I don't know what to do... I can't calm my dad, I have tried so much so far. Please someone give me some advice so that I can convince him to drop this whole thing... I doubt I can live with any of them since I have a boyfriend, and he lives on campus.

313,"Hey all,

I'm a 21 year old mechanic for a dealer.  This dealer has invested a lot in me, and I'm currently apprenticing under one of the techs.

However, I don't know if I want to do this.  I don't think I do.  Mechanics get paid per job, so it scares me that I could only flag 30 hours a week, and be there for 40.  Or, god forbid, you fuck something up, (which will happen) and you have to fix that for free.  I've gotta buy my own tools, and one day I could go in and fuck my back, knees, or anything else up.  Tired of getting dirty.  Every day I go in and get frustrated with something, and only the thoughts of quitting calms me down.  Like, I'll get to the point of tears because of how frustrated I get.

The perks?  The money can be there, if you put the time in, get the experience, and not work for a shit employer.  It all depends on you - how good you are, and your hustle.

I'd love to go back to school, but I'd almost certainly go in debt for it.  $30,000 for a year of studying makes me wanna throw up.  On top of that, I'd have no idea what I want to study.  Hey though, at least I wouldn't destroy my body, right?

I'm honestly just so confused at the moment with all of this. I would rather make this decision now, though, instead of ten years from now.  Ten years in the automotive field, deciding I fucking hate this, maybe with a wife and a kid?  What then?  I can't just pack my shit up and go to college.",08Mar2018,0
314,"I posted here about two weeks ago when I saw my father for the first time in five years. The comments made me realize how manipulative he was when he blamed my mother when I asked him why he hadn't tried to contact me. I also mentioned that he was a pedophile and abused my mother when she was young. She was not the only victim but I never knew the full extent of the abuse. He molested girls as young as 13, but I never knew this. I also found out that he has 3 other children that he also doesn't support.

Recently a government agency managed to track him down and pin him for child support, however because he lied about his income, he has to pay a whopping £15 a week. He never bothered to contact me until the agency came looking for him. I've had times when I've felt worthless, but nothing hurts more than to know that my own father doesn't care whether or not I have enough to eat, or if I have clothes to wear. 

My father is a paedophile and a liar and a cheat with 4 kids that he doesn't care for. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that I'm related to him. All I can think about is what to tell people when they ask about him. What would people think of me if they found out who he is?

I work at a social services housing with people who has various of social difficulties (I have no idea how to describe it in English). I have a new coworker ""Amanda"", I am 25 and she is around 55 years old. Last weekend the whole workplace went out for some food and drinks to welcome the new ones and say goodbye to some coworkers who had quit. When Amanda arrives it's clear that she has been drinking. During the evening she just drinks more and more. Everyone else chills a bit with the alcohol because it's not a party, more of a casual gathering. 

Amanda get louder and louder, acts very ""drunk chummy"" and people start to get a bit uncomfortable. After a while I point out the she might want to have some water and pause the drinking. She (politely) tells me that she can take care of herself and that it's not my business. Especially since ""she has been living far longer than me""..

Later in the evening the majority has gone home. Me and a few others wants to go dancing and Amanda joins us. She is now very drunk. At the club she gets very emotional, talks about her past and her current problems. We all try to say that we don't want to talk about it while where aren't sober and that we should take it later. She doesn't listen and keeps on, being a bit forceful. The night ends with her being upset with me telling her to stop once in for all. 

Anyway Monday comes and I take her to the side and ask her how she feels about the whole thing. She doesn't remember anything and tells me that it happened because she usually never drinks and is on a diet.

I don't know, I just have a bad gut feeling about this. I have talk with my boss about what happened, but we didn't really talk about her being so drunk etc, more about me being uncomfortable with all the personal info I got from her.

During middle and high school, I ate what we had in the house and what was prepared for me. However, when I moved in to college in September, I was suddenly in charge of everything I ate, and I began choosing what I ate very carefully in an effort to be “healthy.” I started using a calorie tracking app that I had had prior experience with, and I basically put myself on a diet. Well, 6 months later, I have lost roughly 30 pounds. I wasn’t overweight when I started losing, so now I am on the verge of becoming underweight. My parents and boyfriend have told me that I looked better with more weight on me, and I tend to agree.

332,"Hi Reddit! 
I am posting here at a complete loss of what to do regarding neighbors that we have. My husband and I live in a three- family apartment where our upstairs neighbors are some of our closest friends, but the older couple that live next to them have been nothing but horrible to live next to since day one. 

It all started when they complained about us walking in front of their window too much (which is right where the cars are parked) and that we did not walk our dogs within the designated area. Our landlord communicated this to us, but not in time for them to pick up the dog feces, roll it up in our newspaper, and leave it on our front step. Trying to bite the bullet and solve the issue with this, we profusely apologized in person along with leaving them a card and a $5 gift card to Dunkin Donuts.

All was good and we hugged it out, until our landlord alerted us of complaints from them again, referring to my husband as the ""asshole on the end"", saying we were stomping on the shared porch, looking in their windows, and slamming our doors. Now, I do want to be honest, unfortunately our door in this old house does stick &amp; tends to expand in certain weather so we have alerted the landlord to this. We close it as quietly as physically possible, look down when we have to walk in front of their window to get to our car, and literally tip toe up the stairs. 

Since then my husband and I have started leaving out our kitchen which is further away from their part of the house- and so that we don't have to deal with the husband yelling at us out his door. 

There's been a few extreme circumstances, one in which he came outside of his house, drunkenly yelling at my husband. They got in a screaming match that night because he threatened my husband, ""to be quiet or else."" And since then said he was no longer talking to us. We thought all was well but the complaints were piling in to our landlord and property owner about us, and since we've lived under this landlord before (thank goodness), he knows that we are quiet and do not cause any trouble. 

I have decided to write on Reddit since he has wrote reviews on my husbands work about him, in which his job quickly advised that our neighbor cease his actions. Our neighbor has since written back saying that he has spoken to a lawyer and threatened slander (???) to whoever from the company responded. 

I am nervous because there have been many occurrences of police coming due to domestic issues of him and his wife, and we googled him and found a plethora of arrests regarding larceny/ trespassing/ assault/ drunk driving etc. 

I know he is aggressive and I am afraid the next step is getting violent with us or hurting our little fur babies who are my heart and soul. 

I know that moving is a good option, but our closest friends live upstairs with other close friends in the complex, I am two minutes away from my job, it is all we can afford, and we have animal rescues (along with occasional fosters, as we live next to our local shelter)  that our landlord is super considerate of and allows us to have. I want to make nice and stay where we are, and I am afraid if we move, he is going to still come after us. 

Thank you to anyone who has even an ounce of advice. I am 24 and recently married, we have never come across this situation yet in our lives and it is so stressful to be both at home and yet also stressful to be away from home because I do not want him to harm my dogs. 



TL;DR- I am getting progressively more afraid of my neighbor that is a heavy drinker and is trying to sabotage our lives by leaving bad reviews at our jobs and making false complaints to our landlord.

341,"My fiancé and I are unsure about what to do regarding some life decisions right now and just need some unbiased advice. 

This summer, we are moving into our first apartment together, getting married, and trying to go on a honeymoon. Currently, after doing all this, we will only have about $1500 left in our savings account at the end of the summer. It would have been more but we had massive unexpected medical expenses come up as a result of a car accident. We wouldn't have planned things this way if we knew what was going to happen...We also won't really be adding to our savings this summer since I work less hours over the summer (school system). Once the school year picks up again, we'll begin to save around 800-1000 per month into savings.

Should we cancel the honeymoon to have more in savings? The honeymoon will cost approximately $2800, so we would be able to add that into savings if we didn't go. However, we have already paid some of it, so that money will be lost and FH already requested off work and can't take another week vacation for a year. I'd be sad to cancel it, but I also am stressed about not having enough in savings in case something happened. I don't think 1500 is very much money if something comes along.

351,"Hi everyone, writing on mobile so I apologise if this formatting is awful. 


Anyway, to begin with some back story: I’m 21M, I purchased a house with my brother, 28 almost two years ago. We initially lived with the both of us and it was rather nice, however his girlfriend 22F moved in with us around 6 - 7 months later and that’s when everything started to go downhill. 


My brother has always done things I disapprove of, for instance he used to drink too much, smoked weed since he was 15 etc - whereas I’m the complete opposite, never tried a cigarette, been drunk maybe 5 times my whole life. These differences never really bothered me as he always used to keep it separate and away from me, however since living together he smokes in the shed (which I don’t mind, it’s not in the house) however before he met his girlfriend he had actually quit for ~5 months and was doing very well, our family was proud of him. Well since meeting his girlfriend, he started up again because she wanted to try it and well now they’re smoking 5+ times a day and I hate it, they bring the smell in with them and they’re always in that stupid fucking state of mind.
He has also done other drugs and they’re starting to creep back into his life because of her. 


His girlfriend is possibly the most spoilt daddies girl I’ve ever met who has never had any real responsibilities and when she finally got a job she left after 2 months because it was “making her ill” - more like she has never had to wake up that early in her life. 


She leaves shit everywhere in the house, never tidies up after herself and I’ve brought this up multiple times with my brother and he doesn’t seem to care and ends up blaming me. (I am confine myself to my room as it’s where I play games etc - I have no mess anywhere in the house). 


My brother has always had anger issues, yet never admits it, he’s the type who never sees things unless it’s in front of his eyes (for instance doesn’t believe in depression and many other mental illnesses). 


Among many other things that are too long to list here living with them is making me feel awful, I hate coming home. 


Him and I made an agreement when we purchased this house that was for any reason one of us wants to move out, we’ll honour it. However I don’t want him to hate me which I know for a fact he will as he just will never understand other people’s thoughts and actions. I do however want to move out, living here is a nightmare for me. I’m autistic, always kept myself to myself, always clean, tidy, cook for myself and having all this chaos in the house just isn’t doing me any good. 


This write up is quite awful re-reading it however I find it difficult putting feelings into words.


My main issues are with his childish behaviour, lack of respect and her damn right stupid behaviour. Sorry I couldn’t list everything down but I hope you get the gist.


How can I pluck up the courage to tell him I don’t want to live with him anymore?",08Mar2018,3
352,"As the title says I've been getting feelings for my closest friend. Over the past year we have gotten really close and over time I've started to get feelings for her. I'm really bad at picking up signals and don't know if she feels the same way back. All of our friends tell me that I should just shoot my shot, but I don't want to ruin our friendship.",08Mar2018,3
353,"Just wanting to whine and get this out of my head. I hope it makes sense

I tried to commit suicide  a few days ago, but I failed again. 

I have told people that I'm suicidal. My parents know about my first attempt that was almost a year ago now. I took a bunch of stuff that based off what I could find online seemed like I had a lethal dose. I ended up spending the entire day vomiting it up. I freaked and texted them. When they got home my dad just called me an idiot and my mom, to her credit, did say how sad she’d be if I had been successful but then told me how I deserve to be burning in hell. I told the counselor at my school but she threatened to call the police on me. I told a Dr who gave me the number to what i hope is the world’s worst suicide hotline. 
I reported my family to CPS. My dad was calling me things like a fucking retard and saying that I have an IQ of 2. My mom was threatening me saying that she would lock me out of the house to freeze and die, happily let me rot and die, and that she would push me out of the car. My brother would call me things like useless, idiot, says he wishes he could get rid of me, that i wreck the family, locked me out of the car so I didn’t have a ride and got physically violent on occasion but he never really hurt me.  I had complained about them to a doctor and they got sent for counselling. But the counselor ffs just gave them a self-help book and told them to feel free to call the police who will take me to a mental institution where i will be “drugged out of my mind”.  When i was on the phone with CPS reporting my family, the worker told me that that was “only my side of the story and that my family’s was probably different”. I thought that was sus but then figured it was probably just shit they said to teenagers. CPS called my house after that and let my family know that I reported them and she had all the details wrong. They also said that it was “highly usual behavior” for me to report to them. My family lost it on me. My mom left for a few hours and said she wasn’t coming back. Then tried to push me down the stairs and came p damn close then charged at me with a chair and screamed at me. Parents now keep telling me that they want to adopt a new daughter. I waited a long time for CPS to come back. CPS never came back. I called to find out and all they would tell me is that the case had been closed. Fucking CPS. Things have been worse than ever now. They still mention it every day. I contacted the social worker at my school but she refused to see me since I’m under 16 and don’t have a parent referral. Wtf. My 25-year-old sister tried attacked me and started to scream at me that I had ruined her life. She claims she was ""shaking the demons out of me"". I called 911 and talked to the police about what they would do. I can report their threats but they can't do much without evidence. From what I've looked up it seems like getting the police involved is a bad idea. They usually take adults' side in situations like this. I called some homeless shelters in the city but they don't accept anyone under 16. Also called a youth organization to talk to them about what housing options i would have when I turn 16 in 6 months. It turns out they don’t answer their phone or email. My grandmother passed away and my parents are refusing to give me my inheritance money now. Their reason is they can't trust me and that I'm going to run away with it at some point and not come back (which is true). I'm p sure it was illegal for CPS to give my name out as the reporter. idk what my “family’s” big problem is with me calling CPS anyway. They have said that they would like to get rid of me by dropping me off at Children's Aid or a shelter multiple times before. 

My parents also forced me to go back to church and they took me to get prayed for. The pastor has now told my parents that i might have a demon in me and that there is ''something wrong with my heart''. Things like that is why i stopped going a while ago and gave up the religion but my parents caught me.  I went to a friend's for a while I can't go back to his house because I think he hates me. I've canceled plans on him a hundred times because I haven't felt good enough, i crashed at his house, and then I didn't show up for his birthday. ""My crazy parents wouldn't let me go"" sounds like a lame cop-out. My parents were mad about CPS and didn’t let me. He's not answering my messages and he's going to move in a month. 

I never thought I’d say this but I miss school so damn bad.  I had had problems with migraines for a long time but i got braces and something went wrong with my jaw and it just started to hurt really a lot. I finally just got the braces removed and the orthodontist sent me to another dentist for him to “fix” my jaw. It turns out he gave me what I now know is trigeminal neuralgia. But at the time I got accused of making the whole thing up. My parents used that to gaslight me a lot. My neck and shoulders started to hurt too. Then I went to my GP who put me on a whole bunch of drugs. I was taking several types of muscle relaxants, stuff for nerve pain, migraine medication, and sleeping pills. All of that just gave me awful side effects. i would get sick, my chest would hurt, I’d be tired, more headaches, and  I couldn’t think clearly on them. So i finally just had to drop out of school and do it online. I lost a few credits which I’m trying to make up because I don’t want to be behind a grade next year. i sort of lost contact with my friends from school. It didn’t seem like too big of a deal because I was still involved with stuff after school that I had friends at. But parents pulled me out of stuff that I was involved with outside of school because of the CPS incident and now i’m starting to lose contact with those friends. After not really getting any more medical care for a few months until I went to a new doctor who bothered to send me for some xrays. Apparently, my jaw is locked and the discs are out of place. I haven’t been able to open my jaw more than 20 mm for almost a year now. So I’m currently waiting to go see a surgeon but that won’t be till next year. My pelvis is also apparently out of line which might be causing my neck to hurt but this seems kinda far-fetched to me. I don’t have any pain medication that actually works. ",08Mar2018,10
354,My long-distance girlfriend of two years surprised me with tickets to come fly out and see me during my birthday weekend of my spring break. I asked my manager two weeks out for that weekend off and he told me no because it will be busy. That Friday before is when my spring break starts and I am slated for 7 days in a row before that working 10 hour shifts and I told him my situation but he told me he can’t promise me that. What can I do so I can get out of it and not disappoint my girlfriend?,08Mar2018,9

358,"Lot of context here:  My father is terminally ill (GBM4 prognosis is about 6-8 months at this point).  He lives at home in a hospital bed in the living room.  My parents have plenty of money for help and equipment.  She has an aid 8 hours a day.  My husband went and stayed there for 3 weeks while I got our home sold so she had 24/7 help too.  My sister drops by daily and is available at a  moment's notice (she lives .25 miles form their home).  I am quitting my job and moving 3000 miles across the country to come home and help.  There are literally 12 people that regularly drop off food and she has a cleaning service.  Point is... she has help and support and while this SUCKS BALLS she is in a better position than most people caring for some one with GBM4 as far as help and resources.

The problem:  My mother had a shitty childhood and never got therapy (alcoholic parents and molested by her uncle).  She is anti-therapy because she doesn't believe a person who has not had your exact experiences can ever understand or help you. She claims she worked through that all and is FINE.  Yet, she harbors a lot of resentment towards my dad who had a rather idyllic childhood.  She also resents the fact that she chose to work so they could afford a nicer house and vacations (like this was literally her choice because she fell in love with the house I grew up in but they needed more income to make it work so she went back to teaching).  BUT she is bitter she ""had to work her whole life""

So she has all this resentment and after my dad's diagnosis it started manifesting itself in cruelty to my Dad.  He is perfectly aware and awake, but the brain tumor and seizures have robbed him of a lot of his speech.  Even though it has been explained to her MULTIPLE TIMES... she thinks that because he can't really talk he also can't hear.  She calls him a burden and tells people how his illness is turning her into a prisoner and stealing her life...in front of him!  He usually silently cries when she does this.  When you tell her he can HEAR her she says ""Nope - he isn't aware of anything - he never talks to me""  But he is - he follows with his eyes, his facial expressions show he is reacting and his docs have said there is nothing wrong with his hearing or his ability to understand english.  When this is pointed out to her she says ""docs don't always get it right"".  She still insists on speaking about him as though he was not there.  Then, she started skipping meds.  If he didn't immediately reach out for the pills to take them she gives up (she has been shown MULTIPLE times that if you explain to him what the pill is for he will take it).  She claims he only does that for other people and not for her.

It's like she is living in a world that doesn't match reality.  her perception of things is so different form anyone else's and she keeps insisting she is right and we are all wring.

My sister is starting to hate her.  I am too.  We tried an intervention with her kids, her best friend and her sister.  We all BEGGED her to see a therapist and we all told her she was treating the man she loved like shit.  She told us WE were all crazy.

I am not sure what else to do.

Now I want to apply for a University and I heard that adults don't have to present SAT scores or GPAs from High School.

362,"Right now, I'm a junior in high school, within the top 10 ranks in my grade, good ecs, good SAT score, and recently I've been given the opportunity to train for my sport in a foreign country with one of the top coaches in the world. I'll go abroad over the summer and depending how well I do, I could have the opportunity to train with that coach for the rest of the year. However, that means I'll have to enroll in a foreign high school to complete my senior year, and I'm a bit weary of doing that because I don't speak the language of the country I'm going to. So I thought about graduating high school early by doing online courses through my current high school. This way, I can focus solely on fencing if I train with the coach for the rest of the year. 

I'm sorry if this is kind of confusing, please send any questions if you need clarification. I'm really not sure if graduating is a good idea because everywhere I read it says its a bad idea but this is for a really good opportunity!",08Mar2018,1

364,"I will start this with a huge sigh

**sigh**.....

long, long story short:

after 2 years, I texted the only girl i ever loved, even after 2 years of not in communication, I still have feelings for her. since it was march 8th (women's day), i decided to wish her a happy women's day, so i texted her on facebook (we are friends there). she replied Thank you with a happy smiley. i asked her if she would like to go to a caffee for a drink tomorrow so we can have some talk on what's new, after college. she said she's going to her home town/home tomorrow in the morning, and comes back after wednesday so we could meet then. i was fine with it and agreed. we are both the same age and in college. we know each other since highschool.

...

then i gave some thoughts about this, and realized what she wrote: ""I'm going to my &lt;hometown&gt; tomorrow morning..."" but wait a minute, if she's not there, where is she now? tomorrow morning? that means she's not gonna sleep at her home this night? ... so where is she at so late? i sound like I'm paranoid, but I'm a little worried. I don't think she has a bf or anything, but I'm really nervous now. can someone tell me what does that mean? what could be the possible case scenarios of this situation?",08Mar2018,2
366,"So recently I've been messaged by a producer on Instagram about how he thinks that I am a talented artist and he wants to do work with me. He's offered me a few exclusive tracks along with promotion on sites such as Complex, and ThisIs50 for a price (Above $1k). We have also discussed all of this through email. At first I was wondering if he was the real deal or if he was someone just pretending to be him to gain a quick buck since he did not have the logo on his Instagram saying that he was a verified account. I won't mention his name due to privacy and I do not want to burn bridges if I decide to follow through with this. After seeing his website that he provided and seeing how professional it was, being contacted by his management agency also on Instagram, and also seeing that other famous rappers also follow him on Instagram, I can definitely say that he is the real deal. He has worked with Rick Ross, DJ Khaled, Jay-Z, Gucci Mane, etc. However, I really do have to ask if this would be there right decision to make for my music career. A few things that I also have to ask is why would he contact me? I have under 1700 followers on Instagram and my songs I post on Youtube normally have 8-20 views, and my Soundcloud plays aren't much better. So I really do have to ask why someone that has worked with big names want to contact a nobody such as myself? I think there is more to it than me just being talented. The amount of money he is also asking I definitely have but I am a VERY money conscious person. I don't like to spend money frivolously and I want to make sure that there is a good return. Once the money is spent, it is gone. It has definitely taken me a LONG time to save up the money that I have. I am also wondering if promotion on Complex and ThisIs50 will really help me achieve success in my music career or if they are dated. I am also not interested in becoming a main stream artist. I want to stay underground since I hate the idea of being famous. I want to be well known but not famous. I also think that I can also get really good promotion without spending a fortune. Plus, there are lots of producers on Youtube that make awesome sounding beats that I can use for free. But of course, those beats won't be from a producer that has done work with big name artists. I would imagine that having a producer that has worked with big names would help me gain more exposure because people would see his name and would be more likely to listen to my songs. I honestly don't know what I should do since I really don't want to make a bad decision to loose connections within the industry.",08Mar2018,1
