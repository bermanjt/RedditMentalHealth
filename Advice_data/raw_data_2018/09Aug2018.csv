1,Im in an internship in a sub contractor company. I have a past medical certificate which is on 16/7/2018. How do i overwrite this to 9/8/2018? Without being traceable.

3,"I was recently running an ethernet cable through my vents, when I noticed the airway opens up to the above space. It is too deep to look into.

4,"The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship.

The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see? Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny.

My wife says bring her if she would like to and my daughter says she would like to but I don't know if it is a good idea. She hasn't gone yet so we can still discuss it together.",09Aug2018,0

6,"I tried r/OutOfTheLoop, but my post isn't in accordance with the rules.

My parents are culturally out of touch, misinformed people who were terribly raised by parents who had a bad influence on them. My mom is a narcissist, and my dad is an immature person who also runs from his demons.

Growing up, my questions about the world were never answered. I had even more trouble articulating my thoughts, and I was brainwashed by education and my parents in a bad atmosophere.

I didn't put it all together until several months ago. I put some of it together around age 11, but I didn't fully put everything together until recently.

I'm now going to college in about a month (community college since its cheaper..I figured out some things), and I feel so out of the loop. I feel out of the loop concerning privacy &amp; security, government, US politics, US political history (including the 90's to now, not just from its founding to the 80's), technology, education, personal finance, political culture, and economics.

I'm very bad at rote memory and not good at organizing facts within my mind, and I have trouble retaining that kind of information unless it's drilled into my head. I hate learning that way. I'm much better at using my imagination in the form of organizing and gathering.",09Aug2018,0

9,"I want to know how I can desire sex some more. I often want to orgasm, but I can't even get hard because desires are so hard to come by. 

I feel like life is boring and pointless, and this might be caused by depression. 

I used to be bisexual but lost interest in both women and men. I've had poor sexual experiences with both sexes due to my lack of standards. I don't know if what happened was rape, but I had an awful boyfriend when I was 19 and haven't had sex with anyone since then.

I'm a healthy weight. I get enough nutrients. I exercise. I get random erections when I raise my testosterone levels from strength training, but they rarely ever happen at a time when I can stop and jerk off. I don't wake up with an erection ever.

10,"So my friend has a drinking problem when he gets too wasted. When he gets too drunk, he'll black out and get aggressive with people. He has done this numerous times and each time varies from physical assault toward women to creeping them out to being rude to people etc. He would feel bad the next day, but would say he can't truly feel bad if he can't remember it -.- It's like he's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde every time, super nice when he's sober but completely different when blacked out.

14,"Had an awesome party on Saturday, no drugs (or weed) cuz my dad is a lawyer, but everyone was of the legal drinking age. Fun party, only friends and best friends (it was a goodbye party cuz I’m moving to Europe in a month) no drama, but my friend (let’s call him Dave) was drinking too much and it was late so we sent him home in an Uber. Dave called the Uber from his phone, even though he asked if he could crash at my place, I said no. He voluntarily got in the car tho he tripped a little. And his last words to me were “I’m so glad we’re friends” and that was the last time I saw him. 
Next morning I texted to see if he got home okay, saw that on WhatsApp it said he was last online at 10 am so I assumed he was fine. Later get a phone call from my friend crying saying Dave was dead. My heartbeat was so loud in my chest I couldn’t hear anything else and I was trembling so much. They found him on the side of the road screaming in agony at 6am in one of the dangerous parts of town and he later died of his injuries in the hospital. His mom got there too late, and his dad didn’t even know about it until he saw it on the news. All I could think about the following days were his family and his girlfriend of 7 years whom I’ve never met. (Note: he was pansexual and they had an open relationship). Yesterday the homicide  detectives came to visit me to ask me about my party since it was the last known place he was at. I told them everything that happened yet they don’t believe that there weren’t any drugs which I’m 100% confident there weren’t. Asked me about Dave. Dave was very social but mostly only with his friends. He was very open about himself, confident, funny, opinionated, well dressed, a wuss, an overall beautiful person. The detectives as well as everyone else (still) have no idea what happened and how he died. It wasn’t a hit n run cuz there was no debris on the body, it wasn’t an assault because he still had his wallet and cash, it probably wasnt a hate crime. And where is the Uber driver? Some are saying he died too, others are saying he ran off. It’s a very weird case. He just showed up on the side of the road with lacerations and wounds. 

I know it’s not my fault this happened to him, but I could’ve prevented it. I know I had no way of knowing, but I still feel guilty. I can’t stop replaying the image in my head when he asked me if he could stay. The mass (public) is tomorrow. What am I supposed to say if I’m approached by a family member? 

I’m never throwing another party again. ",09Aug2018,1
15,"

I literally suck ass at standing up for myself or speaking up even when I know 100% that I’m right about something. I get pressured easily into doing things I don’t want to do.

I know how to say know I know what I don’t like yet I can’t stand my ground on it. I get pushed into taking on tasks that I don’t want to take and even putting myself in intimate relationships that I don’t want. 

Fast forward, I’m 24 years old (female) I have a two year old son and an absolutely amazing hubby who always tries to urge me to stand my ground. But I still can’t manage it. I’ve gotten better because I’ve had to make sure the boundaries around my son were respected but honestly even there in the most important part of my life I’ve done a terrible job. 

Outside of trying to pep talk myself to do better to stand up especially when I have facts. I can’t I get anxiety I feel hot when I’m having a confrontation. I just don’t want to be this way anymore. It just feels weak and pathetic. 

Is it just me who has this weak personality is there any way to work on this before it gets me into a situation that I can’t come back from? 

More than anything this is a vent. I’ve never put it out there like this on how disgusted I feel with myself for some of the choices I’ve made just out of pressure or wanting to people please or not wanting to cause tension. ",09Aug2018,2
16,"To start off, I should probably say that I have severe depression and anxiety. I'm in therapy and am on meds but nothing seems to be helping at this point.

A lot of my self worth comes from my performance at work. I'm a perfectionist, I have a hard time making decisions, and I rarely feel like any of my own work is good enough. Lately, I feel very overwhelmed and while I feel like I'm capable of getting my tasks completed well, I am very afraid that I will take longer than they would like the projects to take. 

My current Bosses understand a small amount of what my job is, but they don't understand the full role as well as I'd like. They're kind and understanding, but the big boss is a big idea guy and doesn't see the details that have to happen behind the scenes to get these ideas into reality. 

I am a highschool dropout with a GED, and I'm in a Director level Engineering position with my company. Over many years I've grown to have a lot of the skills and qualities they need for this position, so it really kind of works well for both of us. One unfortunate circumstance of this however is that I frequently feel underqualified and overpaid. They treat me amazing, and I want to do my best to provide them the best possible services to earn my wage. When I think of failing to do my job well, It feels more like letting down family than it does ""pissing off a boss"".

Here's where I feel I need advice:

Lateley, I frequently feel like I'm in over my head. I'm not the greatest at making decisions due to my depression and anxiety. I need to spend time occasionally to learn new things about my duties, and I feel like I'm wasting company time if I do it at work.

I have projects which I feel I am fully capable of completing, and doing a rather good job at. My time constraints make things difficult. I want to make things perfect before I say they're complete or ready to move to the next phase, but in reality that's not necessary.  So I have to learn to draw the line somewhere reasonable. 

I'm not great at planning large projects, and I also feel like I'm being pulled in too many directions. 

I like 99% of the people I work with and I enjoy at least 50% of my duties (if time constraints were more relaxed)

I start thinking about looking for a new job. One with less responsibility. One with someone over my head that can give me more direction and  someone I can go to with questions about how to approach certain tasks. But i'm not sure I'd be any happier there. At least here I know my team and I know we're all working together well towards a common goal.

It's very difficult having such low self confidence while being in a position which demands decision making and assertiveness.

I would really appreciate any input.",09Aug2018,1
18,"I gotta get this off my chest. I am a man and a female friend that I've known for a year blocked my number after I texted her and told her that if she didn't want to date me that I would end block her number, end the friendship and I waisted money on buying her a birthday present.

20,"I've been on a waiting list since January to see a therapist for intensive CBT for my depression.    
A recent breakup has caused problems, so I found a charity offering a few counselling sessions.

  
I suffer depression is because of my life: I'm long-term unemployed which comes with all sorts of additional issues like stress over bills and lack of purpose, I'm very socially isolated with no friends or family, I'm unhappy about getting older and worried I'll not get to have kids, etc. It's mostly that I exist without actually living, but I get down sometimes too.   


My boyfriend broke-up with me a month ago, despite only being together two months it hit me hard as the relationship was very intense and felt like the real deal, we were very happy and saw each other daily which was a big deal to me (the break-up has also made it difficult to go to Meetup events as he attends, thus it's isolating me further), but he became emotionally abusive and it's when I tried to talk to him about it that he broke-up with me. It messed with my head.  


Issues with my depression have made the breakup harder eg. no friends to support me through it, but also the breakup is feeding the depression eg. feeling more lonely and catastrophising over the idea of being alone forever. I'm finding myself going around and around and around in circles over the break-up - going over bad situations can be how I cope sometimes, but right now I'm stuck in this loop and I can't find a way to get myself out of it. It's making me ill.  


BUT...  


As a 35 year old coming out of a two month relationship I feel ridiculous needing to talk to a counselor about this, plus it's someone I've never met before and may not feel comfortable with so not sure how much I can go into my breakup or how I can relate it back to my depression (which will be better dealt with via the CBT) to make them understand why the breakup has become such a big issue for me. I'm just not sure how to approach counselling about this without feeling silly or finding myself still struggling due to this ridiculous break-up issue, how can I make the most of this counselling?

22,"I don’t even know where to start. Ever since I was younger, my parents have always pushed me in a positive way to work hard and achieve. No fault in that right? However it has continued into my adult years in a more negative way. I work a full time job, live on my own, pay ALL of my own bills from when I was 18 (when I moved out), and have not asked them for a dime since the day I left. That being said my parents “pushing” has turned a bit rude and insulting. I don’t make a ton of money and have dropped out of college after my first year. I try to explain to them that I don’t think it’s worth going into debt at this point for a worthless degree. Every one of my coworkers has a degree and is in the same spot as me.

We had similar interests, he was really nice, we hung out almost everyday of the week, we were perfect for each other. After about three or four months of dating, G sends me a text saying something along the lines of “we were going too fast in our relationship (we didn’t know each other very much before we dated) and that we had to break up because he was uncomfortable.” While I was heartbroken, I understood his wishes and know that you can’t be in a relationship with someone you feel awkward around. Fast forward six months, and I’m mostly over it, though I still have serious feelings for the guy. I meet another person (whom we’ll call N) and fall for him, though to slightly less of an extent.

Another member of the committee has been annoying me to keep on sending the email for contribution weekly so that the money will keep coming in. He's the treasurer and handles the finance, and keeps messaging me saying ""why aren't you sending out the email this week? Nobody is giving us money anymore"".

Personally i have decided to send out email for contributions once a month, on the day the salary is paid out. Most of the colleagues get tons of email daily about work and i just don't want to keep sending when the contribution money we have at hand is already sufficient.

My decision to do the way i do it may be flawed, and maybe i'm not seeing it from his point of view. I just need advice on how i should tell this colleague that i prefer to do it my own way and not bombard everyone asking for money when i understand that they should be focusing on emails that are work related. One of the reasons is i want people who read the email would ""welcome"" it in a positive way instead of feeling harrassed. I guess it's also because i'm not a pushy person.

34,"This happened a while back when I was 15 or 16. My parents asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I had decided to ask them for a PS4. Which promptly got rejected. I had recently acquired 3 art pieces from my school, one from a friend two from people I do not know. I asked for them on my last day of school and was allowed to take them. To be honest I liked them. And I wanted them framed to make a quick buck off of one or the other. I had asked my dad following after my birthday, which I spent alone and without a gift from either my mother or my father, if I could get my art pieces framed. My father said yes and I was excited to take a class on framing. Instead my father took the two paintings and had a store frame them. He then presented them to me as my gift and told me how much it cost him, $700.

It's been a few years now but they sit in my closet untouched gathering dust. I feel terrible and know I could never sell them to pay back my dad. Nor can I throw them away despite how much I wish to retch when I remember their existence. My dad thought he was doing something kind. But it's more accurate to say he doesn't know me. He did something he claims proudly I can show to my children whenever I have them, and say I made that. But I didn't, and I have felt jilted ever since. Especially because they forgot my birthday again for the third time this year. 

I know it sounds like I'm whining, because I am, I no longer remind them. Nor do I ask them for anything. Because it feels worse to get a present meant for someone else, rather than for yourself. I feel he should know how this has made me feel. But should I?",09Aug2018,2
35,"Before I start, I think I should say that I'm trying to keep this semi-private so for anonymity, I'm in my teens, and on the day of my birthday, I will still be in my teens. 


Two weeks ago my long-distance girlfriend(Who I met online) of 10 months broke up with me three weeks before I was going to fly from Britain to the US, to meet her for the first time ever. I was the most excited I have ever been in my life for this trip, which is really saying something as not much really excites me anymore. She canceled the visit, all the plans and she told me that she doesn't want to be friends either. She was my best friend and my girlfriend, so obviously I was pretty broken when it happened.

I still live with my parents, so the day after the breakup happened, my older sister, her boyfriend, and my older brother's girlfriend came over to cheer me up, and my parents treated us all to a curry. In total, including my siblings, myself and my parents. There were eight people, and we all just played some Jackbox party games all day (If you haven't heard of it, and you're into party games, definitely check Jackbox games out).


It was a good day, and the food was great, and it cheered me up, even though when everyone had gone up to sleep, I was feeling devasted again. A week after the breakup, I learn that I can't get a single penny back from the flights, which was roughly £1k (Which is nearly $1.3k). I'm obviously very frustrated and distraught for this reason, so I'm starting to think about my birthday. I want to treat myself because this past month has been the worst month of my life, easily. 


I haven't had a lot of great birthdays. My last birthday was the best one, as I was in Sicily for that. But none have come close to topping that, and a lot of them just haven't been that much. I want to feel excitement and fun for my next birthday. I don't have very many friends, my best friend living two hours away. 


I have a general idea of what I want to do for my birthday, I want it to be exciting, with the same people that helped me over my breakup (Basically the family), and something where we are actually socializing. For example, Go Karting, Seeing a movie, Rock Climbing, are not sociable as you don't really communicate with each other much, and therefore less opportunity to just mess around have fun with each other. 


My sister's boyfriend suggested an escape room which sounds like a good idea, but I'm a little skeptical. I think it's a good idea because it's just all of us, working together but also inevitably messing with each other. Sounds like a fun day to me.



I'm asking, what would be a great birthday for me to have with my family that fit the criteria above? And my second question is how do I get over her/not think about her on the day of my birthday, because I really don't want my heartbreak to ruin this day for me.


TL;DR Girlfriend left me, want to treat myself on my birthday, need ideas.

37,"I am in a great place right now as far as education/academics and could probably have whatever career I set my mind to at this point. I have always made all A's, am a hard working student, and am taking all the possible honors courses currently that are avaliable (which lead to AP classes). I am a freshman in high school and will soon be thinking about colleges and a career. There are two *very* different careers that I am currently thinking about. One is being in the medical field (idk what exactly at this point), and the other being a video game developer at a place like Bethesda Game Studios. (Yes, the second seems like it would be every kid's dream to make video games as a living). I am a planner at heart and would like some advise from others.   


Being in the field of software and games is something I believe that I would really enjoy and be happy with as a career. I believe I would be happy doing that every day until I retire. I have a lot of experience in electronics, technology, and 3d design. According to the internet, the average annual salaries there range from $45k - $100k. I don't really know how that compares to most jobs, but I know it is at least decent. Like the medical field idea, I don't know what specifically I would want to do here. The thing about this career choice is that I don't think my parents would be too happy about it. They are paying a ton of money every year for me to go to this private school, and I don't know how they would react to me wanting to be a video game developer. However, it is something that I really have a passion for. 

I also have the idea of being in the medical field. I don't really know what specific part of it I would want to have as a career. Even if I do end up going into the medical field (or something entirely different), I would really try to go back to school at some point to become a game dev if I don't completely enjoy my current job for an exciting change. Two of the main reasons that I am considering the medical field is because I would be able to help people every day, and I could make quite a bit of money. (I know the range in salary is a lot larger for the medical field than a game dev because it is a much broader term.)   


I trust in myself that I will be fine whatever I end up doing, but right now these are my two favorite options for a career. I would like feedback on what people think I should choose as a career. I have a couple of years to decide on a career so this is just something for me to be thinking about. If there are any people who are game devs or are in the medical field, I would like to know if you are happy with what you do. Thank you in advance for the advise.",09Aug2018,1
38,"Hello people of reddit. Lately I have been receiving a million phone calls from various car companies looking for this Arturo dude. What I gathered from their various voicemails is that this Arturo guy has sent out emails requesting information on cars and has given them my number. How do I get them to stop?! I’ve blocked most numbers but more keep calling.

To;dr basically this Arturo guy gave car companies the wrong number and I can’t get them to stop calling. What do I do?",09Aug2018,1
39,"Hey guys i'll try to keep this brief. 

I just started a job as a medical assistant at the end of May. I love the job it's great... There is definitely a lot to learn and I pretty much like get along with everyone I work with. I feel like I am the type of person to get along with just about anyone. I'm not perfect but I'm always open to constructive criticism and I am always trying to better myself. I feel like life is hard and truly have a lot of empathy for people, where they are at in life, and why they are the way they are. 

Well I have this coworker who I work with very closely that I am struggling with. At first I chalked it up to a personality difference. Not bad, just different..... As the weeks go by I just foresee a lot of problems coming up now and in the future. I don't know how to handle a person like this. I think I have boiled it down to control. I think work is ultimately where she has control in her life.

So we work with 5 surgeons and 3 nurse practitioners. They rotate who is in clinic. Usually we have one surgeon in clinic and two nurse practitioners, sometimes more sometimes less. It can get a little crazy. The medical assistants get assigned to either the surgeons, the nurse practitioners, or the phones and labs.

Well today it was one doctor and two medical assistants in our clinic. It was a ultimate a breezy day. I was on phones and labs. Not my favorite because I don't like sitting all day but I'm not complaining. My coworker was on the doctor which should have been no problem. Room a patient every 15 minutes. 

Well at some point my coworker had to step away and asked me to keep an eye out for patients that needed to be roomed. NO PROBLEM. I need a break from the phones. She comes back says thank you and asks me to keep rooming patients because she needs to go to the restroom.

NO PROBLEM. I don't mind at all! I like getting up and talking to people. I needed a break from the phone anyway.

Well.... she's gone for a while and we started to get a little behind. I've roomed about three patients (she was  gone for over 45 minutes) and there is a problem the next patient needs a Spanish interpreter the one scheduled cancelled. Most of our surgeons are fine using an interpreter using their cell phones but the surgeon we had in clinic is older and very particular. He asked me to grab someone in the back who works phone to see if one of them can interpret for him. 

SO i grab the chart run in back, it's busy back there and it'e really inconvenient for them to drop what they're doing to go interp  for the surgeon.   She is a good sport when we walk through the hall the other medical assistant is out of the bathroom room a patient. No problem, I call the spanish speaker back, I room them ask them my questions with the interpreter it goes quickly. I walk out grab the marker so that the surgeon knows to go see the spanish speaking patient first for a few reasons

1. their appointment was first
2. they go there first
3. So the person i asked to interp does not have to wait around for the surgeon to go see someone else first

well my medical assistant starts to literally bark at me. She is visibly annoyed and starts asking why I'm doing what I'm doing. It doesn't bother me that shes asking me because thats just basic communication. What bothers me is she starts telling me that I should not have pulled that patient back until I talked to her first. It was NOT my decision to make to have the spanish speaking patient go first. it's HER clinic. 

Whatever I just tell her to work it out with the person interpreting and walk away because I had something else that I needed to do. 

When I go to sit at my desk (which we sit right next to each other) she wants to talk about it. Which is totally fine. Communication is really important. She tells me her side, I try to explain my side. She says it doesn't matter because it's HER clinic and  literally tells me I'm just arguing for the sake of arguing. I told her i disagreed. 

She did not care about what happened while she was gone or that I ran HER clinic for her the multiple times she asked through the day. Which it's not really her clinic... she's not the doctor. 

I did not want to be there. I did not want to talk to her. I hate having to work so closely with her. I did tell my boss what happened who told me I did nothing wrong and she would address it. 

In the past going to my boss has bit me in the butt so i hope it does not at this job. ",09Aug2018,1
40,"I am 25F and he is 28M. We started talking on tinder 1.5 weeks ago. He has been in the area for under a year, lives with a roommate and works in a warehouse doing photography on the side. I grew up in the area, live alone and work an office job. We chatted on tinder about how I was interested in photography, and he wanted to hike which I do, so we talked about going on a hike together and him showing me photography. 

He suggested meeting up first for dinner first to introduce ourselves, I agreed, so a week later we met for a burger. I was losing interest but then we had dinner, had very good conversation, and got along really well. Then, we went and got drinks after. We had a great time, it was really fun. Then he invited me over and we talked on his couch for a while about things and our families and bonded some, drinking wine, and then we made out, he led me to his bed and we had sex, and I spent the night...

He told me he had a really great night and I did too. He said he hopes we can go out again soon. We’ve been texting this week about our days. I told him that I was looking forward to seeing him again and he said he was too. 

I am not sure if I should now suggest the second date and I’m getting anxiety. Idk what to do for our second date. Maybe the hike but we’ll be all sweaty and gross.

45,"Long story short I (21f) met this guy (22m) on a dating site and we’ve gone out for dates, hooked up a few times, nothing major but everything seems fine.

We don’t text as much and I’m always the one trying to make plans to hang out. I also know he works 2-3 jobs and is super busy all the time. Even more so lately.

47,"Important information: I am 19 years old and have never had sex.

I apologize in advance if this turns into a large block of incoherent text, I just have a lot to say.

About a year and a half ago, I broke up with my first (and only high school) girlfriend. The relationship was going well for a time, but she was the type that spoke her mind and had no trouble insisting we did things her way. I, on the other hand, am more of a people pleaser in the sense that there's nothing I hate more in life than disappointing people, or basically saying no. So, any time she'd suggest something, I'd agree regardless of how I actually felt (unless it was truly against what I stood for, and even then, it would often result in an argument that just gave me anxiety since I also absolutely hate/can't tolerate conflict in the slightest).

We never had sex together, though we came very close quite a few times. I had insisted on not having sex before 18 and she did respect that choice (we broke up right before I turned 18). She was the only girl (and remains the only girl) I was ever intimate with in any way. The thing is, while our personalities may not have been compatible, our sex drives were. Our kinks lined up amazingly. We'd often sext before bed and all, coming up with scenarios that we'd both love (though, of course, we never acted on in the end).

In the end, we broke up because I always felt like I was walking on eggshells. I would constantly fear her reaction if I said anything against her suggestions for example. Breaking up with her felt incredibly freeing. I'd often get severe anxiety attacks, bordering on true panic attacks when texting her.

Life went on rather well up until then, especially since I didn't date anyone seriously.

Fast forward to about a month ago. We randomly start texting again for whatever reason, I truly don't recall. Very quickly, that sexual compatibility resurfaces. Without even intending it really we end up admitting to each other that we'd totally have sex with each other if the opportunity arises, etc. That night we sext for the first time in over a year because I'm a stupid human being. The next morning, I get hit with anxiety that lasts hours.

The next day, we talk again and eventually we decide to sext once more (I wasn't thinking straight I guess). That time was even more incredible in terms of the orgasm it produced. But so was the anxiety the next day. That morning I had my second ever true panic attack. It was the worst, pacing back and forth, heavy breathing and borderline crying.

You'd think at this point that I'd be sane enough to stop and, well, you'd be correct to an extent. I told her that day after the panic attack that I couldn't do it anymore and that I was giving me serious anxiety. She was ok with it and said she of course didn't want to cause me any anxiety. Fantastic, good and done. Right?

Not quite. About a week later, she messages me and we end up discussing this guy she met up with from Tinder (this wasn't the original purpose of the conversation but it turned into this). Turns out she'd gotten fingered by him and they'd made out on their first date/meet-up or whatever you call it. Logically, I shouldn't have felt a thing. But I did. I got sick to my stomach and to this day I'm not sure why. I'm not sure if I was jealous, or I felt uneasy knowing she'd gone farther sexually with someone other than me now, or that she could have casual sex without a problem while I had an anxiety attack at the very thought of having sex with a relative stranger.

We haven't spoken since that conversation. To this day I still get anxious not only when thinking of her (which I understand is normal I suppose), but also when thinking about sex in general, especially casual sex. I also fear that any time I'll find someone I'm interested in, I'll get flashbacks to this or my past relationship and end up backing out of self-sabotaging to protect myself from anxiety attacks. I'm just really tired of associating sex and intimacy to fear and stress and anxiety and stuff. I don't know if there's any process or method I should be using to calm myself.

Could this all go away when I actually do find someone else? I know this is all in my head, and maybe my experiences with this girl have just sort of ""ruined"" the concept of sex and intimacy for me.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Any insight into my situation would be greatly appreciated. If this is the wrong subreddit for me, just let me know. Thanks.",09Aug2018,2
48,"This’ll be long. Over the past several months I’ve been working almost full time and doing about 3 classes during an 8 week period - which is about 20 hours a semester. Along with that I have to take care of my family and I have an amazing fiancé that I also want to make sure I spend enough time with. I’m 2 months away from my job and school ending, but I just feel like that is so far away. The job I have was supposed to be great, I don’t need the job - I just wanted the experience on my resume. It ended up that they do nothing with me and I sit for 9 hours a Day barely doing anything - which just gives me a lot of time to think, which gives me a whole ton of self doubt and confusion. I have talked to everyone about doing more at work, but they really do not seemed concerned with me. I also have coworkers who belittle me and that makes me feel even more frustrated with myself. I know I’m doing great things, but I just feel as if I can’t take time for myself to straighten out my thoughts. Every time someone in my family needs something, I do it.  I can’t say no to anything because I want to be helpful.  Weekends aren’t even free because they are planned out so I can take care of family members. I think it all spans from my job why I feel like this. I’m there so much, and it didn’t turn out how it was supposed to, and I don’t need the money, yet, I’m still going to stick it out because it’s almost over - it just takes away all my time where I could do stuff for myself. I just am so tired by the time I work and take care of everyone and everything, that there’s no time for myself. I used to be able to look nice every day, and now I’m just happy to be out the door on time , just getting up, throwing new clothes on and out the door - this has really messed with my self esteem. I also know I haven’t been my best, and feel really bad about my change in attitude towards my fiancé. I’m just so tired and miserable with work and everything, it’s hard for me to be happy right now. I know 2 months doesn’t seem like a long time, but it sure feels like it, and I’m not sure what to do in the meantime to feel better. Once work and school end in October, I just have a couple months of free time to do whatever - and I’m excited for that. It’s just making it to THAT point. I do have a meeting with a new manager who came to the company, I do wonder if I should explain how I feel and maybe ask to cut my hours down, but then again, I’m almost done and I don’t want to look foolish. I just want to feel better for myself and my fiancé. Any advice would be appreciated  in regards to the job and how to make myself feel better in general. I’ve already done stuff like getting my hair done in an attempt to feel better about myself, I just wish I had the energy to put makeup on every day like I used to and wear nice clothes.

52,"TLDR: Is a private school worth it if I think I'll hate it and miss out on experiences I really want?

Im going to be a junior next year. I got into a charter school, it's really competitive. Top school in our state, ranked nationally, all that. I could go there or I could go to the local public school, where my brother and most of my friends go. From what I can tell, the public school would be amazing socially because I have friends there and you have free time (the charter school is infamous for ridiculous homework loads, and they require you to take APs). I spent the last two years at another private school, and Ive always been in small schools. Im not sure what to do because I want opportunities and a good college resume, but I also want to finally enjoy being alive for once. I feel like Im sacrificing potential happiness for some nebulous reward later on, and to make it worse a lot of people tell me high school doesnt matter as long as grades are good (not to sound r/iamverysmart but grades wont be an issue, I can do well at the charter or the public one). The people at the charter school are mostly self-identified 'intellectuals' who cant get their head out their asses and be unpretentious. 

So I guess I need to know if itll be worth it. I always feel hollow, i just want to enjoy highschool like everyone else seems too, but apparently im supposed to suffer through two years of hard work and no experiences because im 'a smart kid'. seems like a good future doesnt matter if the present required to get there makes me want to kms most days",09Aug2018,1

56,"I (20F) was bullied heavily throughout middle and high school. For example: One guy used to tell me I needed lap band, even though I was probably one of the skinniest kids at my school. (I eventually became anorexic after being bullied so much too). My “best friend” was one of the worst girls I could’ve ever subjected myself to. She was rude, condescending, and she never had anything positive to say about me. She would compare me to others every day in a negative way, meaning I was always inferior to people around us. On top of this I am autistic (didn’t find out til age 17) so I don’t cope with bullies very well.

I was bullied a lot more than that, those are just two of the people who ruined my life the most.

Lately I haven’t been able to get certain conversations and situations out of my head. I replay them like a movie. Sometimes I imagine new scenarios (ones that haven’t even happened) and think of things I could have said to stick up for myself, which I never did.

How can I stop doing this? I try going to a therapist, but I either never have the guts to bring this stuff up, or my therapist just isn’t good enough to say the right things. What can I do? I am currently obese because of my anorexia. I wish none of this had happened. I feel like I’ll never forget anything people have said to me, or at least that I’ll never move on. But that’s not what I want. I don’t want to let the past define me, or get in the way of me living my best life. It is depressing and lowering my self esteem.",09Aug2018,1
57,"So, basically what happened is, I was dating this girl. We had been together for almost two years, right? We broke up, and we said that if it ended it would be mutual, but it ended up being more of a me-dumping-her thing. It just wasn't working. 

About a month after this all happened, I'm interested in someone new. I had kind of moved on and mourned the ""death"" of our relationship before it ended, so this wasn't surprising to me. What was surprising, however, was that only about a week removed from seeing her posts about how she missed having a boyfriend and a ton of other things about her basically hinting that she missed me, I heard that she liked someone else. 

I was kind of confused, but anyway, I decided to tell her that I was happy that she found someone new and that she could move on so fast (kind of subtly asking if it was true, but I also am glad that she's happy) (also the only reason I care is because the guy I've heard it was is a guy she talked to while we were together, and I was suspicious of the friendship, but she always assured me he was nothing more than a friend, so I basically wanted to see if I was right all along), and no sooner than she opened the message, did she fire back acting confused and almost disrespected. So I told her that I heard about her and the guy who I'll call Tom. She immediately claimed that she and Tom were NOT together and they were only friends, but would admit that she was interested in him in a romantic way. So, I did what any half-wit would do, and elaborated on why I messaged her in the first place. I asked if I was right to worry before, and whatever else I said, because I don't remember, but I kept it for the most part mature and for inquiries sake the whole time.

Moving on, later that day, I found out that my ex had apparently told my new love interest about what happened, but I have a bad feeling that it's been misconstrued badly to make it sound like I'm not over her and I cant accept that shes with someone new, which isn't the case. I'm worried that my past mistakes and idiocies will come back to bite me in the form of losing the girl I'm interested in now.

58,"I have posted on here before but haven't received many responses. I need help. I need more responses. I need an objective point of view. please. I'm a mother of three children. I'm the only one who looks after my kids. I've tried to move heaven and earth to protect them, and I've failed in many aspects. I had my first child at 19. I had no clue what I was doing and I made a lot of mistakes. I have the most dysfunctional family I've ever seen in my life, and I've tried to be different. The crux of my issues is my alcoholic mother. She's evil and she's hurt me more than you can possibly imagine. I did a lot of dumb shit when I was younger, I got married several times and divorced several times. I had two children with my second husband and a third with my third husband. After that experience, when I was pregnant with my third child, I decided to change my life. And I did. the only way I could. I move back in with my mom and started working on a degree. I had no other choice. She has money that she was willing to use to support us, no one else in my family was able to do so. Fast forward three years later... I am 15 months away from getting a degree that will ensure our finances for the rest of our lives. I have worked my ass off to get into this program while simultaneously  keeping my children away from my mother, all three kids that I've had to raise alone. I did such a good job. I had my shit together. Until a year and a half ago, I met a man that has destroyed my life. I am more angry at myself than I am at him, because I don't know how I let this happen again. He was the first guy I was even capable of being attracted to in almost two and a half years after I had my third child. He was kind and compassionate. He had kids of his own and seemed to do everything right. After a few months I let my guard down and allowed him around my then 2 year old. I've been more protective of this child than I'd ever been with my other two. Not that I think anything happened to them, but I have been in agony and guilt over my stupid decisions with them for years. So when I got pregnant with my third and decided to change my life around, my only comfort was that I would do it right with this child this time, and id do everything I could to fix what I did wrong with my other two. Well, now its been almost two years since I met this other guy. I recently found out he forcefully tried to kiss, hug, and get into bed with his 14 year old stepsister when he was 25 years old, just four years ago. There were some warning signs that he had an excessive sex drive, and he lied a lot about dumb things, but I continued to see him because it was an escape from my years living with my mom and enduring constant emotional abuse, while trying to keep my kids away from it and get my degree. During this time period I left him alone with my youngest on five or six occasions, only for 10 - 15 minutes at a time while I showered or tended to my other children. I was paranoid about him from the beginning because that's just how I am, so I never allowed him to babysit her. I was always within earshot and every single time I did this, I was always listening to see if she cried and always ready to jump out of the shower or out of my other kids' rooms to see if she was okay. I never heard her cry and never saw her upset when I came back into the room. However, after finding out this information about him, and after extensive questioning of him which lead to some really bizarre reactions from him (crying, using present tense as if this is a thing that really happened instead of saying ""if I were to do something like that"", he would say ""a kid would just sit there and I don't get anything out of that sexually"", etc.)... I honestly think he did something to my daughter. My whole world is torn apart and I've stared drinking. I have no idea what to do. I've asked my daughter about him, very gently, and she has said no and yes to the questions, and she's claimed other people have touched her upon questioning, even people she is never around, such as my brother who has never been alone with her, and the 60 year old administrator at her daycare who is a female. She has laughed and giggled at the questions every time and thinks it's hilarious, and she's not quite four yet so I can't rely on what she says and I can't question her too much. What I can say is knowing my ex boyfriend's past and knowing that he lies about everything without remorse, and knowing the odd way he answered these questions, I think theres a pretty good chance he did something to her. I don't know how to live with it or what to do about it at this point. My kids all seem perfectly fine, but I did too when I was little and I wasn't fine. All that being said, I have a long history of paranoia about men being child molesters, which I think is exactly what got me into this situation in the first place. I didn't trust myself and my own boundaries because I have suspected almost everyone of this at some point in time. But, with everyone else, nothing ever came out of it and I came to my senses after a while because I realized I had no reason to suspect them. I have many reasons to suspect this guy, and I am at the point that I feel like I can't live with myself anymore because I am the dumbass that left my daughter alone with him for no good goddamn reason.

That said, I know my grandfather loves this dog to death and I am going to do my absolute best to try to keep the little guy alive while they are gone.

62,"I graduated High school earlier this May, and have basically 2 options I ever cared about., Dream Uni, and Fine Uni, I'll use.

Dream Uni is simply as the name states, my absolute dream of a university ever since my mom arranged her side of the family to come with me for visiting the campus and housing. It's out of this world for me, I love it, nothing much to say beyond that. 

Fine Uni, it's in my hometown, already a red flag, one of few things I like is that I cheated their system to where I have so many scholarships from them, that they owe ME $4,900 a semester. The money is great and all, but my mental health always declines when I'm in the same city as my family, or worse, when I live with my family, no matter if it's my mom+stepdad or dad+stepmom, it always does. Dream Uni is halfway across my state, so it's far enough I can go to family only for short periods of time, IE visits for holidays, winter and summer break, and then go back.  My mom and her dad are 1,000% on board with paying the extra $3,700 per semester, as they have told me their philosophy that by gettin this $6,500 is scholarships, in their view I paid my share, which is most of the costs, and they want to assist with the rest. Grandad is known to have bought cars and houses for family members, and I know for certain he can afford this, yet I still felt so much of a burden I used to have pushed that away.

I changed my mind yesterday, and decided that this Friday, I'm getting all my documents together and finishing things with Dream Uni to get set up, that already assigned my room and meal plan, so that's all good, and mom has my way of getting the Meningitis shot I need either tomorrow, or Friday before we go to Dream Uni. I've fully changed my mind, I want to go to my Dream Uni since the chance is right there.

I live with my dad+stepmom now, both of which have major distrust of  my mom+grandad due to past family drama. Just as my mom+granddad were pressuring me to go to my Dream Uni despite the cost, my dad+stepmom are pressuring me to stay with Fine Uni for a year or so before transferring, except I know for a FACT transferring will make this much more difficult. I just need to bring some documents in Friday, as planned by mom+granddad, and I'll be set to move in on Sunday, as they have this thing where students move in early if their Orientation day is in August. 

Just I'm very unconfrontational, and I know that dad+stepmom won't like this, as they want me to stay here for another semester or year and transfer, and  don't know what I know that it's still very possible for me to do this, as confirmed by the admission staff to me. 

How do I build up and just tell dad+stepmom that I appreciate their help, I know they don't trust mom, but I cannot bear living with family anymore, it's only been a toll on my mental health. I've never been this deep or confrontational with anyone before, and I know there's a very high chance they'll kick me out to live with mom again for the next few days until I move into the dorms. It's a miracle they ever let me back the first time I was kicked out. ",09Aug2018,1

I thought I was going to get more money this year due to my parent’s terrible income and the fact that I am a dean’s list student, but I actually received $12k less. I am almost $27k short of the amount of money I need to go to school and live in my dorm, and I can’t take out any private loans because I need a co-signer and my parent’s credit is so bad I keep getting rejected. 
I am going through an appeal process with the school and am expecting an additional $13k after we get it (if we get it) which brings the remaining amount i need down to around 14k. 
I do not know what to do. I cannot live with my parents for one second longer. This is such a toxic environment for me and every day feels like a new level of misery. I can’t find a co-signer, i can’t find 14k dollars, and even if I decide not to live on campus I still need at least 4k in loans to even go to school.

72,"I'm still not even 100% sure if it was rape to be honest. It happened when I was 16, but I didn't realize it was rape until earlier this year (I'm almost 21 now). I didn't think it could be rape because he was my boyfriend at the time.

I was stoned when it happened, so I don't remember how it started really. I just remember it happening and I didn't say anything, I didn't even move. I just laid there and looked away and cried a little. He wasn't the type to accept ""no"" for an answer anyway. If I didn't want to then he would just keep asking until he was basically begging me and at that point I would just let him do it or at least give him head to get him to leave me the fuck alone. There was even a time where i was falling asleep on the couch and he moved me over and started to pull my pants down, but luckily I hadn't completely passed out yet so I freaked out on him. I still didn't think of that as rape either. I was so fucking naive.

I've been depressed for most of my life, but after realizing that that could count as rape, I feel even worse. I've tried to talk to my friends about it, including my best friend who has been raped before, but it hasn't helped. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to cope.

Of course, I have no experience with the various skills necessary to produce a game from scratch, so I'm just sitting on a bunch of concepts.

87,"Sorry in advance for this being long TLDR at the bottom 

So I took my driving test today.  I passed first try! Yay! But unfortunately because of an awful experience with my examiner I felt pretty down for most of the day. 

So to begin he looked at my permit and 5 hour certificate and got mad. “Your certificate expires in 3 days” he just stared at me and I wasn’t sure what to say “are u hearing me? It’s expires in 3 days and your permit expires in two months you better f***ing hope u pass”. Obviously it’s hard to convey tone through text but he was not being nice or funny.

He told me to pull away from the curb. I checked all my mirrors and blind spot indicated then checked again as I was pulling out I noticed this car pull out of the parking lot across from me (it was a very narrow street) We were on a one way street and he totally ran the stop sign coming out of the parking lot so I stopped to see what he was doing. He ended up going the wrong way which was weird. My instructor “What the actual hell are you doing? You need to properly check your surroundings before u pull out so you don’t kill us both” 

I immediately get nervous. Throughout the test me made little scoffs and comments. Whatever no biggie. Then I stop at a stop sign “why the f**k do u keep doing that! Huh? You don’t have to stop before the white line just stop before the crosswalk! Jesus Christ” that’s not what I was taught but whatever 

I do my k point turn. Halfway through I try to turn off my indicator. I hit it too hard and it ends up just going in the other direction I hit it again and mess up and that’s when he fucking lost it. He was swearing up and down and said something along the lines of “just drive you fucking idiot who are you trying to signal for the people in their living rooms?”  Okay I def shouldn’t have messed around with the indicator for as long as I did but being called an idiot just seemed excessive.

I finish the test expecting to fail. He said something about my parents wasting money on driving lessons cause I showed up with my driving school. Also said something about how most imbeciles know how to properly check their mirrors. I was just trying to hold back tears and not really focusing on what he was saying. I look over at him and he’s smiling and tells me I passed.

Idk if this is worth reporting. Because he made some good points but it just felt like the way he talked to me was so degrading but I’ve heard that’s normal with examiners. I mean they are probably pretty scared getting into cars with new drivers everyday. My instructor did say he has a tendency to make people cry it’s his way of testing if you’re good under pressure. 

Also he made other little comments to me, was muttering under his breath like I parallel parked perfectly and he goes “wow the Idiot can park”. Funny enough I got so nervous and shakey I mistook the gas for the break pedal and he didn’t say anything.

This week I've been stuck doing mandatory events for a club so I couldn't work two days for training. I'll be only working one day. 

Anyhow, on my original application, I put my availability pretty broadly. But when we did work orientation, the supervisor asked for our availability this specific week. I assumed since she would obviously go off our recent availability (cause why ask) I did not mention to her about my mandatory events and I put myself down for days that I obviously was available. However, she didn't go by the most recent availability and she put me down for a day I couldn't do. 

She asked us to introduce her to any problems with the schedule. So I emailed her but I decided I'd visit in person too because obviously I don't want to mess this up and I do care about this job. Anyhow, she was obviously annoyed and told me I'm hurting myself (which I don't disagree with that at all). Anyhow, I'll only be working one day this week then.

Now, due to her statement, I've been worried. It doesn't seem like a difficult job but I mean c'mon a job is a job. I wouldn't want to screw up.

Like I mentioned, I don't disagree with her statement. In addition, I acknowledge my mistake here, even apologized, and I should've just told her anyways.

We’ve made out both occasions and have discussed everything from family goals, future plans, waiting for sex, and other topics. We have so much in common and were hitting it off great. Prior to the second date we stopped doing FaceTime. She would usually tell me her schedule of when she was free. The last date was almost 4 weeks ago, and fast forward to today, we haven’t had face-to-face communication, we still text but not as much, usually ending with her not replying for a few hours or even replying the next day. She had recently told me she wasn’t looking for a relationship right now, doesn’t want to lose me as a friend because she enjoys our time spent and still wants to see me. Some coworkers say to not text her for a few days and see how she responds and that she could be treating me like a yo-yo on her shelf, where she will send me a text knowing I still care for her, and then she doesn’t respond but will be on social media. She’ll also like some of my posts and view my Snapchat story each day. If I ask to make plans she usually doesn’t mention that text when responding.

Today is day one, and they texted me roughly 20hrs in saying that we can definitely FaceTime soon and that they loved my recent pictures. I haven’t responded yet.

99,"Around July of last year, I started developing an eating disorder. It's starve myself, but usually I caved in. I'd feel so horrible afterwords. I'd pace around my room sobbing and insulting myself while poking around in the mirror for a few hours, even. I wouldn't eat anything with any sugar (even fructose), fat (didn't matter which kind), or carbs. If I broke a ""rule,"" I'd set timers until I could eat. It was usually a few days or so. I even had a strict schedule for when I could eat, and I only wanted to eat 300 calories a day (100 cal per meal). I lost about 30lbs in a month or 2. Went from 120lbs to 90. Didn't weigh myself after that. I wanted to weigh 72lbs. I weighed that much in the 4th grade, and to me, ""it was before I got fat."" Nobody knew about it. I chewed and spit my food because I wanted to just taste anything. I had always turned to eating as a coping mechanism and going without it was driving me insane. I'd purge whatever I swallowed by mistake. I hated seeing how other people ate. I hate saying this, but I felt like everyone around me was so fucking stupid for ""putting all that garbage inside of them"". Eventually, I started being able to eat whole wheat bread with cream cheese or honey. I'd feel like shit, but I ate it because it made me feel happy. Eventually, after a little more, I was able to eat more and more and my pallet basically just increased out of nowhere. I still fantasize about never eating and living of vitamin pills and nothing more, and I've been having urges to eat and purge. The thought makes me happy. I feel like what I experienced isn't valid or was just made up in my head because people talk about how EDs are just so hard to overcome, and I feel like I did it without even trying, so maybe mine wasn't even real?",09Aug2018,1

Almost every night, in bed, while trying to fall asleep ; I get those existential crisis moments where I think about life and it’s meaning. 

It always freaks me out and makes me anxious... asking myself these type of question (what is after life, what is the meaning of life, etc.) makes me feel claustrophobic and wierd. 

I have this urge to open my phone and distract myself from these thoughts... here I am ; it’s 1:13 AM and I’m writing this post on Reddit. 

Any advice on how to counter this behaviour ? What should I do to stop thinking about this ? Is this just a phase ?

My childhood was absolute hell and still, I've done everything in my power to take care of her during both my childhood and adult life. I've always played parent and I've tried time and time again to get her help to little or no avail.

Legally, I don't really have any power since she hasn't lately been a threat to herself or anyone else. But she's now off her medication again and I just...I don't think I can do this anymore.

107,"I am a commission based front line sales associate that also handles numerous non sales related issues daily, but my job security is based on a quota. I have a customer who I have spent hours with when it comes to giving them a quote and discussing available options. (I'm being vague on purpose....so I'm sorry.)  Again, HOURS. By this point I have made it explicitly clear that I am this customers ""dedicated associate"", that I work on commission, and I will personally handle any business they may have with my company. This customer also has my direct number they can text or call 24/7. Yes...24/7. 

So that being said this customer consistently comes in randomly to add services to their account and works with random associates at random locations (which is fine and doesn't bother me)  but is always upset with the result in their billing and ONLY then contacts me.  
 
I pride myself in my thoroughness and aside from this customer I never have issues with miscommunication or billing problems. 

So how would you recommend I (again) politely tell this customer that I can not be responsible for what another associate tells them, and that if they don't come to me to add the services they need I can't be responsible for their account any longer. 

I only ask because I can spend half of my shift working with this customer while missing out on incoming sales which is ultimately impacting my job security. 

I am grateful for the business and every sale I get and am available to work by appointment. (which is ANY time that works for my customer) 

So I guess I'm just frustrated that the sales go to random associates but I get stuck for hours explaining the bill away while missing out on new sales. 

Long story short I'd like advice on how to politely let this customer know that I'm not responsible for the conversations they have with other associates and that I'm not on call to 'fix' their bill.

114,"We are a low-income family of 7 and a huge train wreck. Every member of the family is fucked up in some way and I feel overwhelmed. I feel out of control and suffocated. Meet my family:



DAD: Head of household. Main provider for the family. What, in our culture, we call ""machista."" Alcoholic. Anger management issues. Spanked 3 of us (the older ones) to the point of bleeding and scarring. Has hit my mother before. Extremely manipulative and stubborn. Drives drunk, and when angry, speeds while the children are in the car.


MOM: Undocumented. Extremely submissive, can't work. Very low self-esteem but super stubborn. Comfortable with being ignorant, and refuses to take advice from anyone unless it's something she likes to hear. Manipulative. Her children are useless unless she makes use of them. Nothing we do is enough for her unless it's of benefit for her one way or another. Narcissistic. Will laugh in your face when she's the cause of your frustration and anger. Blindly follows father's orders. Extremely passive-aggressive.

BROTHER A, 24: Schizoaffective disorder. Half brother, different dad than the rest of us. No job, no school. Addicted to cigarettes since he ran away last year for a month, found in the mountains starved and dehydrated, and ended up in a mental institution where he was given cigarettes for the first time. His cigarette addiction is a huge financial burden to us, but he will stand there all day and become verbally abusive until he gets a cigarette. Smokes till he pukes 2-3 times a day. Refuses to go to therapy, refuses to see a doctor about anything. 


BROTHER B, 20: Alcohol-dependent. Smokes cigarettes, and almost died off of Xanax last year in post-depression partying after my brother's schizophrenia developed. Gotten better, but very volatile. Has a part-time job. Reckless spending. Doesn't really care to die. Diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Won't go to therapy or take meds.


BROTHER C, 14: Plays video games maybe 16 hours of 24. Used to have anger management problems. Least involved in the family, never present. Very sweet, but he tries to mask it to protect himself. Received therapy in the past, but they said he ""didn't need it anymore"" because he said nothing was wrong with him.



SISTER, 10: Diagnosed with PTSD from being hit and watching mother get hit, and severe anxiety for her age. Receives therapy weekly, but mother and father advise her about what not to speak of. Mother casually walks around to monitor her therapy session, and her therapist ignores red flags. Very smart, very sweet, but extremely anxious all the time.



ME, 22: Student, part time worker. Diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anxiety, ADHD. No meds yet, on MediCal and waiting for next appointment with psychiatrist scheduled 2 months from now. Also have anger problems. Basically raising two younger siblings. Contribute half my income to the household. Have a boyfriend across the country I'm due to move in with around March 2019 as advised by my therapist, in order to escape the problems going on at home. Can't seem to get schooling in order to not choose a miserable career, financial aid about to run out and terrified of debt after living in near-poverty all of my childhood but desperate to make something of myself. Near-daily suicidal thoughts.




Now, like my title... what the hell am I supposed to do for these next 7 months until I get the hell out of this hellhole? How am I supposed to live leaving my younger siblings behind when I defend them from my parents mentally, and possibly physically abusing them? How do I get older brother A to seek help? How do I convince brother B to seek help? What do I have to do to get my parents to get their shit together? They get into arguments every day. 


My dad threatened my mom to have dinner ready because he left work at 4:30. My mom made food in the heat and didn't sleep all night because they were fighting. He didn't show up 'till 7 pm, drunk, and told my mom he didn't feel like eating dinner and left her hanging. He gets very angry with her when she eats without him. A week ago, he yelled at my mom and called her a prostitute in front of the kids because she ""didn't wait for him"" to have her first kid from HIM, instead of the man who raped her and gave her older brother A.

Me and this friend of mine go to different schools and a few months ago we made an agreement that we would be each other's dates for our respective school's formals (which is basically the Australian equivalent of a prom or homecoming). 

So we already had my formal (which was about a month ago) and as planned my friend was my date. She said she had a good time and everything and now it's time for me to fulfil my end of the deal - except, I'm not even sure if that's still the plan. 

I think her formal is sometime at the end of September, yet, I haven't heard any news from her about it, even though we text often. My parents are telling me to buy a suit for it already but because we haven't really talked about her formal- or if this is still the plan- I'm holding off on it. 

But I think I do need to know if I'll still be her date.  The thing is though, I'm not sure how to go about asking her without sounding clingy or desperate (we're just going as friends). I'm not sure how to bring it up casually and without it sounding awkward, desperate, clingy, etc... 

Any advice on how I can go about doing this in a seamless way? Is it a possibility that she doesn't wanna take me anymore? (which I'm fine with, but I just need to know as soon as so I can focus on other things). Am I overthinking things? (which I admit, I tend to do).

So, I've come to the conclusion that I need to end this friendship. At this point in time, I find it really uncomfortable to be around him because he often likes to start up conversations about his emotional issues while at work.

I've previously stated that I don't have the emotional capacity for these things as I am working on improving my own mental health. 

On top of that, he keeps bringing up the fact that he planning on moving away to a different continent as a result of how our friendship has gone downhill. He's constantly wanting to discuss whether he should stay or go (in private, 1-on-1) and tries to guilt-trip me by insinuating that the decision hinges on whether I will put in the effort to ""fix"" the friendship. 

He's also made a point of telling me that he's bought a non-refundable airline ticket - but of course, he refuses to tell me the destination. I feel like this is a cry for attention.

This entire situation has exhausted me and I just want it to go away because I'm worried my mental health will start declining as a result. I've tried to make my points clear without being unnecessarily harsh but he just doesn't seem to understand. I guess I'm also worried about the potential aftermath since I still have to work with him.

So about two weeks ago, Sarah (not her real name but it works) visited her home town two hours south-ish of where we live. She was only there for three days, and in that time, visited a man she used to get high with before we started dating, who lives across the street from her mother. She visited him one of those days. Now before this, about two trips south prior, she had previously had to shove off the advances of him (let's call him TJ), and remind him that she was engaged. 

I fucking knew this would happen. He raped her. Not once, but twice, and apparently the last time she went there he raped her then as well. She never consented. He got her drunk and took advantage of the fact that she is slightly autistic. I'm filled with rage. I so very badly wish to drink down there, find him, and beat him until he bleeds to death, for what he did. Sarah is the sweetest, most genuine kind person I have met, and for someone to take advantage of her makes my fucking blood boil. 

Last week, she visited a hospital for a rape kit after confessing to me that she had been raped twice. Obviously as it had been a week. she had showered, and had thrown away the panties she was wearing when he raped her, and the bruises all over her are gone. there's no physical evidence. She pursued something with the police, but to no avail. He was only warned to stay away from her.

My question is. What the fuck do I do? I am so angry i can't process it all. ",09Aug2018,34
134," Long post ahead

I graduated almost 2 months ago (finally) and my gf moved in with me at my moms (everyone involved was accepting of it including my mom, and was talked over many times). I also got a job at Walmart. 

Recently my mom has been treating us both like she's a landlord, and its kinda slowing our ability to gtfo and start life. Its a bit annoying but its workable, together we have pay $300 a paycheck to stay there, plus i need to pay my part of the car insurance, which may be an extra $200ish a month. There are a lot of minor things making it extremely irritating to stay here. This has put stress on my relationship and in turn is making things more annoying with my mom. My gfs household was not a good place for her, hence why she's with me now. Together we make ~3,200 a month rounding down to be safe, and are looking for a suitable living situation for her and I. We know we can make it on our own as a couple, we've tested it many times. Is that sustainable to live off of? A lot of apartments in our area want a credit score or something like it that we dont have, and i have a cat which also makes things a little more complicated. Getting rid of her is 100% off the table. Are apartments more acceptable of younger people with good track records? We are both 18 and I'm responsible with money. About how long would it take for us to get out on our own? Approx. Rent in our area is about 1,000 a month also.

135,"A little over a month ago, a guy came to my job and asked for my number. I felt a little pressured by his request and decided to do it. He texts me one week after and I decide to respond “hey” but quickly felt that something might not be right and stopped responding to his texts. About another week passes and I figured that he got the obvious message. However, as I was closing the store outside, I began to get unknown caller phone calls, which I’m certain is him because I’ve never received calls like before this. My coworker decided to answer and tell the person to stop but they didn’t respond. Today, I received a message on Whatsapp  saying “waiting for this message. this may take a while”  from him and I’m terrified now that he might be trying to hack my phone or something. I don’t know if I should quit my job or what actions to take because I don’t feel safe anymore. Any advice appreciated.",09Aug2018,1
136,"So about 5 months ago I paid for a holiday for me and my best friend of 10 years to go on (we are both 22, but not like that's really important). It was a 4 night stay in an apartment in a fancy part of Spain. For 2 people including flights, apartment, transfers and insurance it cost me £1200. I paid for it alone as she goes to Uni but she also works part time. She does have money but I thought it would be easier for me to pay for it and she can pay for all/most things while we are out there to balance it out. 

About 2 weeks ago we had a ''falling out''. I say it with the '' '' attached because it wasn't a falling out at all. It was me opening up to her and telling her I was upset with the way her and her boyfriend were treating myself and my boyfriend on a group holiday we were on and it was her lashing out at me and getting defensive. I didn't retaliate nor was I nasty towards her. She has now blocked me on Whatsapp as well as all social medias. 

After contacting the travel company, I found out that because our flight due date is less than 20 business days away the most they can refund me for the holiday is £50. Am I wrong in thinking that because she is the one with the problem and the giant stick up her arse that she should at least pay half towards the holiday? I have texted her twice now and shes ignored my messages (Normal texts not WhatsApp cause im blocked, duh!). I've gone as far to ask her mum to talk to her. If she doesnt want to be my friend thats fine and thats her choice but the fact shes now left me out of pocket by £1200 is unfair, right? Is there any other way I could go around getting the money? Or am I going to have to just chalk this up to experience and get over it. 

Extra note: Around a year ago I paid for us to go to Brighton for a weekend away together as its our favourite place and she also ditched me last minute then leaving me £500 out of pocket. She paid me back her half though.",09Aug2018,2

138,"I recently moved to a fabulous new home with great housemates.

However, I've been super busy, pulling 10 hour days, and staying with my partner on weekends - I'm a full-time med student with a part-time job.

So, I haven't seen my housemates very much at all in the month since I've moved in.

I just came home at 11pm, and on my way to the restroom, turned around to see one of my housemates staring at me.

I said, ""Hey! How's it going?""

He said, ""Busted!""

I laughed.

He said, ""How've you been man? Good?""

I said, ""Yeah, really good. How about you?""

He said, ""Good. I haven't seen you in a couple weeks.""

I said, ""I know, I've been super busy.""

He said, ""What? You, busy? I don't believe it!""

Then, he walked past me to his room and said, ""Good to see you, have a good night man.""

I want to believe this is just him being sweet and charming. But, I've had so many weird passive-aggressive and paranoid housemates that I can't help but worry there is some foreboding undertone to this interaction.

What is your perspective?

140,"Tl:dr at the end.

In January, I did something terrible to my friend. While they accepted my apology, I lost the friendship and everyone associated with that person. At the same time as this incident, I also began a new job.

My roommate decided to live with their significant other - who did not want additional roommates - when our lease ended in July. I tried somewhat to find a studio or a new roommate, but ultimately I resigned from the job (due to the stress from the incident and the job itself) and moved back in with my parents 500 miles away.

My father was verbally abusive and unpredictably angry growing up, but had seemingly made significant changes in his life after therapy. Still, I found being around him difficult because I didn't want to believe he'd changed. Obviously, this is my problem and doesn't excuse me being rude.

Yesterday, he questioned me about my mother's location and I answered in a frustrated tone because I rarely know where she is. He got upset (understandably) and things escalated until I threatened to kill myself in front of him with a knife I had in my room (I realize this is bad, to say the least.)

Eventually I confessed to my parents what really happened in January and I thought we all were on the same page. He even hugged me and said he had no idea. We both apologized.

Today, he sends me, my mother, and my sister a paragraphs long text about how everyone hates him.

When we fought, he had suggested that I might be more comfortable staying with my grandma (i.e. his mother, who he also has a tumultuous relationship with.)  I said no, but after thinking more about how unfair it is for me to have a bad attitude when he has done nothing wrong, I moved my things out while he was at work. I sent a text saying ""I'm staying with grandma. I'm sorry for everything.""

After work, he throws all of the stuff I was coming back to get tomorrow into a garbage bag, curses at my grandma over the phone (as usual), and throws it on her front steps.

I guess I just don't know what to do. I knew this was going to happen. I only came home because to me, it was either that or be homeless. I always run from my problems and I thought it was time to face them. I just though I'd get a new job and stsrt going to therapy more quickly, but now things are even more fucked up.

I have an interview for a job at a company with bad reviews. Should I take this if offered, get an apartment in the city, and go to therapy for a year, or should I leave the state now and figure it out as I go?

Honestly, even being within 500 miles of my parents seems to be a bad idea, but I've been making bad decisions for the last two years. I don't trust my judgement anymore. Also, my sister lives here and I do care to see her.

Tl;dr: Depressed for a while. I fucked up, came home, and fucked up again. Should I stay or go? Are there other options? ",09Aug2018,1
141,"Background: 29F, live alone but close to my parents (emotionally and literally) and visit a lot. 

My dad’s life revolves around drinking. He works, he comes home, he drinks until he falls asleep. On special occasions, he can’t fall asleep so just keeps drinking with disastrous consequences. The last few special occasions have gone like this: 

* My mum’s 50th: kept passing out. I had to take him home. I propped him up against the porch while I unlocked the house. He passed out and smacked his head on the concrete. 

* My brother’s 21st: woke up next morning with a huge gash in his head and couldn’t remember how it happened. Found his glasses broken on the kitchen floor and realised the gash was shaped like them, he must have passed out and fallen on his glasses. 

* My last birthday: we went to the cinema as a family. Afterwards I suggested we all go for a drink. He said he couldn’t because he had stuff to do. The ‘stuff’ turned out to be drinking alone. 

* Last Christmas: we both like cheese so I ordered us some unusual cheeses for after dinner, and stuck little labels on them with the name and where they’d come from. Dad was plastered by 2 o clock, ate the cheese but just kept slurring ‘nice brie’. None of them were Brie. He was too drunk to read the labels. 

At the time I didn’t show I was hurt about any of the above. I’ve never told him how I feel because I fear pushing him further away, but part of me wants him to know. My 30th is coming up and TBH I’m scared a) that it will be ruined or worse b) that my dad will end up seriously hurt. 

I don’t want to judge him, or say ‘don’t be depressed’ or ‘don’t be an alcoholic’ because I know he can’t do that. I just want to say ‘this is how I experience your drinking’. 

How would you do it?

*TL;DR: want to tell my dad how I experienced various times he got dangerously drunk, but not sure how to do so without hurting him. *",09Aug2018,3

144," I'll keep this as brief as possible. (Spoiler, it isn't very brief) I'm turning 19 soon, and I'm being given an incredibly generous second chance by some out of state family to move back up there and pursue an actual life and career, most likely in the military. 

I moved up to Washington when I was 16, stayed for just about a year before I was kicked out for being a spoiled bratty asshole to my uncle and Aunt. I moved back down to the desert, officially a high school drop out and have stayed with some family friends working dead end jobs just to keep me from being homeless. Shortly after I came back down I met a girl through a friend of mine and we've been together almost for a year. She's a major sweetheart. We lost our virginity to each other and despite some small bickering here and there we've have had a pretty happy relationship. 

Well, recently I started contemplating the military as an option. Get my GED, ace the ASVAB and join so I could make something of myself. I called my uncle (we've made peace at this point, not comfortably but enough that I can talk to him about such things) he thought it was a great idea and we've been discussing it for a few days. 

I got a call from him today, and completely out of nowhere he invited me back up to Washington for a second chance. He said he really wants to see me succeed and even though we parted on unfortunate circumstances, he thinks we've both matured enough and he wants to help me pursue this option. Of course, I'm fucking stoked. I loved my time up there and this is exactly the chance I needed for myself. 

However, my girlfriend is going to be less than pleased. When I first brought up the military at all, she was against it. I talked to her into accepting it eventually but that was under the assumption it was going to be months from now, and that I wasn't even sold on the idea. But now, we're talking within the month (our 1 year anniversary is at the end of August) and I have no idea how to break it to her that this is what I need to do for myself. 

She's going to be devastated. I'm all she really has at the moment, because she's been going through some tough shit herself lately. But I don't know how to tell her that I need this for my own future. I'd be happy to stay with her through it but I don't know what her thoughts will be and I'm scared what her reaction will be. 

Yeah, I sound like a pussy but seriously, we're talking about a girl who's pretty emotionally unstable and I'm nervous about talking to her with this. Thanks for listening and I appreciate any feedback.

148,"My grandma and I talked the other day on the phone. She lives on the other side of the country. I've been dealing with some bad shit where I'm at now, and she offered to have me move out there in about 6 months when I can. It would be an opportunity to completely start over, but I would be leaving behind most of my family and all of my friends. I just met an amazing girl that would be really great to be with, but both of us have so much shit going on that we need to work on before dating. I really don't want to tell her that I might be moving across the country in six months, but I don't want to get too involved and then already have the move set up, or not move because I'm dating someone. She told me she wants to be together some day, but right now wouldn't be a good idea for either of us.

So, chance with a girl, or fresh start somewhere else? And if I do go, how do I explain to her my decision?

150,"Long backstory short, my friend lives in a troubled household and asked to move in to my house for a while until things calmed down. 

I’m getting frustrated. I love my friend, but she’s making life so difficult. 

1. The front doors of the house are worn, and will drift wide open if left unlocked, meaning that the doors must be locked at all times. My friend doesn’t have the keys to the house, so we’ve instead told her to just tell us if/when she’ll be going out so that we can lock the door behind her. Except, she never tells us. She went out at 2 AM once while the house was asleep and I ended up getting a call from my neighbor at around 6 AM asking why my door was wide open at that time. Absolutely frustrating because I’ve already made it clear to her that she needs to let us know.

2. Remember how she doesn’t have the keys? Well, that also means that when she comes back at ungodly o’clock (4 AM), we ALSO have to get up to let her in. The house also had a doorbell, and I’ve told her before NOT to ring it too early or too late because it’s terribly loud and it would wake up the entire house. Apparently she forgets this too because she has done it anyway twice already. I have college. My brothers have work in the morning. It just feels incredibly inconsiderate for her to come back past 12 AM and wake me up.

3. She’s messy. This I’m a little less peeved about because the “move-out” was hasty, but she still tends to leave her room an absolute wreck. Again, it’s far from a big deal, but a little tidiness isn’t too much to expect. 


I’ve already spoken to her about all of this, and it continues. It’s starting to get on my nerves but I don’t want to kick her out. She’s going through some hard times and she’s one of my closest friends, but I honestly don’t know how I can keep this up. A wide open door is an invitation for trouble. I just want to her to be more considerate of us and adhere to a reasonable schedule most of all. I’m on the verge of giving her the boot. Is there anything you guys could suggest?

When we reconnected, we stated that no matter what, we’d stay friends. So friends usually talk a few times a week? And if we are fwb, hitting each other up for sex shouldn’t be out of line? 

I just don’t want to come off as clingy and I’m worried that I just got played. Though they said they wanted to hang out this week, they haven’t contacted me. I know people get busy but they were the one to reach out and make the first move and now I’m just scared that everything we discussed was all lies and this is a game to them.

So is there a difference with being upfront and clingy and desperate? ",09Aug2018,1

163,"Tons of text below guys and girls, so thanks in advance for your patience.

Situation is the following. I've been visiting prostitutes for over 3 years (I feel totally fine about this). Once I got bored with professionals and searched for a less experienced amateur girl in need of money and I found her.

The girl is 21, and she is way more smart, polite and well-mannered than I was in her age or many of my friends are or were. And I had a very tough period in my life when I met her, so meeting her helped me to get through it. Once I openly told her that I can't treat her as a call girl (because she differs a lot from usual call girls), so I started supporting her with money regularly in exchange for meetings (which do not involve sex only but also a lot of friendly talk and mutual support). I did not set any strict rules, because we both did not have a lot of free time. 

This was about a year ago and one day she told me she decided not to make money this way anymore (but she was happy to continue our meetings). But as I am not very wealthy and have my own family, I never was able to cover her needs fully (and honestly never had such an intention, I believe this would have created a bad type of connection). She tried few different jobs which were taking a lot of her time and energy (obviously) and were hard to combine with her study in college. 

About two months ago she got into a deep fight with her father (the parents are divorced) and left her home. As I am regularly monitoring different sources of commercial sex ads, I quickly discovered she got back to prostitution (amateur as before, without her own place or working on somebody - outcalls and car BJs).

I am honestly worried about this for the following reasons:

1. Prostitution is illegal in my country and is really dangerous. Girls and women (especially solo workers) are basically unprotected and often treated badly. I personally knew a girl in my apartment building who was an amateur call girl and got killed. 
2. The girl does her business really carelessly. She works alone and mostly during nights (which double scares me). She posts ads from her real social media account, which makes her a perfect target for a blackmail. In her case there is an easy way to find contacts of her mother and start blackmailing her in different ways. And society in my country is orthodox, so even the revelation of this fact would cost her a lot (reputation, friends etc.).
3. Though she often acts very optimistic, I feel there is a lot of pain. She ignores any general talks about relationships, love and romance, she once simply tweeted she does not believe in love (OK, this might be fine for her age). I guess the recent divorce of her parents broke her heart (there was another tweet suggesting this) and that's where it all began. It seems to me that a lot of things she does (including prostitution) are aimed to deal with this pain.
4. Apart from safety and reputation issues, I am afraid she will get a habit of constantly fixing her financial troubles this way. I saw some women over 30 who were sincere with me and honestly regretted this way - they lost their beauty and health earlier than average but failed to make any significant savings, so they basically don't have any future now. The exceptions exist but they are rare.

I need some advice. I saw relevant questions on QUORA and answers suggesting minding one's business. I do not have any bad feelings against sex workers, but I just think she is too good for this. I am not a fan of any radical solutions, I feel that a long and soft support will be required.

P.S.  She knows that I know about her ads, but we are both shy to talk about this in details (I just asked her to be careful and be free to contact me if she gets into any trouble)

Thanks in advance to anyone who comes with some advice.",09Aug2018,0

As far as I think, it's outdated and mostly a religious act (her fam is Muslim for reference). Obviously online mentions some minor benifits for reducing risks of a few things but for me, its excessive and cruel, and i would rather not 'maim' for lack of a better word, my children for vauge maybe-benifits.

170,"First off, I'm not sure if this is where to post this, I'm sorry if there's somewhere better this belongs. It may not all make sense, I speak as things come to mind and things that I think might be relevant. But here it is...  

Ok, well I was always an overweight kid growing up. I had lots of ""girl"" friends and it always felt right to be around them. I messed up when I was 17 and used my brother in laws credit card to buy a PlayStation and I ended up in trouble and went to JDOC for 6 months. During those 6 months I had a ton of time to think and better myself. I lost a lot of weight and I was in a counseling group that really helped me come out of my shell and not be so nervous around people. (I was very shy) So when I got out I was looking great and I felt amazing. I was kind of a man whore, talking and making out with all kinds of girls. Until one day I was at a friends house with a girl I was messing around with, and I met met the most beautiful girl ever. I was 17, she was 15. We hit it off real fast. Our first kiss was absolutely magical and our first time was even better. At the end of our first time I felt an overwhelming urge to tell her I loved her. I whispered it in her ear and had no regrets. I know it's silly, how can you love someone you met only a few days ago?! But I felt so many intense feelings and it wasn't just lust. Her mom liked me and I ended up moving in with her and her family a week later. Everything about this relationship felt right to me, I loved her younger brothers, her mom, and her friends. I was scared of her dad and I didn't get along with her older brother. Her mom was a recovering drug addict on methadone and she had a rough childhood and wanted to get out of the situation. We decided if we had a baby that was our golden ticket out. So we got pregnant within the second week. Her mom wanted her to get an abortion, and everyone started to look at her different because she was a pregnant 15 year old mixed girl in a small church town. Everything stresses us out and got to us, especially her. We ended up breaking up and she lost the baby a month later. We remained ""friends"" for a few months until one night we got drunk and got into a bad fight. She hated me, we completely stopped talking and I tried to move on. I ended up getting with another girl within a year and things got serious. She (girl 2) lived with her abusive aunt and her mom abandoned her, so I felt bad like I needed to help. She moved in with my parents after a few months and we dated for 3 years until we got married, a year later we had our first child, and a year after that our second. I ""loved"" her but it never felt the way it did with the first girl in this story. I always thought about girl 1, and even debated having an internet friend ""dox"" her so I could get in touch. 7 years after the start of my relationship with girl 2, we got a divorce. I found girl 1 on Facebook and we talked but she was pregnant and hormones, you know? She has since had the baby, and she came over last night and we drank and talked for hours. I told her everything I felt and how real it was to me, I teared up when I was talking about it. She had been in some abusive relationships since, lost her dad last year, her mom went to jail, and her baby daddy isn't around at all. My kids love her and she is really good with them. We stayed up all night and when the sun came up and we were ready for bed, I took her to my bed for her to sleep and I laid on the couch. She got up and came to me and things happened and everything still feels the same to me... I know not to rush things, but I am also afraid if I don't try I will lose my chance at redemption. I had lost her for 7-8 years and I held onto EVERYTHING. I am 26 and she is 23. And now that I've been with her again, I feel so lost without her. My life has gone down hill, I had put on a lot of weight since we initially broke up, but when she messaged me last week talking about moving back here, I felt a change mentally. I have started eating healthier and exercising. Getting my life back together. I've been meaning to do this for a while but this gives me motivation. 

Am I wrong for holding onto those feelings so long? Or is it bad that she's the only thing that can motivate me? Am I crazy? Should I talk to a counselor? There's so many things I'm feeling right now and I'm afraid I'm taking it the wrong way. I feel like this girl is the love of my life and we just weren't ready when we first got together so we had to go on our own journeys and now life has brought us back together as a sign... I understand we were young and I made some bad decisions, I don't agree with them and I personally wouldn't let my daughter even think about doing something like what we did. But then again, who am I to stop something potentially life changing and magical? I'm sorry for how long this is, I just have this feeling in my chest and need some advice from people that may be wiser than I am. Maybe I just misinterpreted the relationship from the beginning because of problems I had with family growing up. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",09Aug2018,1

173,"So I'm trying to talk to an old friend again since it's been a while, but I'm having trouble reading her interest in being friends.

I used to knew her somewhat well, we were decent friends and we'd hang out a bunch on campus. Same interests, she's really chill and I enjoyed being around her. It's been a while since we had classes together, and I'm a really socially anxious person so I'm not really one for messaging, and we never truly messaged each other extensively.

Let me just say, I'm not interested in her romantically, if I was I doubt it'd get anywhere. I'm mostly just a bit lonely and I'm trying to get out of my bad social habits, and keeping contact is one of them.

Now, from the few times I messaged her in the past and from getting lunch with her countless times, I know her texting habits. She'll get a message and leave it unread for a while, and her phone is constantly being blown up. She's really active in a bunch of different things and has a ton of friends, so that in combination with her being the type to just respond when she has the time and not asap makes it really hard for me to judge interest in conversation through response time.

The thing is, since I'm not one for messaging, our contact has lessened over the years, as mutual classes have essentially ceased to happen and the only time we do see each other is from mutual club gatherings. A few months back I was in a rough spot and she saw it during a meeting and reached out, and I messaged her for a while. It was nice, but I had trouble figuring out what some of her gif and emoji usage was and it was stressing me a bit so I dropped it. Next time I saw her, since this was around a small break, she asked why I stopped messaging her in person and before I could answer, she got interrupted and that was kind of the end of it. She wasn't mad, at least it didn't seem like it.

I figured I might as well message her again since I've not really been doing anything this summer to see what she's up to. The usual happened, we both asked how we were, she told me about some stuff going on in her life such as a new job and a renewed interest in an older game me and her both used to talk about a lot and play together. I made a joke about her job since it was a place me and her would grab lunch at sometimes, which could've been worded better in hindsight, so it kind of flopped. But next to that I asked how she enjoyed the newest update to the game and she said she hadn't played on it yet, and I just kinda repeated a popular joke among the community about avoiding a part of the new update and she just responded by sending a laughing emoji.


The thing is, she her response times were long as fuck, and she was active a bunch before responding to me. That last message I sent her was left on unread for around a day before she got back to me by just liking it with a laughing emoji. Her responses themselves were somewhat engaging minus that last one, and I'm really having trouble gauging her interest and if I should message her again or not. On one hand, she is known to have long response times and maybe my jokes just kinda struck out and I should stop trying to be funny. On the other hand, maybe she straight up didn't care and intentionally ignored my messages, and I don't want to bother her, especially since I'm really just interested in being friends. The other thing is, it's similar to how the last messages ended, emojis fucking freak me out because I can't read much past what they're called, so I'm probably overreacting to a normal conversation thing and don't realize she'll probably hit me back with ""Why did you stop talking?"" next time I see her.

TL;DR: I messaged a girl I'm trying to be closer friends with again. She's known to have long response times, but I'm also bad at messaging and I can't tell if she's interested in me as a current friend or not. In response to my messages, she had long response times but was relatively engaging. Should I message her again or just forget about her being a friend again?",09Aug2018,1

I cannot obtain work because of bus schedules. I would have to sleep on the streets if I were to get a job due to bus schedules.

I am an electronic engineering student in a small-ish college. There are no girls in my classes. No guys in my classes know any girls either because they are unattractive male nerds who girls do not want anything to do with.

I have Asperger Syndrome and am very awkward. I stutter a lot, too. I cannot hold conversations. I also have no time to practice conversations because I am a poor, commuting engineering student, so I can only talk to people for two hours every day. And those people are unattractive male nerds.

My college's social scene is nonexistent. The only clubs available are all strictly degree or ethnicity based. There are no acting clubs, no music clubs, no nothing. I cannot join any clubs anyway because I have to be off campus by five to catch the bus.

Online dating does not work because I live in a trashy, low-income area full of obese, trashy people. I also have only selfies on my phone and no other photos of me because I do not have the time to have a social life.

I am only attracted to young college students because I am a young college student myself. I am not attracted to anybody older than me.

I haven't spoken with him in a while, and he was the only person I could think would be calling from jail.  I felt bad for missing the call, so I called back.

I’m self conscious from my head to my toes, my clothes, how I act, what I say, my personality, my face, my hair, my body etc. People tell me otherwise, they say I’m pretty and nice and funny but I never believe them. My negative thoughts about myself have stopped me from going to school, out with friends and just leave my room entirely. Sometimes I can overcome my fears for school etc but it does get really hard sometimes. This has been happening for the past two years. I want to know how to stop it? I’ve tried everything dr google says and I’d really rather not go to a therapist or talk to family and friends because that makes me really uncomfortable. What do I do? ",09Aug2018,10

190,"My online friend has been spamming my DMs with posts or videos that I'm not really interested in (cars, girls doing the in my feelings challenge, sports etc.). At first, I thought it was just normal because we usually share posts thru DMs. This time, I knew something was off because every time I would react to a post that they share, they would not acknowledge my reaction at all and would just reply with another wave of posts that I give zero shits about. 

This went on for like 2 days, but on the 3rd day, I decided to hit them up with a ""Hey, what's up?"". After a few hours, I got a reply from them, but not with an answer to my question but with two posts that featured girls doing the in my feelings challenge. I was slightly pissed so I ignored those posts and didn't react to it. When I woke up the next day, I discovered that they sent me another wave of posts and even double sent some of the ones that were already sent. I was confused (and annoyed) because I thought I made them mad or something. So I went ""You mad at me? Lol"" and guess what? They replied with another post. No text message, no explanation whatsoever. Just a goddamn video about another girl doing the in my feelings challenge. 

So at this point, I was livid. I knew that they were trying to screw with me and wanted to get on my nerves. And boy did it work, but I was not about to let them know that. I want to piss them off as well but at the same time I want to ignore them until they get tired and just actually engage in a conversation with me. I can't think of any fun way to get them back. What do you think? Should I just ignore them until they get tired of spamming me? Or should I get revenge? If so, what would be the best revenge that would guarantee to make them pissed af?

192," I believe that every single person in the world is driven by an inner urge to experience and produce more happiness in his or her life. That's why we all do what we do and while each one of us may term it differently, the underlying desire is to feel good - to be happy. We all want to be happy and rightfully so, life is goodness and the whole purpose of living is to enjoy life. So there's nothing wrong with seeking newer, better ways of manifesting happiness in your life, but it's about time you started gaining a better understanding about how to find happiness in your life because many times, we go about it the unlawful way chasing after things that we think will bring us the happiness we seek only to discover that it isn't so.

Social conditioning has painted a somewhat distorted picture of what happiness is. All ideas of happiness carry an emphasis on the external part of life. It seems to be attached to doing certain things or having certain things and while the doing and having isn't wrong in any way, making happiness dependent on effects is a sure way of missing it for a bigger portion of your daily living. If you want to find happiness in your life on a daily basis, there are certain things you must know now and begin adapting in your daily routine. To begin with, let's reframe what happiness means to you.

Happiness doesn't mean that everything is absolutely perfect each moment of the day, it means that you are content and grateful for where you are, that you can see some good in your current situation and that at your core, you feel stable, whole, and enough - just as you are. Happiness is being in your alignment. It is being in a state of appreciation, love and feeling good not because of what's happening in that moment but because of who you are. It is allowing life to freely be, as it will, trusting that only good can come to and through you because goodness is the fundamental essence of your life.

This doesn't mean that you won't have challenging days or things to overcome. It doesn't mean that you will always have everything perfectly laid up each day. The clouds are just as necessary to this beautiful world as the clear blue sky. The storms are just as normal as the gorgeous summer days. But the sun and the clear blue skies don't go into depression or doubt their own goodness simply because dark skies cover them for they know the truth about life. I want you to start recognizing the same in your life. So here is something new that I wish to introduce to you:

**Happiness is the outward expression of Joy, which is an overfill, a saturation and a state of being from a mind that is highly developed, strengthened and deeply connected to its source.** At the core or source of any individual existence is Spirit and at this inner most central life-giving place there is only bliss. So in my opinion, what I have found to be the truth about happiness is that: It is bliss from that spiritual center that gives life to you and I, seeking to express itself. That expression at its most concentrated and individual level is what we consciously refer to as happiness.

Is it thus normal to want happiness in life? Absolutely! That is who we are in essence. The inner pull we feel toward seeking more happiness is simply that life- giving spirit within us wanting to express more of the bliss that it is. So how can you find happiness in your life?

* First of all, slow down, stop pursuing it or chasing after it as though it is something external to you that you must get. It cannot and will not be found in the doing, getting or having of some external thing because it is in itself an expression of something fundamentally higher - bliss.
* Secondly, know that there is no way to finding happiness. Happiness is the way. It is the way to eternal joy, to effortless manifestations and to a thriving lifestyle that is based on freedom. You can't put happiness on hold to a future time because you either cultivate it here and now or it remains elusive.
* Third thing that you must know is that if you choose to view happiness as an outward expression of Joy, which is a state of being that's generated from the experience of bliss coming about through that higher connection with the living spirit within you, then you can relax more and be easy with this idea of having more happiness in your life. You can start working on the current beliefs you have regarding happiness, how to have it and where to seek it so that they can reflect more of this new understanding that is dawning upon you.

Knowing that the starting point is the living spirit within you, the only work then is for you to discipline yourself enough and retrain your mind into a stronger connection with the source of your happiness so that you can make it manifest in your outer physical world effortlessly and in ways that you are sure will never be threatened by any facts that arise as you continue with your human journey.

When your happiness is coming from its true source, the cars, homes, money or anything else you play with in the physical world will be enjoyable but they won't enslave you or dictate how much happiness and joy you can experience. Even during stormy or cloudy days, your central sun will still stand strong and stable until the temporary changes have passed on. This for me is what the modern individual needs to know about happiness. All the common little ideas and practices that personality teachers emphasize are well and good as far as they go but given the constant changes of the material world, cultivating happiness must be at a level that surpasses the personality or even the dual world. A mind that seeks to cultivate happiness physically, mentally and emotionally alone will still not strike the level where the source of happiness is to be found. We need to create mindsets that cultivate happiness from the true source and then naturally balance the two extremes of our existence such that at the highest level we can then be able to connect with bliss and from the lower levels of our every day living we are confident enough to go about daily work and dream building with a confidence that happiness is in us not in the thing we are attempting to produce.",09Aug2018,1
193,"A few months ago i was parked on a hill in a narrow street.  A car wanted to get through so i decided that i'd drive forward and out of the street to make it easier for them.  For reasons i still dont know, as i tried to accelerate, my accelerator was locked.  Being on a steep hill, my car began to roll backwards, scraping the side of this guys car.  My brake didnt work either so i slammed the hand brake on and got the car into park.  Anyway, we exchanged details and i thought insurance would do the rest.  I have third party property damage cover.

Fast forward to now, i receive i text from the guy whos car i scraped;

Hi (thetastybeggar) my insurance is taking it's time to follow up on fixing my van. Depending on what your excess is I can provide you with a couple of quotes and you can decide which way you want to go. Also can you send me your postal address as it's required by insurance company? 

I dont know if im just being silly but wouldnt his insurance company get in contact with my insurance company?  Why do i need to provide this guy directly with my address??  Why is he the one contacting me about quotes?  I know im probably being silly but ive been in an accident before and insurance covered verything without my involvment needed.

194,"I'm 28, own my house, own my car, and am working a dead end job but it pays well. I'm bored. I've traveled all over the place, from islands everywhere to backpacking across Europe and Japan. Hiked mountains in every earthly biome imaginable, dove in all the best reefs, and have tried so many random hobbies that my garage could probably double as a hobby store. Long boards, surf boards, RC cars, rollerblades (lol), weight sets, computer parts, every game console, tons of tools, bikes, paint and canvas... Nothing really sticks though. 

This morning while planning a trip to Alaska because I have some vacation time and why the hell not, I was looking around on Google Images for places to explore there when it really hit me... I just don't want to. Why am I doing this? All of these things have been... neat I guess? But none has left me with a great feeling of any kind. I do these trips but I'm honestly never really excited to see them coming up. The day before it's just a ""well here we go again, I kinda don't want to but I know it will be alright once the boring flying is over"". I've seen these places but while there was I ever really amazed or loving it? Not really. 

I just don't know what to do with myself. It feels like I'm constantly chasing ""something"" fun, but I can never really catch it. 

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? I watch people become gods at a specific skill and see how much they love doing it. Drawing, wordworking, scuba diving, hiking, gymnastics. I just can't find something like that and I'm so beyond jealous that they found that one thing they truly enjoy doing. ",09Aug2018,1
195,"I am  26 F and I currently have two jobs. One full time job that I have had for about 2.5 years. And one part time job I have had for 1 year. 

My full time job I am very good at and I know all the ins and outs. I work independently for the most part, most of the day. Although I do work closely with coworkers and others around the office. It is a data entry job for corporate grocery. Lots of job duties have changed over the last few months and I haven't been very keen about them and I have been frustrated with my job as it feels like it has turned into a lot more micro management than it used to be. 

My current part time job is a smaller business but in good standing with a bright future and a recent expansion. It is a very difficult job and being part time, it's always been hard to retain a lot of information. It is a logistics job and can be very stressful at times. It is the opposite environment from my full time job.

I was just offered a management position to manage the logistics office during the day at my current PT job. I got a 5.50$ an hour raise compared to my current full time job and 6.50$ an hour raise than what I currently make there. This is a huge change for me as I have never been a lead or manager of any sort and my only other full time job is the one I am at now. I am terrified because I know less than everyone that works there yet I am asked to lead them. I feel like I would be a fool not to take this job, but I feel uncomfortable as I am not as well trained as most all of their employees and I have been there for much less time.

200,"I’ll try to keep it short, but I’ve been torn about this. This might be venting but I need to. If you make it through, I appreciate any feedback. 

I met this woman at a bar and we hooked up 6 months ago. We hooked up over the next couple weeks and went out on a couple of dates. I’ve been staying at her place every night for the last 3 months, but there’s been signs this is going to blow up. 

We live 3 blocks apart, so even though we started out casually we are now pretty much dating. I’ve talked about being sexually exclusive, but she says that means being Facebook official and etc, which I’m not ready to do yet. 

I’ve told her I haven’t seen anyone, but I pressed her and she said she had sex with another guy while we were seeing each other. I was furious and she said she just wanted to be with only me. I know she’s still been talking to him once in a while to hang out since they share a friend group (I work fri/sat nights till midnight, so she usually goes out), which she knows will make me angry. 

She sometimes goes out until late into the next day and often ignores my calls when she goes out. We often get into fights when we’re both drinking because of something she’s done, but she tries to blow it off and asks me to forget about it and “come home”. 

She knows I have insecurities and trust issues, but she does very little to help the situation while I worry for 24 hours straight sometimes about where she is, if she’s with someone else sexually, or if she’s just safe. I’ll even take care of her dogs if I haven’t heard from her. She says she’ll improve, but it’s been 3 weeks since I’ve confronted her and I am literally scared of Fridays and Saturdays for what might happen.

Sorry in advance for the rambling, I'm trying my best for this to make sense for those who do not know of my situation.  I appreciate all and any help! 

I had really bad social anxiety as a kid. I also found it very difficult to keep friends. I feel as though if I was in a certain place everyday (school, work, uni, etc) i would interact well with people, probably because it was somewhat of a ""forced social situation"", i.e. I had to see these people all the time, i might as well make the most of it. This resulted in me losing these friends as soon as that chapter in my life was over, I thought there was something massively wrong with me, but now I understand that's just how it goes for a lot of people (bear in mind that schools/Uni over here are much smaller than they are in the US, so finding a group of people who you click with and have things in common with is hard. I have a best friend (of 11 years) and a boyfriend (of 2 years) which is the healthiest relationship I have ever been in. I consider myself to be lucky, even though these are the only people I have. 

I have also been in abusive relationships and friendships throughout my life. I am a lot less tolerant of people and how they treat me now (which i consider to be a good thing) and this is another factor in my friendless-ness.

These days I am a lot more confident and put myself out there a lot more. This is, in part, due to the (moderately) bad news I received over my health last year. It is not immediately serious, but it will shorten my lifespan, possibly by a drastic amount. This has resulted in me doing a LOT. Including ticking some stuff off of my bucket list. 2 of these things were to learn to pole dance, and to join a roller derby team. 

I joined a pole dance class recently. I've only been to one so far, but I absolutely adored it! I even splashed out and bought myself a pole for home because I loved it that much. 


The problem is the roller derby. I joined because i wanted to learn how to skate (I had never even picked up roller skates before, let alone skated), and also make some friends. I am very happy of my skating progress, I'm quite good at skating now! However I'm really falling behind in many of the other skills required to play the game. Also I get 6-7 emails a day, and countless messages regarding committees, organizing meetings, and PR related activities. I have a full time job already, a sideline profession, and now i have this roller-derby job that has nothing to do with me learning, and is definitely not what i signed up for (and is also costing me money). 


I do enjoy hanging out with the girls, we've gone on nights out, been to matches together, they're really nice. However this extra commitment is making me resent them. I barely see my boyfriend at the weekends (we live together but both have busy jobs so the weekend is meant to be for us), and during the week I'm just stressed out over all the emails I'm not keeping up with and then of course, I end up dreading the weekend when I have to go to actual derby training where I will get disciplined. 


Also, in relation to my boyfriend, I'm currently learning to drive so I'm not legally allowed drive by myself, this means my boyfriend is essentially taxi-ing me around to my hobbies, which can be annoying for him, especially if he just wants to do his own thing. 


I know what you're thinking, ""Just quit girl, you obviously don't want to do this"", and yeah, I am starting to feel that way, except I am a massive over thinker, these are my issues with quitting: 


- ever since i moved out, I feel myself drifting away from my only (little) brother. He thinks I'm really cool for joining derby. I know that's not a reason to stay but when I joined he used his pocket money to buy me derby related gifts (one of which is an amazing travel mug that I use every day) and every time I see him he asks questions about it. Every time I think of quitting I feel like I'd be letting him down. 


- When I was a kid, i was actively encouraged (aka, kinda forced) to join various sports teams, mostly because my parents worried I wouldn't have any friends. However I HATED these sports, and ended up begging to quit each one. My dad jokes about how I'm a quitter. They're only jokes but it still stings. I know that by quitting derby I would be branded a quitter once again. 


- The girls I have made friends with in derby are...slightly overbearing. They react nastily to girls who have quit, or who they feel just aren't trying. I'm afraid of what their reaction will be should I quit. I wouldn't even know what to say if I was to quit, I'm worried they would talk me out of it, or call me a quitter too. 


- Lastly, I have spent a LOT of money on derby gear (close to $2000). It won't totally be going to waste as I do love skating, but we only have one rink in my town and a. I don't drive and would be dragging my poor boyfriend along to skate with me, and b. guess who else attends the rink regularly; the derby girls! the last thing i want is to run into them when I'm skating, even though I quit the team. they would take it personally. Also I'm trying to save for a house at the moment, I feel like my boyfriend would judge me on the amount of money I have wasted and then gave up on. 

What should I do? and how? Should I stick with derby and hope my mood improves?

Sorry for such a long post, I just didn't know how else to say this and have it make sense. Please help.

207,"Hi everyone.

I am a long time reddit user but I've created a new account just for this post because I'm too afraid of the tiny chance the person I'm currently living with will see it.

I won't be mentioning where in the world I am or any names.

I really need some help on how to deal with this situation -

In January 2018 I moved into a 2 bedroom flat with one other person.  I already knew this person and we have been friends for a few years.

On moving in it seemed like a good idea.  I have lived with my fair share of bad room mates over the years and I thought, I will live with a friend and hopefully this will be the last share I have to do as hopefully my career will finally mean I can make some more money and finally live on my own.

I'm getting to the point where my job is going to mean I can live on my own, although I'm still tied into a contract with this place until December and I will have to stay in the flat living with this person until then.

HOWEVER -

The person I live with is very controlling of me and is not going to take news that I want to leave the place for any reason other than my own death as an excuse for wanting to move on.

The place is a craphole.  It's freezing in winter and noisy all the time due to cheap construction.  You can hear the other flats and local businesses all around.

He/She has lived there for 10 years and also takes any negative comment about the place as a personal dig at him/her.  By his/her decision - the landlord does no work at all on the flat.  If something needs replacing, we have to organise and fix things.  On top of this, he/she finds things wrong with the flat whilst Im at work or away for the weekend etc and messages me about them, basically telling me that we have to sort all this crap out.

If I say the landlord should do all this work - they say, ""I don't want him around here more than neccessary because he might get ideas about putting the rent up if we keep asking him for stuff""

This is why the place is a craphole, because there's no maintenance done.

That's not the only thing I get messages about whilst I'm not home - I get sent links to podcasts about conspiracy theories and all sorts of pseudo intellectual bullshit.  I'm supposed to consume all of this stuff in my free time and then agree with it.

This person is also very very angry at the world in general.

He/She has an extremely high opinion of herself, creatively, intellectually and artistically.  Also his/her opinions are not to be disagreed with, not unless you want a very long argument on your hands which will only ever end if you back down.

You wouldnt even dream of making a minor criticism with this person.  That would unfold into an epic drama.

I am the only 'friend' of this person and they are ALWAYS there.  

He/She only wants to ever talk to me and nobody else, to the point where even though they are home all day every day, they wont even answer the door to sign for a parcel of their own.  Instead they pretend they arent in, let a neighbour sign for it and then ask me to get it from the neighbour when I get home from work!

One time we had to get a new washing machine delivered and I had to take a day off work to sign for it and talk to the plumber.  My roommate says that just because they have all their own free time, it doesnt mean that they should have to do everything like that!

The only other person they see is a partner that comes over roughly once a week.  This ends up in a blazing argument between them on about 90% of the occasions.

ADVICE I'M ASKING FOR -

What can I do?  The situation is really stressing me out.

I hate confrontation.  This person suffocates me and will make things very difficult for me if I say I need to move out.

They will immediately (even though I'll be giving a lot of notice) make out like I'm screwing them over and make my remaining time there as miserable as possible.  They will also probably try and get the landlord to take my deposit off me.

213,"So my kid is mid teens. Not sure if he's even kissed a girl before let alone been intimate with anyone of any gender. Not sure if that's even relevant? Anyway. He's my eldest. He's known his whole life that almost everyone around him is open to all sexualities, races, religions, whatever. No bias. Except for my husband, his father. 

It's been hinted at for a while that my son has non traditional ideas when it comes to relationships. Tonight he came to me amd asked why gay people have such problems when it comes to coming out. So we had another talk about social stigmas and oppression and all that shit and I told him that for me someone coming out is like me saying I'm a brunette. No big deal. But that for them it is a huge deal coz of stuff stated above. We get home and my younger son says ""hey eldest son wanted to tell you he's bi but blah blah blah"". 

So we have a sort of talk. I tell him it's ok, for me it's totally fine, yadda yadda. And here's my big mistake- I said ""just don't tell your father."" He asks me why and I tell him that his Dad is one of those people that is prejudiced and won't take it quite so well. It's the brutal truth, unfortunately, I love my husband very much but when it comes to males being of any kind of gay persuasion he is very anti. He's said in the past that if either of his sons are ""fucken faggots"" he'll disown them, and I know this is true. He loves his kids but he also loves his ideals of them. 

I'm sure at least one of you has been in this position and can help me to help my husband understand this???

So I got my braces off about 3 years ago and being the stupid teenager I was, barely wore my retainer. Despite have permanent wires on the front of both my top and bottom teeth, they have moved significantly in the last couple of years. I have attempted to put my retainer in (clear white) multiple times over the last year but have found them either unbearably painful or just won’t sit properly on my teeth. I am desperate to have them back the way they are as my front top two teeth are at different heights and are very obviously uneven.

If I were to struggle through wearing my retainer gradually over time, is there any hope of them moving back into place? Or have I really just stuffed up thousands of dollars worth of my parents money and my smile..

219,"Last night my fiance and I got home around the same time, I had just worked a 12 hour shift so I went to bed right away. I wake up a couple hours later to my fiance having an anxiety attack in the bathroom. She has had these before but I could tell right away it was a really bad one, to the point where she started dry heaving.  

I got out of bed but I felt like I didn't wake up all the way. It felt like I kept slipping into a dream and then would snap out of it.  I tried to help my fiance but I had trouble because I was pretty confused myself. This went on for a couple hours where I was trying different things to help her. I tried to get her to go to bed because I was really tired myself. 

I realized later that I was much more tired than I usually am, usually I wake up very easily.  After trying to sleep my fiance gets up and starts talking about how something isn't right with in our apartment. At first I thought she was scared that someone was in our apartment which can happen with anxiety attacks but then it hit me. I realized that I wasn't feeling normal either. I told her to get dressed quickly and get outside. 

As soon as I stood up I felt drunk and my vision was blurry, I saw that my fiance was feeling the same. I opened both the doors in our house to ventilate it and we quickly got outside.  sat her down on the curb and had her take slow deep breaths.  After just a couple minutes both of us felt normal again.

I called our emergency number for our gas company and they sent someone over to check the CO levels in our house. After about 15 minutes I realized I should stop ventilating the house because I wanted him to detect whatever it was. I closed the doors and he showed up after another 15 minutes but he found no CO in our house. He checked a bunch of different things but said there was no CO and no appliances in our house that would give off CO. He also said our oxygen levels were normal.

So I have no idea what happened. We went back inside and I set an alarm for a couple hours later to see if we felt something again but we didn't.  So I'm coming to reddit to see if anyone has any idea what this could be.  There was never any odor or taste, the apartment is a quadplex so we have one person next to us and one above us. In the morning I found a small amount of, what looked like, black mold in the toilet. But there wasn't a significant amount and the symptoms of black mold poisoning don't match up at all.  My only other idea is that we do live in a sketchy neighborhood so maybe our neighbors upstairs were doing some heavy drugs and we got something second hand but I don't know if that's possible or reasonable.",09Aug2018,14

I bargained with my boss that since most others get a 5 day week I should get one 3 day weekend of my choosing so I could arrange to go back to camp.

Well I didn't get to choose I found out last week I got this weekend off because the bosses are out of town so not much going on.  Still I was gateful &amp; said I appreciate it. I was excited to go camping/stargazing at a park new to me. Then as I frequently checked the weather it has been thunderstorms &amp; clouds all week &amp; set to continue into the weekend. No sun. This leaves out the opportunity to camp, kayak, amusement parks etc. I had then planned on going on a day trip to this brewery tour me &amp; my fiance went on a few years ago &amp; loved.

We go see our mom's every other weekend. She is not a hugger at all.

The new job pays $11.20 an hour and my grocery store job pays $11.00 an hour. The elementary school job is 2:30-5 Monday-Friday which leaves me below 15 hours a week, not enough to pay my bills. Another issue is the Elementary school job wont be able to get me my first paycheck until the end of September, not gonna work for me, i have bills i have to pay, not much since I'm a student living with my mom but I still have them.

Now here is where the really tricky part comes in. I have worked at this school before but had to quit, to be completely honest i forgot why I had to quit but I did. The director is still the same of the after school program and it's gonna be really hard to tell her I'm quitting again after she gave me a second chance.

Another issue comes in with my family and girlfriend, there were all proud that I got this job and I feel like I'm letting them down by not doing it. It just makes more fiscal sense to stay at my grocery store because I only work 8 hour shifts so if I work at least 3 days a week, i make a whole lot more than working 5 days at the school.

Any second of the day she's not out with her friends she is moaning to me about the fact she's bored. I work an 8-5 office job and am exhausted after work, so an hours drive there and back to see her regularly just isn't doable, especially considering the fact I'm trying to keep up with my gym routine.

She's turned into someone I don't like. She's become obsessed with herself, has grown an enormous ego, has been speaking down to me (even after I found out about her talking to other guys), has suddenly got a taste for expensive brands (over the last 12 months or so) - and is pretty much fucked without my financial support. We have somewhat addressed the whole 'talking to other guys' thing, and it wasn't taken lightly, but now she's telling me she's depressed/suicidal. I told her this myself in March after the first incident and she has literally not once asked how I'm coping, and is now expecting sympathy from me, telling me she hates herself for what she's become.

I'm quite firm and I have never been scared to tell her when she's out of order, but I really do love her and can't imagine my life without her. I don't know what I can do to put things right, and go to a life where I'm not insecure about myself, insecure about other men around her, completely unsure about our future (we were meant to be buying a house at the end of the year, with 90% of the deposit coming from me/my parents - and I've recently posted on LegalAdvice regarding potential contracts to secure mine/my parents' money in the event of a rough breakup).

Believe it or not, 12 months ago things were fine. I mean, the whole 'lovebird' stage had worn off, but we still did everything together and loved each other, and we both seemed quite happy about where life was taking us. Saving for a mortgage with prospects of a degree (her) and a big ol' dog (me). Our goals were achievable and realistic.

Things have changed for the worse, and in the current state I'm in where I literally want to die I don't know what to do or where to turn to. It feels like the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my worry about what would happen to the people I care about. I'm a son, an older brother, a cousin, a nephew, a grandson. This is quite in line with the fact that I am naturally a very giving person and put others before myself, but thankfully on the topic of suicide this is actually a benefit. I don't like this about myself.

I'm scared of being alone and have no idea what to do. Please help me.

250,"**I’m F16 posting this here for potential advice and a platform to tell this story as I’ve been sworn to secrecy about the whole event. My cousins boyfriend is crazy, obsessed and controlling
Also be warned there is a lot of information here....**

***A bit of background info is that my cousin who is 17 years old is currently seeing a man that is 32 this month, we met the guy at the same time while visiting a dodgy pub in May and he seemed like quite the charmer. They kept in touch and now see each other regularly. I should point out that he is a nice guy generally gets along with the family and is pleasant to me. He is however a complete tramp, living in squalor in a smoke stained apartment with his alcoholic friend. (So far I’m not really selling the guy I know). Overall he is really generous and I can tell he really cares about my cousin.***

So this is where the story starts, on Tuesday night me and my cousin decided to go out and meet both her boyfriend (who I will refer to as Jason for this story) and his friend M32 (who will just be his friend). I told my parents I was going to the gym but we both actually went to meet the two of them. (Incredibly bad idea I know but my judgement is clouded when I’m with my cousin I guess and I was hoping it would be ok because she’s older anyway) All in all the meeting wasn’t too bad, they bought us drinks despite us both being underage and where the typical embarrassing pub guys that shout out and try and get everyone’s attention. I mostly ended up talking to Jason’s friend that came with him as my cousin and him where all over each other practically in the middle of the place. He kept asking me and my cousin where we had been before hand and we told him the same thing ‘we went into town shopping’ (which was exactly what we did) but he must have asked at least ten times even asking me on my own lecturing us about meeting up with boys and trying to flirt (it felt like a conversation with my dad at this point it was like he couldn’t decide whether he was my dad or or someone trying to seduce me) My cousin must have talked to Jason’s friend for about three minuets the whole night, and that’s only because Jason was trying to flirt asking me to come back to him place without my cousin possibly to make her jealous, even going as far to take her drink off her and give it to me. He was nice enough and is telling me and my cousin how much he likes us as people and then he says something to me along the lines of “unless you hurt lauren then I’ll kill you” I laughed at the comment how intense it was just he was dead serious. I could tell that my cousin didn’t know whether to be flattered or offended that he had threatened to murder her younger cousin. 

Anyway, so this is when things turn fishy. We where sat outside while he was having a smoke and he brought up an old incident where he apparently saw me and my cousin in a graveyard with lots of boys. He got visibly angry at both of us but me and my cousin where just laughing it off because we hadn’t even gone to the graveyard but we had told him that to see his reaction. At the time Jason told my cousin that he’d seen us in the graveyard talking to boys (he hadn’t seen us at all obviously and it had been a inside joke for me and my cousin for a while how stupid he was to lie about the situation). He also brought up that he didn’t like my cousin hanging out with her friends as they are a bad influence and threatened me not to be a bad influence on my cousin or else. (Red flags I know) 

I honestly did try to get through to my cousin, we went to the toilets and I said I wanted to go and told my cousin to come with me, which he quickly grabbed her protectively and said ‘why do you need her to hold your hand or something’, I said yes in a matter of fact way and he said ‘what are you really doing girls’ I was dumbfounded and just responded saying something like ‘going for a wee’ and he lets us go. In the toilets I was begging my cousin to go and I could tell she was drunk. I told her to leave off the drinks and she told me to stop nagging her 
 
This is where things get bad. We are all sat there and out of no where Jason looks at my cousin and angrily says ‘you know I’m not happy (cousins name)’. Obviously the rest of us where shocked and my cousin was confused about what was going on. Then out of nowhere he exploded saying things like “why are you talking to my mate more that me” “you’re my missus I don’t like it”. Even Jason’s friend was in shock telling him to calm down and me and my cousin just sat there in silence as Jason is shouting at all of us. People sat around us where turning round and I kept making panicked eye contact with women sat around me in hope of some help. Eventually Jason’s friend started shouting as well about how he wasn’t trying to go for my cousin. At this point I thought they where going to break out into a fight or something but Jason stormed off around the building. Jason’s friend told us to stay sat down as he ran after him, he eventually came back round the pub and started speed walking off in another direction completely. At this point my cousin ran after him to try and calm him down. So I was left sat at this table on my own and everyone around was commenting on how disgusting he was acting and that the whole situation was repulsive. I agreed and Jason’s friend came back round and told me to grab all our stuff as we set off the chase after Jason and my cousin who where at this point just screaming in the streets. I was speed walking after them as my cousin is grappling him as he’s doing laps around the town, and I’m thinking ‘dear god how did I end up sinking this low’. They stopped at Jason’s car and he apologised to his friend and turned  it onto my cousin for flirting with him. So naturally, my cousin kicked off and more shouting commenced. At this point I felt sick and I just wanted to go home so I got in Jason’s car with his friend, him and my cousin. I thought that we where just going to go streight home and I guessed I was safe as Jason’s house is on the same road as mine. 

Right off the bat he started driving like a mad man, he was obviously drunk as he had been drinking all evening, he must have been going at least 50 through tight town streets on the wrong side of the road to the point where I genuinely thought ‘well this is where I die’. He was screaming at people and going wild down the roads for at least 20 mins to drop his friend off at home all while they’re shouting at eachother and I’m panicking wondering where the hell we where going. Once his friend is dropped off it’s just me, my cousin and Jason in the car and he apologies for shouting and driving crazy yet on the way back carried on in the same fashion. It was so bad I wanted police to pull him over just so I could get out because I was too scared to tell him to stop. (In my mind at his moment I just thought that I might as well get home no fuss and my mum doesn’t have to find out about any of this) 

Eventually we get back to his house, an absolute dump that stinks of cigarettes and weed, he left me and my cousin alone there while he dropped the car off with his mum (it wasn’t even his car as he doesn’t even have a licence). As soon as we where alone the both of us screamed for a solid two minuets straight in disbelief about what had just happened. We laughed in panic at the events and got changed, I just wanted to go home (I live up the street a ten minute walk away from his place so I just wanted to go back). 

He gets back from dropping the car off acting like nothing has happened, I’m choking on the air in his house as he saunters in. We are just about to leave as he offers us a bacon sandwich, I turn it down obviously wanting to get out of there but my cousin is all for it. So I sit and wait for at least 20 mins for this bacon to cook while I’m silently begging my cousin to leave but she says sorry I’m hungry every time. (I couldn’t have left on my own as my cousin was scheduled to come to my house to sleepover and I couldn’t face going home and lying to my mothers face again) While we wait Jason insists I have something to the point where he is raising his voice at me to eat some bacon or barbecue ribs so I go for some bacon. Once it’s done he insists that he can’t just give me bacon and slaps some toast in the toaster. I told him I’ve got a wheat allergy so I can’t eat it, he pays no attention, so both me and my cousin are almost yelling “no really she can’t eat it” “she has celiac”. All the while he’s all over my cousin while he’s cooking and I couldn’t help but think “why the hell did you want me to come here so badly if your just going do some major pda with my cousin right in front of me” 

Eventually me and my cousin say bye and he says goodbye too and gives us a tiny pouch of cocain literally out of no where and was nagging us to to some in front of him. (we don’t even do drugs at all I’ve never even touched them, I can’t even spell it!) We set off down the road. At this point we hear him shouting behind us saying “well thanks for saying bye you two just coming to mine for bacon and nothing else”. We didn’t respond and kept on walking but I couldn’t help but think “what else did he possibly want from both of us at his house” 

At this point I told my cousin that I never want to see him again. I said it’s fine if it’s at a family gathering but never alone again. She told me she couldn’t believe it and he’d never got that bad before. Later on he messaged her begging us to come back and again I was left thinking “why does he want me back as well as my cousin it’s just off” 


So yes, this is the end, mostly I’m just writing this as a way to get it off my mind as I can’t tell my parents or anyone else for that matter. I don’t know who to be mad at here because I was angry at my cousin for a while as she’s older than me, only by a year, but I still considered her as a older responsible person that would try and get us out that situation. She has in the past told things to my mum and begged her not to tell me as she believes that I look up to her. But maybe that’s just wrongly placed trust and I should grow up myself. 

I know that getting involved in this was very irresponsible but I can’t go back now and change things so I need help deciding what to do now.

251,"So I've been seeing someone since April. We were an official couple for a couple months, and then took it back down a peg over the summer because of his work schedule and long distance. I was okay with it because I was under the impression things would pick up again in the fall when class started and he had more time. I specifically asked him when we were discussing this if he would ghost me, and he said he would never do that. 

Here lately I've had 4 different texts go unresponded, which is really unusual for how we talk. We used to talk pretty much every day, but now I haven't heard a peep from him in a week. I was thinking I'd give him until tomorrow, and then ask what's up. What should I say? Is there anything that can salvage this?

I was put on medication #2 (Lamictal). I need to over time, increase the dose and have done that as the doctor ordered. I recently went up to 100mg. Cue last night. The mood swings and irritability were horrendous. 

I feel like shit because I snapped at my boyfriend several times (I’m F(22). He’s M(22)). I am visiting from out of state and will be returning home (college semester) in less than a week. I realize that the mood swings are being caused by the medication, but I feel like I’m losing it. I do not want to hurt my boyfriend.

here’s the situation, 

in feb i was talking to this guy [19M], we hooked up once and then we stopped talking because i found out he was talking to someone else and he ended up being in a relationship with her until two weeks ago..

anyway, i went through a tough time after we stopped talking because of that.. but i’m now over it..

i saw him at the local club on the weekend and i was wondering why he had said hello to me, usually he would just ignore me.. “fair enough”

ANYWAY, i told my older sister the next day that he added me of facebook because he’s single now..
so today i went to visit my brother and he said to me “oh do you know anyone who’s last name is ........” and i said “nah i don’t why” and he said “nah it’s just .......(my sister) said something today” 

and i was confused i said “what? what did she say” 

apparently she had told him to yell at me because she doesn’t want me talking to him..

256,"I know I'm making this sound weirder than need be but I relate a lot with the Stranger by Camus. Especially at this moment after I've written the post which you're free to view or not. I feel drained. I usually have to put in effort to be empathetic so right now everything's a bit detached and blank, after that sort of cathartic self realisation experience. 

But I guess since I know what I need to do now, there's no need to head into the therapist? 

What I need to do being the following: 

Don't bother my cat. Let her do as she pleases. She'll still be punished for scratching people and other no-nos like that but less severely than what I did. Just a spray of water and not giving her any treats. Nothing more. 

Be more consistent and prepare accordingly. Don't be wishy washy about things. 

Organise everything, plan everything, prepare backups. Don't be unaccountable.

... everything else is just a matter of self restraint. Intrusive thoughts are merely intrusive thoughts as long as I don't follow up with experiencing urges to do them. 

I've went before and tried to go into detail of the past that may have helped me become into the person I am today, quirks and all but in the end they said I'm all good. It's normal to have insecurities but fretting over the past does no good if it's just going to make me linger on the past and not move forward. Which makes sense it really does but it still bothers me and who am I really to insist to the therapist that I still feel like something's wrong with me when the therapist insists that's normal and fine

260,"Hi.

So I study at a university where I got 25% scholarship. The terms were as follow: By the end of the second semester, if my GPA was below 83, it would be deduced to half. After that, if my GPA went below 80, the scholarship will end. If I was able to raise it above 83, the 25% will continue.

First semester, I got around 94. The second semester, for various reasons, I dropped to 70. The cum is 81.22. I know (and my first GPA shows) that I am more than capable of raising my GPA. I received an email from the university about the deduction yesterday. I want to try to keep my scholarship at 25% at least for this semester. I can and will raise it above the 83 minimum. I am really incapable of paying the fees without the full scholarship. This is the email I am about to send. English isn't my first language, so I would appreciate if you help me out. Also, I want to try my best to have the 25% scholarship, but I also don't want to look like a total beggar, because that would be off-putting 

----------

Dear Ms. [Name],

I received your email about the scholarship deduction from 25% to 13%. I understand the necessity of doing this in order to encourage [University] students to do their best. But unfortunately, the fees would be too much for us to handle without the full scholarship.

Is there anyway for me to be able to benefit from the 25% scholarship until the next semester? I am just a few marks short from the 83 GPA minimum.

What date would be appropriate to you for me to come to the university and discuss this in person?

My ability to continue learning in [Uni] depends on this scholarship.

Also, I applied for financial aid but I didn't recieve any email about it. Is my file still being studied?

Thank you for understanding,

But to come in, day after day, and do nothing for 8-10 hours. I’m lucky to see 1 customer a day, and it’s very often an “I’m just looking” customer that I’ll have for an hour, and then it’s back to doing nothing. I’d say on average I see about 5 customers a week. Sell about 5-7 cars a month, which is a solid closing ratio for the people I see, but it just doesn’t put money in the bank and we are working 55+ hours a week.

I’m burned out. I can not come into work excited when I’m just expecting another mundane day or week. I’ve been getting more and more irresponsible getting to work on time. I’ve called out 3 days in the last month cause I just don’t want to be miserable here. 

I have outside work issues. Coming to work and not being able to get to work does not help my problem. In fact it amplifies my negative thoughts when I’m doing nothing and especially after I get an “I’m just looking” customer. 

The ultimatum is:

Either I commit to my GSM that I’m here to be here and succeed. This means no more calling out, no more being late, overall just being more responsible. 

Or 

I bid my farewell and don’t burn bridges. This means I don’t have a fall back job, but in this industry I could literally have a job tomorrow. I also have no money saved. There’s things in the way of making this the absolute easy choice. 

In a perfect world, I’d love to stay. But the world isn’t perfect and neither am I. 

Feel free to dig deeper with questions you have. The advice I need is whether I stay at a job that I truly do like or do I make a leap hoping for a hopefully bigger paycheck but more importantly something that will keep me diligently at work.

At first, I thought it was just a migraine, but after a solid week of uninterrupted pain I decided to seek medical assistance. CT scan came back clean, the pain meds they gave me didn't help at all. After another week, I followed up with my PCP, who tried other meds that didn't work, and then a neurologist, with more meds that didn't work. Currently I'm waiting on results from an EEG and MRA to hopefully get some answers (the doctor is on vacation until later this month).  


Unfortunately, the pain has been accompanied by a degree of mental fogginess that makes it difficult to focus on anything and short term memory issues. The result being that I can't manage to even play a simple puzzle game, much less accomplish any meaningful work. Before this, I worked as an independent contractor, so I'm ineligible for unemployment. My family has been good enough to help support me and cover my immediate medical expenses, but I still want to try and find some way to make a bit of money until I can get treatment.

*Expanding on that, it's difficult to see myself leaving 2-4 weeks salary on the table only to NOT do anything or go anywhere. I could just half-ass the work and pocket the money; put it aside for something that comes along in the future.

271,"Hey /r/advice, get ready for a book.

My girlfriend and I started dating our senior year of high school and lasted through college. We've been through some huge ups (graduations, HS sports success, jobs, fun trips, new experiences, etc.), some huge downs (death of a grandparent who was like my third parent, multiple several-day hospitalizations due to her chronic endocrine condition, failed interviews and school exams, plans that didn't work out, etc.), and everywhere in between. She's my first girlfriend, and I'm her first boyfriend (outside of a 4-month thing when she was 16 where they ""hung out literally once or twice a week"").

I get along with her family really well, as does she with mine. There's never been even a hint of cheating or abuse, and we both genuinely care about one another. We weren't able to get jobs close enough to live together right out of school, so we live about 2 hours apart from one another right now and see each other on weekends.

I think she is a fantastic person--quite frankly, maybe the best person that I know. I think she has amazing traits of conviction, perseverance, kindness, and compassion, I'm physically attracted to her, and I want all the best for her in life. We have similar ideas of what we would want our married sex life to look like. I love many of her quirks. I think she's hilarious, and I think she's adorable. We agree on financial principles and both make it a point to carry no debt. We both think hygiene and home organization are important. She thinks the same of me, for all of the above, which makes me feel even crazier for not knowing what to do.

Understandably, having been together for so long (especially in the Midwest), we've been talking more and more about marriage lately. It's something that we both think we want. I've been starting to look to try to get a job in Silicon Valley for a few years in the next year or so to further my career (software engineer) and increase my income, and she's not against coming, but she wants commitment first, which I fully respect and understand. However, there is a problem...

I don't know what the hell I want out of a life partner. My dad left my mom while I was in high school, and her parents' marriage, while still alive, is absolutely miserable (we both agree we don't want our relationship to reflect that of either of our sets of parents), so I don't really have a basis to work with. I can't tell whether I'm suffering from ""the grass is greener"" syndrome, whether I'm just an immature idiot, or whether we have actual incompatibility issues.

She is religious, and I have become more and more confused with what I think with respect to religion as time has gone on. My whole family is evangelical Christian (like she is), and I am totally cool with observing religious tradition and even being involved in a church, but I still want my kids to learn about science and rationality.

Speaking of kids... we both think we want 2-4 children, and we both want them in our mid-to-late twenties, and we both want one of us (whoever is earning less at the time, likely her) to stay home for a few years or at least work part time before the kids go to school, but we disagree about discipline (her in favor of spanking vs me not) and circumcising any sons that we have (her in favor of, me leaning against).

Our level of communication is not awful, but it's not perfect, either--she has a tendency to ball up when she's upset, and I have a tendency to pussyfoot around and delay conflict at times. I tend to be more positive and extroverted, in contrast to her introversion and glass-half-empty-ness. She also isn't big on one of us doing something without the other unless under occasional and very specific circumstances (ie. a ""girls-oriented thing"" or going to a sports game that she wouldn't want to go to anyway) and would rather sit at home on the couch together over one of us going on a family trip if one of us couldn't get off work for the duration of the trip, while I have more the mindset of ""It's better that one of us gets to do it than neither of us getting to do it."" and ""You should take the experiences when they're offered to you, since future time with your family is never guaranteed.""

I feel like a combination of me not knowing where I stand religiously and religion being very important to her, as well as neither of us being experienced with relationships, has led us to an impasse. We are at a point now, I think, where it's time to shit or get off the pot. We are still young, but I don't want to waste her time if we aren't compatible in the long-term. She agrees with this perspective.

She had an idea that we would take this workweek, while we were apart, and make a list of problems we see in our relationship and obstacles to us getting married, and I thought this was a good idea. We would then discuss our lists when we see each other this weekend. I suggested counseling if we weren't going to be able to resolve our lists alone, and she seemed open to the idea.

So here I am, making my list, most of which so far I've laid out above. What say you, reddit?

TL;DR: GF and I have been together 6 years. Can't tell whether I'm just suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome or what. Time to shit or get off the pot is rapidly approaching. Don't know what to do.",09Aug2018,1

I created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you've got a good taste haha . . .), and 2nd part shows the recording of your web cam.

281,"Hi there reddit! I have a degree in psychology,but I don't want to work in this industry. I recently got very interested in programming and I want to pursue a carrer in IT. I have found an intensive course (1 year) that I wish to take, but I have an issue. I've never been around anything IT related. I mean I know how to use a computer and how to use word or power point, but that's just basic stuff. I also know how to use HTML, because I used to make band tribute sites during highschool, but I have never learned proper computer science. I went to a highschool which was mostly art-literature-language oriented and I has like 1 class per week when we were supposed to learn stuff about computers, but the teacher always told us to play solitaire and not make a sound, so I don't even have that little information. 

What I'm asking is can I get a little advice as where I should start learning this ""IT language"", like what shortcuts mean or smth, because honeslty I don't even know what I don't know, and I don't want to start the course and fail to understand what they're trying to say. :D",09Aug2018,3
282,"My *ex* and I have mutual friends. Well little background story I think it helps you understand the situation better. I met this girl of the gang Maria and we became besties... One time I met Maria's other friends including one of Marias guy friend Tyler. Tyler and I dated intensely for 2 months but we were never officially together but it was like being together. So not really ex but feels like ex. So this gang - they basically all know each other longer than I know them and I know Maria very well she's one of my best friends by now but the others I don't know that well (I've met them all a few times but still...). Let's just say things didn't end that well between Tyler and me. He ditched me like a hot potato. Also he handled the time after *the breakup* like a jerk never checked up on me he pretended as if it never happened. Like *yey we're good all is cotton candy good*. Which btw I once texted him I was disappointed about. Anyway he left me and I was heartbroken...I kinda fell in love with him. (Please don't judge me for developing feelings in such a short time that's not my question I know it's stupid) It's been a month since he left me and it was the worst heartbreak ever and needed long for me to heal. I couldn't get over it that easily. Now I'd say I'm at a point where I'm doing pretty great (finally! so happy) I accept it and I can finally see that it would've never worked in the first place BUT I'm not sure if I'm completely healed especially if I'd see him. And with this comes my question: So Maria invited all of her friends to a bar. I really want to go because Maria is my friend! But Tyler will be there as well... I don't know if I'm emotionally ready to see him I haven't seen him since he left me that day. Also like I said he's someone who avoids uncomfortable situations so I'm sure he'll pretend as if nothing ever happened between us and maybe even crack a joke with me. And I don't know if I can take that. I mean there'll be other people so I don't have to talk more than necessary with him but he'll be there at the same table I guess. What if I look at him and miss him and could burst out in tears? What if what if what if you can pretty much imagine what's going on in my head. Also like I said they all know each other longer so I bet they won't really be careful what they say they might say something ""hey check that girl out Tyler"" and I'd sit there like an idiot and no one would get it because most of them didn't even know we dated in the first place. Which truly hurts me that he never told them (they're his friends not mine) and makes the situation even more uncomfortable.

You might think ""Why is that so important anyways just stay at home"". But it's not that easy. I've ditched Maria once already because he'd go there as well and I'm sick of it... we do have mutual friends sooner or later I'll meet him anyways. Plus if I won't be there I'm sure he knows it's because of him and I don't want him to think that. If he knows that I'm struggling this would just boost his ego. Also I ask myself (or you guys) if it could even help to see him so that it really sinks in like ""nope that's over and it's better like that"". Maybe we could even chitchat a bit and it would do some harmony to our silence. And what I say now - I don't want him back - but I want to look really fucking amazing and be a really good sport that evening and hope he'll regret it at least a bit that he ditched me. Ya know. And I'm finally at that point where I've gained my confidence about myself back and I'm ready to show him but idk for sure how it'll be there...around him. I have to prepared for everything even if that means worst case scenario he might flirt with someone else in front of my eyes.

Oh and by the way give me advice on how to act around him I'll probably meet him anyway someday by accident and I want to be prepared. Should I show him that I'm still hurt or should I be this confident girl? Should I even show him the cold shoulder and let him know I'm kind of mad or does that look pathetic?

More information about the situation/about him would help you give advice but I think this text is already long enough... 

**Alright, should I go?** Please tell me about a similar experience of yours... What questions should I ask myself to determine whether I'm emotionally ready or not?

I really don't know what to do I want to protect myself but I also want to finally get it over with and live my life again...

Thank you so much for the help!

for a little context, my dad's single. he split up with my mom 7 years ago because she was caught cheating on him. unsurprisingly, he's been waiting for the chance to get a divorce so this was his opportunity to do so (that should give you an idea how psychotic my mom is). 

anyway, i just found out while using my dad's phone that he was texting multiple woman from dating sites, trying to get a date or whatever. you get the gist. so at this point you'd think I'd have nothing to worry about, and you're right.

except that my mom made me write a letter from when i was 10 years old or something that if my dad ever married somebody/ or got together with somebody I'd be perfectly willing to let her whisk me away from him. keep in mind that i was TEN, and i had no idea what i was getting into. i just wrote what my mom asked me to.

So I (21 F)have a group of online friends. There's lots of them but the 'main' group is myself and three others. None of us live close to each other except two do live together in scotland I have a major crush on the other one whom lives in the states. I'm in Canada. 

I thought it would go away since I dont actually ever see him, we have only met in person once, when the four of us met up in Scotland but we do chat on discord and messanger almost every day. I have hoped that he felt the same way and was just too shy to say but at the same time I think that's stupid. If a guy likes you wouldn't he let you know? If someone wants to he with you they'll make it happen right? 

Hes one of my best friends and I just dont think I could tell him how I feel. I love talking to him and we have a lot of fun playing games and bantering back and forth. I cant even go on dates with other guys because he is all I can think about romantically. If he doesn't feel the same way and I tell him I feel that I won't have only ruined our friendship but the entire dynamic of our group.

288,"Recently, a favourite movie and a favourite TV show of mine faced criticism; the former from people on YouTube and here on Reddit who took issue with the morality of the protagonist, the latter from a family member who felt some elements of the franchise had unfortunate implications regarding the premise.

Now, I *want* to like these shows, but sometimes, these people's words get to me. In the case of the movie, I've been trying to write fan fictions ""reconstructing"" aspects of the character, taking into account the flaws and trying to patch them up.

I've seen people who belong (or previously belonged) to that movie's fandom, and are very cynical and caustic about it. It's not that they're haters (one of them is a moderator on the movie's subreddit), but there's something about their tone that really bugs me. I don't want to become like them!

I know it sounds melodramatic, but sometimes it feels like that criticism is like a Sword of Damocles - hanging overhead while things nonchalantly progress below. The characters in the work don't see it, but you do, and it can ruin the mood.

People have said lately that I've been getting defensive. I don't know if that factors into things, but I feel like I get hung up about things more and more unless I get out of the house. I don't know how ""defensive"" I really am.

297,"I am going to try and make this as brief as possible: When I was in my late teens/early 20s my life went downhill. My family lost almost everything in the 2008 market crash and my father cheated and left my mother while refusing to help her with any financial needs for my younger brother and I. I was the only one able to find employment, so I worked 1-2 jobs while attending university. On top of that my (now ex) bf cheated and left me and at one of my jobs I faced quite a bit of abuse. I spent about 2 years on, what felt like, the brink of insanity, and the 3-4 years after that rebuilding everything. I had what I can only describe as a mental meltdown (not sure what it actually was) during the time.

Somehow I pulled through and now, at 28, am happy and life is great. I have a great job, helped my mom buy a house that is now almost paid off, and am about to pursue my dream. I feel like my life is close to perfect. 

However, in the back of my mind those 2 years never went away. Even though I have mended things with my father, there is a part of me that still hates him. There are things that remind me of that time that trigger this incredibly deep rage. The final tipping point is that I might soon have to face my ex from the time, through social circumstances I cannot avoid, and I am not sure if I’ll be able to resist bashing his head in. 

I was never a spiteful or violent person, I’m usually very easy going and reasonable, patient and forgiving. But I can’t get rid of the rage and hate for anything associated with that time. It sometimes feels like a dam that is about to break, and though I have managed to keep my cool when dealing with the small reminders, I’m not sure how I am going to react if I am directly confronted with it. 

I’m not sure if I’m dealing with some sort of emotional trauma or not. I don’t want to tell anyone because I feel bad that I’m complaining about it when my life is going so well. 

Is this normal or do I need help?

301,"I’m 19 years old, staring university soon to study computer science. I’ve always had overly big aspirations and goals but I’m very serious about them. My passions are computer science, business, and investing. I tell myself that I want to succeed using these things and really make a difference in the world, and I thoroughly plan out the steps I need to take to do so.

Now I’m not trying to sound arrogant but I’ve always been pretty intelligent and recently became a member of MENSA. I invested a lot of money into books about business, investing, or anything that interests me, and I devoted hours each day to studying and learning far more than I ever could in school. I was genuinely doing well and starting to use my skills in these areas to make small amounts of money.

The plan has always been to get my degree in computer science, then use the good salary in my computer science-based career to fund my business and investing aspirations, and its very realistic. (My goals in business may be stretched but that’s good in my opinion).

The issue is that I’ve recently been feeling so unmotivated and feeling like a complete failure because I’m starting to lack behind on my reading and studying outside of school. I feel that at 19 I should been far further ahead in my life goals than I am and it’s causing me to just lose all motivation to study, workout, etc.

303,"I'm 28 and doing my dream job albeit at a low level. I coach soccer (football) in Southern California and get a livable salary from it. This also leaves me with plenty of time to get a day job also, or study. I just finished my associates degree in psychology - better late than never - but in order to be a head coach in college one needs a bachelors degree.

So, I'm looking into degrees. I want to be a coach in the long run, but would be great to have a [sport?] bachelors behind me. Note* I'm shit at maths so that concerns me in majors.

I'm thinking of a few. Kinesiology, but how much schooling is that? I don't have patience to be in school for 5/6 years+... Sports Management - I'm fairly business minded but wondering if I'd be into it enough. Sports Science - How intense / long is this major? Geography - It interests me, but not sure what I'd study specifically. Psychology - it really intrigued me as an associates. But how intense is the major as a bachelors? What to study specifically? Travel and tourism - I love to travel, and am an expat. But is this a useful degree? Computer Info Systems - I'm fairly computer savvy, but no bugger all about coding. IT is essential in life... Landscape technology/architecture - I love being outside and in the garden. But this may just be a fleeting idea. Economics - meh. The idea is cool but the studying of may put me off.

If anyone has studied these, what are your thoughts. Do you recommend looking into these majors?

It's just no one seems to want to try to get to know me, I'm very socially isolated so struggle to meet new people but even when I do I seem to struggle to make any sort of connection.   


I've had friends but they seem to be more mates to go out with and they easily move on. I've had partners but it still hasn't felt like I think it should, they seem to move on easily and it's always the next person they date who they seem to end-up with. Just recently I had a boyfriend who really genuinely seemed interested in me as a human being and for the first time in 35 years I thought I was feeling love like other people experience, but he broke-up with me (granted I think it was more to do with his own emotional issues than me, but it still makes me question my value as he ended it so easily).   


It makes me feel there's not just something wrong with me but like I'm not a human being, maybe I'm missing whatever makes people want to try to get to know me...maybe I'm destined to be alone, but I really don't want that!

306,"   I’m going to keep as many specific details out of this as possible because i’m afraid he’ll read this. It also may be a long read as i’m trying to explain the dynamic of our relationship, so i’m sorry about that, I’ll include a TLDR at the end.

    So I (20f) have been friends with this guy since our very first job when we were 16. Because our department was so small and we were the only two supervisors for it, we got very close very fast. I had a boyfriend at the time and he had a girlfriend so it was nothing more than a close friendship. Once I quit later that year, we kept in touch for awhile but eventually he kind of fell off the face of the earth. 

   Then, about a year ago, I ran into him again by chance at a mall and we were so excited to see each other, and I was glad he hadn’t forgotten about me or for some reason was angry with me, which is what I worried because he stopped responding. We talked for hours and he admitted that his gf broke up with him, and I told him broke up with my ex a few months prior. Still, no romantic feelings there and because of our past we only saw each other as friends. We talk the most on instagram where we send each other memes pretty much daily, although we don’t actually talk every day.

   We used the platform to make a few plans though, and we saw a movie back in June. After the movie I was expecting us to head home, but he suggested we go downtown and hang out/ get drinks so I went with him and it was probably the most fun I’ve had in awhile. Side note, I don’t have a lot of friends and I’m being ostracized at my new job so I’ve been really down lately, so this was needed. Again, we spent well over an hour talking about life and work, relationships, etc. He told me about a girl he really liked, but who was acting really crazy, and I gave him honest advice. He also told me he never liked my ex because of how immature he was, and didn’t understand why I was with him to begin with. We also have so much in common were basically the same person. Eventually it got a bit late so we said bye and went home, keeping up the regular schedule of sending memes and whatnot.

   Then, sometime in July, I got exclusive access to buy tickets for a band that we both love, and theyre extremely popular so I was excited to be able to buy us seats. I asked him if he was down and he was beyond thrilled, so I bought the tickets and he paid me back. We went on about our lives for a few weeks and one day while we were joking around over text I made a joke about killing myself (normally he responds to these like “same” or something along those lines) but this time he actually reacted with concern saying he’d miss me if I did. Idk what happened after that, maybe I’m just starved for someone to care about me, but I slowly started to like him. Although I wouldn’t show it nor even think about telling him, because let’s be honest he is pretty attractive and I’m not. And this next part is where the actual issue begins... we continue on as normal until about 5 days ago when he posted pictures of a girl he was hanging out with w/ heart eyes as the caption. Different girl from the one in June, btw. Around this time he also wouldn’t really respond to any of my conversations on IG, only send random memes and “like” the ones that I would send. And sometimes he’s like that, where he’s busy or something and won’t respond, just send memes that he sees. So I thought nothing of it, but I thought it was strange when I asked him yesterday if he heard the new song released by the band we’re gonna see and he looked at it but said nothing. 

   If there’s one thing I’ve learned about him is that he hates clingy people, and quite honestly so do I, so I’m giving him some space. But I’m a little confused as to who that girl was, and it was strange that he didn’t tell me about her because he’s very open with me and pretty much only me, he said that I’m the only one that understands him and that makes him feel comfortable talking about difficult things with. I know it sounds really irrational especially considering I have no idea how serious they are, but I’m afraid she’s keeping him from talking to me, and ultimately will keep him from going to this concert with me. I have literally no one else to go with and I’m afraid to lose him again and I don’t know what to do or even how to confront this. Should I try and talk to him and ask him if everything is ok, or do you think I’ve done my part and should wait for him to respond? 

TLDR: I have a best friend that I have an important event planned with, and suddenly he stops responding for unknown reasons. I suspect its because of a girl he posted about and I’m feeling kind of worried that she will make him ditch our event, and also I’m kind of secretly bitter because I’ve started to have feelings for him.",09Aug2018,3

So, in 2016, my Fiance and I moved into a shitty little efficiency in our hometown in the middle of nowhere PA. We pay $350 a month, it's okay. We swapped once to the downstairs 1 bedroom in 2017, but as of 2018 we're back in the efficiency. This house was built in 1925 or so, and is designed to be 4 apartments.


The walls are thin, there's problems, but NOTHING as big as the problem downstairs: Our neighbours. And my landlord(50 or 60 something M) too, but we'll get to him.


In February, my Fiance got a job at the local gas station, 2 houses down from ours. Our neighbour(38F)'s wife did too. She moved right up to assistant manager under a corrupt manager who was later found to be stealing money and laundering it from the company. My Fiance got accused of stealing cigarettes.

He didn't. The woman(50 something F) who worked with him on overnights just didn't like him and didn't want to work with him, so she sought to get him fired. Well, we'll call the assistant manager wife D. The other one we'll call H. 

So D goes in and sees my Fiance is off the schedule and he was essentially fired as they did an investigation of tapes wherein they found nothing. Strike 1 against this company. Strike...who even knows against the neighbours.

D fights with management to get his job back, and a few nights later, he's working again. Mind you, this is a $7/hr job, but he has no formal training/education and we take what we can get. 


It's important to note that he grew up poor and also pays child support. We can't afford to send him to school right now. I'm mentally and emotionally disabled and get SSI. I cannot work. Combined, we maybe clear $1800-2000 a month income.


Well, down the road, D starts running her mouth about coworkers being on drugs, without proof. She's accusing people left and right.

She gets moved to another location about 2 miles away. She blames my Fiance and says he ""didn't stand up for his friend"". We were never friends. Just friendly and civil with them. So she's pissed about that, and H starts running her mouth to me about everything D is saying behind his back.

I'm trying to shrug it off, but I keep it tucked in my memory. So eventually, down the line, these two manage to convince our landlord to keep my Fiance's sister(22F) off the premises because of fights between H and the sister.



It's like high school never ended for D and H. There were fists threatened to be thrown from both sides. It was insane. H starts accusing me of knowing about sister calling the cops on her to have harassment reported etc. She's nuts. I tell her that sister didn't say anything to me about it. I'm instantly a liar.

H is related to just about everyone in this small town and is best friends with all the cops here--The worst part is, the cops are incredibly corrupt. She never gets more than a warning or a laugh from them, and she claims to be deathly afraid of police.

The plot thickens. They have helped us out in the past by giving us food from the food pantry. They've helped my Fiance get this job. D was hired before him, and I guess she pulled for him. But that's about as far as it goes. Last year, they would often start drama and drag us into it. We had the cops called multiple times to our house as a whole.




Now onto the Landlord. He runs our local 911 call centre. It's named after him. He is also either a slumlord or he's just really down on his luck, I can't tell. Their rent is what pays his mortgage on the house. We had a bedbug situation over the summer where he couldn't afford pest control or he'd have gone into default on it.

This guy is nice, and is super lax for the most part, but incredibly lazy. He hasn't made repairs to things that really need it in 3 years, according to other neighbours. Black mold, holes in ceilings, bowing walls from water leaks, rotting floor boards, severely damaged carpet, missing stairs. He had the house on the market twice, even while I lived here, and no one wants to buy this house.



Well, D and H have known the Landlord for 3 years. She can get away with murder with him, despite screaming and yelling and ""telling him how it is"". The guy is barely ever in town. He has another house he's paying off in north carolina where he's trying to fix a relationship with his wife. I don't think he likes me much because I take issues seriously.

I've been brought to his attention multiple times because of H and D spreading shit. So has my Fiance. We know they don't like us. We know they're two faced as hell. We just try to get along because we all live here.



Cut to the past week.



D was absolutely furious to hear that my Fiance finally got employee of the month. She said, to my face, for the longest time that he would never get it. He will never get a pay raise. He will never get a promotion. He did get EotM, but not the other 2 things yet. We'll see. His boss and corporate love him.

Hell, even H tried to convince me that he was cheating with a coworker. We had that coworker come over to clear the air but I didn't bring that up.



So the gas station puts Employee of the Month pictures up of the employee and their certificate online.

When my Fiance's went up, not 30 minutes later, there was a stream of nasty comments and rude words coming from one person. I thought it was funny because I know who types like that. D does and H does. They're extremely similar. Well, we went over and told his boss. She notified the girl from corporate who comes around and told her to delete that.

I decided to look up the picture used on the profile. Low and behold it was from a spam account on twitter about dogs. Something wasn't adding up. I knew it was fake.

H wrote congrats on the post, and shortly after that, it was all taken down and reposted. H starts messaging me like crazy, asking about the profile and who would say such mean things etc. She also asked me if she could help me fight whoever they were off. I looked up the profile after I proved with screen shots it was fake...it was deleted completely from facebook.

My Fiance and I talked to his boss about this in the store.

After that, she wouldn't stop asking us about it, informing us that D was looking for another job. Apparently she got one at the local prison. H continued to say that we had said it was them and that corporate was being involved. When we talked to the boss, we never directly named names, but the boss knows them and suggested maybe it was them. We said we thought so too.

So after being banned from the facebook page, both of them, D quit her job and filed a 2 weeks notice. She claims she was fired by corporate over this. They both also told us they were banned from the store. My Fiance's boss says ""if they were, she would know"".



H also claims that corporate showed them paperwork with my Fiance's name on it outing D as the culprit and that is why she was fired. H also said she got to see the comments that were mean and nasty, and said that D was too ""kind hearted to say something about someone she liked"". I call bullshit here.


D also messaged me on facebook calling my Fiance and I nasty, trash, liars, saying we need mental help and are just doing this to draw attention to ourselves and then she blocked me. H has yet to block me. We'll see. I'm keeping all of their messages just in case.


H also told me tonight that she told our landlord about it all, showed him the papers with my man's name on them about D, and said she and D (and their clan of many) are moving out. If they do that, their $800 will no longer be paying his mortgage payment as that's what he uses it for. And that's IF what she said is true.



I'm worried my Fiance and I will be made homeless because of it (we don't even own a car to sleep in), or will cause the Landlord to jack the rental price up so high we can't afford it anyway. Either way, the situation is looking dire. I can't tell if it's all talk or not. I called my landlord around 10:30, and no answer. He usually works overnights so I'm hoping that's why. He has yet to come get rent.


These people have caused a LOT of trouble for us. I mean, when we lived downstairs, these crazy bitches came up onto our back porch without asking, to have drama meetings, to try to knock the shit out of people they didn't like who'd come to visit my Fiance and I. They were constantly attempting to insert themselves into our lives and business.


There were times my landlord came over to sort things out with us all like children because of them.


I don't know what to do now. I could really use the insight. Thank you for your time.



TL;DR - Fiance and I have neighbours who are CERTIFIABLY INSANE, and are threatening and running their mouths so much, we're afraid of losing our home and becoming homeless because of them. It'd be awesome if people read this. I really need the help.",09Aug2018,1

I'm currently at a loss and in need of some solid advice to reach resolution. Forgive me if there are any violations of posting rules, as this is my first attempt in seeking advice from this sub. I'll do my best to be brief, but my wife and I are looking for some solid guidance regarding our situation. 

***A quick backstory on the school:***

Our son is starting middle school on Monday, which is located in Florida. For context, the school is a Charter school, or a school of choice, and focuses on Science and Technology - every week they attend a field activity devoted to the curriculum of the week (i.e., if the focus is marine science for the week, they'll visit the local mangroves and estuarine services). The curriculum is vast, and is very much, ""hands-on learning"". We've heard fantastic reviews from parents and alumni, and are excited about the opportunity it presents. In order for him to have been accepted, we've put in a lot of work during the summer, which included an entrance exam, and a written essay, among other tasks that included a review of his state-issued standardized testing scores from his elementary school. To say that we were excited that he was officially accepted last month, is quite an understatement. 

***Current state of the situation:***

Earlier this week, while speaking to a neighbor regarding our son's acceptance to the school, we received some troubling information, regarding one of the current board members. Back in the late 90's, this particular individual was a science teacher at a middle school in the community, and was accused of (multiple times), and later terminated for, sexual misconduct of multiple children, during a handful of off-campus field trips. 

After some research, we were able to locate some of the case details from the county, to corroborate the information provided by our neighbor. After this individual's termination, and subsequent trial (to which he ***WAS*** acquitted), he later received funding some 10 years later to develop this charter school. 

It's troubling to us that this individual, who has a history of these accusations, and tangible repercussions derived from said accusations, is now currently in a position of authority over middle school aged children, once again. In my research, it is quite apparent that this individual is well connected with members of the school board and other notable members of the community. This was apparently a very highly publicized trial in the area, and there were numerous media outlets covering the story - Oddly enough, our attempts to locate the editorials from our local paper regarding the trial produced many results, but once you navigate to the paper's archives, the digital files have all been completely scrubbed. For all case and purposes, some 20 years later, this story has completely disappeared. We wouldn't have known about this individual's history if it wasn't for our neighbor. 

Furthermore, the thought of our son on weekly off-campus field trips (with which this individual is present for all school activities), paints a disturbing picture of history repeating itself. 

While I don't want to falsely accuse someone of misconduct, especially someone who has been accused and acquitted, I'm quite apprehensive in just chalking this whole scenario up to coincidence. 

I've drafted a letter to the county school board, outlining my apprehensions and concerns with this individual, but have yet to receive a response - I can post a redacted version of this letter as requested. 

In our scenario, how would you proceed further in seeking some sort of common-sense resolution to this predicament? ",09Aug2018,5

I have an older friend (in his 70s) who's essentially home-bound with a disability. Recently, I was talking with him and he mentioned that the FBI had sent him an email (red flag) recruiting him for some sort of research project. Basically, ""they"" had him download a bunch of software and taught him how to use it, and now he does research on, like, disaster response, I guess? He says they have him go do research on how many casualties would occur in such and such a place if such and such an event happened, and he logs his findings into this software program. I don't really understand the situation entirely, but it sounds really suspicious to me. He doesn't get paid for any of this, and apparently they haven't told him not to share this information with anyone else.

331,"My post got locked in another board for saying my sister is a narcissist. I know she can't be diagnosed at 15, but she has a lot of traits of it.

She's always had a major golddigger attitude. I remember getting in fights with her when I was freaking 8 because she would throw a fit in a store to get a toy she wanted. We learned from a young age that money is hard to get and we don't get everything we want. Our dad, mom and older brother (26M) have all been super nice about it and said no to her on many occasions, but she never learns. She thinks that if they love her, they will do anything for the money to buy her X, Y, and Z. She would throw such tantrums even at 13 that our mom would give it and try to make her feel guilt about what she bought her, but even that didn't work.

My sister acts like a popular girl from a movie like Mean Girls at school. She thinks she's better than everyone else and bullied the 7th and 8th grade girls when she was in 9th. 

When I told our mom, who was abused at that age, she flipped out, slapped my sister, and dragged her to each of their homes to apologize. Still didn't learn a thing.

Our mom is a sweet woman but couldn't take it anymore when my sister told her if she loved us, she would buy us a better house. She decided she had enough with her shit. She's slapped her nine times and yells, ""Want to make it 10?"" when my sister talks back. She's spanked my sister's bare ass in front of our grandma and in the women's room of a Chinese restaurant when she had a classmate see her get dragged in there. You'd think that would stop her from being selfish, but no. She cries a little and went back to demanding all kinds of shit. She threatens to cut herself to try to get what she wants but never does. Our older brother refused to take her on vacation because she was a brat to him, and it was just me and his son. It was sweet freedom to be honest.

I don't know what's wrong with her. Maybe she's destined to find a sugar dad. I'm tired of her BS, and I'm tired of being blamed for fighting with her. She steals from me, I try to get it back. That's fighting. I tell on her for stealing and our mom doesn't care. So I have to just let her steal I guess.",09Aug2018,1

338,"This may be a little complicated.

A little bit of background information - I recently broke up with my boyfriend after a long relationship filled with emotional abuse. Unfortunately, I am in the same program as him in University. This wouldn’t be a big deal, but our program consists of about 15 people in each year which means I will have to be seeing him and intimately working with him every single day. I have gone to a higher up in the University about this and how I am scared to be forced to confront my abuser on a daily basis. She was very helpful and made me aware of the resources that are available to me. 

Now comes the hard part. I recently realized that my ex’s facebook information was still attached to my phone. I know I shouldn’t have, but I looked. What I saw was disturbing.

I found a conversation between him and a classmate about how they should start killing off our classmates to ‘get rid of the competition’. What scared me even more is that before the threats started my name was mentioned specifically. 

I was always afraid of my ex turning violent, and people who are close to both of us mentioned how they feared for my safety when we originally broke up.

I’m hoping to get some advice on how to approach this and to confirm that I am not overreacting. Although I do believe that they would be joking, I don’t want to brush this aside if it’s something that could be avoided.

I already asked the manager about this and she is fully aware and agrees. She just says that there’s not much she can do, but I disagree.

And I'm noticing so many of these negative things. I used to be able to brush these things off, by looking at the good in the world which would make me feel better. Yet, as of recent I can't cope with anything anymore, they build up on a stick to me making me feel like rubbish constantly.

Jump to a couple days ago. A girl I went to school with (26) gets a job in the office. We look like we could be the same age and she seems a little immature for her age so she still acts like she's 20. So we get to talking and really hit it off she asks me how old I am, she guesses 23.

Anyways she asks if I'm working all week and on her way out says man, I only gets to see me once a day. The next day we have a really great conversation and I can tell we're vibing with each other.

She asks me who the youngest I'd date would be and being a sly bastard I tell her there's an equation that works perfectly.

349,"Hi Reddit, I find myself in an odd situation right now. (I hope my text doesn't come off as humble brag. My intention is only to present my case objectively)

TL; DR: I find myself extremely stressed, when objectively my life is doing great. It is hindering my ability to get things done, further worsening my situation. How do de-stress. 

____

**Back story:**

I am a person who has done generally well in life so far. I have had a pretty normal life with my fair share of failures / difficulties, but I have usually come out the other side with a positive outcome.

Couple of years I found myself wanting to change disciplines, and despite being in a bad place for a year I finally got an got an opportunity to pursue my dream career at my dream grad school. This was far beyond my expectations, and I found myself among intelligent peers who were both extremely ambitious and well prepared. While I do fancy myself intelligent, my preparation was certainly lacking.

I had initially begun my course with the intention of getting my foot in the door into the industry and not competing with the more ambitious, but as time went by I found myself getting swept in with my peers' ambitions, seeking the best opportunities just as they did.

To my own surprise, I have managed to just squeeze in and barely land opportunities that I would never have thought possible for myself 2 years ago.         
Thing is, I do not think I deserve it.          
I still have visible deficiencies in my skill set, and every day I dread that I may get exposed as an under-prepared fraud among the elite. I am a good talker, so I can work my way around conversations and discussions, but interviews are something else all together.           
The advent of such a day bears heavily on me.

I know full well, that if I settle for being above average, then I can avoid this imposter syndrome. But, I know not if I will find myself so close to my goals ever again. The thought of becoming a person who settled for OK, is one I can't bear, for it is not the type of person I want to be.

These thoughts take up constant space in my head and affect my ability to go about being a productive part of society. For instance, I wasted one whole summer of valuable work with a professor because the stress of needing to get things done, made it hard for me to get anything done. (academic or leisure)

Lastly, I am also dealing with standard mid 20s problems of needing to figure my personal life out and taking over certain responsibilities from my parents. The fact that I have made no progress on either of those fronts further bears heavily on me.

I know full well that my problem is nothing when compared to what most people face on a daily basis. I have long thought about whether I should even post this on the internet or just deal with it. But, today I found myself very visibly affected by it (when a plan that would have given me more time to work things out, looked like it might not work out and I might have to face my inadequacies at a lot sooner than I thought). So here I am on reddit, feel free to tear me a new one.

Hopefully this isn't enough personal information to run my anonymity.

352,"Hi, I'm currently halfway through getting a high end realism tattoo from an international artist who has an amazing portfolio but also a big reputation for being a diva - which is what has made me scared to approach discussing my concerns about the work with them today.

I had to pay two full day rates at £550 per day. They completed 50% of the work today with the rest finished tomorrow but some things are off, the most pressing of which are;

1). We originally agreed two full days for a skull and a rose to go from my shoulder to elbow - today the design was only a skull with some black swirls and no rose, the skull only goes down 3/4 of my upper arm

2). I showed them many example pictures from a moodboard and specifically said I wanted a black and white piece only, no colour - but towards the end of our session today I looked back at the progress of the tattoo and they had put a lot of bright orange shades all over the skull which is exactly what I didn't want - I wanted to freak out but I don't want to upset them while they still have to finish the other half, this person is a DIVA and will just give me shit if I rock the boat \[I am not being dramatic about this point - I swear this person is an artistic genius but has a screw lose\]

In addition but not quite as pressing;

3). They charged me two daily rates for the skull and rose because these are two intricate pieces which takes a lot of time - but the design has has come up with is significantly smaller than originally agreed and is missing the rose - in my eyes the piece they have come up with is way less intricate than what we agreed on and doesn't warrant two full daily rates

4). Our 'day' today was 3.5 hours of actual tattooing, I'm almost certain they had another client in the afternoon despite charging me for the full day - this piece almost certainly could have been finished with a full day of work today

I'm very unsure how to go about steering this back on track - I'm more concerned about getting a good looking piece that I what I actually want than quibbling about the price, what can I do about the orange tones? Should I raise the issue of the rose we agreed upon not being in the design? Am I getting ripped off with the 'daily rate' stuff?

357,"My wife and I have always been the oldest in our friends group.  Part of that also is being seen as the most responsible or the ones who everyone most often comes to for advice.

Since everyone around us tends to be younger, there's also pieces of immaturity that comes with that.  Much of that comes with dirty jokes, tales of all kinds of somewhat irresponsible adventures, sex, all kinds of stuff like that.

Even though we're a bit older, we're not immune to stuff like that at times.  We also like to be a little irresponsible or perhaps a make a bad decision or two every now and then.  

The tricky thing is, this never seems to be very well accepted amongst our friends.  No one is ever really repulsed or anything, but our stories or jokes never get responded to, get ignored, or sometimes we might even get a response like ""TMI, guys.""  One friend even told me recently about an adventure of her own and when I basically asked her ""how was it"" in a friendly way, she's been strangely holding me at arm's length ever since.

It's super frustrating.  We don't really want to have to constantly hold up this role of having to be responsible or completely vanilla every moment of the day, it's kind of suffocating.  We also feel super left out to not be able to joke around, be sex positive, or make a mistake or two of our own.

I've spoken with this crowd about this in the past and they always seem to assure me that we're free to be open about whatever we want, even through their actions say otherwise like in the case I talked about with one friend.

I know one answer to this might be, ""well, just get some new friends"" and trust me we've tried.  My wife and I are in our early 30s and don't have kids and have some interests that not many our age share, and it's insanely difficult to really hit it off with anyone else.

Through the years so many things interest me that i’d like to pursue fully but i cant because im pursuing too many things at once

At this point i dont even know what my career will be


For example:
I got really interested in Canadian Law and politics about a year or two ago.

About a week ago i started learning the piano 

I love programming and have been for 3 years

I really like writing and want to write books

I like acting and i want to be an actor

I like writing movies and directing so i wanna do that too

I wanna become a chemist

I wanna become a physicist



All of these things im pretty good at if I do say so myself, and i enjoy them all A LOT. Pretty soon i’ll probably pick up another interest and it never stops


I want to have a career in each of these interests",09Aug2018,1

363," **We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.**

If you pick up today's newspaper, or turn on the news in your city, state or country in which you reside, you are no doubt bombarded with disaster after disaster, disappointment, and adversity that many of your fellow neighbors and fellow man are experiencing at any given moment of the day. Unfortunately despair, affects all of mankind....even you...

About Me, in the course of over 11 years now in helping people with goal setting, and developing smart goals for themselves, I cannot tell you the number of people who are facing seemingly insurmountable odds, and the overwhelming fear that seems to possess one's once positive attitude and positive thinking mindset.

Maybe you too are experiencing the trials of life yourself, and are suffering despair, adversity and setbacks in your personal or your professional life. It is true, we cannot control outside forces and events that affect our lives... but... we can control how we react to events and circumstances that impact us.

***Overcoming Adversity Despair, and Disappointment Requires Faith***

As a personal; believer in the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and savior in my life, I personally believe that the only way we can overcome challenges and obstacles in our life, is by inviting God first in our lives. You see, God desires to have personal, and successful relationships with all God's children, including you. Furthermore, how can you ever expect to grow and mature in your spiritual growth, and spiritual walk with God, if you are never faced with adversity in your life? Overcoming despair and adversity, yields spiritual growth and real character development.

Call out to God now, God hears your voice. Don't worry if you don't quite know how to meditate and pray unto Him, God knows your heart. I Samuel 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel,""Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart. Develop the hope and faith in God above and in your God given abilities.

If after all, everything else in your life has not worked in dealing with obstacles, adversity and despair in your life, you have everything to gain and more, by making God apart of your life. Also, if you ever want to know the age old secret how to be happy, and how to succeed in life, make God part of your life....

***Overcoming Adversity Despair, and Disappointment Requires A Positive Attitude and Mindset***

As I write this to you, I am currently without a job. My last previous contract that I was on ended January 31, 2011 with the federal government. I have been working in HIV/AIDS for 11 years now in program management, and began my employment search over 2 years ago, knowing my job would eventually end-which it did.

Life is way too short, to get down and discouraged, feeling sorry for yourself, and I chose not to be defined to what many would choose regarding negative thinking, and self-defeatism. Instead, I will rise above, and know God will supply my immediate needs by opening another opportunity in the way of a full time job my, in His time, and I have the hope and faith knowing God does provide.

Instead of succumbing to what you can't do, concentrate on what you can do. Make a smart goals plan of action, in prioritizing what you can do now to minimize any obstacles and setbacks in moving forward.

Develop the positive thinking mindset and positive attitude that you need in overcoming any trials that the world throws your way. Like the old adage, if you can believe it, you can achieve it still holds true today, conversely, if you don't believe you WILL, more likely more than not, you WON'T.

Develop the self discipline, and the self motivation to change your emotional outlook in how you look at adversity. Remember too, the biggest room in the whole wide world is the room called self improvement, and self improvement, is something, you, nor I can ever receive enough of in our lifetime.",09Aug2018,1

366,"I'm 19, I've been a professional back-end programmer for 3 years now. That's 3 years of my life where 9 - 5, 5 days a week is dedicated to sitting at a PC. I enjoy it, I really enjoy programming, that's not my issue. 

My issue is that I just can't find a way to escape technology. Monday  - Friday I'm working on a PC. After work, I sit on my personal PC and game, program, watch YouTube, watch Netflix, scroll Reddit, etc. There's just so much to do on my PC that it feels like it's my only hobby.

My hobbies:

* Programming
* Gaming
* Listening to Music (I'm a big audiophile)
* Watching Music Videos
* Riding Motorcycles
* Cars
* Camping
* Cooking
* Abandoned building exploring

Nearly Half of those hobbies are dedicated to sitting at my PC, and there's lots more other things to do at my PC, excluding those. I don't really have anywhere to ride my motorcycle to in the evenings, likewise with the car. I can't go camping until the weekends. After a day of work, I can't be bothered to put effort into cooking something big, I just want to sit down. I have a GF of a year, who lives about 45 mins away, so I'll quite often go out to see her a couple of times a week. My Dad is often watching TV in the living room, so I'm forced to sit in my office on the PC to watch Netflix.

I'm just a bit lost at what to do, I feel like I finish work and just default to my PC. I want to become more fit (I'm pretty slim anyway, but don't exercise), but can't be bothered to start that. I'm demotivated and relatively unhappy with my out -of-work life.

370," I (23,f) split with my ex (25,m) almost 2 months ago now after a 2 year relationship became a constant argument and got extremely vindictive/aggressive to the point he was throwing furniture at me and threatening me with murder. He is constantly wishing for me to get back with him but he hurt me so much, I just can't put myself through living in fear again. However, for the last 10 or so years of my life, I have been wildly in love with a man I know but have never got to date; We have gotten close but never officially dated. Just over 2 months ago (a week before my relationship ended) he started talking to me again out of the blue and although I tried to ignore the buried emotions, I couldn't stop them, I really couldn't. One night, we were messaging all the way into the next morning and admitted we both wished we'd gotten together; we were each other's 'what if'. He's now currently on holiday for 3 weeks and has been gone a week so far. He's not contacted me once and before he went, he said he would message me when he could. I've messaged him a few times telling him I miss him and asking if we've become strangers and still nothing. We were supposed to meet up before he went and it didn't happen. Now he's gone cold on me. Part of me thinks I'm just lonely and I'd date anyone at this point in time but I'm not. I've reverted back to Tinder - where I met my ex - just to feel like someone would still want me but I know in my heart, all I want is my love of 10+ years. It's driving me crazy but I just want to know if I should wait or just give up? No matter how many others I could meet or date, I'll always be in love with that one guy and although he seems like nothing special, he's always been that one for me. Always. ",09Aug2018,1
371,"Hi, for context I’m currently 19 and I’m at university. My university is quite close to my house so I live with my mom and sister and I take a bus everyday to university. 

So basically, my parents are quite overprotective but it’s not in the sense that they don’t let me do stuff, it’s more I have to update them what I’m doing , where I am etc. so the issue is basically I’ve been quite lonely for some time now, I have a few friends here and there but it’s more they message me when they have issues with their computers, or with some uni stuff etc. I try to go out with them a lot but there’s always either busy or they find an excuse so throughout the summer I’ve seen them once . I deal with other issues as well, I stutter quite a bit and have all my life. Saw a speech therapist for a bit which helped slightly, but obviously there’s no “cure” for stuttering it’s just a temporary thing. I cry a lot and a lot of that is because I just don’t have anyone to go out with I’m just stuck at home playing some games. I feel like no one understands me, I’m just alone in this world. I’ve really thought about seeking some help but the issue is I really don’t want my parents to find out it’ll be such a big issue for me they’ll be even more overprotective if they are worried and it’ll make things worse. And the issue is I live at home and so they kind of know where I am and what I’m doing so there’s no way around it. Also professional help costs money and that all goes through them so they will find out. What do u think I should do? I just want someone to talk to I’m sick of people saying “go out and make friends” it isn’t like that it’s much deeper. Thanks in advance.

372,"My parents are very nonchalant towards my education. I work very hard in school. I've always been an Honor Roll student. I get straight A's in school. Every time I show my parents my report cards/progress reports, they show no enthusiasm. They never praise me, they never say I'm proud of you, etc.

Every time I talk about my schoolwork and everything, they brush it off and change the subject. I tell them I want to go to college, and they don't really care.

I just want my parents to show interest and support with my education. My friend's parents are very supportive with their schoolwork. When they show their parents their report cards, they always congratulate them and are happy for them. My parents do none of that. It upsets me because I wish my parents were like that.

My parents don't come from an educational background. My father never went to college. He didn't even finish high school. He got his GED, and has been working manual labor jobs his whole life.

381,"So, when I was growing up I never had a lot of friends cuz my family was a military family and we moved around a lot. I'd have a few in the places I moved to, but nothing ""permanent"" or anything resembling childhood friends. Because of this, I either spent most of my time with my family or by myself.

I'm in college now, and live away from my family. I feel weird all the time because while I have a few friends who I hang out with a couple times a month, my life kind of just feels empty. Like I go to class, then go home, do homework, or do my hobbies. I feel like I should be wanting more. Like, I feel like College is suppose to be about making lots of friends, going to lots of parties, having lots of sex, and because I'm not doing any of that that's the reason I'm unhappy. It makes me anxious that if I'm not hanging out with someone at least once a day I'm missing out.

I find it hard to relate to others here too sometimes because coming to college is the first time I've been back to the states and been around peers of my nationality, and I just don't always connect with them. Things like how they've been driving, always lived in their same home town, know where their roots are and where they want to settle, and I'm barely figuring out where I consider my home to be.

382," I need some serious advice here. Long story short, my dad convinced me to buy this Ford Fusion 07 for 1500$ at a junk yard and told me it was a great deal and that we can fix it up as my first car.  

The car initially needed a subframe replacement, because it was bent when I bought it. So we went back to the junkyard to get the subframe from another Ford Fusion. I paid 300$ to install it. It turns out, according to my father, that it doesn't ""fit"". So, for months, he asks around people to weld something so it would fit. I really don't know. But it turns out, that that is not the case either, and that it simply needs the correct subframe. So we got the correct subframe apparently, but I only have 300$ to my name, and the person who did it before won't answer anymore. The thing is, I've asked around quite a bit about this, and some people say that if the subframe bolted in, then it should fit no matter what. It's just that it needs motor/transmission brackets. There will be people saying that I'm just going to have to suck it up and do it myself, but I know literally nothing about this. I have an anchor around me and it's called a Ford Fusion. My dad is no help, no help at all. He doesn't help, and on top of that, he recently accused me of taking his pills, his ""phenobarbital"", when I didn't. This is the third or fourth time he accused me, and he even went over to my friend's house, the day he accused me, and accused HIM of buying them off of me, implying that I was selling them. 

I'm stuck in a very bad position I feel. My happiness levels are down. I don't feel comfortable living here anymore, and I want out. But I don't have any guidance, not even a little bit.

383,"A little cat started showing up at our house last August. We found out he's our neighbors'. They said they put him outside because his behavior was problematic for them (clawing furniture, urinating outside litter box, etc.). He started showing up at our house often. As the weather got colder, we started letting him in our covered porch room to warm up by the heater, then putting him back out when we went to bed. We noticed he was always really thirsty (drinking from dirty puddles). Then, we noticed he was outside our window meowing a lot. We saw him outside in bad weather soaking wet under a tree. I checked the neighbors house, but he had no way to get shelter (garage, barn, shed doors were closed, house was closed up). So, we started letting him come into the covered porch through a pet door. He would come and go as he pleased.

Then, in the spring, we noticed he had an abscess on his hip. It looked pretty bad, so we immediately took him to the vet and got it dealt with. (The vet said it was due to him fighting with other cats (he is not neutered)). We let our neighbors know about the vet trip, and they were cool with it. We paid for everything and gave him daily medicine. We stayed with him in the back porch at night, so he would stay inside to heal. Gradually he got better and the abscess healed.

It's summer now. He's been with us nearly every day. He goes outside in the morning, and comes back in the late afternoon to nap in the covered porch room. We take care of him as best we can, but we don't know if he's had vaccinations, flea meds, or anything else. I've seen signs of other potential health problems. We've taken him to the vet for a little checkup, but we can't do anything major because he's not our cat. We just do anything we can to give him a good life, but we can't do it 100% because he's not our cat.

A few months ago, we asked the neighbors if we could have him, they said ""no, we couldn't do that to our kids."" Yesterday, their daughter came over and said they were moving in a few months. She took her cat back home. Predictably, he showed up at our house the next day.

I don't know what to do. I deeply love this little cat, and though he requires work, I feel I should take care of him. The thought of him leaving forever breaks my heart. Should we ask our neighbors again, and maybe offer money for him? Should we just drop it, and not interfere? Any advice you can give is extremely helpful, Thanks in advance.

I have no power anymore, I can't go on like this.

I am attracted to girls aged 11-14. Hebehilia, so prepubescent to pubescent girls. I want to love them and be loved by them. So no, I am not a rapist nor a molester or whatever. That doesn't give me anything. I want sexual acceptance from girls from that age group. I believe this stems from a deep insecurity with girls, because back then I would show my sexuality openly (as any normal human does) and was called a pervert and excluded, mobbed and was just the nerd/pervert/genius everyone picked on. I just wanted to be loved and to love back.

But now it's too late. Society forbids me to follow my passion and my heart. Nothing I will ever do in my entire life can possibly give me what I am so deeply longing for. And I know that. No love in my life. And what is life without love? Whenever I see happy people it breaks my heart and i just want to cry and fall into an endless cry that never ends, becomes monotonous and finally disappears together with me into nothingness. Just end it. This is only suffering. Knowing what you need to feel that bliss all the others are allowed to feel, but you just can't get it. But you're smart enough to create in your mind a glimpse of what could be. You know the love you could give. Which makes it even worse.

Whatever I am going to do I will not be happy. The moments of laughter and happiness are merely moments of forgetting. And then I always get sad again because I remember.

So how do you guys cope with knowing you will never feel good?

How do you deal with never being able to live your sexuality?

Please any tip to stop becoming so sad that my heart and chest physically start to hurt. Please someone help me.

391,"I [17F] need to give you a lot of context for this, so please bear with me. 

My mother has been forcibly using me as a scapegoat to cheat on my father for at least a year. She used to force me to go to gym due to my weight, then she would flirt with this dude that has has an important role in society. She hit it off pretty big, stealing money from our home, getting money from the man, and all that. They were going out on dates while they were leaving me alone, at night, because I'd get badly hurt if I told dad, because dad ""would have a heart attack and die"" if I told him, because I would be ""a horrible daughter, as usual"" if I told him. So I stayed silent out of fear. For one year of constant fear and anxiety. I gave up on everything in life at this point. My mum was making every friend of mine go away, she was so mean with everyone that they kind of avoided me. 

Now, one day I say ""screw this, I'm going to tell dad because I don't want to live, and I don't want to live like this anymore either"". I tell dad and hell breaks loose. They argue, but dad never got physical. He kicks mom once or twice just for him to forgive her and get her back all the time. Three or four months ago she ran away with every single document and all the money in the house. Dad called me urgently while I was attending classes at my highschool, and I had to immediately leave to support him. After that, it took us roughly a month to get our papers back and all that. 

They didn't file a divorce yet. 

Now, you see, dad's an amputee, he's missing a leg, and mum kind of forced him to stay inside and all that, motivating him to do nothing at all while she goes ahead and cheat on him. After she ran away, he kinda took his prosthetic leg and started walking around, even if his other leg hurts. And, well, he kind of hates her for that. 

At this moment though, they're getting along well. He's madly in love with her, while she has him in full control, and well, thing is, as much as a bitch she can be (trash talking us to the whole world and lying about everything we did, for example, she said we kicked her now, when she ran away, and she lied that **I** was treating her like shit when it was the other way around). We met tonight at my mother's place, and she suddenly told me that my father said that he wants us to move together in a new house. Thing is, after everything my mother did to me through all these years, I don't want to see her anymore, ever. I couldn't care less if she was dead. 

But I care about dad. And he's saying that if he stays in this house more than needed, he's going to kill himself. Ever since there's a lot of bad stuff that happened here to them, he doesn't want to stay here anymore. He wants us to move with my mother otherwise he's going to kill himself, since he's tired to ""mediate"" between my mother, my grandmother and I. 

I told him I don't want to stay with her, and he said I don't have a choice, for two more years until I finish highschool and go to uni (preferably outside my country away from them forever). But I don't think I can make it two more years. Each day I've spent with my mother was a day of self loathing, self hatred and a few days of self harming. Every night I went to sleep after a day with her I wished I'd stop breathing, or stop existing, and as an atheist I would pray to God I'd actually die the next day.

396,"I just quit my job a week ago and lost my health insurance through the company. I have the opportunity to get a new job that offers benefits that I don't see myself fully enjoying. I also have another job opportunity for less pay, no benefits that I think would be more inline with what I enjoy. 

If I take the latter job I won't be in the best position to pay for my own insurance, but the other job will leave me feeling unfulfilled. They would both be long term and I'm just not sure which is worth more. ",09Aug2018,1
397,"Kinda specific. I'm self-taught cause can't afford classes ever but I love dancing. I have two road blocks not sure how to get past. 

1.) Even if I know all the moves, I will see a dance to a song in my head. When I get up to do it my head goes ""blank"". I can't seem to think and dance at the same time no matter how much I've commited the moves to memory in my head. But I know it can be done! 
How do others get their head and body together enough for choreography? Especially your own choreography? I don't want to stay stuck in a rut of what's familiar and thus stay too repetative. 

2.) It's hard to keep my whole body engaged. I keep finding either my legs/feet, or arms will get kinda lazy and forgotten part way through. Any good tips to break this bad habit and keep my wholebody engaged? 

I might not be a professional but I really want to improve! Anything helps, thanks so much! &lt;3 ",09Aug2018,1

400,"So, I am really passionate about gaming. I want to do something involving gaming for a living, too. Whether it's development or streaming. However there is one major problem. My parents.

They want me to become something that benefits them and *other people*. These words are very important as this is the only thing I've been thinking about the past 16 years of my life. I just want to do something for myself!

I also am bad at deciding stuff and when I, for once, decide what I want to do, it's disappointing? I get it, though, but why won't you accept my decision?

I have really good grades and I do balance school with gaming. My parents just don't seem to notice the good parts. They did buy me a PS4 and a monitor a couple of years ago and it was for ""weekends only"". I did that for a couple of weeks and afterwards I talked my way to 1 hour every day. Which was great btw.

Last year I decided to move over to PC gaming and I looked online for a good gaming pc to build. I put all of the parts in an Amazon wishlist and started saving. I told them I was saving and they said it was ok. I saved 1200 goddamn dollars only for them to say no. Now I have $1200 dollars lying around.

They call gaming a mental disorder and it bothers me every time they say it. I am healthy, I listen to them, I do my chores, I babysit my sister whenever and I've lived up to their expectations until now.

What should I do, cause I have no fucking clue?!",09Aug2018,2
401,"I completed a couple of years at university. I decided I want to take a break from school, and join the workforce for a while. I want to transfer my credits from my university to my local community college to get an Associate's. I just want to get my Associate's before I join the workforce, because I think it's good to have SOMETHING than nothing at all.

I met with an advisor at the community college. The advisor told me, ""If you just want a stand alone degree, you should go for the Associate of Arts."" I also thought about getting the Associate of Arts because I read that can get transferred to a university. He then told me, ""If you want to get the Associate of Applied Science, you have to go in a specific area like Chemistry, Biology, Nursing, etc. You would have to take general classes and then more specific classes.""

I don't want to do that. I don't want to go in a specific area because I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO! This is why I want to take a break from school and join the workforce.

I've completed 61 credits at my university. I had 59 more to take. The advisor told me, ""if I want to get the Associate of Arts, your credits from your university will transfer and you have to just complete 15 credits at the community college."" That sounds good. 15 credits, I can do that in a semester.

However, my mother is telling me I should get the Associate of Applied Science. I don't want to do that, because I don't know what direction I want to go. I told her I just want a more general degree. I also read that an Associate of Applied Science can't get transferred to a university while an Associate of Arts can.

My mother asked, ""So are you going to get an Associate's and work at McDonalds? Walmart? Sweep floors? You have to pick a specialty!""

She's annoying me because I feel like I'm being forced to make a quick decision and just go in a specific specialty when I don't even know what specialty I want to get into.

I've never even had a job. I want to get some work experience, and I think an Associate's will give me a better shot at landing a job. I don't know what kind of job I want, I just want to work and develop my passion. My mother is telling me I need to pick a specific area of interest and pursue that. However I don't know what area I want to get into.

Since it is summertime and I live in a temperate climate, everyone has their windows open to let in the cool nighttime air. Which brings us to the main issue: my neighbors who live directly across from me leave their windows open all night, including the 1-3 hours that their baby (about 1 year old) screams and cries. It is so loud that it wakes me and other neighbors up in the middle of the night. I know if they would close their windows, the sound would be dulled enough to not be bothersome, but I don’t know how to go about that.  
  
I feel bad complaining to management or non-emergency because it’s a baby and crying is the only form of communication it knows, and I don’t want to look like an unreasonable person, but really I just want them to close their dang windows while their baby is crying. That’s all I ask. ",09Aug2018,1

So I'm 16 and as far as I know I am quite normal for my age, I have a job and life goes well enough. I do have a bit of anxiety but lately I have been feeling as I'm slowly getting less anxious and more social, so my life goes quite well, as far as I know I don't have any mental disorders except very very mild autism but to be honest I was very young when that all was tested (was tested at my school with all students) and I don't think I actually have it as I have no real symptoms of it, and my dad, although I haven't seen him in 10 years is Bi-Polar.

But ever since 2 to 3 years ago I have moments in my life I suddenly feel like I'm of the opposite gender (My real gender is male) it's when I wake up and it stays for at least a month or longer, in this stage I have the urge to cross-dress, in my dreams I mostly appear female, and I have a lot of lucid dreams where I am female, as for last night it's the one that pushed me to seek help as when I woke up it felt like I was pushed out of ""her"" body and then I shot back into mine by my alarm, as if I was in a very deep coma but in reality I just slept for a normal 8 hours. In the times that I feel female I also have this weird gut feeling as if this is really me. I do not believe in the multiple genders as biology shows this is not a thing (I do respect everyone that believes this and does not push it down everyone's throat) so I do not think I'm gender fluid.. but I just don't know at this point, as I really feel like I'm female at some points and at other points it doesn't even cross my mind... another point of interest is that people always see me as gay, or that I act gay, although I am quite sure I am not homosexual as I do not, and never have had homosexual thoughts, but this might change at one point in my life.

So I work in a standard office setting I’m a straight male but have been single for a long time, my coworkers are always insinuating that I’m gay when I’m not. They say things like “just come out already” or “who’s the guy you’re always talking to” (I run a business outside of my job and most of my clients are men so I answer the phone saying “what’s up man” or something along those lines)

I don’t know why this bothers me so much but it does, it’s almost like being bullied. I’ve been to company events with women I’ve dated and have even had sex with a co-worker (not many people know and we prefer not to let it out to the public)

What advice would you give someone in this situation? 

Should I just get over it even though I don’t want it to catch on and have everyone in the office start saying it?

Anyway, recently, I've seen a bunch of criticism of a favourite movie's protagonist - mainly attacking her moral character. Some was on Reddit, some on Youtube. Even fans of the movie seem harsh on her.

I felt that the character was on her way to developing out of that stage, but it's proving hard to forget that criticism.

I *want* to keep enjoying that movie though - I feel it's a good movie.

420,"So just some general information, I started this job making coffee and cashiering about a year ago now. The manager that hired me hired me for minimum wage in my state (June 2017; I live in the US by the way). For various reasons, she had to step down as our manager in September. I stuck around through a busy few months, and we finally got a new manager in December of 2017.  I learned about a month later that she had began hiring for 50 cents more per hour than I made at the time (it's a coffee shop, so generally we run through people rather quickly). I put up with it for a little bit, before finally asking for a raise in May of 2018, as the school year was wrapping up and I need to start earning more than minimum wage. She said she would do everything she can (apparently raises are a difficult thing to do because she has to go through our district manager, I don't really know). 

A few weeks later (June 2018 now) one of our other locations lost a lot of people, so our store manager had to run up there, and ended up co-managing both of our stores (though really, I haven't seen her at all since then. Our assistant manager and shift supervisors have been doing most of the managing). It's now been 3 months since I've asked for the raise, and I've received nothing.

Now, I'm not exactly the most stern person, but I have been asking my assistant manager about whether our store manager is gonna get the raises out, as I'm not the only one that's being paid less than new hires. She says that any day now our store manager will be back, and she'll probably get to giving us raises then. In addition to this, apparently the store manager talked to the assistant manager and shift supervisors a few months back to ask which of us deserve more than the new hires, and they seemed to agree that I did (I heard this from one of my shift supervisors who has now quit).

So essentially, I've been waiting 'just a few more days' for her to get back for 2 months now, and I'm not sure if I should stay put until she finally does get back (*if* she does get back) or if I should put in my 2 weeks and look for work elsewhere.",09Aug2018,2
421,"Hi all. I browse reddit a lot and give a lot back to the community in any way I can on my main account, but now I need some help. I've never had this situation happen to me, and I've only heard about it but never seen it in real time. About 40 minutes ago I got a text from a random number that read ""Twitter is a public place you dumb troll. Enjoy being jobless and sued."" Now, obviously I started freaking out. I post about instances of coworkers that will upset me sometimes, but for the most part I keep to myself on twitter and retweet things that I agree with or make me laugh (Politics, sometimes liking racism watchdog's posts, or just funny memes) and even when I post about politics its not as common as everything else. I'd say 2-3 in every 15 tweets are politics related.

I responded ""Who is this?"" and took a moment to go through my twitter and try to make it private. I couldn't figure out how to while in the middle of a league game, so I just deactivated it in a panic. They texted back saying ""Deleting wont do anything when we have screenshots. What an ugly personality you have"". and I again asked who it was.

They said ""Doesn't Matter. Wont have to deal with you anymore."" I responded that I had no idea who they were talking that, and that I haven't done anything (At least to my knowledge) to make any enemies. It's been about 20 minutes haven't gotten a response yet.

Now, I'm just a 19 year old black girl working a minimum wage job, and the job is one that I've been thinking about quitting anyway so I'm honestly not too pressed. However, it IS scary that the person contacted me about my twitter, had actively been watching it and messaged me about 2 minutes after I deactivated it, and is threatening to sue? Over what I don't know. The last time I \*Responded\* to something via a retweet comment was some tweet about how someone tweeted that women don't cook or clean after a hook up where I said something like ""Why would a woman clean and cook for you when they're the company in your house?"" Other than that just memes and videos and a few tweets I made about some really good mac and cheese I made at 2am. I don't often use the ""reply"" feature and I've used it maybe 5 times recently to reply to friend's tweets or post reaction images. I haven't gotten into any ""twitter battles"" in a good 6+ months, and even then I think it was maybe 3 or four and not serious enough imo for someone to contact me using my actual phone number?

It's REALLY concerning the person got my number and knows exactly who I am since I've posted photos and potentially could be finding out where I live and more? I'm not sure what they could sue me for, they could for sure dampen my relationship at work with some of the tweets, and I'm scared this info might get spread somewhere else and I might start getting death threats?

Is it too early to report this to the police? If not, how and where can I report this in Arizona? And how could someone have gotten my number through twitter, I always thought it was the other way around? I'm less scared about my job and more scared about my information being leaked/them coming for my family as well. I've been shaking from fear ever since I read the first text. Is it possible for ME to figure out who THEY are using the number they gave me? I asked a friend who knows more about tech stuff that I do and he said he'll look into it but the wait feels like forever. I'm just not sure what I should do.",09Aug2018,1

Â Â Â  Hello

Im falling in love with a man that may be in love with someone else.I met him through a mutual friend.My friend told me it was her best friend.Come to find out,they just met at the end of October.My boyfriend let her move in with him to help her get on her feet. He told me when i first met him that he was very attracted to her but then she started having different men over every night and he changed his mind about her.She had a lot of undesireable people comming to his house and his landlord warned him that if the traffic did not stop,he would be evicted.Well traffic did not stop and they were evicted. Now keep in mind this was the end of November of 2014.I met him Jan 26 of 2015.They rented a business office together and were in the process of getting a house together.

Â  As time went on he found out that his father was terminally ill.And this woman brought to my attention that he called her first.Also we were talking one day about my boyfriend and something came up and i said well i would ask him and she said 'call him' but he was working and could only use his phone at lunch time and he told me not to call him.to that she replied that was crazy because he talked to her evereyday at his llunch.I was mortified.See this woman was saying these things to me just to mess with me.I eventually confronted him and told him that i thought he still had something for her.He told me that I was the one he loved and they were just friends.Hes very overweight and NOT her type at all. I think that SHES not interested but he is.

430,"(Before anyone asks, I’ll explain how I had him as my teacher two years in a row. My high school is small and some of the classes have the same teachers. I had him for AP Human Geography and now for AP Physics.)

I haven’t told anyone about this.

I noticed it last year originally. It was when I did after-school tutoring for AP exams. I took AP Human Geography during my first semester (and our exams are in May), so there was about 4 months when I wasn’t doing anything with that class. Because of this, the school offers after-school tutoring about 2 weeks before the AP exams. This was where my trouble began.

Keep in mind that he’s in his 40s, and married.

Honestly, this all might be my fault. I asked a lot of questions, laughed at his jokes, etc. I don’t know. Is that flirting?

5 days into the tutoring, he pulled me aside after everyone else had left. He told me that he could tutor me privately if I needed. He said that I’d have a much better chance of passing the exams if I did. He said that he was privately tutoring lots of other students as well (which wasn’t a lie). I should’ve figured things out then, but I guess I’m just an idiot.

I agreed, and he set up a private-tutoring session on a Saturday at 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM.

I entered through the office, and walked to my usual class. I didn’t know why at the time, but I had an awful feeling the moment that I stepped into his classroom. 

Despite the feeling of dread, everything was normal at first. The problem started after about 1 hour. 

He was sitting opposite of me. I was reading a portion of the textbook, when he started trying to play footsie with me. It freaked me out, so I pulled my chair back a bit. 30 minutes later, he moved his chair next to mine, apparently to “see the textbook better”. Thing is, once he moved, he put his arm around the back of my chair and sat uncomfortably close to me.

What happened next is what’s been tearing away at me most.

There were about 15 minutes left until my session was over, and I was pretty thankful. That’s when he took his hand off of the back of my chair and moved it down to my thigh. For 15 minutes, I had to sit there with him caressing my inner thigh. 

When I was time for me to leave, you’d better believe that I booked it (no pun intended). Not before he gave me an unwanted hug, though.

I haven’t had a private-tutoring session with him since, or even gone back to tutoring. Even now, in class, he calls on me excessively and gets WAY too touchy. My classmates have noticed, but I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone what happened. 

I feel so disgusting. The only reason I’m writing this here is because I’ve been holding this in for months and I can’t tell anyone I know personally.

I don’t want to fail his class and I’m afraid that he’ll sabotage my grade if I try and say anything.

I don’t know if I should switch schools or not.",09Aug2018,1
431,"I’ve been doing a lot of research online about a sleep disorder called DSPD (delayed sleep phase disorder) and I show close to all the symptoms, e.g consistently having inabilities to fall asleep and wake up at a desired time, usually resulting in family members needing to take big measures to wake you up ( I usually sleep at around 5-7 am, and wake up at around 3), generally having no other sleep problems, fatigue and tiredness throughout the day, etc. This isn’t really a big problem during vacation or the weekends, but it becomes an issue when I need to wake up for school. I uncontrollably sleep very late, usually around 1 am, and wake up feeling unenergized and unrestored. I tried all the sleep audios online and hacks but none of them worked.

434,"I filed my taxes in January. I’m 19, so it was my first time filing taxes. I thought I did everything correctly because I got my state tax return quickly. However, in March, I got a letter from the IRS saying they are investigating my return and that I don’t need to do anything. May comes along, I get another letter in the mail saying that if I don’t get my return within 60 days to call them. 60 days go by, I call them and they simply tell me it’s still being investigated and there is nothing I can do. 

Now, its August. I got a letter in the mail today saying, I need to send in certain documents because they think some things were wrong on my tax return. They want me to send in copies of pay stubs, letters from my previous employers(WHO i am not on good terms with and do not want to be contacting them, also they’re 3,000 miles away) and more shit. 

I’m honestly so frustrated and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the money to go to an IRS office. If my state taxes were filed fine then why aren’t my federal???

436,"I'm 35 - I don't have the things I'm supposed to have: partner, children, job/career, home, achievements, etc. so I feel far behind everyone else my age and like I'm too far behind to catch up. I think it's really hard to move on to he next phase of life when I don't have what I'm 'supposed' to have at my age - I know we don't have to adhere to social norms but these are things I want for myself. I'm experiencing a bit of an existential crisis too because it seems once you turn thirty you're seen as less important and I'm struggling to see my value/place as a 35 year old woman without a career or children.  


I missed out on a lot in my teens/twenties like being a student (no appropriate support to get me into higher education and not sure I could have afforded it either) or partying and travelling (I've been homeless and unemployed), so I think there's that element in here too. No one gets the life they wanted, but I feel other people have had better opportunities to at least try or have had more options to find their alternative versions of happy, but I'm not happy in my life at all.   


I'm the sort of person who gets annoyed when something isn't perfect, who'll throw it away and start again...but you can't do that with life, you're stuck with what you have and may struggle to change. Even just acknowledging my age causes a horrible pang of pain deep inside me and I've really got to fight to avoid dwelling on it or I end-up suicidal.

437,"I had to make a new account for this because I'm ashamed and need the anonymity.

I met a guy who was significantly older than me. This was well over a year ago. I crushed on him really hard, and he reciprocated in small ways, but nothing happened for about 5 months because we met in a professional environment. I thought he was single during this entire time, and by the time we began to speak outside of this environment, I already had really heavy feelings for him.

I had never been in a relationship before this, never kissed anyone, dated, confessed to liking someone, nothing like that. Shortly after we started speaking more casually, he told me he had a girlfriend. We agreed to just be friends. We started hanging out as friends, and things gradually progressed. We began to be more than friends, and develop deep feelings for one another.

I'm not at all proud of it, but it became an affair situation. I was the other girl/woman. It was made marginally easier for me to push thoughts to the back of my head because he told me that their relationship was very unhealthy, even broken, that they had major problems and she made it difficult for him to end things. They repeatedly took ""breaks"". He told me he was going to end things with her, all on his own, and he said he promised things would be different by the beginning of this year. That time passed, and then he told me he wasn't ready to do it. We had a really lengthy conversation, and I understood, and told him I would wait for him. I was in love and naive and given him basically all my firsts.

But since then, it all got too much for me to handle emotionally. Even though he really is extremely sweet to me in every way, I would start crying when we were just hanging out, feeling a mix of guilt and like I wasn't good enough for him. I started to get depressed and insecure. Then, I left town for a couple months for my education/work. He encouraged me to do this for my own growth.

It was really good for me. I started to regain my confidence, I started to make lots of friendships, and I started to open up to the idea that I deserved to be in a relationship where I didn't feel like a back-up plan.

I'm back in town now, and unexpectedly, things are completely different. He's always been very sweet to me, and we've always had a very understanding and healthy (aside from the third party context) relationship... but he's suddenly acting so much more devoted and loving to me. He told me he needs time to tell me all the details, since I guess he is still processing it, but he's no longer with this girlfriend of several years, and has been making all these future plans with me. We aren't officially a thing yet, which I appreciate, because he's been showing me complete seriousness and wanting to progress slowly and comfortably for the both of us. He's always doted over me and made me feel adored but it's at an extreme now. Basically all I could have wanted is now happening. This is where we're currently at.

I don't know why, but I feel confused emotionally. I think that being ""the other woman"" for so long has made me scared at the idea of having a real relationship with him or anyone. I don't feel like I'm good for it, and I almost don't know how to act. I still have residual guilt and shame for the entire situation. We are more affectionate with one another, intimate, etc than ever, and I feel really happy when I'm with him, but every time I'm not, I feel strange. I feel like I had JUST given up hope and accepted that this wouldn't ever happen, and now that it is, I don't know how to fully receive or accept it. I have been passive for a long time and allowed things to happen, and now this is too.

I don't know what I need here, but any advice or guidance at all would be appreciated. I have been focusing on myself for a while, which is what I probably would tell anyone else with my situation, but it doesn't seem to help me feel any less confused about this situation.",09Aug2018,1

He grabbed a bunch of shit, knives and hammers and stuff, and brought it all back to the bedroom where we were having a ""chat"" with Ryan. 







Noah interrupted and started telling Ryan that his entire life is over, everything he has is gone now, no one can love him now, even his family will hate him and be ashamed to share his blood. He told Noah the best thing he can do is commit suicide now. We were mostly really weirded out but the situation was so tense that we didn't really pay a lot of attention to it. Ryan kept saying he wouldn't and kept begging us not to tell, Noah kept telling him he needs to commit suicide and he'll give him the razor to kill himself with. Then Noah had a couple of the guys hold Ryan down by the arms and legs. I'll never forget this, he said, ""Here is what we'll do. We're going to use this pearing knife to cut the skin off his feet and hands, and then we're going to pour this entire container of salt on them."" We were all like what the fuck, we need to call the police, and Noah was like, ""We need to take advantage of this opportunity. When will we have another chance?"" We were all like wtf do you mean and he said that child molesters deserve the utmost suffering, so let's give it to him. I'll admit, I hate pedophiles and I hope they suffer horribly, but something about making it real just made me jump out of my skin. He had convinced some of the other guys, Ryan was screaming and crying and Noah was just hanging over him, grinning ear to ear, with a knife and a hammer, saying he was going to smash each one of his finger tips first before he cut the skin off his face hands and feet. Honestly it was bloodcurdling, my whole life I'd never seen Noah be like that, ever, I couldn't believe it was him, and more than half of us were going along with it, saying Ryan deserved it. I screamed that I was calling the cops and Noah looked up at me and said, ""Don't."" with the creepiest stare. I said we have to, Noah kept saying if I do that then it'll ruin everything, I called the cops anyway. Noah just yelled ""We won't get this chance again!!"" I had to leave the room and stay out with the friend we had protecting the girl. They said after than when I left Noah went beserk and tried to strangle him and tried to take his pants off, maybe to stab him there who knows, and kept telling him he'll get raped in prison. They said it took every person in the room to keep him off Ryan and even then he broke free multiple times and tried to bite his face and neck. I'm glad I wasn't there.









The cops came, they took Ryan and called someone else for the  girl, and they had to make sure that none of us took part in it, etc etc. They were really suspicious of us but apparently the girl said it was just Ryan and that we discovered him. 






Anyway that happened less than a week ago, it's been tough for all of us. I haven't talked to Noah. That dude seriously is my best friend, we've been through shit together, and I still can't wrap my head around it. It also creeps me out that so many of us were willing to let him fuckin torture him. I totally get it, but regardless if he's a pedophile, you're still doing that to a human being. I feel like I can't talk about it enough, I can't get it out of me.





I feel like I should do something about Noah but I don't know what to do.",09Aug2018,1
