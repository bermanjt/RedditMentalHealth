0,"I have this friend. Let’s call her Isabel. I hate her so much. She’s that annoying perfect person everyone knows. 

Isabel goes to my school and we became “best friends” but honestly I stuck with her because she’s popular, smart and rich. 

Now her parents offer to pay for her plastic surgery and she said yes. And she’s going to Korea during winter break for it. It’s not fair!! I’m obsessed with kpop why can’t she let me go too? She doesn’t even care about Korea she doesn’t deserve to go. 

I hate how everyone loves her too. She’s “sooooo nice”  and she’s “sooooo funny” when she tries to be sarcastic. 

She has literally everything and spoiled and she blows it off as if it’s nothing. She wears a $3000 necklace to school and when I point it out, she was like “really? I had no idea it’s worth that much”. She even got a Mercedes because she learned how to drive like wtf? And when she brings up how she wants a baby grand piano, her parents buy her one!!!! 

And she dresses up like a princess during her birthday party. Legit no one has dress codes at their birthday party but she imposed a dress code on us. She even wears a fucking crown and shit. And surprise surprise she gets Dior and Hermès for her birthday present. Then she whines about not having clothes like Abercrombie because she wants to be “normal”. She’s an entitled bitch at times. 

And what’s worse is that I work harder than her but she still has a better gpa and ACT score than me. She’s always top 1 in my class but all I see on her Instagram story is partying ALWAYS. I bet her parents bribe the teachers to give her an A. When people ask her about her grades or homework, she denies having good grades and shit. I’m sooooo done with her. 

Should I drop that snake?!?! ",25Aug2018,0
1,"My friends a guy and was joking around and I texted him I felt disrespected when he said that. I said “Hey I felt like you were disrespectful when you said I needed to pay for gas and other stuff. I know you're joking around, but if I tell you something personal about someone being mean to me I find it insensitive and rude when you say something mean” and I said girls can get killed for saying no or rejecting a guy.

3,"I live with some a friend in an apartment, but my other roommate who i'm kind of friends with of them failed out and has to stay until the of the semester. The only problem is she didn't bring a car and got a job way out in town and expects me to drive them all the time to and from without running it by me. 


She mainly works night shifts that either end really late or around 7pm - 9pm I have my own schedule, and early morning classes. I can't stay up all night waiting for her. I can't want to keep forcing myself to fit her work schedule with my classes and clubs. Would I be a dick if I stopped driving her I'm at a loss.

8,"I have two coworkers who are married. The woman had a kid from a previous marriage. They never planned on having any other kids. Well, the woman's daughter died and left her with their 2yo grandson. I am not 100% clear on all the details but the grandson is a bit delayed because of his mother's drug abuse.

The husband is super stressed and not happy about this (he never wanted kids). They occasionally get another co-worker to babysit him on weekends.

I've only been working here for a year. I talk to the husband probably 2-3 times a week. Just work stuff that take a couple minutes. I rarely see or talk to the wife (she is in another department).

10,"I figure this is a bit of a stupid question, but it has been starting to bother me. Am I actually overreacting and what can I do to improve my situation?

Several years ago, I worked somewhere where I knew a lot of people. It was my first 'real' job. I made genuinely good friends and a lot of people who would go out of their way to talk to me or to call out to say hi.

Now, there was one person who was higher up than me who actively didn't like me. I worked in his area sometimes, but never did anything to make him dislike me. My clients loved me and they would openly request me. As I found out over time, he would badmouth me behind my back for things that weren't even true. He told me directly that people there didn't like me and they were being nice. I believe this was on more than one occasion and there were pointed looks to me if something was said in my presence.

For some reason, whether it was my frame of mind at the time, my age, general insecurities etc...that really seemed to cut me deep. And for my remaining time (two years?) at the job, I questioned the motives of every person who was nice to me. Even if they'd seek me out across the office, I'd still try to hold myself at arm's length so that they wouldn't HAVE to spend time with me to be nice. In any group situation, I'd try to stay on the outer so that I didn't force myself on anyone.

I went travelling and then returned 6 months later only to hear that people were so glad to see me again and making times to catch up. While I'd been away, I'd had people asking my close friends at work how I was going and what I was up to and hoping that I was doing well. I started, for the first time, to realise that maybe they weren't just being nice people and they actually did like me.

I took another position at another workplace and found the same thing (from my end). I couldn't put myself out there because I didn't want people to feel like they needed to be nice to me. Again, I held myself at arm's length and, while people wouldn't mind talking to me, given the choice between me and someone else, they would always choose someone else. My department was also actively discouraged from socialising with other departments - the department itself was viewed negatively by other departments and my department spoke poorly about the other departments. I spent a few years there, before moving on (my choice).

I'm now in a new job and it has been actually amazing so far. A few things this week just brought me back to my ridiculous paranoia though and made me realise that I'm not at all over what that person said and that it has actually affected every single interaction that I've had since then. 

In a work group this week, I spent pretty much the whole day on the outer. In group discussions, I had backs turned because they were talking in a small group and I was left on the outside (rectangular table). In one of my few contributions, I was cut short when I was talking. This is the first time I've seen anything like this in this job.

Now, I get that this group has known each other longer, but I've managed to put two and two together and this paranoia has resurfaced that I've been so happy in this new job and that it may all have been fake. 

I think know that it's an overreaction and is likely all in my mind, but I now can't shake that feeling. Normal people wouldn't necessarily see these as slights. The more I think, the more I still distance myself from people because I don't want them to 'have' to talk to me. I'm definitely not rude and am interested in other people's lives...but I don't want to pry (even if what I think is prying is what other people think is normal conversation).

How can one person's comments mess me up so much - even years later? I get that to most people his words would be very minor, but it seems they hit the nerve they were so carefully selected to hit.

Can I get some objective opinions on this? How much of this is my fault? What can I do to improve my situation?",25Aug2018,1
11,"I was staying at my girlfriend's house for dinner, and my patents were originally coming to pick me up at 10pm. They ended up getting stuck in traffic for three hours, so I ended up staying at her's until 1am. We both got kinda horny around midnight. We knew we couldn't have sex, but we ended up getting pretty damn close. After a bit, she was just in a bra and panties as I groped and motorboated her boobs. This wasn't enough for us though. I eventually lifted her bra too look at her boobs. I'd describe them since this has been the best moment in my life so far but I don't want anyone to feel like a pedo. I groped her a little more and flicked her nipples a few times. Her parents were upstairs the whole time, so they didn't know. I had 2 peices of bread with my dinner so I pressed them up on her boobs before eating them. Just before I got a call from my patents saying there were here, I pit her boob in my mouth.

13,"My wife was sideswiped a few weeks ago by a driver who ran a red light and turned onto the intersecting street my wife was driving on. He hit the right front of her vehicle.

The driver was immediately apologetic and admitted to not paying attention. He was forthcoming with info (license, insurance, etc.). She took pictures of the vehicles and his info and they went their ways The damage was minimal but the bumper was damaged enough to need replacing.

After claiming the accident his insurance company has come back to say he claims he had a green light and it was her fault. They told my wife ""she could have done a better job to avoid the accident"".

He didn't take any of her info, he didn't take pictures, and I'm pretty confident he doesn't even know my wife's name. The insurance company is denying it only because he is now lying.

What can we do to further push this with them? Should we pursue a legal battle with the driver? Obviously, going after Flo will get us no where.

16,"Hello! I started a new job as a restaurant host around three weeks ago, with the plans to work for the rest of the summer and continue with a few shifts a week once school starts back up. I have a full academic scholarship but wanted some pocket money this semester. Everyone is super nice (especially for a restaurant) and pay is actually better than described, but the hours are a lot different than what I was told.

Most of the hosts go to the same school as me, and during my interview the manager assured me I’d be out every night no later than ten, which was a major selling factor.


I have been out by ten once, when the restaurant was absolutely dead and there was a second host on. It’s been closer to 11:45 most nights, and the other hosts tell me that’s lucky since they often don’t get off until 1:30. I’ve also only worked slow nights so far. Even though I’m not at all a night owl this has been fine during the summer while I have nothing else to do, but school starts in two weeks and my first classes all start at either 8:30 or 9:30am. Another issue is that now that I’m no longer in training the other hosts have been asking to go home early and trying to get me to pick up their shifts, which I assume will worsen once school starts.

The other host I asked said that the manager made her the same home-before-10 promise, but she doesn’t care as much since all of her classes are much later than mine. 

I really don’t think I’m going to last much longer. Next week reservations are out of control, and I have a feeling that I’m going to be there last 12 every night. My dilemma is whether or not I tell my manager why I’m quitting. The manager who hired me just went on vacation so someone new is in, and I really don’t want it to seem like I’m throwing the one who hired me under the bus (aside from the schedule thing he’s super nice). But at the same time it’s a pretty significant reason, especially if he’s telling everyone he hires that they’ll be going home at a completely different time than they are.

21,"(I put this in another subreddit as well, that might be more suiting.)

Anyways, this might be a long post but to sum it up, I’m halfway done with college and I feel like I haven’t amounted to shit. I don’t even know what I’m doing now nor in the future.

In high school, I was very insecure with myself because I'm different than most people (I'm not ashamed of myself or anything like that) and it pretty much affected everything I did then. I didn’t really make high school worth anything – I didn’t try in academics nor sports, didn’t go to any dances, sporting events, nothing. I never had a girlfriend, but turns out I would’ve needed more than two hands to count how many girls actually liked me. I was just either insecure to ask them out, or I was dumb enough to realize they had liked me. Ever since girls liked me, I feel like I’m becoming more insecure and it really does suck. I basically just went to school and came home and did nothing for 4 years. I wish I would’ve tried harder in school because I feel like I wasted my time not learning anything. Don’t get me wrong, I was an above average student but I just didn’t take academics as serious as I should’ve. I loved sports but didn’t take them seriously, but I sometimes regret it because I have realized my potential, but I feel like it is too late now. I hung out with friends sometimes but on most weekends, I would just stay home and do nothing. I maybe drank once in high school. I was basically a clueless kid in high school, who had no idea that I was. I liked high school but didn’t love it. I regret so much and it sometimes still haunts me to this day.

Before I knew it, senior year was almost over. This meant college decision time. When I decided which college to go to, I wasn’t really confident in my decision – I just picked it because it was a good university. I didn’t exactly know what I wanted to study or pursue. Before college, I told myself I was going to change my ways and be completely open-minded, make a ton of friends, party hard, but no. During my first semester, I made quite a lot of friends and they all liked to go out and drink, but I rarely went out. I stayed in most weekends and just watched Netflix or listened to music and repeated. It was like high school all over again. After my first semester there, I realized it wasn’t the college for me. Sometimes to this day, I feel like I didn’t think hard enough and sometimes regret transferring. I’m now at a much different university and it still feels like I’m not amounting to shit. I am happier here though. But, I only have a few friends here and rarely go out. I’m not saying partying is the way to go about having a good time and making friends, but it makes me so much more confidant. But, I feel like I have nobody to go out with. I suck at striking up conversations because I can be very awkward at times. I have no idea what I want to major in and time is running out. I feel like I’m just going to classes that I’m not really interested in. I’m almost 20 but I feel like I have the mental maturity of my same 14 year old self. It almost feels like I still belong in high school, insecure and not knowing what I want to do. It really sucks seeing people living their best lives, or even seeing people on Snapchat having a good time, and here I am in college insecure as fuck, not doing jack shit nor knowing what I want to do. I’m going to be graduating soon, feeling like a 14 year old. It sucks. Each and very year, I keep regretting things.

I know it’s mostly my fault for not trying nor putting in the effort, but it can be hard to a lot of times. I might even be overreacting, but I thought I’d share what I feel sometimes.

Any advice would be appreciated.",25Aug2018,1
22,"Hi. My mother just went through a procedure to remove a cancerous tumor (Granular Vulva) and they found and removed a second tumor which is currently in for biopsy.

They took a portion of my mother and she is understandably upset. She hasn't been home for more than a few hours and I've done everything for her I can so far to make sure she is comfortable and clean.

She's so strong... I couldn't process it before (I'm 31, she is 52). She has been through various surgeries, fibro, bipolar, botched breast reduction, chronic migraines, etc... 

Story aside, this is a rare and aggressive cancer. I am confident they got it all (procedure demands wide excision) but she of course is terrified. 

What can I do, besides be there and listen and show positivity and empathy for her, to help her feel more at ease so she can relax? Anything I can read to her or show her? Any uplifting or strong words I can share with her... I'm not good at emotions. Nearly passed out from my own anxiety helping her but I pulled through my demon and put it aside...

I blame that for partially why I'm so unhappy most of the time and why I feel I've been conditioned for my suicidal tendencies. they did it purely to make life easier for themselves and to save money. I feel no worth in life living only for myself even if i do get a decent job, but I feel emotionally crippled and unable to make close connections. 
2. My family put my in jail for breaking a door. My reaction was to 24 years of abuse and them saying I deserved it as a kid when I had just about to give them a second chance.

I tried to keep the relationship together, basically begging my girlfriend not to give my family this much control. She stayed but it remained shaky the entire time until we broke up recently.

27,"This might be a very common post to make, but it’s something I’m really struggling with at the moment and I need to put it in words. I’ll try to keep it somewhat short but the backstory feels necessary-

Basically, I started college in August last year. I am naturally a very outgoing and extroverted person so I didn’t have a lot of trouble finding friends. I made a lot of really close friends within the first couple of weeks of school and I was so happy. We did everything together and I felt as if I had finally found my “group”. However, During the last month of my spring semester, I was beginning to be excluded a little by some of my friend group. I also had a lot of family problems going on and a ton of stress from school. This  resulted in me becoming very depressed. Long story short, me and my best friend ( who is bipolar btw) got into a huge fight because she thought I was mad at her, but too immature to tell her what was wrong, even though I was just going through a lot. Most of my friend group was genuinely too scared of her to disagree with what she does, so a lot of them began to avoid hanging out with me because they didn’t want to make her mad, even though they all know she’s crazy. It made my stress and depression even worse, but luckily at that point I still had a couple of close friends who stuck by me and were there for me though the end of the school year. 

Fast forward to this semester- I am roommates with four people I don’t know and who aren’t around much, but my two best friends, who were there for me the previous semester, are roommates in a different dorm. I didn’t mind this too much at first, but they make little to no effort to see me or hang out even though I’ve tried several times. Today, one of them asked me if I wanted to go to a party with them and I said yes, assuming that we would all be going together like we always did. She gave me a time that the party was starting and I was getting ready when I called her to ask where we should meet up before we left. She didn’t pick up, which normal for her, so I didn’t think much of it until I looked out my bedroom window and saw her and our other friends walking to the Uber to leave. It been a few hours now and she still hasn’t asked me where I am or if I’m coming. 

It’s made me very insecure and I’m constantly terrified that I’m being clingy, annoying, or maybe boring. I was scared to call my friend earlier to get details about tonight because I was worried I was being annoying and now I feel like my insecurities are confirmed. She knew I wanted to go, she new I called, but despite that she still left without me. It’s hard to explain this to strangers online, but I have honestly never felt more hurt and lonely in my life. Everyone has a closer friend or someone they’d choose over me and I have no one to turn to. I’m left sitting in my dorm room, alone, feeling like no one cares that I’m not there or misses me. It’s this awful sinking feeling in my chest and anxiety I can’t stand.  I might’ve come to the realization that I don’t actually have any friends here and I’m just not sure what to do with myself now. ",25Aug2018,1
28,"Hi there. I'd appreciate your advice in helping me craft a long-overdue apology to be sent to my first love, ""Angela."" Backstory: we were a part of a love triangle with ""Carrie"" for the majority of 2013-2014. The three of us were 16-17 at the time. Regardless of who I was or wasn't seeing at the time, I had both of these girls invested in me at the same time, and neither of them were being loved fairly. Of the five times someone was broken up with, I was always the one to do it; both of them put me before their own best interest. In 2015 the triangle was dead and I've since made peace with Carrie.

I've acquired a sort of spirituality in recent years and much of that comes from how influential 2013-2014 was. These years and girls pulled me into adulthood and I find a lot of beauty in the mistakes we made and the lessons I've learned since. For a long time afterward I felt guilt for how much pain our situation caused these girls.

Since 2016 I've planned to lay it all out in a memoir in a way which best meets everyone's needs, though that's a topic for another thread. Last month Angela called me for the first time in 3 years to angrily express discontent with how I'd been planning the to-be-released memoir. This helped me realize that publishing a memoir is a very roundabout way to apologize, and I should send an apology letter first.

A few things are tripping me up in writing it. 

First, I don't believe that my actions and behaviors went against my ethics (usually grounds for an apology), especially because I only did what I consciously thought was best for everyone, though I know my actions and behaviors were ineffective in practice. I was horrible at interpersonal communication, empathy, conflict resolution, and healthy relationship dynamics. We were 16 and new to mentally-emotionally intense situations; naturally, we were immature and unwise to participate in this hurtful love triangle for so long.

Second, if these girls agreed to be in love me while I couldn't promise either of them the world, is their 16-year-old consent valid enough to say that I did nothing wrong? [NOTE: I'm not specifically referring to sexual consent here because that was always given.] I'm not so against having **done** something wrong, but I'm more so having trouble piecing together the words without framing myself for something I believed to be ethically sound (but practically hurtful). The actions which did cause pain fit within my ethics at the time, i.e. initially communicating that I had a chemical friendship with Carrie while dating with Angela, or breaking up with Angela to be free, or trying to maintain a healthy rapport with Angela even after breaking up. These things were certainly hurtful and horribly executed, but were they ""wrong""?

Third, in my head it often feels like I'm apologizing for how Angela felt in response to my actions, and not for things that I did. Friends have said that statements such as ""I'm sorry for how you felt when xyz"" invalidate how they felt because they didn't have a choice to react that way, and it sounds like I'm putting blame on them. I want to express sentiment for the amount of pain Angela went through, but this advice makes it seem futile and unwanted in the first place.

In considering these things I feel like the following statements cover my bases:

&gt; Angela, I cannot take the blame for the pain everyone endured, but I will take responsibility. I believe my behavior was ethical but in practicality and practice it was ineffective and hurtful.

Are 'blame' and 'responsibility' too close in meaning here? This is my only chance to create an apology which is effective and cathartic for her, and which doesn't subject me to more blame than I deserve. Do you have any suggestions?",25Aug2018,1

36,"Hi there. I'd appreciate your advice in helping me craft a long-overdue apology to be sent to my first love, ""Angela."" Backstory: we were a part of a love triangle with ""Carrie"" for the majority of 2013-2014. The three of us were 16-17 at the time. Regardless of who I was or wasn't seeing at the time, I had both of these girls invested in me at the same time, and neither of them were being loved fairly. Of the five times someone was broken up with, I was always the one to do it; both of them put me before their own best interest. I was always the one in power because they put me in power. In 2015 the triangle was dead and I've since made peace with Carrie.

I've acquired a sort of spirituality in recent years and much of that comes from how influential 2013-2014 was. These years and girls pulled me into adulthood and I find a lot of beauty in the mistakes we made and the lessons I've learned since. For a long time afterward I felt guilt for how much pain our situation caused these girls.

Since 2016 I've planned to lay it all out in a memoir in a way which best meets everyone's needs, though that's a topic for another thread. Last month Angela called me for the first time in 3 years to angrily express discontent with how I'd been planning the to-be-released memoir. This helped me realize that publishing a memoir is a very roundabout way to apologize, and I should send an apology letter first.

A few things are tripping me up in writing it. 

First, I don't believe that my actions and behaviors went against my ethics (usually grounds for an apology), especially because I only did what I consciously thought was best for everyone, though I know my actions and behaviors were very ineffective in practice. I was horrible at interpersonal communication, empathy, conflict resolution, and healthy relationship dynamics. We were 16 and new to mentally-emotionally intense situations; naturally, we were immature and unwise to participate in this hurtful love triangle for so long.

Second, if these girls agreed to love me while I couldn't promise either of them the world, is their 16-year-old consent valid enough to say that I did nothing wrong? [NOTE: I'm not specifically referring to sexual consent here because that was always given.] I'm not so against having ***done*** something wrong, but I'm more so having trouble piecing together the words without framing myself for something I believed to be ethically sound (but practically hurtful).

​

but for me, my dad was almost the best dad in the world, he did EVERYTHING for me. He worked 3 jobs just to help me pay my tuition, and well a lot of other things too

But my dad passed away recently, my mom doesn't miss him, but I miss him a lot because he did a lot for me. Sometimes I talk about him to my mom, but she hates when I mentions him. So I don't talk about my dad in front of her. BUT she always mentions my dad and always says shit about him. So sometimes I get angry, how do I stop getting angry at her when she talks shit about my dad? Also should I miss my dad? I feel guilty for missing my dad because I know he did very bad things to my mom.

But I recently discovered a pocket of bees living in the ground that have stung me the last few times I mowed, and I'm allergic. Soooo I'm not wanting to mow the lawn anymore. Basically I'm asking if you think I'm obligated to mow the back yard lawn or not.

50,"I hope this is an appropriate way to phrase the question. My life went through lots of changes within the past year and even more so recently and I'm really overwhelmed and depressed and just generally find myself unable to be happy anymore. Everyday there's something that stresses me out or overwhelm me. So today I decided to make a list of main stressors in my life and what they reveal about me not being happy. I'll try to keep it a short read but I thought it was relevant to give you the bigger picture first.

I'm living with my emotionally abusive mother at home because I was broke after graduating from college a few months ago. I had to pick up a job near home because money was drying up so now I'm stuck living here. I'm also trying to get back with my ex after being apart for about a year now, I usually would just leave it but she's worth a try imo. I'm also having doubts about my profession and what I studied for 4 years. So basically every aspect of life, Career, Love life, and Living situation are all so uncertain and it's stressing me out a lot. I've struggled with depression and anxiety before and finally was able to overcome it a few months ago. And I feel like all the stressors are bringing me back to that dark place.

Springing from all those stressors, is the revelation that I seem to need things to work out all the time in life for me to be happy. Which I've always struggled with, but because things were finally looking up after overcoming depression that i was pretty happy in the past 6 months or so. Now that the shit is hitting the fan, I just feel unmotivated and overwhelmed waking up everyday not wanting to try at all and not seeing myself loving myself or being happy at all.

So I'm wondering, what advice or tips would you guys have to be happy or just simply not overwhelmed or depressed even when life is not working out at all? How do you not get overwhelmed and unmotivated when nothing seems to be working out? How do you love yourself and embrace the uncertainty, without having the things, or people, or accomplishing the goals that you had in mind? I know there seem to be be more than one question but I think they all fall under the general category of ""how to remain positive and happy even when nothing is working out in life""? Thanks in advance.

51,"I don't know how to structure a post like this, so I'm just going to start by describing my life. I'm sorry it's so long, no tl;dr here.

I am over 18 years old living in the US in the same house my entire life. I live in the smallest room of the basement. I only have room for my computer desk, bed, and clothes. My family does not help me feel loved. I have no irl friends and have not had an irl friend since 10th grade.  I have never worked a job. I have been actively trying to get one for over 2 years now and I only got one interview with no follow up, it feels impossible. I often get irrationally grumpy for small reasons or no reason at all and my mind stays in that mood for hours, but I don't lash out. My ""online-family"" often buys me the games that they get so I don't get left out, they care about me that much.

I could not finish high school and had to get a GED after I had failed 10th grade for the second time. In middle school I had repeated sicknesses unrelated to my weight and nearly died from them but I am fine and it hasn't effected me physically since, but those sicknesses caused me to gain little to no information from middle school. I often feel like it is my fault for failing every class and stressing my teachers so much. I cannot do much math past basic math but I believe my writing is good and my understanding of science is average. I don't feel dumb, I feel like a knowledgeably average person. 

My only friends are online friends, but they feel like real friends to me. We are like family. I have never had a relationship outside of the internet. I have had multiple suicide attempts but nobody knows about any of them. I am not on the types of speaking terms with any person to discuss things of this topic besides those I have dated online and one of my ""online-family"" friends. I am no longer suicidal and I haven't made an attempt in nearly 3 years and I feel good about the future now. I feel a deep void where someone else should be, I believe I suffer from extreme loneliness. I recently got serious about trying to find an actual serious relationship so that I don't die alone (my biggest fear) and I think it's going well so far but these types of things take a lot of time and I only met the other about three weeks ago. Yes it is another online relationship but I've been able to open up to them and they have been very receptive, respectful, and caring for me and have listened to my issues a lot so I think it might work out.


I am sorry if this breaks rule 3 but I believe it is part of my depression and therefore important to include, I will edit it out if a mod requests it:

My health is terrible but I do not have the willpower to change anything about it. I have been fat my entire life, even in my earliest life memories I have always been the fattest kid. I hate my body and sometimes it doesn't feel like it is mine. I have drank a 2L of soda nearly every day for a year now, maybe more. I think this is a form of self hate. I have noticed that I am less hungry lately and I have only been eating as much as I need instead of eating until I am stuffed, so that's good. Lately I have been ''feeling"" my weight more. When I walk it feels like I have weights strapped to my body that I can't take off, it's miserable but I stop noticing it after a while. My sides ache often and I think it's my kidneys or something. My oldest memory about me acknowledging my bad health was in a class in 8th grade where we tested our BPM and mine was the highest, I didn't tell anyone though.

53,"Two week ago my life completely changed over night. 

I was living in a Drug house with my parents that never took care of me.
Two weeks ago the system took me out of their (during a drug bust) and put me in a detox facility (I was addicted to opiates and was using other substances)

 I got released today and put in a group home.

 I have to go to school in 5 day. I haven't been to school since 5th grade (my parents took me out) I have read alot of novels in my tween years so my literature isn't too horrible  (I stoped reading when I started using drugs) but other than that my education Is of a 5th grader.

 Before my parents took me out i was one of the smartest kids in my class, i honestly loved school and was heartbroken when my parents took me out.


 School starts in less than a week I'm gonna be a sophomore (I'm a 16 year old female)
     Pushing the pressure and fear away I'm  excited for school and am hoping to graduate.

But I am soo overwhelmed and confused.The last 3 years my life has been centered around drugs it was all I lived for.

It first started with weed and alcohol but buy the time I was 14 I was smoking meth less then a year later I was doing pills then eventually heroin. I still have drugs on my mind but at the moment I'm distracted from all the stress (I did sneak weed when I was in the facility).

 I have no one I consider a friend (the closest thing to friends I had was my old dealers) so I have no one for advice or support (I expressed my concerns to my social worker and she said she already helped me all she can) I'll probably never see my parents again (not that I care)

I have been praying for a second chance for years and am so grateful than I finally got a fresh start after almost giving up.

There is way more to my story (and alot more problems i have) but I don't want this to be to long. Any advice on how to catch up in school (and what to expect) or how to stay clean would be appreciated.

 Much thanks

So last year my Live in Girlfriend(Now ex)of 3 years decided that she wanted to go study abroad, the country she wanted to visit was actually a country I was very familiar with and deeply invested in their history, culture, and media. So naturally I was excited, a little jealous and nervous that she got to go. However she reassured me that everything was gonna be fine, and for the first few months, it was. Everything went fine we talked often she sent pictures of the place she been and things she was doing, I would send her cash if she needed it. 
   Then she began making friends and going to clubs and such, it worried me but I tried not to stress it until she ended up in the hospital after falling on her face breaking her glasses and having to spend most of the night standing under an awning during a rainstorm.
But thankfully she came home for winter break shortly thereafter, and things were odd. She was slightly off in our interactions and she would spend all day sleeping and even sleep when I got off work but then spend all night awake and I thought it was just jetlag but it honestly felt like she was avoiding me. Even my mom commented on it(I live with her).I asked her about this and she said it was just jetlag but things did get better shortly after.
    Now it came time for second and final semester abroad, and it was really emotional goodbye for us, even, more so than the first time. this time she didnt stay in a dorm and lived with a friend school
 and as such she needed more money this time around she was still going out and she ended up back in the hospital 2 weeks after going back. This time I made her promise to stop drinking and she agreed, Two weeks later she got drugged at a club, was raped and the friend she was living left her home by herself immediately after the rape to go hang with a mutual friend of theirs. Now this understandably devastated me, and I wanted her to come back immediately but neither of us could afford a ticket and neither could her family. So I did what I could. I researched how to handle rape victims, I talked to her all night even days I had work in the morning(She was scared that I wouldnt want to be with her now that she's been ""Dirtied"", I didnt believe she was).
   But Maybe a month after the rape she just stopped talking to me, and everyone from the states she would respond to messages or calls. But she did hit me up one last time to ask for $250 for rent, didnt even say thank you. now maybe a month and a half passes, after I sent her the rent money bringing us to the end of may, Lost my job in April btw.I found out from a mutual friend ours that she wasnt in trouble or hurt or anything she had been posting on 2 different social medias, I still havent heard from her, I began having nightly panic attacks at this point, I was hurt and freaking out so I checked out her social media(I know bad move) and messaged some of her friends to see what was up, turns out none of them have heard from her for a while either except two, One friend a guy hit her up and told her told to hit me up and the girl said that she was okay and that she was taking care of her. her words made pretty uneasy. but then shortly after my ex finally hit me up and the first thing she did was break up with me. She was extremely cold and bitchy She wouldnt even talk to me about what happened. all she said was that she doesnt love anyone else, but she cant be with anyone. but said that she would talk to me more frequently(We were each others closest friend before we started dating, so I was still worried about her even tho I didnt want to be with  her after all this)then she vanished again after that at the end of May(Funfact my birthday is in the beginning  of June)
   The next time I heard from her was 2-3 weeks and all she sent me was a meme, a fucking meme. She wasnt even trying to explain what happened while she was gone. I was pissed off I told her off, but still got nothing out of her. Next time we speak was the 4th of July I hit her up(dumb I know but it was her favorite holiday and I still had unfinished business) and this time I got her and the phone and she explained to me that she stopped caring about me and anything else really after the rape in her words "" I care about like 1%percent of anything"" and just wanted to pay her rent,She was cheating on me shortly after getting raped, got raped a second time,and then after that became a prostitute and while still taking my money.
She said that her senpai(The girl who made me uneasy earlier in the story) is taking care of her and that she be enough to put me at ease, So clearly she found someone who had more money than I did and could support her lifestyle and I'm pretty sure their together and that my ex is full of shit.

  that's pretty much it I still dont know how to feel about all this tbh, I'm kinda numb sad or angry most days almost killed myself(Not gonna try again I swear)
I still felt kinda manipulated by her as she made me promise not to tell her family about this stuff or she would never talk to me again. I guess it really doesnt matter. I just dont know how to move on, She was my first girlfriend and ontop of that all this stuff happened in a place that's extremely near and dear to my heart.
Any advice?

60,"This is going to be so complicated but I’ll try to cut it down as much as I can. So I’ve moved 5 times so far this year, out of my foster fathers, then out of my ex’s, then away from uni, then out of my nans, then out of my mothers most recently. Something always seems to go wrong, so I just run. I’m in Melbourne now, four hours from everyone else I know, living at my sisters. Already things are not looking good, a couple nights ago my sister (21f), her bf (35m) and I were drinking and eating edibles, and I was so out of it I didn’t even acknowledge all the weird things her bf was saying to me, like bringing up a childhood trauma, saying he was lucky to have “sisters” living with him, talking about threesomes. As soon as I sobered up I felt and still feel so uncomfortable about it. The next day they could tell I was acting weird, so they offered me oxy! This time last year at my foster parents I was literally addicted OxyContin, I only managed to stop because my ex moved me into his house away from my access to it. I don’t think living here is going to work but I’m running out of places to run to. My ex and I are friends and still talk, and he offered to get a place in our hometown and we could be roommates, he’d pay the bond and the rent until I can pay as well. Is this just another mistake, or is it a good idea? Should I just try things out here at my sisters or do I need to get out?",25Aug2018,2
61,"My ex and I are both 19. We were together for three years. We also have a son together, who turns four months on the 10th.

It started out like typical puppy love and teenagers and slowly morphed into me not being allowed to have friends or even see my family. I couldn’t hold a job because he would accuse me of cheating with my coworkers and I just didn’t want to fight so I’d quit.

Three days ago he finally left after I made it known to his other girlfriend that I was in the picture. She didn’t know about our son or that he was living with me. She also didn’t know I paid every bill he had. 

I didn’t know that he was cheating on me. I didn’t find out until after he left that he had been cheating on me with three different people. But I made it known to this one and I guess she called him and cussed him like a dog because he grabbed some of the things and I haven’t seen him since.

 He’s called me once to check up on our son. All other communication has been on my part, just simply letting him know that our son is okay and to see what I need to do with the rest of his stuff.  

I’m writing this post to ask how not to be tempted to take him back.   I know deep down inside that he is not good for me or our son if this is how it’s going to be acting, but my heart says that he can still be the funny guy I met when I was 16.

If anyone can offer ways to stay busy so I don’t think about him or just encouraging advice, I’d very much appreciate it.",25Aug2018,2

64,"I hope this is an appropriate way to phrase the question. My life went through lots of changes within the past year and even more so recently and I'm really overwhelmed and depressed and just generally find myself unable to be happy anymore. Everyday there's something that stresses me out or overwhelm me. So today I decided to make a list of main stressors in my life and what they reveal about me not being happy. I'll try to keep it a short read but I thought it was relevant to give you the bigger picture first.

I'm living with my emotionally abusive mother at home because I was broke after graduating from college a few months ago. I had to pick up a job near home because money was drying up so now I'm stuck living here. I'm also trying to get back with my ex after being apart for about a year now, I usually would just leave it but she's worth a try imo. I'm also having doubts about my profession and what I studied for 4 years. So basically every aspect of life, Career, Love life, and Living situation are all so uncertain and it's stressing me out a lot. I've struggled with depression and anxiety before and finally was able to overcome it a few months ago. And I feel like all the stressors are bringing me back to that dark place.

Springing from all those stressors, is the revelation that I seem to need things to work out all the time in life for me to be happy. Which I've always struggled with, but because things were finally looking up after overcoming depression that i was pretty happy in the past 6 months or so. Now that the shit is hitting the fan, I just feel unmotivated and overwhelmed waking up everyday not wanting to try at all and not seeing myself loving myself or being happy at all.

So I'm wondering, what advice or tips would you guys have to be happy or just simply not overwhelmed or depressed even when life is not working out at all? How do you not get overwhelmed and unmotivated when nothing seems to be working out? How do you love yourself and embrace the uncertainty, without having the things, or people, or accomplishing the goals that you had in mind? I know there seem to be be more than one question but I think they all fall under the general category of ""how to remain positive and happy even when nothing is working out in life""? Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Nothing is working out for me right now. Recent grad out of college with everything being so uncertain and daunting, how do I keep my head up and get motivated and stay positive without knowing how things will work out?",25Aug2018,3
65,"Basically the title. I found out today that my grandmother is dying, and will be gone soon. They don't know when; just that I'm to prepare myself. I also found out today that the man who raped me as a child will be attending the funeral. I found this out from my mother. I asked if they could simply tell him not to come, but was told that I need to ""be an adult"" and ""deal with it"". I need to ""grow up"" and just ""be civil"" because I ""don't have to talk to him"". I am incredibly distraught about this. There were issues in my childhood related to this (my parents did not protect me from this man even after they knew what happened) and I do not know how to cope with this.

I was very close to my grandmother. She practically raised me. I am heartbroken and grief-stricken at this impending loss, but I am terrified of running into this man (on top of the spouse of an estranged cousin that I also have unrelated issues with). What do I do? My parents are furious with me for ""being unnecessarily dramatic"" and are accusing me of attention seeking at my grandmother's funeral. I was told that because she's his grandmother too I have no right to ask them to get involved, and they ""can't control"" the situation or other people. I was told to stop being selfish and to just deal with him ""for one day"". I feel trapped and I don't know what to do. I want to go to say goodbye to my grandmother, but I don't want to run into my childhood rapist. I don't know how to reconcile these positions.

68,"Recently my ex broke up with me because he wasn't romantically in love anymore. Were still trying to stay friends. We had been together for five years. He instantly latched on to another girl but there not officially dating. But he's defiantly into her major. So I don't really feel like I'm condoning cheating but it also feels a little wrong. But ever since the breakup hes been way more sexually interested in me. He'll come over to chat and if alcohol is involved at all were defiantly having sex. I think he's trying to stop doing it but lo and behold it keeps happening.

Now the problem here is I was and still am in love with him. I enjoy having sex with him separately from being romantically in love just because he knows what I like and how I like it. I think that's why he keeps letting it happen too. It's easy and fun as hell.

But then he'll say stuff like ""I wish I could have stayed in love with you"" and ""I'm sorry I couldn't make you happy"" stuff like that and it honestly confuses the fuck out of me. I really don't know what to do or how to feel. I'm heart broken over the whole thing but every time we have sex it all gets washed away and broken down a little more. 

Honestly I would love to have him back but I would never stand in the way of him being happy. We all deserve happiness. I guess I'm just looking for general thoughts and advice because I have no fucking clue whats going through his head no matter how many times I ask for clarity. I feel like I'm just along for the ride to be honest.

This makes me furious and my emotions just take control of me. I pretty much have a discussion with her every day she does this. These are where some of our arguments come from.


In our heated arguments, I sometimes swear and say stuff I shouldn't, and when it ends, I talk trash behind her back to myself, all of which I always end up regretting. I say to myself in my head ""I'll be a better person, I can be better than this"", but in the next day or even in the next few hours, It's the same rollercoaster all over again.

I’m a 14 year old girl who plays with a group of guys. We’ve been playing together for like a year and a half. We’ve become great friends, we hang out, go to movies, swimming, play sports, ice skating, birthday parties. There are two of them I’m very close to we talk all the time but with one of them J it’s unpredictable. Sometimes he’s like super into talking and hanging out and then all of a sudden he’s only talking to the other guys and doesn’t acknowledge me. It’s crazy I consider him and the other guy K my great friends. Just an example when summer started we were playing sports like 3 times a week and J was calling me wanting to go to the movies and swimming every other day. I was busy with cheer so I told them I could only do weekends and they were cool with it. Again we talked and texted constantly J both of them would try to hang out as much as possible but then it sorta fizzled out mid summer cuz they had things to do too, stuff with their parents and hanging out with their school friends. But then all of a sudden J wouldn’t acknowledge me when we hung out to play sports only the other guys. It’s been like a month of this. It’s so weird. I remember he did this back in April for no reason, I just ignored it and talked to the other guys and after like two weeks he started being normal and we went back to talking all the time, I never asked what was up. But now that I see it might be a pattern I don’t know what I should do about it. He called me today to ask if I was going to go play and when I said no he said ok bye and hung up wth. He hasn’t called me in a month. And the last time he texted was the begging of July to tell me he had won a game. I really don’t know if I should ignore him as long as he’s acting dumb or call him out but I don’t wanna seem like I’m being weird. I don’t know.

86,"Hey r/advice :)

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have a friend who i genuinely want to cut contact with after witnessing a few things for the past few days however I tend to be abit too insensitive when trying to get my point across, however I myself can't find a different way to express myself, I can't sugarcoat anything.

This person is very delicate emotionally, she's 23 yet she has the maturity of a 14 year old, behaves and deals with arguments/situations exactly the way a high-school student would deal with things and she's extremely naive, to the point where I actually find it very vomit-inducing. You could give this person clear cut evidence and she'd ignore it and take the impact of each situation and then bitch about it.. **EVERY SINGLE TIME.**  
She claims to have depression however she told me she never had it diagnosed and I only believe people have depression when they have been professionally diagnosed by a doctor/psychiatrist because the things she feels and the reasons she gives doesn't really correlate with depression and are 5% of the things that an actual genuine depressed person feels on a day to day basis, I know this because I myself have recently been diagnosed for depression and anxiety.  I told her to get herself diagnosed and seek professional help but she says there's no need, so pretty much she doesn't give a fuck about her health.  


I told her that I have personal things that I need to handle, my ex and I broke up a few months ago however we stayed very close and she decided to fuck off out of the blue and blocked me on everything, giving me very shady and very weird reasons that don't sound valid at all but that's not what I need to handle, it barely counts as anything.. I mean it stings like a bitch and I do feel sad whenever something reminds me of her but I know at the end of the day the things I genuinely have to handle are more important. 

Anyways, this person started calling me boring because apparently i stay at home every single day and don't come out and see her and I told her that I have personal business to take care of and then she decides to make a remark about the situation with my ex and told me to **get over it.** I said to her that I never stated that I had a problem, I only needed to solve some personal business and then I told her that she shouldn't be talking because of her horrid history of mistakes. She basically said that I owe her an explanation and literally tried coercing me to explain my personal business and I said I don't need to tell you shit, I have my own privacy and she should respect that. 

Mind you, I know she's a very selfish person but each time I call her selfish she denies it and says that she isn't. She's a very high maintenance type of a person and frankly she's seriously starting to get on my nerves.  


I don't want to be a cunt towards her but I feel like i'm forced to hence why I'm seeking out advice here.. I feel so suffocated being friends with this person.",25Aug2018,1

Well, now he is having his friends (also minors) do it for him since there isn't a way he can be proved to be masterminding. They've moved passed things that provide evidence such as calls and texts, and are just doing things that can only be submitted to police through word of mouths, there isn't any hard evidence she's still being harassed or stalked but it's happening on a daily basis and she's incapable of maintaining a normal life or moving on with this all going on.

I used to have friends (from 14 till 18) who would cuddle, talk in a huge dog pile, sleep with 8 of us in a bed, brush hair, chat shit ect. It was a mixed gendered group, not sexual. Now I am in University and whilst my flat of 5 (3 boys, 1 girl then myself) are delightful conversation, even a hand on the shoulder was like I'd shocked them with a bolt of lightning. They've expressed that they hate physical contact so I've gone cold turkey 100% to respect their wishes. Not even hugs, no hand shakes or fist bumps, zip, nada, zilch. 

I really want them to be comfortable around me which is why I am really focusing on not touching them in anyway too respect their boundaries. But holy hell... I have to constantly check myself, remind myself not to for example, tap someones shoulder to get them to turn around but rather I should say their name. Small things that are such instinct to me...just leaning against someone. They hate it, and I don't want to invade their space or upset them because that would be so wrong. I don't want to make them sad.

They drink with me, we stay up too dawn chatting, we go to parties, have gotten piercings together, celebrated together, but they hate physical contact. My parents are the same. I know they like me in case that is what you think, they invite me out and knock on my door to hang out and play games or whatever.

This lack of touching anyone is driving me crazy. I lent on my dads shoulder earlier and it was probably the longest minute of contact I've had in ages.

All my past relationships have hated PDA, no holding hands or kissing outside the bedroom.

I just feel so damn touch starved. And because 90% of people (besides when I was in school) are not willing to hug and lie on each other or lean on each other or anything I am going mad. I want to grip someones arm or just anything. 

I don't know what to do...I don't want to cross anyone's boundaries ever, but fantasying about hugging people and shaking their hands is just too desperate. 

Do most people hate physical contact and I'm the weird one? Is there a solution other than find new people and pray they like high fives? Or just any advice would be lovely.

Thanks",25Aug2018,1
91,"Obviously a throwaway account. Also TL;DR at bottom 

I (M) and my best friend (F) are basically an indestructible pair. Since our 6th grade year we’ve been friends and nothing has come between us for those 4-5 years. We both know each other and our families too well and are always watching our for one another. 

Last Thursday was the kickoff game for our high school football team which was an 1 h 30 m drive. I’m on tenor-line and she is one of the 1st flutes. During the ride, she finally made a somewhat move towards me and rested her head on my shoulders and I just went with it. I have never been on a date or been in any kind of relationship mainly because my parents are dicks when it comes to my social life. I didn’t say anything besides offer her to share my earbuds which we normally do on a bus ride anyways and I was seriously caught off guard. 

On the ride back, it was cold as hell and we had to wear our uniforms to stay warm the ride back. The first thing she did when we got moving on the bus is she scooted closer to me for body warmth. Again, I’m not used to anyone besides a brother on a quick car ride to get into my personal space like this. The ride back wasn’t quiet really due to our team losing during overtime from a 20 yard fumble (which I’m still absolutely pissed about). We casually talked on the way back about random stuff and it seemed way more relaxed than I usually feel around my other friends. 

The only thing really stopping me is that I’m in a really bad place mentally and physically. Before school started, I would begin to run scenarios in my head where everyone abandoned me due to my relationships with everyone not “good enough” but I’m scared to tell anyone due to me just being told to “deal with it”. I’m also in a bad spot financially due to me donating a bunch of my money so my family can see my brother graduate from basic training on the other side of the USA (which I also wasn’t able to go to because of the game) so I wouldn’t have money to go out with people or buy myself stuff. Another holdback is my mother is really good friends with her mom which, from what I see out of both of our moms, would be hell on earth trying to get permission to go places. 

I’m sorry for the wall of text but typing this out is like a form of therapy to me. My main fear is just being friend zoned due to us being buddies for way too long. Any advice or philosophical statements about random stuff would be really great. Thanks for going through this if you did.

96,"Probably not the best title.

My mom is one of those people that is on her phone a lot and will make it a priority over what is actually going on.

She is also one of those people that will sometimes just not answer when you talk to her/ask a question.

And she also will a lot of times say something like “ohh”, “mmhmm”, “ok”....little things like that in response when it makes no sense. For example asking a yes or no question and she will answer with “ok”.

And to clarify, she is not always on her phone when this happens. 

I’ve talked to her about this many times and how it hurts my feelings and sometimes makes me very upset. She will not admit to this being wrong and won’t look at herself at all, so there is nothing I can do there.

99,"This is going to be a long post describing the behaviours I’ve witnessed. 

So, this kid is now in his teens. He’s my little brother. Let’s call him ‘Jason.’ 

When Jason was in elementary school— I’d say about fourth to fifth grade— he had some concerning issues that I’ll discuss further down. 

I’ll give some family background if it helps.

We were poor because of the stock market crash, father was out of a job for a long time, and our family life was rather dysfunctional. 

Our mother yelled and screamed at every little thing we did and our father was often absent off at work or a business trip. 
I remember finding discarded alcohol bottles in my father’s room every now and then. 
The bad thing was that when our father was gone (majority of the day), our mother was in high stress and she took it out on us; emotionally and mentally. Rarely, if ever, physically. 

My two older siblings: My brother (‘George’) and my sister (‘Anna’) were more concerned with themselves. 

My older brother had anger issues and would often take it out on my little brother. 
I’m not sure if George has done worse things to Jason because I’ve only seen some abusive incidents. 

One where George threw a metal basket at Jason’s head whilst he was lying down on the couch. 
Another where George cornered Jason back into a wall with a sharp object and tried to get him to say ‘shut up.' 
Most of the time George stayed up in his room and threw explosive temper tantrums at video games. It was always solved with our mother yelling her lungs out at him. 

I’m concerned for both of my brothers, but George’s aggressiveness has lessened and has showed guilt. Jason’s has worsened with no guilt or anything. 

At around age 11/12, I had witnessed him purposely neglecting all of our pets, being harsh (throwing, trapping them in unbreathable containers, holding them down), and chasing after the smaller animals and frightening them to death for fun. 

I had tried to stop him and bring it to the attention of our parents, but they never caught him in the act because he’s a clever little shit and knows he can get away with stuff. 

At school, from friends I had heard that he called people insulting names and scratched at one of his best friends intentionally and repeatedly. This was when he was maybe 9? 

He’s stolen items. I know he has because he returned home with objects that he couldn’t have paid for since we got no allowance. I haven’t caught him very often, so I don’t know how much he has stolen. 
He lied often. His lying skills are lacking at this age. He’s impulsive. 

Skip to middle school. He completely neglects to take care of himself, not giving two shits. He continues to neglect the animals and seems to now be disgusted by them. 
He despises my company and spends all his time in his room doing things or playing video games in the family room and binge eating. 

Meanwhile my mother says disdainful comments about my brother’s weight and eating habits while she’s severely overweight herself.
He has this expressionless face and is unresponsive to punishment given by our mother. He rarely spoke and kept to himself. His grades were borderline failing. Our mother screamed at him. He didn’t care. 

We moved away from our hometown in high school year and got rid of most of the pets. Jason got more secretive and continued to be angered by my presence or any other member of the family.   

He’s very territorial over his room. If someone goes in it (like our mother for example), he seems to know immediately. 
George has barged in there unannounced several times and snooped around. Jason now keeps it locked and has the key.

I can tell that he doesn’t like George and our mother the most. They are quite similar. 

Jason never really liked to talk about school. I rarely saw him in his freshman year and my sophomore year. When he turned 15 and started 10th Grade, I got to see him a bit more.

He had a new group of friends and was acting completely different than what I was used to. He was wild and ‘edgy' and had this mischievous smirk on his face. 
He would grab ahold of them and shove them around or suddenly lunge at them and choke them for about a second or two— just enough to bewilder and shock them. 

I sometimes smell alcohol on his breath. When I drive with him, he drives recklessly. Most of the time I drive for our own safety. 

He’s begun asking concerning questions recently, like: if I would be sad if our parents died or if I loved them.
Some of the steak knives and BBQ lighters have gone missing as well. 
I’ve discovered the remains of poorly hidden black ashes in the backyard near the back porch steps. I think he’s burning things. I’ve....also found toads and lizards with the backs of their necks and bellies slashed open. Their bodies were discarded haphazardly in the backyard. 

I’m afraid that one day he’s going to become a serial killer or end up in a situation where he kills himself or gets taken to prison. 

On our last vacation, Jason got into an unnecessary argument with our mother. My siblings and I sided with him while our parents sided with each other. 
George said that she had failed as a mother, causing her to get extremely upset. George left the apartment for a long time. He later admitted that he felt really guilty and wanted to apologise, which he did.
But Jason...I saw him smile a few times when our mother broke down crying. When our mother had been yelling at him prior to the break down, his face was devoid of all emotion and he stared unblinkingly into our parents’ eyes. He answered in a monotone voice. 
Jason never did apologise and our mother never did either. 

My sister, Jason and I went out by ourselves to regroup and calm down. Jason looked entirely unaffected. 

Antisocial personality disorder? Other personality disorders? Something else? ",25Aug2018,1
100,"One of my earliest memories is being strapped down to a table, trying to rip the bracelets off while screaming and crying for my mother that they weren’t letting in the room. Then they pulled out my front teeth while I was still awake and barely any anesthetic. I had rotten teeth due to my mother not brushing my teeth after breastfeeding, I was about 3 years old. Another one of my earliest memories of doctors is having four nurses holding me down with what felt like all their force because I was scared getting my shots. 

I know, I was probably a “bad” child in their eyes but I was just scared because I wanted my mom with me but they didn’t let her be with me. 

I think after those experiences my mom began to put her foot down and demand that she is in the room with me. Even when I was 16 and had braces she would come to every single appointment to make sure they were treating me right. She’s such a good mom and I’m thankful that even when I’m 19 she comes with me to doctor visits. She’s a stay at home so she doesn’t have much else to do anyway. 

When I was 17 and had to get some cavities filled, I remember leaning back in the chair and feeling so defenseless. I started crying. The dentist was extremely nice and offered me some food and water but I was still utterly terrified of him and the situation. 

Last year, I got this weird tonsil infection. I drove myself to the hospital(18)now and they really fucked me over. The pain I was in was the worst pain of my life, all the tests for mono and strep came back negative but they sent me home with “mono.” I had to go to the ER again because the pain in my throat became so intolerable that I was writhing in pain. They eventually gave me some antibiotics and pain killers and everything was good as new. 

However, since that tonsil infection. I’ve had a hard lump on the right side of my neck. It’s been a year already but I am starting to get scared it might be something worse but I’m too scared to go to the doctor. 

Has anyone else had similar experience? How did you get over your fear of doctors? ",25Aug2018,1
101,"Hi reddit, 

Thank you for your interest in my life. I am already so grateful. :) 
I am in a transition stage at the moment where I don't know what I should do. I have several life goals that I want to achieve that require time, money and focus that would leave out the other goals, which are important to me as well. I am a 26 year old female, from a kind of privileged background, I live in Australia but I am not from a rich family. 

I have recently moved back home with my parents to gain financial and emotional stability after breaking up with my boyfriend and leaving my job where I was miserable. I don't live in an exciting city (it feels more like a town and I've lived here my entire life). I view my living situation as temporary. To be frank, my mum drives me insane and I want to travel or move as quickly as possible. However, not needing to pay rent is enormously beneficial, I love my family and I could see myself saving money and travelling in the future and I could leave my stuff there. 

They are awesome parents but they aren't the kind of parents that know about the world and the adventures in which I wish to undertake. I've gone into life naively and just followed my heart with great enthusiasm without much thought for the future. It has been fun and a learning experience but I have also made mistakes and I feel behind compared to other people my age. I have gained a lot of maturity in my lifetime but I want to know more and your advice would be much appreciated! 

My life dream and purpose I believe is to travel the world as a musician touring and I want to paint, be an artist and also have my own label and be a fashion designer. These may seem like lofty career aspirations to some but for the past ten years I have been surrounding myself with music, musicians, art and fashion and understand these fields in depth. I am skilled creatively and I have a BA in Fine Art too. Without wanting to sound conceited, I think I would be able to contribute some really cool art to the world. Coupled with this belief in myself, I also have a highly motivating fear that if I don't succeed in finding success as an artist, I will never truly be fulfilled. It should be noted that I have battled addiction and feelings of inferiority, anxiety and depression in the past, which had prevented me from getting motivated and stopped me from making money to do all these things properly. I am happy to say I am totally over that stuff now and I am ready to take on the world!

So in order to start making music I have learnt how to play guitar. I practice everyday for at least two hours and I've got a friend who I've known for years who's already a successful musician/ really good musician who believes in me and is helping me. I have been given a lot of excellent equipment to use too. So the music goal is actually getting somewhere, albeit slowly, but it is happening and it's exciting. Music has always been my passion in life and I think since picking up guitar and singing, I won't ever be depressed again.

So I have no money yet. I am broke and receive government help while I look for work. Good news is though, I've had three job interviews this week and all three were successful. 
One job is just a temporary Christmas casual job at a department store (I have accepted the offer for now). The other is at a chemist working in the cosmetics isle which is permanent (my friend helped me get an interview with the manager who seemed to really like me but she hasn't gotten back to me yet), not sure if it's full time though and the third, is for a big hotel as a Guest Service's Agent which won't start for another few weeks and I have a second interview for that job next week. This job would be a serious job and would be full time if I am successful (with the option to be part time).

To make matters confusing, I am also enrolled to study Primary Teaching full time  to start early next year. This would force me to work less but ultimately lead to a higher paid job and it's a big dog career move. (I love working with children and have worked with kids on a casual basis while I've been looking for work.) This degree would take two years (using my BA I already have).
At university again, I wouldn't be able to save and travel much but more concerning is that I might not be able to make music and art which may set me back on the road of making my dreams come true. Also, my thoughts are that I need to capitalize on my good looks and try to  release music while I am still young. 
I also want to travel while I'm young too. However, the degree only takes two years, I work part time while studying, I would get student government help while studying, big money isn't a guarantee in the music business too (prepare for the worst) and it is a step up in the world, I would be a respectable member of society. I could live and work overseas. Also money working as a teacher would fund creative endeavors more effectively than any other job I might get. I might not have as much spare time, though and teaching is stressful af.

The other option is completely devoting myself to music, getting increasingly better while working whatever job I can get. Saving as much as I can and releasing/touring and travelling. That is what some of the other musicians I know do. I would also be avoiding digging myself deeper into student debt.

Does anyone have any advice or life tips? Any working teachers out there who also have a creative side hustle or dream they're working on? Is it just a case of time management? Perhaps I can balance it all: study, work and my dream.

Thank you in advance! :) ",25Aug2018,1

I've been with and living with my GF for about two-and-a-half years now and I didn't realize it was happening at first but my friends and family helped me notice an ongoing pattern of emotional abuse. She has done a lot to move the relationship along uncomfortably fast (when I wasn't in a position where I could afford to say no), manipulated me, made me dependent on her/entrapped me (pretty much forced me to sell my vehicle, cost me my job, undermined my personal projects, etc.), tried to separate me from friends and family, and systematically dismantled my sense of self-worth/self-esteem. I wish I'd noticed it quicker but a lot of anxiety, depression, and related things kind of blinded me to what was going on until it was too late.  
&amp;nbsp;  
All that said, my eyes are open now and I'm working on a way out. I fully intend to leave her as soon as I've saved up enough money for a deposit/first month of rent and a vehicle. I've got a job interview coming up in a few days (which she is *not* happy about) and have a guaranteed job elsewhere if that doesn't work out so things are moving forward, albeit slowly. I'd leave her sooner if I could but I'd lose everything I've worked for over the last few years and would end up homeless. That is *not* an option, especially with my depression issues (I wouldn't last long). So I have to bide my time, work, and save up for the day when it comes.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Now that we have the backstory out of the way, the immediate problem facing me is that I have a high sex drive and I *do not* want to sleep with my GF. Doing so leaves me feeling as if I've just been sexually assaulted. Everything about her disgusts me now, especially now that I've realized what she's been doing.  
I desperately want to have sex with a woman I actually *want* to have sex with again. I want to feel that desire, that excitement, that sweet release... Even it's just a one-off hook up with a willing, random cutie. But I have no idea *when* I'll be able to break this off. I have no idea how long it'll take me to save up enough to leave. 
 
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm trying to wrap my mind around everything and trying desperately to decide how I feel about this train of thought. I've always been very against cheating but now I find myself considering it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Do you folks have any advice?",25Aug2018,2
115,"I got a new job 4 days ago. I’m in love with my job, and I already love it. I’m working in a hospital at customer service.

I am someone that likes to give her best always, no matter what and I’m very happy with my job because it’s in a very important hospital. I want my department to be a really successful one.

Unfortunately I’m not satisfied with my workmates. They aren’t bad people and they haven’t done anything bad against me but I don’t think that they are taking good decisions on their actions and they aren’t compromised as I am.

To tell you a little bit for example, they are always playing and joking between them very loudly, some patients have called for several days asking for some papers, they are using the hospital resources on their behalf and however they want, they hate to answer the phone even if it might be something important, they decide when to serve the patient and those are just some things.

I’m the new there and I don’t know if it would be right for me to go and speak about it with the supervisor or the boss. 

I just want my department to succeed and be the best it can be.  So it’s nothing personal.

As I said I’m deep in love with my job and I want everything to go fine because we are a department and if something happens then I will be part of the problem, even if I haven’t done anything.

Thank you so much! ",25Aug2018,1

Hello everyone,

I have been in a few relationships in the past, but none of them where I have really felt like myself. This is because, I guess like most guys, I get nervous around girls – self conscious, over think – you know. Most of the girls I’ve dated have sort of turned out to be a mess and wear me down, sort of like it’s all been a kind of joke. In addition, the girls I’ve truly wanted to date – ones that could have great compatibility – end up being just out of reach or we don't date because of a real, natural reasons like distance, risking a friendship, etc.. Now I get to watch the one or two of them get married and be gone forever. 

It has been a year since my last relationship which left me hollow and wondering if it was even worth finding someone who was compatible with me. That inspired me to start pursuing a life without women, without marriage – one where my focus is on success in school, work, and my own personal growth. While I think that is still a good focus, I've found that I have a hard time considering a life without a companion. 

Now, I guess I still can’t figure it out. I look like a normal guy, I lift, I take care of myself, and I sometimes say dumb stuff but nothing rude. I want to see how I can make this something that I’m responsible for – something I can work on. I hate being irrationally mad at a whole bloody group of people unjustly, it’s just that these are the feelings I’m left with and I‘m disgusted at myself for it. 

Am I too nice? Am I weak? Do I just need to put the idea of dating away *as best as I can*? What do you think?",25Aug2018,0

118,"It’s hard to put this into words but since a breakdown yesterday in which I just couldn’t stop crying I just couldn’t handle it anymore, I feel like now is as good as any time to try and write this complex manipulative situation I find myself in.
Ever since I was small, my family has moved a lot basically every year of gradeschool was in a different state of the US, meaning I had no lasting relationships. This continued until senior year,(which I spent in another country in Southern Europe). This, paired with a manipulative mother that reminds me everyday that she sacrificed everything to raise me, that without her I would be nothing, and that she could stop paying for me anytime she wanted to. Any choice I made for myself that she didn’t agree with, I would have to change otherwise she would threaten to cut me off financially. My father is not a bad person but he is never home and when it comes to standing up for me, he would rather see his wife happy than me. He thinks I overreact, but he doesn’t know how it feels to be limited to such an extent to where your perceptions of things and your perception of yourself is damaged because of the limitations and the self doubt and self hate that has been instilled by my mother. I’m 19 now, I have been moved to Southern Europe for university studies and any move I make that isn’t to my mother’s liking risks my college education. The jobs I had I was forced to quit before I came here so all I really have is €275. I really want to be college educated and it is a priority for me but I know without the financial support of my parents I know I will not be able to be college educated for a while unless I get a scholarship which I’m not sure how to apply for here, much less without mentioning my parents. I know I need my independence because it’s reached the point where I can’t take my own decisions and my own happiness and personal freedom is being restrained. I virtually have no social life outside of my family, because anyone my mother doesn’t approve of has to go and if they don’t I do. I’m really just so scared and confused as to what to do, I have no support system and no hope that things will get better, I know I need a plan but where do I start and how do I make sure all my priorities are still fulfilled?

119,"This isn't bragging, I hear god damned everything. Every noise in and outside my house, every clank and spangalang in the kitchen at work, and it makes hearing other people talk REALLY hard. Especially because I can hear the other people talking around me.

Recently, I found a job in a kitchen. Not a bad job, but very hard because I get more focused on the noise around me than the people talking to me. I can't use ear plugs cause I need to listen for calls, but it's hard because I'm more focused on the spatula clattering than the actual words being said to me.  


Actually, if we're being honest, I barely hear the words. I'm always more focused on the rhythm of the dishwasher, or the timbre of the grill, or the music out front (we have a performer every night). How do I develop an ear for human voices that take precedence over the sound of.... well... everything else?

122,Hi I’m 16 years old and I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed. In other words I’m dumb all my brothers did amazing in school and I barley passed all my life. But grade 10 was my highlight  never went below 71% but those were just essential classes so the next sem I decided to try going into intro  to precal and I was extremely embarrassed I was lost the speed that they were going at for me was just to fast and every time I asked a question I would just get made fun of because it was apparently simple so I dropped the class because I was just getting clapped in every test and being bullied. Soon going into grade 11 (I’m Canadian so it starts later for me) and I just wanted to ask you guys if the essential classes were good enough for your future or was the more advanced classes necessary thank you for your time and have a good rest of your day/afternoon/night (I’m sorry if I’m terrible at explaining something thing I’ve been told  my writing skills are equivalent to a child writing skills),25Aug2018,1
123,"               Ok so I'm in need of some advice and I feel very stuck. I'm 22 and I dropped out of college when I was 18. At the time one of my childhood friends died and I became very depressed with that on top of other issues. Dropping out hit me very hard because my 2 older brothers didnt even graduate highschool and my parents are extremely hardworking so i wanted them to have something to be proud of. It's also hit hard because my older brother is schizophrenic and he will never get a chance to live his own life, he will be living with my parents indefinitely. I was selfish and squandered my chance that he never had and that was hard to swallow.


               I used to be pretty athletic but have been steadily gaining weight for years. I'm 300 pounds now (about 150 gained since high school) Now about a year ago I first started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. This helped me to cope a little with the addition of anti-depressants. I am a month or 2 away from weight loss surgery so I can finally have my life back. I've had a few jobs in the past but have been unemployed for 2 years. I want to move to a different country in a few years and start over but I don't know how to with no degree no qualifications no money etc. I don't want to burden my parents anymore and I want them to be proud of me. They've really been given a shitty hand in the past decade and I want them to be happy. 


              I just want some advice on how to achieve my goal. I feel like I'll never make it.

124,"I am a soft person with an aggressive exterior (F16). I know i need to grow a thicker skin but i do not know how. I had a few ""best-friends"" in my life but none like my most recent. She had similar views, values and opinions and we both experienced the same things/people from mutual friends. WE were ""friends"" since i was 13 but back then she was really mean, she put me down on things i did and enjoyed to the point were i wanted to die. But the year after my hospitalization we got to *actually* know each other and became close friends. Through this (in my 10th grade year) another one of my friends claimed to be her best-friend and i fought her the title. I regret it. In the summer we were close - so close -  trusted her with my life. Until recently, she found a boy. She ranted to me about how she doesn't want to date him but went i came over, her eyes were glued to the screen. I was not who she was worried about when I was the one at her house, it was him. She still refuses to date him. When the school year started back up (a little while ago) she started acting extremely rude/mean. She started degrading me as a human and stealing my words and phrases. The things i taught her to be between us she shared with her boy. If she didn't want to be friends she could've told me - how shitty of her. I started taking a passive stand, i stopped talking to her, returning her items and moving from her in all ways possible. Its working and i am slowing drifting like i planned.

125,"So as I was growing up during the 2000s, I had been acquainted with the phase “playing hard to get.” From a good friend of mine who would tell me about stuff I need to know to be able to function in society like a normal person, (something I’m not. I’m quite weird, the good weird. Lol I’m just rambling now.) I’ve got to hand it to him, without him I would’ve been an outcast to society. So when I reached adulthood, I met this girl who intrigued me. What drew me in was that she was the opposite of me. She was an extrovert while I was an introvert. She was so popular while I was a loner. She’s light while I was darkness. Since I was an adult, I wasn’t as shy as I was when I was growing up so I didn’t have a problem talking to her. I bumped into her, quite literally at a local coffee shop. 
Thank god she didn’t have a coffee on her or it would’ve slipped on her and burn her and give her a bad impression of me. I grabbed a chair next to a table and she sat next to me and we had a decent chat. 
2 week later, and I’m trying to do my best for her to like me. Compliment her, buy her flowers, be a gentleman. You name it, I done it. Whatever I did it didn’t work. That’s when it hit me. What if she’s playing hard to get? I was going to challenge myself if I was able to actually win the girl over and all, but I was and still am a lazy mofo, so I gave up pursuing her. After a while of not talking or having an interaction with her, it seemed it affected her. She would usually come more often to the coffee shop next by my house and most probably hoping that I’d show up there. Or maybe she just liked the coffee there. 
As I was wondering what to do with this girl, a lesson my old friend taught me came suddenly in. “There are plenty of fish in the ocean.” How could I forgotten this? I reached out to this girl who I suspected liked me since a lot of people told me so, it turned out she did like me lol. So after dating her for like a month, Girl A somehow found out that I was dating a new girl and came out of nowhere confessing that she liked me and she was just playing hard to get just to see my motivation or some bullshit. So should I date her or continue dating the girl I’m seeing now?",25Aug2018,1

128,"Sorry if formatting is off, I’m on my phone. I feel like my psychology teacher is an outstandingly smart guy who lives his life the best that he can, and he’s fantastic with advice. He was definitely my favorite teacher and I could tell that I was his favorite student. It’s really easy for me to talk to him, and I want to be able to talk to someone completely unbiasedly, and I don’t feel like I have anyone who I can talk to like that. We sometimes talking about taboo topics like psychedelic drugs and the benefits, and during our depression/ suicide unit in the class I asked if he would let me be excused to go to the library while he taught the class about it. He asked why but emphasized that I didn’t have to tell him if I didn’t want to. I didn’t go into the details, but I just said that I had just started an antidepressant so the topic was a bit touchy for me. He said he completely understood and didn’t stigmatize depression or antidepressants at all, and he’d let me do whatever made me comfortable. It was an extreme relief because that I was the first time anyone had taken my mental illness seriously. I don’t have medical insurance so I definitely can’t afford therapy. I’m not comfortable talking to my family about it. Half of them are why I am the way I am, and the other half have their own problems. I don’t want to burden them with more things to worry about. There’s also my boyfriend but I sort of sugarcoat things so that he doesn’t worry so much. I want to be more open with him but it’s not something I’m comfortable with. Each day I think that my depression and suicidal tendencies can’t get worse and each day I’m proven wrong. I don’t know what else to do, I’m just really wanting someone who I can be open with who will offer me advice. Do you guys think I should email my psychology teacher?

134,"Recently the company I work for has had some rumors the our facility might be closing down.  Last week I decided that instead of riding it out and waiting to find out the truth that I would begin the job hunt.  Within 12 hours of putting my resume on a popular recruitment website I was contacted and set up with a phone interview that same day.  This all happened on a Friday and the following Monday they followed up and asked to meet Wednesday for a formal interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background on me, I've been in my current position at my company for a little over three years.  This is a skilled trade position and I have no other experience in this field besides the three years at my company.  I have no college degree or journeyman card for this skilled trade.  Most jobs hiring for this position have minimum requirements of at least five years experience, an associates degree, or a journeyman card.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went to the formal interview and within a couple of hours after leaving the interview the recruiter called to tell me that it went very well and the company I interviewed with was working on an offer for me.  This is the second offer I've had for a job in this position but the first job I turned down because the pay was too low.  

&amp;#x200B;

After hearing this offer I went to work the same day and had a meeting with the whole plant stating that the rumors we heard are not true.  The company is not closing down but relocating to a building a couple miles down the road.  We have a couple months before the big move happens.  I've been trying to weigh the pros and cons of taking the new job or staying where I'm at and I'm still on the fence on which choice is the right choice.

I began to develop feelings for him. Over the months though I noticed his responses became less frequent and he often ignores my messages. This really offends me because I can see he’s online and I know he’s seen the message. 

Ive learned from looking for advice that when you’re being ignored like this it’s either due to you being annoying or their interest is no longer there. 

So what do I do? Normally I would just end the relationship but since he’s my tutor I don’t know if I want to end this because it’s a challenging subject for me.

But at the same time now I hate this doubt in my heart. I no longer feel like messaging him or sharing stuff I think he’d enjoy. Because his response rate is so random that it makes this damn relationship feel like I’m throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.

i’m taking a gap year before college to get my massage therapy license, and unfortunately have to drive 55 miles to and from school because there’s no program in district. since i have my permit, my mom has to come with me (two days a week for four hours of class and 2 hour total commute). but, my youngest sister is in school, my brothers are homeschooled and need her to teach, and my live-in grandpa has dialysis on one of my class days. The wednesday class my grandpa can take me, but i have to take her car. and the thursday class is co-op day and dialysis day, and my dad works every other thursday, so no one can take me most thursdays. 

she already overextends herself wayyyy too much and this time she just won’t be able to balance all four kid’s (and her own) schedules. 

I feel i am ready to get my license. i am confident in my skills and have proven multiple times i am capable of driving the route on my own. i also have friends halfway there that i could stay with during bad weather or something. i’m the oldest and i know she’s afraid of anything happening to me and that i won’t be ready. but i am, and she’s restricting her own time and wellbeing by trying to coddle me. my grandpa has offered to give me a down payment on a car, and i will be working my butt off to pay the rest of it off, and i’ve found several good vehicles that i could rely on and pay off easily. 

how do i approach her with this? there’s too much on her plate to drive with me back and forth 5 hours two days a week. i am capable of driving myself and have a good financial system set up to pay off my own car. i love my mom to death, we’re extremely close, and 98% she’s right about things. but i don’t think she is on this subject. 

how do i go about approaching her with this?

141,"I'm sorry if this is trivial, the wrong sub, whatever. I'm a complete wreck about this and I have no one else to emote with.

My childhood puppy, the chocolate lab my family has had since I was a teen, has a cancerous tumor on her anal gland. It's growing extremely fast, I can tell the difference week to week. My parents, who love her as much as I do, are coping by avoidance. It's all I can think about, I've sobbed my guts out so many times, including right now. I'm just so heartsick, guys. I know she's had the best life, but she's only 11. She's still frisky and smart, she should have another 5 years to age naturally. 

How do I cope with this? I'm so glad the people I love are safe and healthy, but this is excruciating. I spend multiple nights a week at my parents' house because it's close and I love my family and my dog. I'm hurting so badly. Please help me. Thank you all in advance.

142,"I’m 28 and I’m about to have a baby I didn’t want. But it’s almost here and I’m getting things in order. What this post is about has to do with the mother of my child and if I’m imagining things or your think something is up too. We started seeing each other in January 2017 and had a rocky relationship in the beginning but it has worked ever since. She’s older than me and has 2 kids and neither of those facts bothered me. But now that we are having a baby, I almost feel like she sees it as her family with a new addition, and then me, the outsider. She tried talking me into helping her get a bigger place for her and the kids, but not me. I quickly turned that plan down. She has an obsession with the baby looking like her. She’s Thai and I’m white. She has made comments about how she wouldn’t be happy if the baby looked more like me. Also, she appears to have discussions with her kids about the baby and how it will be raised, while I’m sitting right there and as if I have no say in the conversation. For instance, I have an interest in different religions and even though I was raised Catholic, I consider myself Agnostic. But the one day I’m at her place and a conversation comes up about the baby and she flat out tells her daughter the baby will be Buddhist. Now personally, I’m not against that, but just the way she announced that without talking to me about it really irked me and the more I think about it, it pisses me off. I’m starting to feel less like a father and more like a sperm donor. ",25Aug2018,2

144,"So I am in the process of renaming/rebranding my startup company (in the US). We are really trending upward, and have meetings with big names in the Venture Capital world. We don't plan on launching for about another year or so. We hired a naming agency that came up with some great names. However, the name my co-founder and I liked the most is currently being used by another company in the same industry/space. Here is where the ethical dilemma comes in.

The other company is : 1) located in another country(Canada) 2)The other company doesn't appear to have much traction. They've been around for 8 years in the space no major funding or success in their country or in the US. Apart from just, what looks to me like paid publicity Fortune, Askmen, and CNET. 3) For whatever reason, leadership at the company has not filed Trademark for the name in either Canada or the US. 4) the size of the company according to a LinkedIn search is 20-30 employees (Ours has 3)

So here are my options: 1) file a trademark &amp; launch my product/service regardless. 2) file a trademark in both countries &amp; sell it the company( for profit) as a means to be petty for them stealing a great name and wasting on a company that isn't going anywhere. 3) Keep searching for another name

I'll be completely honest with you guys I am extremely salty that the perfect name has been taken by somebody. It's even more frustrating that they are in the same market just botching it. I can easily just take this company's name/brand and build it into something better. There is a strong chance the brand/name may have already been diluted by the weak company, I am no marketing expert( the experts disagree with my assumption).

I understand that the business world can be ruthless, and its survival of the fittest. Yet, the way I was raised was to believe in karma and treat others how you would like to be treated. There is a strong chance that if the roles were reversed the CEO of the other company wouldn't even hesitate. I also have reservations on what it would say about my character to investors if I were to take this companies name/brand. I think investors might frown upon it and judge me to be a scumbag.",25Aug2018,1

I offered $20 but then they said they spent $60 on supplies for him and I think that’s a little outrageous. They said they found him last night too. 

I’ve already filed a police report and checked my animals chip to see if there was any kind of gpa locator on it but unfortunately there isn’t.

They called from a blocked caller Id so I can’t even find out who the number is from.

150,"I have a coworker who I loathed from the moment I met him. The guy is an insincere, manipulative snake and he seems to completely lack compassion and empathy for others, to what are in my opinion sociopathic levels. He goes out of his way to kiss the ass of superiors yet try to subtly make power plays on new coworkers so they see him as a ""boss"" (he's not their boss).
From day one he could sense I didnt like or trust him and saw past his superficially good social skills and confidence to what he really was. He launched a campaign about how ""strange"" I was which I believe eventually failed. He used to attempt to do small things to intimidate me, like stare at me over his desk when ever he would see me, or repeatedly ealk past and ""bump"" my desk by accident. He also is constantly trying to put himself in a position where he is laughing at the expense of someone else.
I find the guy loathsome and cant in a million years understand why he cant be professhional, accept me dont like each other and get on with his day. He cant stop himself from micro aggressions, even though I have ignored and not reciprocated. Ive been very clear and kept a cold and profeshinal distance from him, without wver stepping out of line.
Anyway, the other day I feel he crossed the line.
I was offering another coworker some cake and I made a joke about how the cale was safe to eat ""I promise I havent coughed pn it"". I get tha the joke was a bit silly. He overheard this and laughed his obnoxiously loud, mocking laugh and then I heard him say ""wanker"" under his breath.
He said it so that only I heard it. I was shocked and didnt react. I feel he has crossed a line and Im not sure if I should make my problem with hin official or continue to leave ot be. There are people who like him for his social confidence and he pretends to be competant at work and a haed worker - people buy into it. If he really is a sociopath i may cause more trouble for myself than its worth. I know at the very least the guy is aggressive but hides it and has a complete lack of toleranxe and empathy for others, which he also hides. He lets it slip with me because I can see through him and he can sense I dont think like my other coworkers in my entry level job.

151,"Mid 20s guy here. Currently living with my single mom. She is a depressed and needy woman. I understand she had been through a lot, given that she is from an emotionally unstable low-income family and her married life was in ruin due to an animal of a man who married her. However, I am losing my shit trying to deal with her emotions and wanting attention all the time. I am an undergrad student with so many things in my hand, I am getting tired of dealing with her behavior seriously. Why can't she understand that I have a life too... 

Believe me, I try my best to be there for her like every night I watch TV show with her, chat with her, ask her about her food business, make her laugh, help her with paper works(she is illiterate) and legal matters. But time and time again she will find a way to inflict her depressed life on me. You know the kind of pessimist person who views everything negatively and creates suffering for herself so someone notices them and give them attention. For example, she overworks at her own business when she doesn't have to. She handles hundred over customers at once all by herself even when few customers are sufficient to drive her income. Daily she would send me pictures on WhatsApp that she burnt her hand, cut her fingers while preparing food for the customers, come home to complain that her body is aching. If I don't give attention to her minor problems(due to academic project and side jobs), she would make me look like a jerk. Like really why would you make your life miserable when you don't have to?? Why can't you just take care of yourself while your son concentrates on his academic to get a job for a better life for all of us??

We are not short of money. In fact, we are living a pretty decent life living as a middle-income family. Partly because there are 3 members now in our family, me and my teenage brother. I just don't understand why she does this. I love her, I really do but this thing about her is just dragging me down. Our relatives and close family all live in another country so we are pretty much alone. All I wish is that she is a strong and independent woman who knows how to hustle with life. Often I motivate her, give her inspiration to become stronger. Advice her not to let her past define her. She can be empowering and strong sometimes, but more often then not she is the same old miserable lady...

Let me start by introducing myself. I need to be somewhat anonymous so call me Cat. I am a 20 year old female at a large university in the north east. I need advice and I need guidance because I have no time to find a humanistic therapist and also I believe you beautiful humans may be able to help me. =)

I think I’m going insane. Not psychologically but just in life. My entire life revolves EDM and anything related to it. It has been this way since I can remember but the intensity has grown since I learned how to play a board last October (not well but OK). 

Anyways, I’m a senior in college pursuing a degree in Public Relations. I love it but I recently have come to realize that I literally cannot work a “corporate” job for the rest of my life without losing my mind. 

*Back story* for some reason I have always loved to party. I don’t know why but partying has always been such an  intriguing topic to me and it seems like an important part of life —— if it’s in moderation of course. But I’m obsessed. 

Back to the problem. 

I need to be a DJ. Like more than I need to breathe, More than I need to exist. I have so much to say and so much to portray but I don’t know HOW TO F***ING DO IT! I just want everyone to love and have fun and I just want to be the DJ  and get everyone on my level😩😭 

I believe in myself. I have so many supporters and friends and family. How do I take the leap and go balls deep into EDM and just finally learn how to produce... I need serious life advice. I know I have it in me.... I think I’m just afraid to try. I don’t know how to teach myself so it’ll take a LOT of time and devotion. But the investment with be worth it I think. 

I don’t know what I’m really asking for here but I just need some other human’s opinions :( 

P.s. please don’t be mean or condescending I’m finally coming to le internet for some help.

154,"I want to start off by saying I do enjoy my job for the most part. About a year ago, I got promoted and one of the perks was having a half day. It was really beneficial because I do have a mental disorder that gave me the opportunity for therapy appointments. It was also obviously convenient to just have that “break.” However. I’m very dependable at my job because I’ve been at every position there, so I kind of get pulled where I need to go when needed...but no one can do my job, so that’s still waiting after I’m done covering for others.

This was starting to take a toll on me. I was told I couldn’t have a half day anymore because we were “behind.” The reason we are behind is because other people keep quitting or calling in sick which leads me to cover their position. Okay, fine. BUT, my coworker is still able to come in late, my supervisor still takes her half days, and basically I’m the only one sacrificing something. I tried to talk to my supervisor but all she said was I could go to my therapy appointment and make up my time and the days I don’t have my appointments I have to be there.

Tonight I was waiting by the bus station after last call, and it's usually a sketchy part of the city because that's where crackheads, drug dealers, etc. hang out around this time to take advantage of all the drunk people so they can get money.

Anyways, I run into two guys trying to sell weed. I strike up small talk and tell them I don't want to buy any weed. One of them seems laid back and tells me it's all good. 

The other guy however, seems to have insecurities coming out of his ass, because he tells me to go fuck myself. 

I tell him if he's trying to sell weed, talking like that to people isn't going to help him out much. He acts tough and tell me he is ready to go, lets fight, etc.

To be honest, I wanted to (and could have) smash his head against the pavement until he went into a permanent coma. BUT:

- There were witnesses

- He had a friend with him, who was taller and bigger than me

- He probably a had a knife (read below for clarification)

- He was mentally ill (read below for clarification)

- There was a camera behind us, so I don't know if I would have gotten into trouble


I let him mouth off and then tell him i'm not picking a fight, and he should calm the fuck down. 

He goes quiet for a few minutes, then tells me 'sorry, I have BPD'. I tell him I have friends with BPD and can relate because they get into fights a lot, and that he should count to ten next time and calm himself down before he gets into trouble.

He seems to calm down, and we sit there waiting for the bus again while his friend hollers at people and tries to sell his shitty weed.

5 minutes later, just before the bus comes, I talk to the bigger guy and tell him to try going around certain areas where people might buy his weed. Just trying to be helpful. 

His friend gets another stick up his ass and tells him 'i'm going to knife this nigger', and then they both get up and walk past me, while he's still talking about knifing me. After that I get on the bus and go home. 

Now, I know how to fight, and i'm usually the first one to attack and cuss at people. I don't know why I took the verbal assault without fighting this time, but I did. And it's messing me up. I feel so angry and embarrassed I let that piece of shit get away with something like this.

Is there anyway I can spin this around in my head to make it OK? I feel like such a pussy for backing out, even though things might have gone so much worse if I had fought. 

I'd appreciate some advice, because I don't usually stand there and take lip from anyone. I guess it's my pride making me feel like this, but the guy was such a punk, so maybe that's why as well.

160," Hi there

My partner appears to be suffering from a sleeping disorder (or perhaps more than one). I've been reading a bit about it online but thought it would be insightful to hear from others who have sleep disorders or who know people who do.

I've noticed the following while he sleeps:

* Very loud snoring
* Sounds like he stops breathing, then a loud snore/snorking sound (I have read that this could be sleep apnea). I think I should ask him if I can take a video of him while sleeping, so we can see and count how many seconds he is quiet)
* Loud teeth grinding, in a rhythmic sounding way, and lip smacking (like griiind, smack, griiiind, smack, griiind, smack - reminds me a bit of a cow chewing grass - hehe)
* Rubbing his face over and over again with the flat of his hand in a circular pattern, almost like he's washing it in his sleep, with one hand (almost always do this when he grinds his teeth a lot)
* Sleep talking (I have on occasion talked back while he does this, and its almost like he's suddenly completely awake, not disorientated and aware - I can't tell if he's still sleeping or awake. I think the times I've mentioned this to him the next day he said, oh yeah I remember you talking to me, so I must be waking him).
* Twitching body sometimes
* Twitching limbs sometimes. He will sometimes raise his left arm above his head with his elbow close to me, and he's knocked me on the head or face a couple of times with his elbow, luckily not hard enough to cause injury
* He says he often has nightmares, bad ones, where is fighting or in trouble or has strife with his family
* His younger brother has night terrors I think, so may be something that runs in his family

Anyone have these symptoms? (I'm especially curious about the face rubbing thing) and quite concerned about sleep apnea - could this be life threatening?

I think it would be best for him to go to a sleep clinic and see what they find. Both of us suffer from anxiety and depression and I've read mental disorders and sleep disorders are sometimes related. I think he has had an EEG done before but it might be good to get another done. I'm not sure if he's had a MRI done so that may be good too.

Looking forward so some insights :) Sorry its a bit of a long read.

​-Edit: Interesting, I saw the moderater on this channel @jadedrakerider has a tag ""Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome"" next to his/her name. I checked it out on wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed\_sleep\_phase\_disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder)) and this: "" Often people with DSPD manage only a few hours sleep per night during the working week, then compensate by sleeping until the afternoon on weekends."" is something my partner does as well.",25Aug2018,1

162,"Hello guys, I'm here to make one and hopefully my last post. I would like it to get attention so please share it as I need all the advice I could get. My life is in a colossal isolation / vicious cycle, a very personal hell cycle to call it.

1. All I meet is bad people all that I gravity towards is bad people, my idea is maybe it's the Internet. Girls were the worst thing to happen to the Internet period, if you disagree then maybe you should leave.

2. Every time I look at the clock it says ""9:11"" I was born one day before 9/11 happened the terrorist attack, and I feel like this is some sort of existential sign or subliminal message telling me to kill myself. 

3. I find myself regretting everything and even regretting thought, opinion or even emotion. You could say I'm gas lighted by the fucking world. I have narrowed my options, deleted mostly everything I ever done and am left with nothing, no one to speak to and nothing to do.

Notes:

- I am home schooled 10th grade currently and (no I will never go back)
- I am currently 16
- I am doing a good job containing myself from busting my entire desk up
- I live in a rural area
- I have been isolated in my room for over two years plus
- I feel unwanted from this world

So what am I asking from this post? I'm not asking for friends anymore. In fact, I am in pain as I'm typing this. Full of doubt, full of hatred and full of resentment. But there is one thing I'm asking and it's truly, how the fuck do I break this fucking cycle of hell? How do I no longer feel suicidal. All I ever wanted was to meet someone who didn't judge. I guess real life is the last option. And please tell me something I haven't already heard.

We live in a world where it's controlled by numeric bias and sheep.

TL:DR: The Internet is the causes of all world problems.

Also, my number one leading cause to feeling suicidal and probably going through with it is seeing 0, no notifications and having no one normal, nice, friendly and relate-able to talk to. Even better talking to people who rarely talk to me and everyone I ever meet just disrespects me and doesn't treat me anywhere near a personal level. No medical advice you can fuck off.

I want to date. We agreed on just cuddles for now because we do both want that. We cuddled last Saturday and it was great. The next day we talked and she said she'd like to take it slow and hang out more one on one. I said Id be keen for that. Then the next day she asked why I wanted to date so bad and I said I didn't, I thought we were just gonna take it slow now which is what I wanted anyway. She thought about it for a bit and then said she didn't want to do anything physical now because she doesn't want to lead me on or anything. She's not ready for a relationship and she'll reconsider once exams are over in like November December.

I have no choice but to just wait, because I'm not gonna leave and move on. I know there's something between us given what has happened so far - especially the cuddling, it was great.

She said she wants to grow our relationship from what it is now, but not do anything physical yet. I don't understand this. We're already super close friends and i already do everything I can to flirt with her, but she doesn't seem to notice and said she doesn't think I flirt. I'm not sure how I can flirt or do anything without being at least a little physical.

176,"Hey,

Tonight I was waiting by the bus station after last call, and it's usually a sketchy part of the city because that's where crackheads, drug dealers, etc. hang out around this time to take advantage of all the drunk people so they can get money.

Anyways, I run into two guys trying to sell weed. I strike up small talk and tell them I don't want to buy any weed. One of them seems laid back and tells me it's all good.

The other guy however, seems to have insecurities coming out of his ass, because he tells me to go fuck myself.

I tell him if he's trying to sell weed, talking like that to people isn't going to help him out much. He acts tough and tell me he is ready to go, lets fight, etc.

To be honest, I wanted to (and could have) smash his head against the pavement until he went into a permanent coma. BUT:

There were witnesses

He had a friend with him, who was taller and bigger than me

He probably a had a knife (read below for clarification)

He was mentally ill (read below for clarification)

There was a camera behind us, so I don't know if I would have gotten into trouble

I let him mouth off and then tell him i'm not picking a fight, and he should calm the fuck down.

He goes quiet for a few minutes, then tells me 'sorry, I have BPD'. I tell him I have friends with BPD and can relate because they get into fights a lot, and that he should count to ten next time and calm himself down before he gets into trouble.

He seems to calm down, and we sit there waiting for the bus again while his friend hollers at people and tries to sell his shitty weed.

5 minutes later, just before the bus comes, I talk to the bigger guy and tell him to try going around certain areas where people might buy his weed. Just trying to be helpful.

His friend gets another stick up his ass and tells him 'i'm going to knife this nigger', and then they both get up and walk past me, while he's still talking about knifing me. After that I get on the bus and go home.

Now, I know how to fight, and i'm usually the first one to attack and cuss at people. I don't know why I took the verbal assault without fighting this time, but I did. And it's messing me up. I feel so angry and embarrassed I let that piece of shit get away with something like this.

Is there anyway I can spin this around in my head to make it OK? I feel like such a pussy for backing out, even though things might have gone so much worse if I had fought.

I'd appreciate some advice, because I don't usually stand there and take lip from anyone. I guess it's my pride making me feel like this, but the guy was such a low life punk, and maybe that's why i'm beating myself up about it.",25Aug2018,1

182,"I am going to be posting this in multiple r/. Because I am desperate and out of options.

A little bit about us.
I am disabled, jobless and battling the system for approval of benefits. I have multiple physical and mental illnesses. Mainly severe depression, PTSD, Polycystic Ovaries and Ulcerative Colitis.
My boyfriend is transgender. He has mild autism, depression, PTSD and scoliosis. But he is able to work and assists with paying rent.

We recently moved in to an apartment in with our emotional support dog and my best friend of 14 years. We were all excited to get away from our families and things were going great for the first few weeks that we lived together. But everything has changed. And my boyfriend and I are now in constant stress and fear.

I feel like I've been lied to and manipulated the entirety of my friendship with my best friend. We saw each other as family and she always advocated for my struggles and hoped she could do something to help me. But now she has become the source of all my stress and current pain. If I knew she acted like this behind closed doors, I would have never moved in with her.

She gets angry easily. Over the smallest things. We both have to tip toe around her with a fake happy face, trying to avoid upsetting her but it never works. When she gets angry she slams things around, she groans and sighs loudly at everything, she angrily whispers horrible things that she believes we can't hear her say, but we hear her 85% of the time. She slams doors. She slams my mouse constantly when using my computer. But she is also has silent anger. Where she won't say a word to you if you ask what's wrong or what happened or how you can help. And that may be the most frustrating thing of all. That she doesn't commicate with us. She doesn't say what is wrong. And then she takes that anger out on us. I don't even understand why she is angry! None of us do anything to set her off. We cater to her every whim. She acts like a brat. Yelling at my dog when he does normal things a dog does, aka, literally just staring at her. Standing up when he hears her getting food. To which she's said, ""Leave me alone! You only want me when you want things from me. Like everyone else."" And he does the occasional, ""Whose coming in?"" growl when she comes home. That he also does to my boyfriend when he gets home too. But she's convinced the dog hates her. Even when he comes over to her for affection. 

She barely lets me touch my computer and sits there groaning and sighing if I'm on it because she wants to play 1 singular game on my computer for hours. I ask her not to eat at the desk. She does anyway, I ask her to ask us if she can use the computer first because we have a lot of things we like to do on there. But she never asks. And if she is using it and I ask if I can, she says ""You are home all day and I never get to play."" I am either asleep or cleaning the apartment that she doesn't help clean when she is at work. Then when she comes home she wants to watch a show with me for hours, and then she gets on the computer for hours until she goes to sleep. Leaving me maybe 3 hours or 0 hours to do things. I have touched my computer 4 times this month alone. I have things to do on it. She's been on it everyday but 1. And the day that she didn't use it, which was today, where I was spending time with my friends who I haven't hung out with for months, she was angry in the background, whispering with venom in her tone and slammed the door hard as she went in her room. Only for her to not answer me when I ask whats wrong. And then find out later from my boyfriend that she erased herself from the group drawing he made of us from our whiteboard and said, ""I don't matter."" when asked what happens. What the fuck does she mean? I spent an hour with my other friends while I spend 10 hours a day with her in attempts to please her. What is her problem!?

She doesn't clean. I'm always cleaning after her. She doesn't take out the trash. She complains there is no room in the freezer and fridge for her food when my boyfriend and I only have a plate of pizza left overs and a couple yogurt in there and all the rest of the food is overflood with her things. 

We are all just completely stressed. When she isn't home, everything is amazing. We feel happy and free. But the moment she's home. Its all us in nerves and her painful anger. I can't even be sad around her. She groaned when I started crying the other day because I was in a lot of pain and asked my boyfriend for a hug. And she gets mad when I talk low when I'm super depressed.

TLDR;

Point of all this is. We can't live with her anymore. She is giving us too much stress. We want to leave, but my parents won't allow us to move back with them. We'd love to kick her out but then we won't be able to pay rent. We both have no other friends in the area. And the portion of the rent she can afford is 1k. While my boyfriend pays 640, plus 75 for Wifi because he can't afford more than that for now. Not to mention the lease we have for a year. I was hoping when and if I finally get disability, that my boyfriend and I would be able to live together without her, but who knows how long that is going to be. We really don't know what to do. We are stuck in this horrible situation and its effecting our already deteriorating mental health. Please. If anyone knows what we can do, please please help us! If we were able to find somewhere else to go or have someone move in with us that would be ideal, but we literally have no way of that happening that we know us. Please. Help! We don't know what to do!",25Aug2018,2

I think I have a problem where I love people too quickly and too much. Even though he was mean to me and got mad at me about everything (I was constantly on edge because I was scared of him getting mad at me for something even when I did nothing wrong. Just last night I was making us sandwiches and I guess I was using the wrong ham for his and he got mad and said he should hit me upside the head for it). He called me dumb and stupid and fat and ugly (even though he might’ve been joking). Basically he just got mad at me for everything and was mean to me. He even broke up with me over text multiple times but I just kept begging him to stay with me and telling him that I would do anything. He knew he had the upper hand. 

Today after he got mad at me randomly again and started being mean to me over text I finally stopped begging him and started talking back. And I took all my stuff and left. 

But even after all that, I would still go back to him if I could. I think I depend on having a bf so much. I already want to re download tinder and find one. I just feel so lonely and incomplete. But I’m scared that when I get another bf the same thing will happen. It will be so good at first but then he will see that he has the upper hand in the relationship and start stringing me along and using me. And I won’t even care. I knew that my ex was a bad person to me but I didn’t care as long as I could cuddle with him at night. I would continue letting him use me and be mean to me all he wants.

I never had a relationship with others, I can simply say that she is (or was) my first girlfriend since high school, it is just that I am attracted to other women** ***(just like shopping, you had to buy ""this"" but right after buying that thing, you see other versions of the one you bought and thought ""I might buy that one"" or ""that one looks good too"")*** **but I never imagined being with them which she won't believe. This has been our issue ever since and I guess she can no longer wait for more time for me to change (which I am really trying). But I am honest to myself that she's the only one. We have been on and off and tried to work this issue (after getting back together after a break up before, things went smooth for around a couple of months, then we're back again to same issues). She even told me to cut my social media accounts (which I did) to prevent stalking girls, no longer see my friends (which I did) and other things, and literally updated her thru texts my whereabouts.

My on and off again relationship of the past 3 years has just ended with the other person now 1 month into a relationship and I this this may be it for us, for now at least. I need to move on though and don’t know where to begin.

They were my first love, a lot of our firsts were together, everything from virginity to first time over seas. We saved up all summer doing anything we could to get the money together to go. We met at an after party for high school graduation.

My best friend for the past 3 years, whether we were together or not. Now for the first time since we’ve known each other one of us is dating somebody else and it’s tearing me up.

Of course I’m happy my best friend is happy but I always just assumed we’d grow old together. I told them that and they gave me a disheartening “well you never know”. But from the tone in their voice I could tell it wasn’t hopeful anytime soo at least.

So pretty much anybody who’s gone through something like this what did you do?",25Aug2018,1
194,"My friends boyfriend took advantage of me when I was drunk the other day. We kissed and then he took off my underwear and I told him to stop, I was really drunk so I was like laughing saying no, but he was like come on, and the next thing I know he’s fucking me. I didn’t stop him once it started though. He was really drunk too but says I was up for it. I’m not gonna report him or anything but does it sound like rape to you? ",25Aug2018,1
195,"Am in Australia.

So my brother in law (henceforth BIL) has 2 kids, and got with a woman who has 6-8 kids from previous relationships (two live with the grandparents). Her last relationship she fled from due to domestic violence, moving back here from across the country, and 2 months later she moved in with BIL. They had 2 more kids together, and ended up pulling all the kids out of school to homeschool them 2 months ago.

That's not the problem. The problem is they are constantly having fights and calling over their in laws, my husband's parents, to mediate between the two. A couple of times BIL has come over to stay at our house because she's kicked him, or his kids, out. He is constantly screaming abuse at her when she calls other people for help, and vice versa. 

Recently it's escalated to them calling the police on each other, locking themselves in various parts of the house with the kids, etc. They've called the police on each other 3 times in the last week.

The family is trying to help them out but no matter how much any of them, especially the parents-in-law, sit them down to try and talk it out, they end up fighting again.

I wonder if there's anything I should do...or could do...to help or if I should be reporting them to child protection or something. This has been going on for 2 years now and I hate to think what those kids are forced to witness in that house.",25Aug2018,5
196,"Hi guys... 

I'm fairly new to reddit so apologies in advance if I haven't done this right. But I believe this kind of question is on the right thread? 

Anyway.. I dated someone for 4 1/2 years from when I was 15 to 19. It's been 9 years since we've broken up, and I am still not over them. I was devastated for years.. I'm OK now, that old sharp pain has long subsided. But every time I go a few days or a week without thinking of them, or thought I moved on, I realize I haven't at all. Every time I see them (which is once a year when they visit the country if even), I am taken right back to how I felt all those years ago. 

I have even been in a new relationship for years now. I do love that person. But it's not the same love.. 

For the past 4/5 months  I have been having constant dreams of my ex. I am writing this post today as I woke up from one last night, and I truly don't know what to do about this anymore. I have tried everything in the book of letting them go. 

I have found out recently through a mutual friend, they are moving back in a matter of days. It's caused me to feel a storm of emotions, sad, happy, anxious..

This was my first love so I don't know.. Is it always going to be like this? Am I always going to have these dreams, feel sad? It is truly messing up my mental state, I feel like a crazy person or something.

My ex is far beyond over me.. and it also hurts me to know that even though that is actually the normal thing to have done, you know, moved on. Are these consistent dreams and how I'm feeling all these years later normal? How the hell do you get over a first love? Any advice from someone out there who struggled with the same? 

Thanks..",25Aug2018,19

199,"So long story short my S/O went to rehab about two months ago and got out a month ago and was living in sober living up to just recently. He ended up quitting his second job being there and was risking them kicking him out (he was well behind on rent) and so he decided to get up and leave. 

  One of the main reasons he was in rehab is because he was homeless and had no where to go and after a crazy benzo incident he decided he was going to go. 

  Now I got us a apartment that we are suppose to be moving in on Sept 5th. The only reason I got it in the first place was us to be living together, I would be fine regardless if it was there or not. 

  Because he would have to wait (at the time) 14 days without a place to live. And living where I currently live is out of the question. I suggested to him if he took a very low amount of a drug, that would still show up in a drug test, that he should go back to a rehab for those remaining days. He thought it was actually a really smart idea at first and was going to go along with it.

  Then he started to change his mind because it meant he would no longer be clean as long as he has been (which was a little over 60 days) and he really didn’t want to take any substance at all. But it would mean that he would have to camp outside somewhere and risk getting arrested (he already has a warrant for his arrest for not paying court fines) and he wouldn’t have a place to shower and no where to go if it got cold and rained. 

  Because of that he did end up taking a lower dose of DXM from taking generic brand NyQuil pills. And because of that I now feel very awful about it because he did take it and got high and I was there for it and even gave him my debit card to buy it. 

  Not to mention I haven’t heard from him since Wednesday and I tried contacting his facility and no one has gotten back to me. When i first called they said I’m under is release to consent but no one has ever said anything to me and I’m worried I fucked up that’s why i’m off of it or why no one has talked to me. They did tell me the first 7 days my boyfriend will not be able to make calls but it still doesn’t explain why no one has gotten back to me and he’s been there since Wednesday.

  I’m really nervous that he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore because of taking the dxm and that’s why no one has called me back because they took me off his release of consent. ",25Aug2018,1
200,"Its not make or break as i love him more than anything. A baby isnt worth losing my soul mate over and i will always stand by that. He is unequivocally the love of my life.
Years ago we unexpectedly fell pregnant. We were young and in a bad place, especially me. Struggling with depression and a few other personal problems it wasnt ideal but we thought wel make a go of it.
My pregnancy was horrible. Sickness that lasted until the birth. I would be violently vomiting 4-6 times a day resulting in the blood vessels in my eyes and around my eyes popping constantly.
I was 10 days over due and had to have an emergency c-section after over 55 hours of labour as i never dilated and the baby was in the back to back position. 
I suffered cracked enflamed and bleeding nipples from breast feeding.
The baby never settled and i survived on an hour or 2 sleep if i was lucky.
My depression was crippling and unrelenting.
I never experienced joy with my baby. This joylessness lasted about 6 years. 
I had 2 or 3 major mental breakdowns before my partner understood that i was not a well person. 
Depression is a strange thing. 
When our baby was 2 i fell pregnant again...except this time...the pregnancy was terminated. Its too much for me to talk about. I dont regret what i did but its fucked me up good and proper.
Fast forward to now. Our child is 11 and i can connect better. 
I never thought i would want another due to the heartache that was suffered. I protested this for years. I wanted to be sterilised but the doctors always said no youre too young you might change your mind. My partner said the same as he hinted at another. I hated that. Nope not me never no way.
Now im in my 30s and here i am, a hypocrite. The tables have turned. Ive changed my mind but so has he. 
He does not want to be a an old dad and wants to be able to have free time for himself and us as a couple which i completely understand. 
But im also angry. Angry with the doctors. Angry at myself and angry at him. I wish i had been sterilised so id not have the option to think about babies. Im angry that my partner didnt want me sterilised saying id change my mind when now i have and he doesnt want to know. 
I want to donate my eggs or uterus but he isnt comfortable with me donating eggs and ive not even spoken about uterus donation. Because seriously whats the point in having them. Theyre useless to me. Someone else who will be a fantastic parent could have them. Id be thrilled to know my parts had helped someone desperate for children to conceive. Someone who deserved to be a parent. It also means that in a weird way id know id technically have children out there in the world. Children that are there because of me. 
We arent exactly in the best financial position or accomodation to support another kid so im my heart i already know its dumb but i cant help this longing.
I often think whats the point in my birth control when children arent on the cards. Why not just take it all out then theres no chance at all.
Weve talked about a baby pros/cons but i guess i feel lonely in my thinking. I just needed a release.
Has anyone else been in a similar situation? If so how did you handle it? 
My heads a mess with this. There is an overload of emotion. This urge is ever so frustrating and i need some kind of relief from it.",25Aug2018,1
201,"Hi 

so here's some background I finished university without applying myself. revising the night before exams, handing in essays on literally the last minute, then at the end spending a week on my dissertation, I managed to get a class III honours in biomedical science.  A degree I didn't want to do in the first place but did because I was too late to apply for anything else (like always)

After that up to now, I've been working at a warehouse for just under a year now doing back breaking work, due to not being able to get anywhere and not really looking for another job (because I'm lazy, see a pattern here). 

I want to do something , i want to get better organised, do things way before the deadline, but I just end up being the same last-minute guy who is often too late. even this post is too late since i got around 10 days for a masters application deadline. 

my goal was always to get into medicine, but always remained hopeless about it, I didn't even dare to apply for it. never been able to get any work experience or a volunteering role, so thought i would be able to get in.

As of last year, I sat next to this really cute guy. (Now my crush) we talked for a bit but started off pretty awkward and weird. Whereas my “best friend” talked to him with no big deal at ALL. I started trying hard to impress him and it got even weirder. At the time, I didn’t know how to talk to boys. She did. On the 3rd month of school last year, she told me that she liked him. Or shall I say “interested” therefore (basically) translates into DATE ME under her circumstances. I told her that I liked him too. I’ve liked him since the end of the first month of school. She stated that she knew ever since I started to like him. She then proceeded to tell me about how she fell for him in October. See, two people liking one person at once is one thing, but; that person being your “best friend” and ALSO KNOWING is another thing; clearly. At this point, it wasn’t even jealously. It was just anger that she would actually do that. Something about her is that she has a pretty awkward personality. She thinks it’s distinctively cute to be awkward. She does that “cute”HENHEHEHE giggle. How annoying. Also, the occasional “umm hehe”. It’s really annoying. She does that even more around him and it’s unexplainably uncomfortable for me.  They started dating in January, but only dated for two weeks. Literally.  How it ended? The guy (my crush) straight up said, “I don’t feel the love”. I’m like WOHH. Another thing that was very attention seeking of her was to send him hearts in the group chat with the three of us when she knew I liked him. Now, present day, they broke up and she clearly told me she didn’t like him anymore but they HAD to have 5 periods together. Whereas I only have one with him. She’s/my “best Friend” is all over him all the time meaning touching his hair and giggling “cutely” around him.  That’s basically it with the “story” part but now I’m getting to the relationships between me and my crush and my best friend and my crush currently.

204,"So I am a college student in my senior year. I love my university and overall college experience. Made friends, good grades, well-known on campus, joined Greek Life and received many awards for my involvement. That being said, my mental state was the only factor I never focused on. Anxiety and depression would hit me in waves. Out of the blue, sometimes last for days. I would believe I'm disliked or feel I'm never good enough sometimes. Then this 2017/2018 academic year hit me hard. Struggled with 3 bad break ups which left me heartbroken. Physical health issues (sports knee injury and sickness a least once a month). And Greek Life! I love Greek Life, best choice I ever made. But, it came with drawbacks. I became a sorority sweetheart only for the sorority to treat me poorly despite everything I do for them and I still never complain about it. And being in my Greek organization and holding a high government position as Risk Management, I was forced to handle situations I never thought I'd have to involve myself. I handle: drunk people at parties, calling the ambulance to save someone's life, bad brothers not receiving punishment for their crimes and dealing with four sexual misconduct cases with Title IX (3 of which were falsely admitted by the accusers because of petty differences like didn't text me back, pursuit of another girl and etc). The other case was true and I fought long and hard for the girl to receive justice. I was a prime suspect and talked to Title IX for 2 months about everything I knew. Then a growling debate with the brothers about who's right and wrong when the evidence was clearly in their face. I felt like I sat in a room full of monsters who didn't care about sexual violence. I'll never forget when someone said, ""She was asking for it."" That was the breaking point on my morality. I didn't know who to trust anymore. And those allegations hurt our name too. We suffer from the price of one person. Luckily, Title IX finished the case, that guy was kicked out the university thanks to my help. But, those who were defending the guy/friends with him made life harder for me with talking behind my back and etc because they didn't believe me and thought I was out to get their friend because I didn't like him which was not true at all. Some days I felt no point on getting out of bed. Didn't want to show myself to anyone. No one could understand what I mentally went through as a person, trying to do good but get treated less than dirt for it. So when May hit, I left school for summer break, uninstalled all social media and didn't talk/text anyone that wasn't family until this August. I worked 40+ hours all summer so I was plenty busy. And I met my girlfriend who I spent time with and have a promising future with after learning from my mistakes with the last 3 girls. Now that I'm back on campus, my perspective has changed. I am still kind of isolating myself from others just because I fear I am not ready mentally. I've been around evil people so it's more difficult to accept others even the good ones. and those who questioned why I fell off the earth for 4 months are questioning why I took so much time away for myself. I just feel like I'd feel judge or misunderstood for keeping away if I explained my situation. Thinking of seeking out counseling to discuss more about what's going through my head. I'm doing better than 4 months ago but improvement is always a good thing. Even my girlfriend suggested I reached out for help, she suffers from anxiety too so we agreed we both get the help we need this school year! I think my Greek experience had some good but could have been more toxic than I realize. Any advice?

205,"Okay so I need advice and I've asked my friends about it but I'm not sure so why not just ask a bunch of strangers on a website...

I'm in a relationship with a guy for over a year now and I'm having issues. Firstly, his mother is freaking controlling him (he is nearly 18) telling him what to wear, what to buy, metaphorically wiping his ass for him. I'm bloody sick of it because she's so rude to me and it might be a joke to her but it's not to me. Secondly, my boyfriend lives about a 40 minute drive for me and I hardly get to see him maybe twice every fortnight and that's only on weekends because we both go to school. Thirdly, I'm always going to his house and putting my plans and life aside because he can't come to my house because on weekends he has soccer games which is fair enough the season is nearly over anyway.

However, I am so sick and tired of this dumb fucking relationship. I put so much effort into making this work by giving up my plans on weekends to go to his house, revolving my whole fucking life around him and getting nothing in return. He puts no effort into this relationship whatsoever and he thinks that our relationship is perfectly fine and nothings wrong with it. WRONG!!! We always bloody fight nearly every week and it's usually because I'm angry because of his mother and obviously I can't yell at his mother because that's just rude so I take it out on him... 

I honestly don't know what to do... He's always busy, we never do anything sexual maybe like one thing when we see each other and that's not even sex! The only time we have sex is when he comes over my place which is fucking never! His bloody mother doesn't even realise that we do anything sexual cause she's either a daft twat or she knows but just doesn't want to know. Apparently whenever my boyfriend brings up the topic of anything sexual the mother gets angry and shuts him down saying he's to young to have sex (age of consent is 16) and there's no point in having it... tf?

Anyway there's more to the issue but I'll stop myself because I'll be making a fucking book at this point. If any of you have advice please tell me. Idk if I should leave this dude and move on or try and work things out with him (who doesn't even see an issue in the first place). But the thing is I don't want to lose him because he's a good guy, but I wan't someone who I can stay up with till god knows what time in the morning and talk about life and our future and stupid shit like that, but the man I'm with now goes to bed at 8.30PM and hates me talking about the future for some fucking reason.

206,"So long story short, I'm staying at a friend's place for about a week while I sort out the bond and other things for an apartment I'm moving into (unrelated family issues caused me to move out of home) and I really appreciate him for taking me in, but...

He has a dog that lives inside for the most part. A big dog, not sure what kinda breed if anything specific. The dog, let's call him Fido for now, is the most obnoxious and terribly trained canine I've ever met. 

He pisses inside. He shits inside. Half the time my friend or his girlfriend will straight up ignore it for hours -- I came back from an appointment yesterday and there were multiple turds scattered around the living area where friend's gf was sitting. 

They also forget to leave him water. At least twice in the past three days I've been here, Fido was pacing around whining anxiously and jumping up to the counter/sink when I walked into the living room where one or both of my friend/his gf were and his water bowl was dry as a bone. 

Yesterday and today, Fido had *no* dog food (no kibble, meat or cans) and I walked down to the supermarket to buy 8kg of kibble and a few cans of food because he was jumping on me trying to steal my food (which isn't unusual admittedly) and chewing anything remotely organic he could find, including wood in front of the fireplace. 

The cherry on top was half an hour ago when I noticed Fido had urinated inside again. ""Oh shit, Fido has pissed inside again"", to which my friend responded ""Oh right ... Shit, it's 11 already? I'm gonna go to bed""

Are there any long-distance movers that will help you load the stuff? Any brokers that will buy a whole storage unit for a flat rate?

The problem is I know NOTHING about boxing. I dont know how to box. I dont know the rules. Someone asked if i can take hands and I have no idea what that means.

221,"I had a birthday 2 months ago. My birthday was on a Tuesday, so I didn't really expect anyone to have time to celebrate, so I decided to ask everyone to do something on the next Friday.  We were going to eat and then go out to the club. 

Then one of my friends asked me what I was doing on my actual birthday. I told her I was going into the city to take some pictures, maybe get a pedicure or massage. I was fully prepared to have a good time alone. Then she asked if I would like company because they had some spare time on a Tuesday, I was excited to spend the day with one of my friends. 

A few days away from my birthday she tells me that she can't hang out with me on my birthday because she forgot that she had agreed to go to a parade after the Caps won the Stanley Cup. I was really offended by this because how do you already know that you're going to a victory parade if the caps haven't won yet? I know victory parades don't just pop up out of nowhere and require planning, but there was no way that she knew for sure she would go to the victory parade until after the Caps won, so she straight up ditched me for something better. I didn't even ask if she was free on my birthday, she was the one who offered. She didn't even invite me to come with her to the victory parade.

Then on that Friday, a couple of friends and I were going on a bar crawl to celebrate. One of my friends asked me if he could bring some other people, and I asked who and I said okay because I was on speaker phone and I knew who the people were. So he rolls up to the club with about 8 other people 4 of which I don't even know. Then we start our bar crawl and end up in this little dive bar. He comes in with his group, they sit down for 2 seconds, and say they are going to wait outside. After we get our drinks, we look outside and they are gone. They walked off to another cooler bar. I asked him where they went, and they went to a bar and he wanted me to meet them there. I told him no because I didn't like that bar because I had a bad experience there and then he got mad at me because I wouldn't meet him there. 

I just realized how I am still very upset by this. Every time I hear them talk about birthdays, and all the things they have planned for their friend's birthday I get really salty. I didn't ask for anything. I just wanted my friends to spend some time with me. 

I feel like the next time someone mentions a birthday I am going to loose my cool. I have no idea what to do about it. I know I need to get over it, but I have no idea how. Any suggestions?",25Aug2018,1

223,"I changed jobs recently which meant I had to go back to the bottom of the totem pole. I am aiming to get a transfer to a similar department I’ve worked in before which is a very intelectual job and less physical. 

Anyway, I’ve had to start at the bottom again in this new company but the thing is, my boss hates me. She will take any opportunity to take a jibe at my work or at my commitment to my job. The thing is I don’t think her comments are valid because I’ve had extremely good feedback from other bosses that sometimes come to replace her sometimes, they all say they’re very happy with my work, and I almost always stay later than anyone else on my team. So much so that other teams bosses have noticed and tell me “do you ever leave this place?!” when they bump into me. 

I hate her as well obviously because she treats me like shit. It’s affecting my mental health and I desperately need advice on it. Thank you. ",25Aug2018,9

I have continued to struggle ever since then but have gotten worse over the past few years. I feel I have fairly severe anxiety, and possibly some other issues that have not been diagnosed. Almost daily I am miserable, or angry, or frustrated. I can barely sleep anymore without jumping up several times a night feeling like something is wrong. It is affecting my quality of life. I don't have a job and I'm afraid of driving and do not have my license. I want to start seeing a therapist. My boyfriend wants me to get help and feels I should be medicated.

Here is my problem... I live with my boyfriend and have for the past 2.5 years, but I'm still young enough to be on my parents health insurance. I asked my mom to see if our insurance covers therapy, and she said it needs to be approved, meaning my step dad has to call and request that they cover it. I've been waiting and so far he has not called. I'm not sure if he ever will. I don't have the money to just pay for therapy out of pocket. 

Am I just supposed to deal with this myself, continue to go untreated and just feel miserable? Because right now or feels like I have no choice in any of this. I'm afraid.",25Aug2018,1

My first inclination is to not go, as I would feel rude if I show up with a cold that might still be contagious. On the other hand, he has this BBQ once a year and I already miss a lot of social stuff with my coworkers for other reasons, and they were talking about how they were excited I'm coming to this BBQ, so I don't want them to think I'm just being a flake.

Whenever I'm not at work, my bosses will take over my emails and send them, with my signature. They said it's to keep things consistent. When I come back to work, I see all these emails to and from ""me"" that I never saw before and it makes me slightly uncomfortable.

Well a few days ago, my boss sent an invoice, as me, and the invoice was incorrect. The customer called us out on the incorrect numbers and she was like ""My apologies, please see revised invoice"".

Do you think I'm being a wuss if I ask them if we can all just use our own names when signing off emails? This email address is office@_____.com so I don't think it'll be too weird. But I am very non-confrontational about things I want sometimes and dont even know how to ask or if I should.

I want to look into adhd and HRT/transitioning. I'm afraid that they will connect the two issues and as a result discount them both - if they think my dysphoria is caused by adhd, they won't allow me to look into that, or if they think my adhd is actually symptoms of dysphoria, they won't let me deal with that.

Some people act like he's just young and wants to party - he's not, he literally drinks for months straight and won't stop. I don't want to break up with him, but I've been supporting him while he's been unemployed since December of last year and I own everything in the house that we own together - if we broke up I would lose everything. 3 weeks ago he got offered a good job in town, but the training is out of state and he's been staying in a hotel out there. While he was out there he slept with a woman 3 time and went on many dates with her. He claims it was because he's never been with another woman and didn't want to die without ever getting the opportunity to sleep with someone else. He says that he ""doesn't regret doing it because now he knows that I'm what he wants"". And if you didn't get it from the title, I'm 7 months pregnant. 

So what the fuck am I supposed to do. I am heartbroken, I've spent days crying, and on top of everything else I could have an STD from this strange he met in a bar which could, obviously, negatively affect my baby when it's born.

234,"This happened within the summer months, as far as her admitting that she cheated on me. She came clean that she was at a party with her sorority sisters, and she made out with a random guy. This was around July, and she came clean immediately after the fact this all happened.

I kind of overreacted, and said that we’re breaking up. She was sad because of this, and she’d been crying for an entire week. She even quit her internship because she lost all motivation to go to work.

I might’ve handled this poorly, but I didn’t tell her that I wanted her out of my life. I was just trying to get at that I needed space. I communicated that poorly, so I told her that I didn’t exactly mean a break up, and just wanted space. 

So this brings us to now, or at least very recently, I started texting her around the beginning of August, and we arranged a meet up in a public setting to discuss everything. The meet up went well, and it seemed like the relationship would be fixed. The key take away was she said she wants to have me back. 

Then, it kind of took a nosedive because life happened, I was busy working shortly after our meet up, and I was just dead tired. I pushed away meeting with friends and social activities. All that stuff, because of work, got pushed to the back of my mind. 

I finally called her out of the blue, and told her that I still have feelings for her, additionally I followed up with mentioning the meeting we had earlier in the summer. I ended my piece with saying that I wanted a relationship again.

There was a long, awkward pause on the other end, and she just tells me that the feelings are no longer mutual. She tells me that she respected the space I asked for, but after the meeting she soon felt neglected because I wasn’t returning any of her Snapchats, or text messages. I basically just kept leaving her on “Read”. 

I tried explaining to her, and she should know this by now, that just because I don’t reply to a funny text or a Snapchat, doesn’t mean I disliked it, or thought it was stupid. I just find it ludicrous to have to reply back “LOL” after everything. I also explained to her that work has been crazy. 

She started to explain, in the form of an analogy, that me as the a ship’s captain that I sailed away and left her at the port, and that she found another ship to sail on (at first I thought another bf, but she was just trying to make a point that she moved on with her life) I asked what she meant, and she said that I started throwing signals that I was done with her. Which, wasn’t my intention, and I tried to back my stance on that. It didn’t work. 

After that long winded spiel, I have to ask, should I be surprised or upset that she closed the door on me? I wasn’t trying to lead her on either, it was never my intention. It just seems like my inactivity with my texts and snaps, that she moved on with her life. 

As I finished this all up, I texted her with a long lined apology that basically covered the whole me not talking much because of work taking my energy away. I followed up with saying that I don’t regret the memories we’ve had together. I also mentioned that if she ever needs a helping hand, that I’m still here. Not sure if it’s the smartest thing to do, but my heart said it was the right thing to do. 

It’s strange because she tried her best at damage control, and now it just seems like she’s saying “get out of my life”. ",25Aug2018,2

During the day i talked about how hard is camping conditions and probably leave tonight - She was staying her friend's house not in tent - . Her friends and she was very insist about my existence in there so I told them I will think about it after the concerts. If I stay there , I have to deal with all that shit like taking shower - it is very hard in festivals like this -  , eating , sleeping - I realy really hate sand and tent was built on sand - , heat - it was 38 degrees min - on the other hand,  if I leave she will be ""vulnerable "" because there is lots of "" bad"" guys wanna ""use"" the girls especially lone ones. If you ever been in a festival you probably understand what am I talking about. Finally I decided to go my friend's house which is 80 kilometers to the festival. I wrote her about it and she said "" It was more beautiful with you I hope we meet again "" then i went the house. My plan was taking a good shower and eat properly then go back to the festival to keep making sure she is okay. Other day i wrote her that I'm coming and wanting to meet again. She said ""OK come we are here"" . And I started to hijacking. After 3 hours finally found a car  - it was 39 Celsius outside- and went to the festival and started to wait for a call from her or any of her friends. I waited there like 7 hours and there was no signal. Finally I asked her where are they , she said they are in the festival and it's been a while since they arrived. I was super mad and sad at that point , I left there and started to hijacking again to my friend's house . It was way more harder than the first time , I started to hijack on 10 pm and I came home on 8 am. I don't even talk about what I struggled with all this time. Besides , the only reason that I been there , the only reason I struggled with all that shit was just making sure she's okay.

another thing is that I'm a really conservative person, e.g. when people talk about topics like sex, I not feel comfortable in that kind of conversation,

241,"I'll start with a little about me. I am 36 and basically a virgin. Becuase of my insecurities and fear I never really pursued girls since my early twenties. And my sexual experience was relegated to just a hand job and foreplay type stuff ( fingering, playing with boobs). I also haven't made out with a girl since my early 20s. Anyway long story short, I recently got a great job and have been getting in better shape, so my confidence and self esteem has risen quite a bit. 

So I met this girl, Mildred (26) and we hung out a few times smoking weed. And she came onto me one night, and normally I would chicken out and think of some excuse to stop a chick's advances at this point. But I still barely knew her and was like fuck it, what do I got to loose if I embarrass myself? So she ended up sucking my d and I finger banged her. And to my suprise, a couple days later she wanted to get together again and we fooled around agian. No actual sex or kissing (I didn't know how serious she wanted to be, like romantically, and kissing seems more intimate than sex to me and at that point an actual relationship wasn't something wanted). 

Becuase of life circumstances, I won't go into the details, she left town for a couple months (1 month in). Since then we have been talking on the phone everyday and even wrote each other a couple letters. We have fallen pretty hard for each other after talking so much. 

Now here is where the advice comes in. I am totally intimated by her sexually. She has tons more experience than my basically no experience. I am afraid that I won't be able to please her. I have also been intentionally obtuse about my sexual experiences becuase I am afraid she will be weirded out if she finds out that the couple times I messed around with her make up the majority of my sexual experience. 

What can I do to became more confident in bed when she returns to town? Any advice on how to be sure I please her? 

Also, last time we talked she tried to initiate phone sex. Luckily, I was in a public place so I had a good excuse not to engage. But I would like too, but I have never did that either. I have never even sexted. Any advice on that front?   

One more thing, she told me the last guy she dated was a bad kisser. And, well, I don't have much experience there either. So I am real nervous about making out too. 

Thanks for any advice.",25Aug2018,17

He kept asking ""when can I see you?"", and ""When can I come pick you up?"" to which I responded ""Just give me 30-45 minutes to get ready then leave"". He gets mad and says I take too long to get ready (but I really don't think I do bc I'm relatively low maintenance) and he said to get ready at his house but I can't really do that bc my parents are strict and it'd look obvious when I leave with all of my stuff and come back looking normal and clean.

I mean I do want to see him, but I have to take care of myself too. Today I just needed to take a shower, wash my hair, and I really needed to shave like everywhere so it may have taken me a little bit longer in there but when I got finished I just threw on some comfortable clothes and no makeup because we don't have any plans.

Basically a year ago I got this job as assistant manager of this small museum shich was run by the county's Parks and Rec department. However the posistion was technically considered ""contingent"" which meant even though I was working a full 40 hours with some benefits i was still mot considered full time. About a month ago they announced my posistion and the main manager posistion for the museum were being converted into full time posistions with better pay and benefits. Because it is technically a county government posistion, I had to re-apply and re-interview for the posistion, but it was also open for other people to apply as well. This other girl in the same sub department as me ended up getting the posistion. After I was told this I asked my supervisor what happens next, she told me I would stay on for a ""few weeks"" and then I would be let go.

My degree is in history and ive had two other museum jobs since graduating (early 2017) but this was my first big time, mid level posistion that paid me decently well. I put my heart and soul and so much hard work into this job and it was all for nothing.

She’s told me she has a therapist, but I have no idea how many times she’s visited them or if it’s regular or not, as well as that she’s on some type of medication, but  I’m not sure if that’s still true. She has very frequent panic attacks. She’s had several suicide attempts, that have either failed or she couldn’t go through with. One specifically over this year’s summer, maybe two. I’ve always tried to keep her calm and talk through things, encourage her to take care of herself and stay safe, but now I have no idea what to do.
     Her school and home life are hell. She has many siblings and her parents don’t seem to care about her or them that much. As the oldest, the duty of making sure they’re entertained and don’t need any help with anything falls directly onto her. She only has time to relax in the night after everyone’s gone to sleep, another factor to play into her insomnia.  
     At school she’s had so much drama with her friends. I didn’t know much about what happened during at the time and still don’t know that much, but her once very close friends started to just flat out ignore and bully her. Purposefully exclude her from anything they did. They specifically aren’t much of an issue anymore, as they switched schools, but I know she still has issues getting over it. But now another friend that she was also close to and thought that she had a compact relationship with seems to just be ignoring her entirely. She’s tried talking to him through text and in person, but he seems to be avoiding her and neither of us have any idea why. At school I also know that she is in frequent contact with the guidance counselors, but I’m not sure how much help they are.
     I am afraid for her. She tells me that she just feels like she can’t do anything anymore, that it’s all very constricting. I keep trying to encourage her but I feel like nothing I say makes anything better. Over the year and a half I’ve known her I’ve done much research on helping people who are depressed, suicidal, or under stress, but I can’t seem to find anything that I could do to help her relieve some stress or just calm down a bit. I don’t know if I can even talk to any adults, as she’s already in talks with the school, and her parents probably don’t have the money to really help her that much(that I know of) or they think they have better things to deal with. I also don’t want to be responsible for possibly giving her more stress if I make a big deal out of anything that isn’t that big.
     On top of this, and I know it’s extremely selfish to say when I know what kind of situation she’s in, but sometimes I wish I could just disappear our relationship. I want her to be safe and happy but I feel horrible when I come to school everyday to find that things seem to keep going downhill with her mental health rather than up. Or at least it just doesn’t seem to be getting better. I want to hang out and have fun with my closer friends, but I always feel as if I’m neglecting her when she really needs help. I know she doesn’t get out much and wants to do more things together, but at the same time I barely even talk to my own friends outside of school besides texting, much less hang out face-to-face or one-on-one. In-person situations usually make me uncomfortable, and I don’t like going to friend’s houses or things like that that much.
     Still, I’ve been trying to find events that she and I, as well as one or two of my other friends could go to and hang out together, but it’s slow going. I don’t even know if she would like or feel comfortable in those situations at all.       
Last school year was personally one of the worst years I’ve ever had, and I was hoping this year would be much better. Unfortunately, nothing seems to be going right. I am afraid for the safety of my friend and I have no idea what to do. 
If anyone has any suggestions, please help.",25Aug2018,4

As soon as she left I went to her room to find her pain pills. I take her pills all the time cuz they're awesome. If you haven't tried pain pills you should start.
Anyway when I was taking a handful I noticed she had a dildo in the drawer I was looking in. Naturally I got curious and decided I was gonna try to use it. I've never used a dildo before.
I crushed a couple pills and snorted them before I tried it. I lubed it up probably more than I needed to and put some lube on my asshole then slid it in. I instantly knew I would be doing this again. It felt so good every time I shoved it farther in my ass. 
About 5 minutes in I heard my mom pull into the driveway. I freaked out ripping the dildo from my ass. I rushed into my mom's room and threw the dildo back in the drawer but as I did I noticed there was some poop on the side of the dildo! It was a big brown streak that was instantly noticeable. There was just no time to clean it without getting caught in her room so I just left it. She's home now so I can't get back in there. What do I do??",25Aug2018,0

But I still feel guilty or bad for liking this guy while I'm going through this. I really don't want to drag him into my mess that is waiting to be fixed. He's sweet but very sexual and so am I with him. I realized that I'm just sexually frustrated but I don't want to ruin him by having sex or him being a rebound from my shitty marriage. He really likes me a lot and so do I but I don't want him to get hurt or I. I want to move slow by asking him and I to be friends because we seem to be moving a bit fast. So I asked him if we could start from being friends... But idk... I really like this guy.

I respond, ""Okay. Well, were you gonna wash them?""

260,"I’m a 21 year old female and I feel like I’ve been cursed. No guy I’ve ever liked has liked me back, or I like guys only to find out later they are in relationships. This has been going on since middle school. I don’t think I’m stunningly gorgeous but I don’t think I’m hideous or ugly either. I’ve been told I’m pretty a lot before.(Even though I don’t believe it.) I’m never interested in the guys that are interested in me. There’s only one guy I’ve  kissed (I was 15, he was 18) grosses me out til this day and I’ve never been in a relationship. I am very shy and always have been but because of the amount of rejection I’ve gone through I’m very closed off and have walls up, so if a guy try’s to get to know me I feel super vulnerable like I have to protect myself. The pain from this is very deep, I haven’t dealt with the feelings in a proper way and I’m not sure how to because the scars and pain will always be there. I’ve always had low self esteem but I feel like my feelings towards myself (I’m ugly, worthless, etc) are validated because of these things I’ve gone through. It makes me feel very isolated. I don’t feel like there is room for me and there is no place for me. It’s a horrible feeling. I’ve felt suicidal over this before. It’s embarrassing to talk about, I’m deeply ashamed.

262,"Hello, everyone. I am 20 years old and I dropped out of college about a year ago. In college, I was studying political science and later changed to mass communications/journalism. My goal was to become a political commentator of some kind. I made two attempts at starting a YouTube channel and vlogging, but was not able to get anywhere with it even with regular posts (multiple times a day even) and making longer, better-quality videos. Ever since I was about middle school age, I have had a deep interest in history as well as politics and current events. Before that, I also developed a love for writing.

This week, I just got hired as a package handler at UPS after being unemployed since January. It is not an easy job, but the hourly pay and benefits made the job enticing. Since I still live at home rent-free, I plan to put aside some of my paychecks to fund my future endeavors. I also recently got interested in investing (Forex trading) and plan to give it a shot with some of my money as well. Political commentary and writing are still things I feel like I am called to do and things I have been passionate about for a very long time. I am not really intending to make a career for myself at UPS, though I won't totally rule it out if it becomes something I enjoy. What I am asking is how can I take my love for writing and politics and possibly turn them into something sustainable?",25Aug2018,0
264,"So me and my gf or ex gf I should say, broke up a couple of days ago, and I’m completely devastated by it, we did everything together and she meant so much to me and I really did love her more than anything in this world. But then this is where things get complicated and it hurts my head because all I do is think about it and how it could be different or how I could fix this. She said we needed to be friends for a bit so we could get to know each other better (to me doesn’t make sense because I already told her everything about me and we pretty much knew a lot about the other) and ever since then, I’ve became seriously depressed, and so has she. We both still love each other that I don’t have a doubt in my mind. I guess the part that confuses me is that and I could be completely wrong or whatever but I don’t see why we couldn’t just stay together and just work on what was the problem while still being together. I love her still, nothing gets her off my mind, I still keep our promise ring on and she does too. And in my mind I guess I’m just trying to piece it all together and make sense of it all. I try to be happy so she doesn’t see me upset and depressed, I was always told as a man I need to be strong around people and never show those emotions. But I just can’t, I physically can’t smile anymore, I try but it won’t work, I can be happy when she tried to cheer me up in my mind it was helping but all the other parts of my mind it wasn’t, and I guess I just don’t know what to do, she said after we be friends for a little bit if it still felt right we could get back together, and I honestly thought she is the love of my life, I still do, but it feels like my world is crumbling around me and I can’t stop it. And it makes me panic, and I just want it all to go back to how it was before. So I guess if you have anyway of helping me cope or any advice at all on what I should do, please tell me.

269,"I am married for 4 years been living with my wife and step-daughter for 4 years and I also have a 3 yr old daughter. Firstly i have never touched my step-daughter, i am not attracted to her and i have no intentions to. Even though we don’t have a father-daughter relationship she’s a kid (14yrs). Now that’s out of the way here is my dilemma. My SD has a friend who is 19 and a few weeks ago the 3 of us were joking around in a play fight way, this lasted for about 3 minutes. Then to my surprise when they left and went outside my SD said to her friend, “You know he’s a Pedophile right? Her friend told me a few hours later and asked me what the hell did i do. I was traumatized, surprised, upset and confused. Like i said, never have i had that in my intentions, she’s a kid my wifes daughter and that’s it. I couldn’t believe it she said such a horrible thing. She has always been the one that seeks me out for hugs, and always come into my space which is perfectly normal, i was confused. I was going to tell my wife at first but I really wanted know why she said that so i asked her friend to find out why she would say such a thing. Her friend told me that she, my SD said that i have been checking her out, looking at her all the time, and stare at her when my wife is not looking .(OMG)Remember this girl is 14yrs old. Days past and i just avoided her until a few days ago i confronted her about it. She was twisting her words, saying maybe she said, she not sure, and if she did shes sorry. I asked her if i have ever touched her or checked her out she said no. I asked her if she think i want to make a move on her she said no. Asked why she said it she said she was just fooling around. I reminded her memory to a time she had my phone, she got a video message and must have forgotten to delete it. This video had her and the same 19yr old friend doing explicit ass dancing also including sex stroking gestures and repeatedly saying “Fuck”. She was surprised i saw that, I didn’t say nothing just ignored it, i was a teen once so i use to do crazy things too no big deal. I told her that if i was a pedophile that video is invitation to move on her, which i never even thought of doing. She said that’s true. She apologized and said she didnt mean to say it, she begged me not to tell her mother because she would be is so much trouble. So my dilemma is should i tell her mother. I don’t want to get her in trouble and this can go the wrong way and create bad blood between us. I have seen step daughters cause marriages to end, i don’t want that but this was a BIG lie and it could have gotten me in trouble and i’m worried she might say shit like that again. I have known her over the years to not be truthful and her mom knows it too. A family member warned me to be careful around her because of her lies. What should I do?",25Aug2018,1
270,"I really need advice.   
I'm 27. For like 3 years I have been sick long term (depression, ptsd, etc), had a small job I had to quit.  
Suddenly this fall I am finding myself in a situation where I got in to a nice school, a one year program. The school has a great sense of community and is situated in a nice town.  
At the same time I got a job for the first time in my 27 year life that I really want. It's got the perfect amount of hours per week and it is just perfect for me.  
What the two choices really mean is not so much of importance as actually making a decision, because I can only choose one of them and it is freaking me out.   
I already started both of them, so one of them will get mad at me for interrupting when I would quit.   
I feel like if I choose one over the other I will miss a great great great great opportunity.   
What makes it even worse, at the school there is someone I started to crush on for the few days I have been there, and it is so rare for me, and not choosing the school would mean not seeing him again, however I can not choose a freaking school over a guy.  


I need advice, how to choose one over the other when they are equal in your head, and you feel like  you will break either way you choose.

271,"I work for a financial planning firm, and a client wanted to wire $12k to her grandson. We reached out to him and got the banking instructions, and I submitted the request to our operations team. The operations team told me to update the request with the wire routing number (not EFT), so I went online and Googled the institution, got the number, and updated the request. The funds were sent.

Fast forward three days, the grandson indicates he has not received the funds. I sent him a copy of the request and asked him to verify the information, and if all looks OK, to reach out to his bank with the reference number.

Well, long story short, that wire routing number was for a bank with a nearly identical name to his. I contacted the client to tell her that the initial routing number was incorrect, the request was being cancelled, and that a new request would be coming her way shortly with the correct number.

I called the custodian and asked them to return the initial wire, which they said can take a few days ""if they can get it."" The grandson confirmed the initial number he gave us was for both EFT and wires.

If they can't get it, my firm will have to pay the client $12k to make her whole again. I'm sure this is a fire-able offense.

I have already taken steps to resolve the issue but imagine I should alert my manager sooner rather than later in case it can't be resolved. I will be unable to sleep or do anything all weekend, I'm sick over it. I have been in the industry for 8 years and with this firm for 3. I know I should have called the bank myself to confirm the wire routing number - I can't believe I let this happen. I guess I need advice on what to say. It truly was an honest mistake.

272,"Has it ever made you feel insecure,when your boyfriend tells you about  his  ex before you?, do you ever wonder if she is prettier, hotter, more smart, who did he feel towards her, etc?  
 

Well my wonderful boyfriend, which is older than me,divorced, no kids   thank god!!, had an ex if you can call it that way Lol before me, so he   had mentioned her when we first started dating, but he did not give  away any  details or a full story about them both, so this past Saturday  he told me how  they began, and he said, they had a nice time together,  went out, but he  would not consider a boyfriend and girlfriend  relationship just by the  way it all turned out.  
 

So on Sunday we go out again, and we where talking about **how we met** and  just having a nice conversation laughing, enjoying  time together, and  he told me that when we began to talk, he travel  back to his hometown  for 2 weeks, we had not even gone on a first date,  we were just talking  on the phone, Whatsapp etc, so when he goes back to his  hometown, he  kind of told his mom he had met me, but he did not wan to  say it was  confirmed that we were going out,cause his mom really wanted a  good  woman for him, so he did not want to give her false hopes about  me, the  point is he said going back to this ex girl he had, that his mom  did  not like her at all, and then he began talking about her again, the   same things he had said on Saturday, that she was too diva, all the   guys were after her, rich man, blah,blah, **they did not even had sex,**she  was nice and all but there was something missing in her.  
 

**THE POINT IS: all of this conversation coming from his mouth made me   insecure, and made me question myself: is she prettier than me? does  he  consider her prettier, better than me? and all these things, plus I  cant  deny I felt a little jealous as well, like if he wanted her badly  or  felt more for her that she for him, etc.**   
 

**But it made me feel this way cause he has her on his Facebook,  besides his family, friends, etc, months ago he had told me his Facebook  username, so we would add each other on Facebook but I never added him,  I just looked for him and went to his profile, but never added him.He  has this girl added still, they had this ''relationship'' in 2017 until  July when it ended or so he told me. I wonder if him having her on his  Facebook, awakens any type of thoughts, what caught my eye is : ''the  same day I saw this girl on his Facebook friends, I decided to click on  her Facebook profile to see who she was, she had recently uploaded a new  picture I believe it was august 13th (Monday) it was public so I was  able to see the picture, and then the weekend that came after that  Monday, is WHEN HE TALKS TO ME ABOUT HER (BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY) HE  MENTIONS ME HOW THEY HAD MET AND WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM)  SO I  WONDER IF HER POSTING THIS PICTURE, IS WHAT MADE HIM REMEMBER WHATEVER  THEY HAD, SO HE STARTED MENTIONING HER TO ME.**  
 

 How can I deal with this insecurity brought up by this  conversation we  had. I did not know much about this, cause he had  mentioned her before  when we began dating but very superficially, no details  or nothing.  but everything made me feel weird, like belittled/ a little jealous,  I  don't know if you can relate.

273,"It's going to be a long story, I'll post tldr at the bottom, if anyone's really bored or anything, read it all xd

Here it is: this summer I went to a camp with loads of other people aged 16-17 (I'm 17). Everything was fun, I've met one girl that my friend knew before, she is very friendly, sympathetic, etc. probably the sweetiest girl I've ever seen in my life and I loved every single minute talking to her. Side note, we got along very well and talked a lot, later on especially about private things, so she has a boyfriend, and had 6 before rofl. We became bros quickly, I got to hug her and I got a look at myself from the woman side, what mattered the most. 

The 3rd day of our discussions I said that I don't have a girlfriend, and indirectly asked her to help find me one xd. She said sure, and later that day introduced me to her bestfriend (Btw, 1st girl has shitloads of bestfriends no matter if they are male or female, basically appreciates everyone). Lets call her Ava. Ava is easily 8/10 (the same rating the 1st girl gave me), I fell in love with her instantly, she is so cute, although we have a big difference in height xd She is 5'7"" and I am 6'7"" (yes, I play basketball). It did not matter, as we arranged a meeting that night at 3am. 

I took like extra 4 shots and got to go, she was a bit drunk aswell. I took her downhill to the river side (we lived in a small village) and we sat on some log with a gap under it. We talked for 3 hours until 6am, she had 2 boyfriends before, lasted 8 months with him. What's weird is that I know most of her friends and especially her 2nd boyfriend, I'm related to him and all of his friends. So we chat about random things, she gets cold, I give her my hoodie, I vape from her, all good. I don't actually remember everything because I was drunk, only today few things got to my mind - she asked to touch my bicep // I dropped spaghetti at one point. She mentioned something simmilar to ,,the nature around us is so beautiful"" and I said ,,you are aswell"" [c r i n g i n g  i n t e r n a l l y]. So thats how our first meeting went, around 6am we went home, she gave me my hoodie back, I went to my apartament and she at hers. 

The next day we had other activities in the camp, I somehow found time to come to her room (she lived with 3 other girls). She had woken up before, but was taking a nap on the bed. I talked with the 1st girl, everything good, then Ava woke up. Bit later she asked her other friend to scratch her head (legit wtf, she said she likes that a lot), then that girl had to leave, somehow we got to the point that I had to continue that, I was sitting on the bed, she put a pillow on my knees and laid on side, I put my hand on her lap and scratched her head with the other and damn, it felt good. Probably one of the first close up interactions with a girl because I'm a pussy ass virgin. Then she had to leave the room, I did aswell. 

At the evening me and my friends were all planning to drink together, her friends did aswell, so I asked if I could join alone. Her tilted friend (she was like that on me because one morning I went to talk with Ava and the 1st girl, got nowhere to sit so I sat on the tilted friends bed and woken her up apparently, that's why she was hating me the next 3 days until camp ended) said no, I was like ok and left to drink with my bros. After that Ava texted me on facebook ,,I'm sorry that *tiltedbitch* got rude to you, I just asked if you can drink with us and she said no"". I replied ,,it's ok, don't worry, we can meetup anytime you want"". Obviously we didn't that day. 

The 4th day of the camp, I went to her room, long story short we partied a bit and I'll be honest, I have shown more interest to the 1st girl than I did to Ava, maybe because she just was more friendly to me. I was lowkey afraid to take Ava for a dance aswell, thats what I regret the most, she maybe thought that I did not make my move and I have no interest into her, although 1st girl told her before that I like her and I think she's beautiful. So yeah, I asked Ava out like twice the 4th day, she rejected everything and ghosted me for some reason.  Later on, going from a shower to my house I saw her with another dude, they had both crossed hands (I don't know how to say it, she got her hand around that dudes elbow). I was a bit devastated. Talked about his to the 1st girl and she said it does not matter that she hangouts with other dudes, I should still make moves. That's true tho.

The 5th day was the same (we had to leave the camp that day), I went to her room, talked with 1st and other girls, she was lowkey sad, I invited her outside once and she obviously said no. I went to her room twice later, because I left my phone and I wanted to invite 1st girl outside. *tiltedbitch* said fuck off out of my room lol. I drank somewhere, Ava completely disappeared out of my radar, the entire day I was so sad thinking what I did wrong. There was like a little party to close the camp in the massive dining room, she was here aswell. As I left with the other boys to clean everything up, I saw that she left her hat (at first I thought it was intentional, but later 1st girl said it wasn't, as Ava overreacted realizing that). I brought the hat to her, she said thanks. We had a little talk, as we were about to separate ways she sad she is good at basketball (I knew that from the 1st girl lol), I suggested her playing together when we come back home from the camp, she said sure.

Evening came, everyone left the camp. When we came back to the city 1st girl invited me to grab a few drinks together, I said sure, as we went to buy the bottle (other dude bought it, its illegal to buy drinks under 18, though that dude was the one that Ava hung out with 1 day before) tiltedbitch said fuck off to me obviously, she demolished me morally. There was 6 of us, Ava and her brother went home, bitch and that dude went somewhere, me and 1st girl went to the bus stop.

We made it to her house, found a nice spot like 500 meters further and drank here, we talked about girls, she told me so much what to do, where to make my moves, I am so thankful to her. I hugged her for like 3 minutes, did not give a shit that she has a boyfriend. So yeah, I did not drink too much, my father brought me home with a car. 

Late night I dm Ava asking her if she wants to go outside tomorrow, she says she maybe has plans or her parents might take her somewhere. I say ok, she says me to hit her up when I will be in the city, close to her (I live in a district). I chat with 1st girl, she says she will go talk with Ava, few minutes later I get a message from 1st girl that Ava is outside with other dude (I know him lol) and calls it gg for me, she says its most likely I'm not going to succed with her, she says she will help me find another girl. I stay on the verge of a breakdown, sadness hits me.

Next morning I workout, I come home, I chat with 1st girl again, I ask her if I should invite Ava outside again or should I just forget her, she says she has no clue because she had an argument with Ava earlier, 1st girl did not pay money she loaned before to her or some shit. I arrange a meeting with 1st girl on Monday.


Now I'm just sitting here cluelessly, not knowing what to do with Ava. Someone, please, give me at least slightest advice judging from the situation.

TL;DR I meet a cute girl by in a summer camp, everything goes uphill in the first 2 days, then she completely ghosts me and hangs out with other boys. At the last days evening, when we get from the camp, I invite her outside and she says she cannot, next day her friend tells me that she is hanging out with other dude. Should I ask her out again or should I just ghost her aswell?",25Aug2018,1

283,"Hello, r/Advice. I'm an exchange student in United States, this is my second week in the US and I am starting to feel isolated and lonely. I had trouble making friends in my home country too, but now with the added layer of difficulty here (cultural differences and language barrier etc.), I am worried that I am going to end up alone for the whole semester.
I know that getting together with people that have similar interests as I do is a good move. But I love playing piano, watching anime and messing with computers more than anything else. Finding people with the same interest or doing some group activity with them seems difficult.
I suffer from social anxiety. So I never really push people into doing things with me thinking that they will have a bad time or just don't like me. Most of my conversations here was around ""where are you from, whats your major"" etc. I genuinely do not know how to further a conversation. And when they become meaningless little chatters like this, I do not enjoy them, so they do not enjoy it too, and it doesn't last.

So, finally, my question is; how can I approach people (without being annoying or creepy), have a nice little conversation, and continue doing that until we can be considered friends? How can I come up with activities to offer someone so that we can get closer?

I mentioned friends mostly but as the title suggest, it can go beyond that if it can too. But I never really had any crushes since my terrible first relationship. What could that mean? (because I haven't felt love in a long time now)",25Aug2018,3

286,"So I’m a 23 year old male, and normally have a quite a high libido, usually wanting to relieve myself once or twice a day atleast. I have always told myself I’ve never wanted to have a one night stand, as personally it kinda grosses me out, and doesn’t seem enjoyable to me, so I stayed a virgin until I was 21, and this girl who wanted to take me on a date, got me way to drunk and didn’t listen to me when I told her that it was too fast and I didn’t want to sleep with her. Fast forwards two years, and I’ve never even hit on any other girls, just because I haven’t found anyone who i thought I’d like to date. On Monday night some random girl started to make out with me when I was again far too drunk and couldn’t really even talk, and I don’t know her name, but she ended up taking me to hers and sleeping with me. Pretty ashamed it happened, but I didn’t think it bothered me that much, just a little disappointed I let it happen. However that day after i still felt normal, high libido in the evening. But I went to a bar to meet my friends, and I hadn’t had much to drink but I met this girl my friend was trying to set me up with, and she was super pretty so I thought I had no chance with, and didn’t try anything just chatted for a bit, but she ended up making out with me a bunch, and we ended up going home together, but neither of us were very drunk, and we had about 2 hours of solid conversation and it was great, and we just cuddled and went to sleep, nothing more happened. Unfortunately she was visiting my friend on holiday and she left that day, so I’m probably never going to see her again, even though I would definitely like too! But now the rest of this week, although I’ve actually felt the happiest I’ve felt for months, I’ve just not had any sort of sex drive whatsoever.

288,"I'm currently 16, almost 17. When I'm 18, which is in a bit more than a year, I plan to get some plastic surgery procedures done. 

People will say that I should wait until I am older but I do not think that there will be a significant change enough in my looks for me to be looking sufficiently better. The nose and chin and jaw are almost completely finished growing by 16, and definitely so by 18 (when I plan to have the surgery). Plus, the more years of my life I am to spend comfortable in my own skin, the better, in my opinion.

Someone did morphs for me so I can see how I'd look better post-surgery.

289,"I’ve recently been having a struggle with my boyfriend that maybe someone can help me understand better.

So a little background information, he does drink and has worked on controlling and cutting back his drinking so that he can enjoy his beers but not get drunk, so he can still go about his day and be productive.

Sometimes, however, he seems pretty drunk, his eyes will be wide and a little glossy, and the sound of his voice kind of changes to more monotone, and he starts to become a little short with people at this point.
When I ask him if he’s drunk, he swears up and down that he’s 100% sober and that the amount
 that he’s drank so far in that day wouldn’t allow him to become drunk or buzzed.  He claims that these changes have to do with when he becomes tired, exhausted, or lack of proper sleep.  I just don’t know what to believe.  We have had many arguments about this and it’s getting to the point where when these changes in him happen and I ask him if he’s sober, he gets angry and is “tired” of me accusing him of being drunk when he swears that he’s 100% unquestionably sober. And says that it’s all in MY head and that I have a predisposition to believe that he is going to mess up his sobriety.

Are there any reasons why he would SEEM drunk, but actually still be sober? Is tiredness really an excuse for this? Or is he likely lying? To clarify, he does have sleep problems where sometimes he isn’t able to sleep for a couple days, or will only get an hour or so.  So I can understand why that may cause these changes in him, maybe sometimes.  
It’s just hard to know what to believe because when he changes, he seems and looks what is in my opinion, to be drunk, but when he’s like this in front of his family, they never say anything when they would be inclined to if they saw it too.

Opinions?

292,"So my friend and her boyfriend were together for 3 years and they broke up for about 1 month or more  and then got back together like a week or 2 ago. We will call my friend Ally and the guy Matt. About a few weeks after Ally and Matt broke up, Matt and I saw a movie because we both like superhero movies and we saw it AS FRIENDS. Matt and I have been friends for like a year since we work together, Ally used to work there as well. I told Matt I enjoy golf so then Matt asked if I wanted to golf sometime soon so we went and golfed and it was just a friend thing. Well Ally and I were hanging out a few days ago and I told her in person that nothing went on between Matt and I during their time broken up and she seemed like it wasn't a big deal but she also said ""well we weren't together so it wouldn't have mattered"" and then I said again that there was nothing going on and she was like ""yeah I know I was just kidding."" I felt like she still kind of had it on her mind but she just let it go and everything was fine. Well last night Matt text me and said Ally asked him if Matt liked me. Let me quickly add in that a few months back when Ally and Matt were together, she had joked about Matt and I dating, Matt claims that Ally had issues with Matt and I texting and stuff. Continuing the story... then this morning Ally told me that ever since she found out about us golfing together(through text) she was bothered by the fact that we went together because she felt like I was hiding it from her on my snap story. All I posted on my story was a pic of the golf place and I didn't feel like I needed to post anything else, it wasn't me trying to cover anything up. I then replied by telling her that I probably just never posted anything further on my story because I didn't really think to and that I was not trying to hide anything from her. I have yet to hear from her because she hasn't said anything else/replied. We have plans for this coming week to do stuff but I guess I shouldn't talk to her unless she talks to me. I just hate being in this situation because they are both my friend and it just makes stuff feel really weird because she knows I am a good friend.

295,"So I'm in kind of a weird position. A good friend of mine stopped talking to me a few months ago and said they needed time to figure out if they wanted to be friends still. I waited a while but never heard from them and eventually walked away from the relationship because our relationship was negatively affecting me and they weren't treating me right. I took my time away and worked to get over the situation. They ended up saying that they wanted to be friends again but by then I had already been moving on and was putting things behind me. I figured I'd give myself more time to figure out if I wanted to try and work things out or if I should move on. I came to the conclusion that next time I was in the same town as them I'd ask them if they wanted to talk. A week before I was supposed to be in town I checked their social media accounts to check in before texting them and saw some bitter and kind of shitty posts about me. I decided to not message them. I've been doing well without the negative relationship and I wasn't interested in talking to someone who was going to be that bitter so I figured they needed more time alone.

302,"So I met this guy while playing MTG a few moths back. He was pretty nice and was really good at the game, I was pretty new and I wanted to get better. He offered to help me out, so we exchanged numbers and we hung out a few times and played a lot of magic. 

 His situation was definitely pretty weird. What he told me was:  he had just graduated culinary school and he was a manager of some bar back in his hometown, and he decided to drop everything and move to my city in pursuit of a better life. He said that he basically emptied his bank account for the plane ticket and had a place to stay lined up for a few weeks. And since he got to the city he was basically looking for jobs and trying to find a place to stay until he got a decent job and enough money to get his own place. This was about a month ago. I should also probably mention that I work in tech and make a pretty decent amount of money. Not trying to brag or anything, but It's kind of important to the story. 

I kept my distance a bit at first because I have had a lot of bad experiences with liars and people trying to take advantage of me. But now he definitely has a good job, he is working as a manager at a super fancy 5 star restaurant in my city. I was definitely able to confirm that. He is making a decent bit of money now and he offered to help me with my rent if I let him stay at my place for a month or so. I'm paying out the ass for rent, so I agreed and he has been staying at my place for about a week. Overall, he has been a pretty ideal roommate and a decent friend. He works a lot, probably like 60 hours per week and he has about 1.5 hour commute on top of that. The only time he has every asked me for  money was to help him put some on his transit card so he can get to work. Overall the impression I get is that he is working hard to make it in the big city and is overall a pretty decent person.

But I'm not so naive as to not have any suspicions about someone with such a shady back story. I took a picture of his ID when he wasn't looking a few days ago and have been trying to get some more info on this guy. Lo an behold I found him the Michigan sex offender registration . He was convicted in 2010 

  
750.520G1 - CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO COMMIT SEXUAL PENETRATION 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have no idea what actually happened. I haven't been able to get any more details about the specifics of the case, other than that he pled  **Nolo Contendere.** I don't know if this is a violent person. Here is what I do know. 

* This happened 8 years ago, people can change a lot in 8 years 
* This guy is trying really hard. Waking up early, 3 hour round trip to work, super long shifts. 
* He has overall been a good friend to me.
* He is a little bit weird around women. Nothing TOO terrible but maybe a bit creepy depending on who you ask. Always going in for an extra hug, that kind of thing. 
* He stopped a homeless dude from stealing from our local magic shop 

So I don't know what to do. Do I just play my hand and tell him that I know and see how he reacts? Am I entitled to knowing the details of his past at all? Do I believe that this was just on mistake 8 years ago? We both share a lot of the same friends and play at the same game shop, so I'm really not trying to start any fires here. But I would really like to know if he is violating his parole by living here in Seattle. I don't know what to do. Hence I ask you fine people.

She just wants to do expensive stuff like shopping or going out to eat and I just don't have the money to do that on a regular basis. Whenever I try to talk to her at home, she's just playing with her mobile phone all the time, scrolling through instagram. 

So I need some preferably cheap ideas for spending time with her, before we grow apart even more. Any advice?",25Aug2018,1
309,"I think I’m finally content with life. 
To start off, I’m about to enter my first day of Uni and I see it as an outlet. It’s 4 hours away from home so I’m off to a good start. Before coming to UNI I had attempted suicide by overdose and failed but the next three days were spent with me vomiting  and headaches . I no longer felt the need to live. 
Since then, I’ve become more healthy in the sense that I only need what’s necessary/don’t bother with any type of junk food or drink that isn’t water. I no longer find enjoyment in it. I want to die. I want to die so badly but I can’t bring my self to harm my self. It’s why I overdosed, because I wouldn’t have to slice my wrists. I’m thinking of starting to hitchhike and leave my state. To leave and hitchhike hundreds of miles away and start off my new life. I’m not picky, I don’t want a high paying job, just one that’ll afford a roof over my head.  I no longer fear death, so I don’t see the need to fear in others. If I get ran over, I get ran over. If I get murdered, I get murdered. I’m just cautious over the thought  of  how much pain a sadist might put me through until they decide to kill me. 

Is there anything I might need that isn’t a compass/map/basic clothing? I have a soap and a tooth brush. Am I an idiot? I see no other way to escape and don’t feel the need to stay in UNI, I have good grades but I can’t see my self in another classroom. ",25Aug2018,0
310,"Over a month ago, I posted about this same thing. Looking back on it, I realize that I spent too much time waxing poetic about how lonely I feel and in doing so left out some important stuff and also didn't describe my current situation well enough, so I decided to come back and fix that by making a more detailed post.

Before I describe the luck (or lack thereof) I've had with women, let's get the basic info out of the way. As the title says, I'm a 24 yr old guy. I haven't held a job in my life to this point, nor have I had any real post high school education apart from a year at a broadcasting school. I'm still living at home, but I'm trying to take steps to move out. I got my driver's license just this summer, but to my disappointment that hasn't changed anything.  Lastly, I'm autistic but it's internal enough that you wouldn't be able to tell unless i told you. I never did any special education classes and graduated with honors from high school. I've also never considered myself a friends person.

As I said in the last post, I have never had a girlfriend before in my life. I've never even been on a date or even kissed by a girl. Now, with all that out of the way allow me to describe my (rather futile) history with women and you'll see why.

It all started back in junior high school.. That was when I first got the urge to go after girls. Now, mind you, I'm autistic so social skills weren't really my forte (they still kind of aren't but I have gotten better). What resulted was that I went after them in totally the wrong way. I became clingy and might I say stalker-like, which obviously isn't a good thing at all. I eventually gave that up by the time freshman year of high school rolled around. I convinced myself that I didn't have a way with women at all and that no woman would want to date a guy like me.

Since high school I've had three encounters with girls that I can recall that never got anywhere. I might be missing a couple, but these are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. I met all three through church since that's really the only social activity I remotely participate in. All three of these girls were/are approximately my age. Anyway, here we go:

Girl #1 - I met this girl in sunday school at a fairly large church that me and my parents attended before we moved to where we live now. I didn't talk to her all that much but I kept her on my mind for many weeks. I was actually just about to ask her out when one Sunday she brings a guy with her to sunday school. Although she didn't say as much, I could tell that he was her boyfriend. So all thoughts of going out with her ended then and there, much to my disappointment.

Girl #2 -  I met this girl at a Memorial Day picnic held by the church (same church as Girl #1). We had a very nice conversation while we were watching the younger kids play at a playground nearby. To this day I believe it is the longest conversation I've had with a girl outside of my family. Anyway, we seemed to hitting it off somewhat and had a very pleasant talk. After the picnic was over, I really looked forward to seeing her again. Well, I never did. A couple of months later (I think) I was shocked to read in the church bulletin that she had gotten married. She had failed to tell me she was engaged. Again, I was hugely disappointed.

Girl #3 - This one never even got off the ground. I saw her (in church, yet again) soon after me and my parents moved to where we live currently. As with Girl #1, she seemed (and is) very nice and I could see me going out with her. It wasn't long before I learned that she was engaged to another guy at the church. Again, huge disappointment. To their credit, they are now happily married.

So that's three girls, all taken, and two in a row that were engaged. That's some very horrible luck, wouldn't you agree? These events only further convinced me that I don't have a way with women at all.

Because of all of that, I feel doomed to be single for the rest of my life, which isn't what I want. One of my goals in life (not the only goal of course, but a major one nonetheless) is to one day get married and have a family. I know full well that won't happen until I get my act together regarding women.

My sister (who is a couple of years older than me) got married four years ago this December, and my brother-in-law is a very cool guy, and they are happily married. However, to this point they have not shown any outward interest in starting a family. I'm not going to hold it against them, it is their decision after all, but my mom has lamented (perhaps jokingly but you never know) on at least a couple of occasions that she will never be a grandmother. It seems at this point that I will have to be one to give my parents grandchildren. This thought has caused me to further despair about my bad luck with women, as my parents really do deserve grandchildren

My life feels so empty without someone to love, and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about all this to some degree. A few of my high school classmates are either married or engaged to be married. A few others just have a significant other. It genuinely hurts me inside to know that I have so much love to give but no one to give it to. I so desperately want to feel a woman's love. I've never felt love from anyone else other than a family member.

Here are a couple other things about me that might prove relevant. My interests include history, gaming, and technology (mostly computers). I don't put much stock in dating apps or going to bars and the like.

There's a hole in my life that needs to be filled. I don't want be lonely for the rest of my life. I feel time is running out on me.

If you've made it this far, you are to be congratulated. Any advice you people can give me is greatly appreciated. I'll check back on a semi-regular basis and answer any questions, if anyone has any. I will also try to answer messages in a timely manner.

Thank you all for reading and have a nice day.",25Aug2018,1
311,"I am a 20 yr old male, working but not in college.

313,"(TL; DR at bottom) 

My son had  not a device for months  until my husband was able to get him a new tablet a few days ago. During these months  my TV was always on Ryan's toy review during the time TV is allowed for him.  So if i ever watched a show, it was on my phone.  


On top of  Last year my husband  only had to work until 11 at night so  I let him watch TV and still any and all things I ever watched was my phone. 






Now I have my TV back since I told my son he will now be watching everything on his new  tablet. Also my husband works nightshift from 5pm-5am  and so now the only time I have to watch stuff on my phone is at  night time when he is off, but I   am struggling. I tried to start putting YouTube on TV and watch wrestling, or whatever, but I find it hard to pay attention. I sit in a ""rocking chair"" besides the couch to watch TV  and that helped a little bit especially when I want to push myself to watch a wrestling shows on my tv, but at times I find myself losing focus, and the phone in my hand or mind my wandering..  



Before this, I never had a problem watching shows on my actual TV and never lost attention and my phone was never in my hand. 

So now it looks like I'm just doomed and if I want to ever to enjoy and want to actually pay attention I now have to watch it on my phone and will never be able to watch TV again  Or is their a way to retrain to watch tv on my tv again? 

TL; DR: I have realized that when I watch shows on my phone I never have a problem with paying attention or anything. I am capable of watching a  show or  even binge watching shows easily,  But never on my actual TV. When I try to watch shows on my actual TV , I lose focus, can no longer pay attention  to the show and it ends up being mainly background noise as I find myself on my phone. ",25Aug2018,0

316,"I had a rather rough upbringing. Lost my father to suicide at 10. My mother wasn't working at that time and my family was poor financially since I was a baby (to the point where they couldn't afford film, so I have literally a handful of baby photos). I have an older sibling who is 3.5 years older than me. He never has done much for family. I grew up looking after my grandmother and mother, basically. My childhood was quick and full of responsibility early on. I do ""live at home"", but I'm not a mooch. I do so because I'm not married (at least, for now) and prefer to give my money to family rather than give rent to some stranger. I fix stuff around the house, pay for probably $600-$800 of bills/groceries/gas per month, etc. I look after my 83 year old grandmother who is paranoid schizophrenic, has high anxiety and such. My mother is 60 and I help her mostly with certain things physically around the house, but she's working nearly full-time. She just can't make it financially on her own at the time, struggles with certain tics that she has developed over the years, has pretty bad OCD and just basically can't work a higher paying job because she can't multi-task.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some life/career advice. I'm a 35 year old guy trying to figure out what field to focus on and stick with. I graduated from high school and dove into working in the early 2000's. I struggled a lot in high school with cognitive issues and couldn't ""get"" the work. I was tired all day. It wasn't until early 2018 (at 35 years old) that they finally figured out that I have sleep issues/possible sleep apnea.  I have had all sorts of health tests, blood work, a sleep study and also a major sinus surgery a month ago. We're still figuring out the rest of the issues, but my life and outlook is starting to improve. I've missed a good 20 years or more of ""good"" sleep and I also wasn't breathing at full capacity every day (had a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates that doctors missed for all of those years). I have generally not been able to advance into a position like most people my age because of those struggles. I had a speech impediment until about 28 years old when I had to pay out $14,000 for dental work (was missing some teeth that never existed to come in). Somehow - I don't know how - I managed to go through a lot of Sales and Customer Service-related jobs with that impediment. I also have tibial torsion in one leg (rotated tibia bone that makes the left leg out-toe a good bit more than normal), but it doesn't affect my actual moving. I just walk a little funny on that leg and have to try to compensate and move it as straight as possible with each step to walk more normally. I've been to an orthopedic surgeon who didn't recommend surgery and said that it wasn't worth the money and may make things worse or cause problems elsewhere. In spite of all of that, I presently walk between 4 and 8 miles per day at my current job. This past week I covered 40 miles. I'm disappointed with the pay and lack of advancement there and seeking advice as to what field might be best for me. I'm also running circles around my coworkers. My manager comes to me asking for computer/system advice sometimes and I get lots of compliments from coworkers. I type over 100 words per minute, but I'm not a Data Entry type of person and my 10-key isn't very good. While I like working on the computer (and I do hours of that at my current job) updating databases, entering client info and such...I don't think I'd be too suited for an office job. I like to be active and don't like to sit for too long. At the same time, I'm walking way too much at my current job when combined with my sleep struggles and general lack of energy as I'm bouncing back from all of this. Docs are a little puzzled. I've had an issue with my tongue/speech since I was an early teenager. The ENT doc said I might want to see a speech specialist because my tongue ""looks a bit big"" and I bite it and get sores and such on it on a regular basis because of that. That makes it difficult to speak properly at work and some days I'm in a lot of pain. So a job where I need to talk on the phone a lot isn't exactly a good idea, for instance. I have days when I struggle to speak properly to answer the phone at work and other days it is fine. Cognitive issues still exist a little presently, so driving is still kind of dangerous for me and I'm not as focused, but yet alert and able to do complex tasks.

 I'm a very frugal guy. I don't want the newest car and prefer a used car. I don't need the latest and greatest of everything. I like the little things in life that are free, so my lifestyle doesn't require as much money as the ""average"" person in the US. I'm just trying to figure out what is next given my personal struggles. I get so frustrated sometimes because I put so much into life and other people seem to breeze through without those physical struggles and succeed because of it. I try not to look at the negative or compare myself to them, however.

What is my best bet going on my previous experience alone? I'm thinking Production/Manufacturing. Is my best bet going to be through another staffing agency and getting hired on directly into a position? I have a lot of retail warehouse experience with unloading trucks and such, but most of them want forklift experience and I don't care for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a staggered and odd work history in various fields:

Since 03/2017, I have been working as a contractor for a mail company. They have been on-site for about 17 years at one of the largest beverage companies in the world. It is their corporate office headquarters for worldwide operations, so we're talking about 4,000 corporate people ranging from admins/executive admins to executives, managers of operations, group directors, project managers, VP's, CEO's of various departments/restaurants that the beverage company partners with and that sort of thing. I'm a Mail Coordinator/Floor Coordinator and interact with those people daily. When they move to other offices/buildings, I have to research them and update the databases with the new info. So I'm a mailman/package delivery guy for UPS, DHL, FedEx and USPS. I deliver the mail, set up mailboxes for clients, maintain supplies in 7 big mail rooms, troubleshoot/fill supplies for 16 copiers spread over 7 floors. On my 7 floors, I have about 1,000 clients, many of which I know by name. For all of that, I get about $25K per year. Yes, not much at all. Some of my coworkers have been with the company for years before they got a raise. I'm not going to be that person. The company gave a 25 cent raise to some of the workers before and apparently took it back. So yeah, I'm not sticking around for that nonsense. 

An envelope printing company: Offset Press Operator 2016 - 2017 (quit after 90 days because they didn't care about health and the process for dealing with chemicals was unsafe)

Staffing company for 6 months/Digital security company direct-hire afterwards:  Production Machine Operator  08/2015 - 10/2016. Operated a 25-foot machine that manufactured and encoded credit cards.

Publix Supermarkets: Stock Clerk 2011 - 2013; 2013 - 2015 Meat Clerk (machine operator - food packaging/pricing machine)

Airport electronics store: Sales Associate - 2009 - 2011

Circuit City: Sales Associate/Warehouse Associate  08/2008 - 01/2009

Office Depot: Sales Associate/Print Center Associate - 2005 - 2007

&amp;#x200B;

I'm basically trying to figure out what would be best. I have a lot of real-world work experience, but zero desire to go to college. I know that might be ""the best bet"" for a more stable financial future. I'm looking more so at working my way up within a company, instead. I had massive anxiety from the second grade in elementary school all the way through high school and it was the reason why I hated school so much, in addition to the speech impediment, odd way of walking that people frequently referenced, etc. I even have corporate clients at work stare at my left leg when they pass me in the hall, so it isn't just ""in my head"". I don't let that get to me. That same condition with my left leg makes it uncomfortable to drive a long distance in the car, so that's frustrating. I have no interest in the USPS as an employer and their backlog for potential employees is long, anyway.

319,"I posted elsewhere, but it was removed. I would appreciate more advice. It's my day off and I have nothing to do but sit here and think. 

My [35M] wife [33F] and I have been together for almost three years. Our backstory is long and convoluted, but she means everything to me and, while I still sometimes worry she'll leave me for someone smarter, she shows me how much she cares about me every chance she gets. 

She has a five-year-old from a previous relationship. Shortly after we first met, she was left full guardianship over her ""niece,"" who is the coolest fourteen-year-old ever. I love these kids. 

My wife got pregnant early on. It was an accident, but we were both very happy. I've always wanted a family. And now we could add something that was both of ours to the one we had.  

Unfortunately, she lost the baby with two months to spare. That was in September. 

She has been my fucking rock through this whole thing. We lost the baby on a Tuesday. So, she set up standing Tuesday check-ins (she studied psychology for a while), and we talked about it to death (pun only slightly intended). I told her that I figured it was my fault. She never said it was, but never said it wasn't. 

Let me back up a second. My wife is the best communicator I've ever met. Any issue she has, it's discussed and resolved. Seriously, I haven't once gone to bed angry. And she's never hurt me with her words. She chooses them very carefully. 

Which brings me to this morning. She left for work around 6, so I decided to browse Reddit. We both have accounts. She rarely checks hers and I'm not using a throwaway because I'll be talking to her about this as soon as she's home. I just want some advice beforehand. 

I had answered a question about listening being a high priority skill in communication. My wife taught me that. Listen while someone's talking and then formulate a response once they're done. It eliminates interruption and stuttering. 

Anyway, I mentioned something about the loss of our baby and how we've been trying for another since. 

Apparently, my buddy [31M] who works with her (he's her surgeon and she's a doctor) decided to create an account so he could annoy the hell out of me 24/7. He mentions something about it being difficult for us to conceive because of PCOS. I ask him what that means, but he goes silent. So, I look it up. 

It means my wife is going to have issues conceiving. I've since learned that it isn't as big of an issue as I'd originally thought, considering she does already have a biological child. But my problem is that she never told me this. 

Now, neither of them are answering their phones. They're probably in surgery, which means the radio silence could go on for HOURS. 

All of this happened just now and I'm freaking out. Why the fuck wouldn't she tell me this? There has been so much opportunity. I don't understand. 

I think I'm in shock, because I'm kind of numb right now. I have no idea what I'm supposed to feel. But I know myself well enough to know this state won't last. I'm going to get really mad. Like, break something mad. I think I want to send the kids out somewhere. She doesn't get off until 11pm, so I'm just gonna sit here and stew the whole time. 

But, here's the thing. I adore this woman. She means the world to me. But...this sucks. Lying is something I already hate. But she also lead me to believe it was my fault we lost the baby. She allowed me to kill myself a little more every time a test came back negative. Every time she'd tell me she was menstruating. It was my fault. I wasn't a man. I couldn't do what I was biologically wired to. What was I good for?

And now I'm starting to feel angry. Please help. I don't know what to do. 

Tl;Dr: wife and I lost a baby back in September. Been trying since and nothing. I think it's my fault until I accidentally find out she has issues that would make carrying a child to term almost impossible. She never told me. Don't know what to do.

334,I’ve just experienced my first week in senior high and there’s this girl that is showing interest in me. We’re making eye contact a lot and in ways that you can’t do it by mistake like accidentally looking over. She’s turning around in class to look.

I know exactly why.

336,"I'm sorry this is so long there was a fair amount of back story to it. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for around 10 months and he's so amazing. He's kind and loyal and never ceases saying how much he loves me. We really click and have so much fun together. 

One issue is that I'm currently studying in England but my family lives in Germany. This means during the holidays I go home and we spend long periods of time apart. 

During this summer I've slowly started feeling like something isn't right. I feel like there's something missing, like a spark. I hate to say this but I don't often yearn to be with him sexually even though he's the best I've ever had. It's just become quite predictable. This isn't just his fault, it's also partly mine because before him I wasn't very sexually experienced and that makes me hesitant to try things or insecure that I'm not good enough or I'm doing something wrong. 

My other big issue is I have a massive crush on one of my friends. I've known him longer than my boyfriend, about 2 years longer. We lived in the same flat in my first year of uni, along with a bunch of others. We instantly clicked as friends, we had similar interests. We would stay up until late hours talking about music in our kitchen. He made me laugh so much. He wasn't my usual preference physically but that didn't really matter. I instantly felt comfortable with him. Whenever I see him now all those feelings come rushing back. We innocently flirt/banter with each other and not too long ago we both admitted to having crushes on each other in first year uni. 

This all of a sudden made it so much real for me. I had never admitted it to myself or anyone else before. I remember our first week of uni the other guys in our flat saw our instant connection and spread amongst the others that we both liked each other and that we had both admitted it to them. Something neither of us had done. Everyone made a big deal about it and a girl in our flat sat us both down and asked us flat out. We both denied it and said it was just friendship. That was partly why I carried on denying it. I was scared it was just me that was feeling it. I've always had self esteem issues and I figured he didn't find me phsycially attractive. 

So our first year went on with us both keeping our feelings to ourselves. We carried on having an amazing friendship. I can honestly say I've never bonded with anyone so quickly in my life. 

First year ended and I didn't see him a lot. Second year flew by and we hadn't met up once. Third year came and I knew I wanted to start hanging out with him again. He came on some nights out and all was good. On one particular night out we confessed our crushes to each other. Both of us talked of them as if they were in the past. I guess we had to because by that time I was with my current boyfriend. 

Cut to now. I keep getting excited about being back at uni for a number of things. This guy being one of them. Sometimes more than my boyfriend which sounds so fucking shit of me. 

I'm just so confused right now. Earlier this year I thought I had fallen in love with my current boyfriend. I was sure of it. But this summer it's slowly felt like I was wrong and I don't know whether to blame it on myself, him, both of us, the distance or just things fizzling out. 

Reading this back it sounds like an obvious problem. That I like the other guy more than my boyfriend but it's more like I like them equally for different things. Also the added mystery of the other guy sometimes makes him seem more exciting but essentially I'm torn.

The other thing is, sometimes I miss being single. I'm one for going out a lot and meeting new people. Before I got in a relationship I would frequently go out and flirt with guys, maybe kiss them, rarely be fully intimate with them, but sometimes. I still go out a lot and I feel the difference. I feel like I'm constantly watching what I do. Is what I'm doing flirting? Should I be talking to a guy even though I know I would never cheat? Can I accept free drinks if they are being bought for me and my friends? I always thought it was innocent if I had no intentions of becoming intimate with anyone but talking to my boyfriend he has a different idea which makes me paranoid. 

Just a disclaimer I've never cheated and I never would. I could never do that to him. But there have been times when I've thought about kissing/sleeping with other people. I can't help it popping in my head. I know it happens to everyone. It's just more my feelings for my friend and me missing being single sometimes that makes me skeptical and paranoid. 

I'm not making any rash decisions yet because I have a feeling the distance is partly the problem. I go back to uni in September so it's not too far away. I wouldn't give up on my boyfriend just because of a few concerns. If I go back and things return to how they were then it's all good, if not.. I don't know what will happen. 

If anyone has any insight or opinions please let me know. Even if they are harsh, I can take it. ",25Aug2018,1

341,"I currently have my own business with 2 partners that is doing pretty well.
We have been in talks of me leaving the company and selling my share to them. It's kind of hard to explain why I am leaving my own company, despite it being successful and only getting bigger. But I feel like  it's not challenging enough for me and I am stuck in a rut and not learning and growing, so I want to go work for another company where I can learn and cover up my ""weak spots"" in areas I don't know well.

My partners are supportive of my decision and said there's an ownership spot for me if I ever decide to come back, even if it's years down the line.

Anyway, on to the topic of the title.
A CEO of a very big and well-known company in our industry somehow got wind of me leaving my company and looking for a job (not sure how since only a few people know right now), and called me to ask for a meeting. I met with him and he offered me a very high-paying job running one of his company's departments. I was taken aback my this offer. It is very lucrative and a position most people would kill for. However, I personally believe I am not qualified. I know this CEO from my previous job, where we would interact constantly, so he knows my experience for the most part, which is why it is surprising that he offered this position to me.

I am not sure what to do. I feel like even though I am under-qualified, I can read and study and learn what I need to, and in a few months be somewhat qualified. They also said they will train me. I did want a challenging job and this job will definitely be tough.

My friends and family think I would be stupid to not take the job, and the worst-case scenario would be I get fired but would still learn a lot during my time there even if that happens. They also think I AM qualified and just have low self-confidence, which I admit has always been a personal issue for me.

I was thinking of requesting another meeting and being honest to the CEO with my skills and what he expects, just so there are no surprises, would that be the best way to go about this?

Another complication is that if I take this position, I will technically be competing against the company I started, so that makes things even weirder for me.

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my master's program and have been offered financial aid that can more than cover my expenses. I have about $5,300 saved up in my bank account right now, and I'm thinking of taking out excess loans to save up more money for medical school apps which are EXTREMELY expensive. I'm not doing anything else with the money, so I'll send it back to my loan servicer when I'm done with applications and everything, but I feel like this may be the easiest way to make sure I can afford applying to medical school without having to go through credit checks and stuff with a private lender. I'm not worried about the few hundred dollars that are lost here and there because of fees and interest, but I don't want to burden my parents with this expense, and don't think I'll be able to save up enough from work by the time the application opens next year because of school and other expenses. Should I take out the extra money as a safety precaution? Thank you!",25Aug2018,1

346,"Hi,

I would love some advice, since I feel very stuck right now. I am in the process of writing my bachelor thesis right now, in a subject that I feel less than confident in (which makes it a lot worse..).

I still live with my parents, which I never got along with to begin with (both are very abusive). But since I live in a very expensive city I can't afford to move out. Now, a flat in our appartment building is free for rent and it was offered to me for a very cheap price (cheap only in comparison..It's still 900 dollars per month just for rent). 

&amp;#x200B;

I could move in with someone, but the problem is that I got the offer today and they asked me to make a decision by tomorrow (no one can find someone to live with that quick...)I was saving up to travel to America for the very first time and in my life (I haven't had a vacation in four years) and also consult a private doctor because I struggle with a chronic illness that just seems to get worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And if anyone would move into the flat in the building I wouldn't care and just stay with my parents and later move to a worse area. But if I don't take the place, they asked the landlord to let my cousin move in. I come from a pretty big family and he was always everyone's favorite since he is the only boy from all of my cousins. No matter what he does, he gets compliments, for the most ridiculous things. He dropped out of uni and my mom was praising him for making money and complaining why I'm not doing it(more like screaming at me). And when we were kids, he would beat me up all the time. He never even got screamed at for it and when I fought back I got screamed it. What I'm trying to say is that life is even worse for me when he's around. If he would live in the same house I wouldn't know how to cope with that, since it's already pretty bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Options:

1) be broke for some time, look for rommates and struggle

2) have my asshole cousin live in the same house and thus have my parents stress me out even more

347,"I am going to be posting this in multiple r/. Because I am desperate and out of options. This is a little long, so feel free to scroll down to the TLDR.

A little bit about us.
I am disabled, jobless and battling the system for approval of benefits. I have multiple physical and mental illnesses. Mainly severe depression, PTSD, Polycystic Ovaries and Ulcerative Colitis.
My boyfriend is transgender. He has mild autism, depression, PTSD and scoliosis. But he is able to work and assists with paying rent.

We recently moved in to an apartment in with our emotional support dog and my best friend of 14 years. We were all excited to get away from our families and things were going great for the first few weeks that we lived together. But everything has changed. And my boyfriend and I are now in constant stress and fear.

I feel like I've been lied to and manipulated the entirety of my friendship with my best friend. We saw each other as family and she always advocated for my struggles and hoped she could do something to help me. But now she has become the source of all my stress and current pain. If I knew she acted like this behind closed doors, I would have never moved in with her.

She gets angry easily. Over the smallest things. We both have to tip toe around her with a fake happy face, trying to avoid upsetting her but it never works. When she gets angry she slams things around, she groans and sighs loudly at everything, she angrily whispers horrible things that she believes we can't hear her say, but we hear her 85% of the time. She slams doors. She slams my mouse constantly when using my computer. But she is also has silent anger. Where she won't say a word to you if you ask what's wrong or what happened or how you can help. And that may be the most frustrating thing of all. That she doesn't commicate with us. She doesn't say what is wrong. And then she takes that anger out on us. I don't even understand why she is angry! None of us do anything to set her off. We cater to her every whim. She acts like a brat. Yelling at my dog when he does normal things a dog does, aka, literally just staring at her. Standing up when he hears her getting food. To which she's said, ""Leave me alone! You only want me when you want things from me. Like everyone else."" And he does the occasional, ""Whose coming in?"" growl when she comes home. That he also does to my boyfriend when he gets home too. But she's convinced the dog hates her. Even when he comes over to her for affection. 

She barely lets me touch my computer and sits there groaning and sighing if I'm on it because she wants to play 1 singular game on my computer for hours. I ask her not to eat at the desk. She does anyway, I ask her to ask us if she can use the computer first because we have a lot of things we like to do on there. But she never asks. And if she is using it and I ask if I can, she says ""You are home all day and I never get to play."" I am either asleep or cleaning the apartment that she doesn't help clean when she is at work. Then when she comes home she wants to watch a show with me for hours, and then she gets on the computer for hours until she goes to sleep. Leaving me maybe 3 hours or 0 hours to do things. I have touched my computer 4 times this month alone. I have things to do on it. She's been on it everyday but 1. And the day that she didn't use it, which was today, where I was spending time with my friends who I haven't hung out with for months, she was angry in the background, whispering with venom in her tone and slammed the door hard as she went in her room. Only for her to not answer me when I ask whats wrong. And then find out later from my boyfriend that she erased herself from the group drawing he made of us from our whiteboard and said, ""I don't matter."" when asked what happens. What the fuck does she mean? I spent an hour with my other friends while I spend 10 hours a day with her in attempts to please her. What is her problem!?

She doesn't clean. I'm always cleaning after her. She doesn't take out the trash. She complains there is no room in the freezer and fridge for her food when my boyfriend and I only have a plate of pizza left overs and a couple yogurt in there and all the rest of the food is overflood with her things. 

We are all just completely stressed. When she isn't home, everything is amazing. We feel happy and free. But the moment she's home. Its all us in nerves and her painful anger. I can't even be sad around her. She groaned when I started crying the other day because I was in a lot of pain and asked my boyfriend for a hug. And she gets mad when I talk low when I'm super depressed.

TLDR;

Point of all this is. We can't live with her anymore. She is giving us too much stress. Our PTSD is going haywire when she is around. We want to leave, but my parents won't allow us to move back with them. We'd love to kick her out but then we won't be able to pay rent. We both have no other friends in the area. And the portion of the rent she can afford is 1k. While my boyfriend pays 640, plus 75 for Wifi because he can't afford more than that for now. Not to mention the lease we have for a year that she is the holder of. I was hoping when and if I finally get disability, that my boyfriend and I would be able to live together without her, but who knows how long that is going to be. We really don't know what to do. We are stuck in this horrible situation and its effecting our already deteriorating mental health. Please. If anyone knows what we can do, please please help us! If we were able to find somewhere else to go or have someone move in with us that would be ideal, but we literally have no way of that happening that we know us. Please. Help! We don't know what to do!",25Aug2018,0
348,"hi, I'll start with introducing myself real quick.
I'm female, 17, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 

so, what I'm asking advice on is feeling unwanted by my parents. what I mean to ask is if the way they're behaving is normal and I'm just overeating or not.

so, my parents are both my biological ones, and have been married for 25+ years.

while I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety, I've closed off myself to them for a while, and they've been doing their best to talk to me. 

now that I've recovered somewhat, I've decided to talk to them and spend more time with them, and now that I've started talking I feel like I'm being ignored, most of the time while I'm telling them something either my mother or father will interrupt talking about something completely different and forgetting what I was saying making me sit and be ignored until they've stopped talking. 

the things that they talk about are things I cannot talk about such as their co workers, bills or something personal that I feel uncomfortable commenting on.

since the severe depression I've not eaten in the same room as them, and now I've decided to do so, when I told them they seemed happy. but I've noticed the times I've been in the room everything was quiet, no one asked questions and when I asked them how was work or something they'd reply with very short answers. 

but when I left the room I heard them talking between themselves, and when I enter the room again everything is silent.

lately all the conversations that happens between me and my parents are just greetings and me asking how was work.

I have told them that I was feeling unwanted, but they quickly said that I was being silly and moved on from the conversation to something else completely.

I've never felt so unwanted in my life. I feel like an intruder in this family.

I know for a lot of people the biggest issue in their relationship is that their SO doesn't take their concerns seriously but me (22f) and my bf (27m) have the opposite problem. The issue is that when I raise things in the relationship that I may want to change/ are bothering me, he becomes (in my opinion) overly apologetic and upset, even if I approach the subject as delicately as I can and make it clear that it's not his fault.

For example, my yearly income is less than half of his, but I finish work earlier so it usually ends up that I do all the grocery shopping and plan and prepare all the meals. I mentioned to him the financial and mental strain this was putting me under, hoping to come up with a plan to share the burden, but he just got very upset and apologised profusely for putting me under that pressure and insisting he didn't know what I was going through. I ended up comforting him, and insisted that it really wasn't a big deal at all (because it really wasn't as big a deal as he seemed to think). He eventually calmed down, but I've been to scared to bring it up since, for fear of upsetting him, so nothing has really been resolved. 

I'm normally someone who is very good at communicating what's bothering me, but I realise I've learned to suppress these concerns for fear of hurting my boyfriend and starting a huge drama where I am then forced to abandon my own worries to comfort him. It's just way too emotionally draining. I've brought up with him how these responses make me feel kind of stifled, but it ironically just sparks the same emotional, apologetic response. Making him feel guilty makes me feel guilty too, but I also hate feeling constantly guilty for just wanting to talk about my feelings. I just don't really know what to do.

357,"What happened:

I'm a now sophomores in college and was caught cheating the end of last year on a 8 page essay. I stole several paragraphs worth of work and tried to conceal this.

I received an email staying my professor had found this errors and will report me to provost (educational integrity committee). Due to it being the end of the year the meeting was moved to this month and I will meet and discuss this event with the committee.

Why I cheated:

I have no excuses but I do have my reasons:

 - I was confident I would not get above a B with the time I had left to finish the assignment. I believe that nothing but a B and up is acceptable and time was short due to my grandmother's death.

 - I had my first major death in my family (grandmother basically raised me) and was trying to care for my grandfather after this.

 - Do to my grief, I betrayed and lost a good friend. 

 - I had already started self-harming to keep myself on track for assignments and this amplified it the point I called the suicide hotline to calm down after a few deep cuts happened. My parents discovering my actions and were extremely disappointed.

All of this piled on and I had already asked for a extension so I clearly could not ask for other one, so I cheated.

The Advise I need:

Should I mention any of my reasons to the committee? Are they too close to being excuses?

Do I surrender and take all punishments, no arguments?

Do I dress like I'm going to a trail, business casual, or street clothing?

Final notes:

I am very remorseful about what I did. There are not excuses and I have learned from my mistake, but still fear the punishment will damage more greatly. I refuse to try to manipulate the outcome to a positive or ""woah is me"" result because that would mean I have learned nothing from this. I sorry for what I did not because I got caught.

TL;DR - College, cheated on final essay, caught, will be speaking to committee soon, I'm sorry for my actions, what do I do?

Thank you for your time.",25Aug2018,0
359,"So long story short, I was given a promotion at work last week, its something I've worked very hard for, and gone way above and beyond to earn, and the hard work finally paid off and I'm just overjoyed. 

The issue, one of my co-workers who is now my subordinate is pretty irate I was given the promotion and they were passed over. 

Granted this person has been here a lot longer than I have but has never really done anything to distinguish themselves, and to be brutally honest isnt great at the job. I also understand that before I worked at the company this person was years ago offered a management position but turned it down due to something that was going on with his personal life. But now they are angry that they were passed over.

So over the past week this person has been insubordinate to the other department heads, dragfin gn their feet on anything they have been given to do, and just walking around with a bad attitude and everyone has noticed it.

I really dont want to rock the boat with the iron fist a week into being a department head with someone who HAS been here for a long time, I think I at least owe then time to let things settle.

How do you app think I should be handling this moving forward? Thank you!!!",25Aug2018,1
360,"I'm 27 years old, and I feel like I'm falling behind where I want to be at this point in my life. I wasn't successful the first two times I attended college, but I decided to quit making excuses and get my ass back to school. At first I thought about doing cybersecurity, but after looking into it, I realized it wouldn't be right for me. So I found a 2 year  computer programming course available at a local campus. 

I originally went to school for music education, and then audio engineering, so everything in the domain of computers is foreign to me. So I have several questions.

1. Should I be taking this computer programming course, or should I be looking into things like computer science?

2. What kind of careers would a two year course set me up for? Should I lower my expectations, or should I expect to continue into further education if I want to do anything fun and /or exciting?

3. What kind of careers should I look to avoid?

4. If I have weak mathematical skills, how much of a challenge am I looking to face as a programmer?

5. What programming languages would allow me the best opportunities?


School starts back up in 2 weeks, and I'm in panic mode trying to figure out what's going to be right for me. Tell me every harsh truth you can about being a programmer, and the paths you took to get you where you are.

Bonus points if you can tell me anything about what it takes/what it's like to work in the video game industry.

Then she said that she could pay for me when we meet or buy me something so this way she pays back and I refused again bc I prefer to have my money back in the same amount I gave her.

363,"My (M33) wife (F29) and I have been together for seven years. About two years ago we lost a child due to miscarriage, and our relationship hasn’t really been the same since. Last year, we were split up for most of the year. I don’t think she dated anyone else, or at least she never admitted to it, but I did date someone that I knew from high school for about a month. After which we got back together and tried to make things work. We broke up and got back together a few more times this year, and it’s been rather bumpy. 

We both have incredibly strong feelings for one another, but when we argue it gets so intense. Usually when we break up, it’s under the guise of not wanting to fight around our four-year-old child. It’s been on and off so much it’s hard to keep track anymore. My family is tired. I’m tired. She’s tired. Her family hates me. Blah blah blah. 

This most recent time we broke up was at the end of May, and I started a relationship with a woman in another city. I think I was just having warm body syndrome, where I wasn’t exactly ready for another relationship, but I also wasn’t ready to be alone. I made a lot of bad decisions and I’m having to deal with all those now.

During the time that we were broke up, my wife stayed in our hometown, and decided to date a bit. I use the term “date” loosely, as it was mostly casual sex or so she says. After she attempted to seriously date one of my friends, we both sort of broke down and realized that we wanted to be together again, and that we were both making bad decisions without each other. 

My issue is this, since moving back into our mutual home, I’ve noticed a lot of evidence of her casual sex. For instance, my wife is a squirter, and I’m noticing telltale stains on the couch in our living room. I know is that she slept with multiple men in the bed that we shared for years. I’ve found condom stashes and she even still talks to one of the guys. 

I’m having huge issues getting over this. Perhaps it’s my male ego that just won’t shut up, but it’s really hard for me to sit on the couch in my living room as I’m writing this and knowing that another man gave her an orgasm on the couch where my son watches cartoons. I can’t even set foot in what used to be our shared bedroom (it’s pretty much just hers now). Since we don’t have any other bedrooms in the house, and I sure as shit don’t want to sleep on this couch, I’ve taken to sleeping on the floor. 

I’m miserable. 

She feels deep remorse over everything that happened when we were apart, as do I. I know that I was not innocent in my actions. I did indeed sleep with the woman that I dated, but only at the beginning. I could not physically bring myself to have sex with another woman anymore because of my desire to be with my wife again.

I just don’t know how to get over this. Given our past, it seems like maybe we are kicking a dead horse. That maybe it’s better off if we just try to live our lives separately. But it’s hard for me to let go, it was my longest relationship, she’s the mother of my only child, and I do deeply love her.

Halp. 

TL;DR - Got back together with my ex (wife) and can’t get over the mental hurdle of knowing that she was with other men in our house while we were split up.",25Aug2018,1
364,"Looking to get this off my chest and hopefully receive some advice. 

Last year my girlfriend and I went to separate colleges, 5 hours away. It was initially extremely hard for me, and after a while I sank into a bad depression. I was constantly sad, felt a pit in my throat and stomach, and could t eat. Id worry and stress day in and day out, and lost 35 pounds in a month. I don’t remember many of the specifics about that time as it is now somewhat of a blur, but I do remember how agonizing each day felt. After telling my family about it and getting a little help and prescribed medication, it was still challenging. I eventually stopped taking the medicine in the winter, and things started to get better. 

The past 3-4 months my girlfriend and I have spent almost every day together. Even if it was only for a little, we’d make it a point to appreciate every time for what it was because we couldn’t see each other nearly as frequently during the school year. Initially the summer felt like it’d last forever, and I was so happy to have so much free time to spend with her. Now it feels like t absolutely flew by, and I don’t know where the time went. 

It’s been a day or so since she left for school, and I’m feeling it. I promised myself, my family and my girlfriend that I wouldn’t fall into a depression again, but this year feel just like the last. I know it’s early on, but all those familiar feeling are coming back and I don’t know what to do. Everyone I know has gone away for school so there’s nobody I can really talk to, and I haven’t made any friends in college. I’m extremely worried about this year and I don’t know how to stop myself if and when I start to fail. I can’t fuck up and get as bad as I did last year. I can’t do that again to the people I love. How can I deal with this without straining my relationships and keeping myself ok? If anyone has any advice I’d greatly appreciate it. Thank you",25Aug2018,2
365,"How can I get my girlfriend to stop being lazy and start forming more good habits, without just saying it plainly? We've been together for 3 years, we live together, and I feel like I'm always picking up after her. Whether that be bringing dishes down that she used and would let pile up otherwise, putting the toilet paper on the roll after it runs out, putting shit back where it belongs after using it, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's really pushed me over the edge is her lack of work ethic toward school. She claims she wants to attend the community college I do in the fall, just doing a class or two. She was a poor student in high school, and though she's changed overall, she still struggles to stay focused on even the most basic shit involving math. I've told her that she needs to review a bit if she wants to be ready, but you can tell she clearly doesn't care and gives up when the smallest bit of adversity hits. She already did school for a quarter through ASU online via starbucks, where she did terrible. I don't want her to take financial aid and then waste her opportunity when she realizes she has no interest in going to school at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten quite sick of it, and I feel like I'm slowly building up resentment toward her, especially when she claims she's a clean person, or that she'll commit to school when it starts. What can I do? Leading by example has not worked, at least not at building consistent patterns. ",25Aug2018,1
367,"For the last three months I've had nothing but complete and utter social isolation. I used to have a great, active and busy social life with many friends and even a crush. We would hang out with our friend group and do things like go to the beach, play basketball or watch movies at eachother's houses after school. Life was great and I enjoyed every second of it.

That all changed when the summer vacation started. Half of my friends from our friendgroup went travelling abroad with their families for the vacation and the rest of us all had some other reasons that prevented us from hanging out together, like time consuming summer jobs or camps. Gradually I grew apart from my friends. I only saw any of my friends once during the entire holiday, the rest of the days I spent completely alone with absolutely nothing to do. My crush also turned out to be a lesbian so I had to deal with unrequited love too. I had never felt so alone and so insignificant. It was the worst 2 months out of the 16 years I've been alive.

I started highschool about two weeks ago. All my friends went to different highschools and unluckily, not a single person I'm familiar with went to the same one as me. The place itself is okay and the teachers seem really nice but that does not change the fact that everyone there is a complete stranger to me and that I'm utterly alone. I've never been the most socially gifted person but before I've always managed to find at least a few friends and somewhat manage to maintain good relations with the rest. This time feels different. This time I feel like I'm unable to find anyone with similar interests as me. They seem like nice people and I got nothing against them but our fields of interest are just so different that starting a conversation feels nearly impossible. The only common trait I share with anyone out of the new people I've met is that me and one of the new guys both enjoy going to the gym and lifting. That isn't something you can easily make a conversation out of though and we can't go to the same gym because it would be too inconvenient due to location.

During the second month of my summer vacation I started watching lots of anime. I really enjoyed series like Highschool DxD, Nisekoi, Konosuba, Aho girl etc. It made me feel less alone. I felt like I was almost interacting with the characters and thus experiencing the social interactions I so desperately crave. It sounds extremely sad and pathetic but I felt like the anime characters were the closest I would ever have to real friends. This did not change when highschool started. Although I'm surrounded by other teenagers daily, I just feel completely alone and unable to make any kind of connection with them, the best I've gotten so far is making extremely awkward small talk about our exercise programs with the guy who also goes to the gym. 

I understand why I like anime so much now. It's because I'm able to live the life I always dreamt of but was never able to have, through watching anime. The main character always makes a bunch of friends, gets an amazing girlfriend, accomplishes his goals, and gets everything I ever wanted in life. By watching anime, I'm able to momentarily forget about the sadness and loneliness of my own life and escape into an ideal utopia, the existence I always dreamt of experiencing myself.

I just wish I was able to make friends with new people like anime characters always do. I just want to share the things I enjoy in life with someone else, share the things I experience in general, hear about the experiences of others, and to help one another in our hardships. But in reality, I'm as alone as a person can be. Therefore, anime is a way for me to experience the friendships, the social interactions, the romance, the feats of accomplishment and everything else I always dreamt of having in life, but will never have. I have accepted it now, I will never get to experience these wonderful things in real life, so I may as well stop trying and just try and make the most out of what I have. I now understand where the ""weeaboo NEET with no life"" stereotype comes from, and I pity anyone who finds themselves in the same situation as I  find myself today.

370,"This is going to be long, but I'll try to make it as short as possible, please help.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start out with: I am an alcoholic with almost 6 months sober in AA. Me and my ex split up 1.5 years ago, and my friends all stopped talking to me roughly 1 year ago. My ex and I were mutual friends with these people, although they were my friends since early childhood They made friends with her through me. I had ruined all of these relationships with my behavior while drinking, but I have cleaned up my act and made amends with everyone except my ex who has cut off all contact with me. I am trying to get back to where I was with my bestfriend(R), but he has started hanging out with another one of my bestfriends(C) and C's group of friends who were completely separate from our group until very recently(past few months). Ex has also been hanging around C's group of friends now too. I am talking to and trying to actively have a friendship with these guys, but with the presence of my ex... 

I'll sum it up: C has assimilated our old group into his group along with my ex, which has forced me out of the entire group even though I am still friends with all of them. Ideally I should be able to talk with my friends and maybe get involved with everything, but I would need to either patch things up with ex(impossible due to her wishes), or they would find a way to involve me while keeping boundaries(they probably don't care to do that because it's a pain in the ass for them, and it's simpler to keep things the same.) Also who wouldn't rather have a pretty girl around instead of another guy like me if given the choice?

I'm stuck. I'm not sure how to handle things. I was planning on going to a bar tonight to see a band that I want to see, and I asked bestfriend R if he wanted to go. He told me that C's group was going to be there and they had already invited him. Therefore, if I went I would be in an awkward position alone while 2 of my bestfriends and very likely my ex would all be hanging out right next to me. Not to mention I feel absolutely betrayed over this whole deal, but I have a hard time finding fault with these guys because they didn't expect me to change and come back around.

&amp;#x200B;

I think things will clear up with enough time, I'm just curious what r/advice thinks I could do to help this process along, or maybe what NOT to do to make sure I don't make things worse. I'm trying my best to be respectful of everyone involved, but I really want my friends back or at least be able to go and do things that I like to do without the looming dread of seeing them hanging out without me.

371,"I'm not loud, I don't party, lawn is tended to, I mean for all intents and purposes I'm a ""dream"" neighbor.  The first time I saw my neighbor, I was coming home and when I turned the corner he was at the end of his driveway staring at me (that feeling you get when you know). When i got closer he was still staring, I smiled and started to wave and he spun on his heel and marched inside his house.

If I go out back while he's out back, see I've thought this would be an opportune time to say ""Hello"" but when I go out back, wherever he is he immediately goes inside.  If he's sitting on the deck reading, he DROPS his book, goes inside, slams the door and locks it.  Same if he's mowing and sees me while he's mowing, out with his dog (well not his I think he sits it for a family member sometimes), just boom like he thinks I've got a weapon or something.  I decided to try ringing his door to greet him, I tried twice when I knew he was home but he wouldn't answer.

When I've been leaving through the front, when I come out the front door if he's out front he either stops stiff (like he's tensing up as though he thinks I might be planning to attack him?) while staring until I'm gone (as in in my vehicle driven around the corner out of view) or if there's what I've found to be his ""safe distance"" he will powerwalk into his open garage door and close it.

These all happened multiple times with him and I kept trying to smile and wave but no progress.

One time I was coming home and he stared at me as I was coming around again.  This time he was out front with who I would guess is his granddaughter or niece (I've seen her multiple times since, seems way too young to be his daughter), when I started to smile and wave he did his routine.  I looked to gauge her reaction and she just looked confused and ended up following him inside.

Next day I go out back and she's out back alone.  As soon as I'm stepping out I see her rush to go inside and slam the door - she left her book on his table though.  Anyway later I go out front, and both of them are there.  As soon as I turn around from locking my door, he's kind of leaning into her but they're both meanmugging me.  I look at her and then him while smiling and say hello.  They just keep staring silently.  So I just get in my vehicle, leave, they shift position as necessary to stare at me the whole time.

I'm out front doing yardwork and she pulls up in his driveway.  I have to get up to grab something so go to do so, I see her in my peripheral on her phone staring at me.  When I'm coming back from the garage to the yard with what I needed, she's out of the vehicle and off her phone.  She turns and stops to stare at me.  I smile and wave, she keeps staring.  I carry on working and she's staring at me for a solid five minutes before moving again and just going inside.

So this went on with the two of them for some months.

Last Friday, he had I think his brother over? The granddaughter/niece/whatever lives with him now btw.  Anyway I see his ""brother"" outside once when I'm leaving, he looks at me smiling so I smile and wave.  He waves back.  I think cool! Finally!

The next time I see him he's just meanmugging me, if I go out back and he's there he goes inside, same if multiple are out back, same staring if multiple are out front, like him smiling and greeting me that one time was just a ""glitch"" from not being filled in on whatever the heck it is they're doing.

372,"A few months ago, my freind got out of a relationship with her now ex-boyfriend. He basically ghosted everyone, didn't tell her or any of his friends that he was moving, and then (by his own description) was awful to my freind to 'drive her away for her own good.' He suffers from depression, but the way he uses it as an excuse for every shitty thing he does, including this, is inexusable in my eyes. I know I'll never be completely fair in this situation considering my best freind was involved, but I do genuinely belive that the way he treated her was disgusting. It took her a couple of months to even be able to talk about any of the stuff he did, and start to come to terms with the fact that she's been gaslighted, manipulated and treated as his emtoinal punching bag through the whole relationship. She really loved him and wanted to help him, which he completely took advantage of. Eventually she managed to confess to me and a couple of otherss specific situations that she was still struggling with. One in particular, the boyfriend had been ignoring her all morning and refusing to reply when she spoke to him. Eventually she broke down crying, and he came over and tried to kiss her. She tried to push him away but he was quite forceful and it took her a while to get herself away. She felt really unsettled by what she described as 'rapey vibes', although she was very clear that it was not rape and he stopped (eventually) when she tried to get away. While she didn't see a massive problem at the time, as she so unhealthily invested in him, but later she told us she realised how shitty that situation was, and that it defintely didn't sit right with her.

One of the other people she told this is has now started spreading rumours that my freind was going around saying the exboyfreind raped her. To futher compound this, the exboyfreind has unblocked all of us (who he ghosted all those months ago when he was moving) and is now interacting with the rumour spreading person, but not me nor my best freind. I recently ended up in the discord server where they were posting articles of false rape allegation cases and captioning it with 'who does this remind you of?' Which the exboyfreind replied to with a thinking face. I was incredibly angry and left immediately before I could say anything, but I needed to vent.

I have had a retraining following harsh times with a narcissistic manipulator. I had to take a new way to make a living and gain independence. For a year now I've had my physiotherapist degree and open my office with a ""friend"". I was willing to get my own apartment...

As soon as we've began doing building work, she totally changed. She began to act egoistic, selfish and superior (as she's been working for 10 years and has a good network). I don't like her anymore, and the working environment isn't fun anymore. I earn almost 2500€/month which is pretty nice, but I'm not happy at all, and feel very depressed. With barely no time for me (4h daily commuting, paperwork to do on the week-end...) I have almost no pleasure in life.

I'm willing to get my own apartment to flee from my narcissistic manipulator family, but by engaging myself in this office, I'm afraid to be stuck.

For almost 9 months, I've questioned myself if I should leave. I've made a contract at the moment our business was created, so I can't leave this easily (need to find a substitute, prohibition to practice in a certain perimeter). I was thinking about working doing only home consultation. These are a little harder to practice, but pay a little more, and I wouldn't have to pay for a rent for the office, and have a little more spare time.

But I was also wondering if I couldn't do another completely different job online. I'm pretty fond of mobility, working on computer and earning money doing stuff (I was a former mid stake poker player, but I had to quit to have a ""real job"").

I always am taking it seriously and trying to be rigid with rules and stuff, and I'm just not who I really want to be. Unfortunately, I think this repulses people, too. :( I have no real friends who want to hang out with me.

I'm hoping you can point me in the right direction.  I'm just so lonely and really want to learn to be a fun person to be around.",25Aug2018,1

379,"There's this girl at work I think I hit it off with...In the beginning she talked sweetly and once while texting she even mentioned that she likes my calmness and personality. Also inquiring if I had a girlfriend or was seeing anyone.

Now, this was on a Friday night..so I didn't see her till Tuesday as I was sick on Monday. Tuesday was kind off hectic at work and we hardly spoke...and then the next day while sitting relatively close by I hear her telling her friend about some guy that she liked...Now I don't know if she took this name just to piss me off or she was interested in him.

Things really got weird between us as I tried to make my peace with her liking someone else...she completely stopped coming at my desk and would talk to some other guy(don't know if the same guy she had a thing for) at her desk constantly and even the few times I went and talked to her it wasn't the same. This went on for more than a week...

Also yesterday she calls the two guys who sit with me to have her lunch but not me... I was hurt at this point cause I've always been nice to her...but whatever. Also forgot to mention that she regularly borrowed my charger earlier but stopped it during that rough week.

That night though I talk to her about work stuff and we joke a bit and stuff and it seems like before.

I just want to know that can a girl just within 3-4 days go from liking me(I think) to immediately liking someone else...I mean that's fucked up or she was trying to make me jealous and things went south ??",25Aug2018,1
380,"Hi everyone. I wanted some advice as I'm a little lost today.

I have had a retraining following harsh times with a narcissistic manipulator. I had to take a new way to make a living and gain independence. For a year now I've had my physiotherapist degree and open my office with a ""friend"". I was willing to get my own apartment...

As soon as we've began doing building work, she totally changed. She began to act egoistic, selfish and superior (as she's been working for 10 years and has a good network). I don't like her anymore, and the working environment isn't fun anymore. I earn almost 2500€/month which is pretty nice, but I'm not happy at all, and feel very depressed. With barely no time for me (4h daily commuting, paperwork to do on the week-end...) I have almost no pleasure in life.

I'm willing to get my own apartment to flee from my narcissistic manipulator family, but by engaging myself in this office, I'm afraid to be stuck.

For almost 9 months, I've questioned myself if I should leave. I've made a contract at the moment our business was created, so I can't leave this easily (need to find a substitute, prohibition to practice in a certain perimeter). I was thinking about working doing only home consultation. These are a little harder to practice, but pay a little more, and I wouldn't have to pay for a rent for the office, and have a little more spare time.

But I was also wondering if I couldn't do another completely different job online. I'm pretty fond of mobility, working on computer and earning money doing stuff (I was a former mid stake poker player, but I had to quit to have a ""real job"").

382,"I am starting to believe I’ve been given an engagement ring to shut me up. Here’s the story. 

My boyfriend of 4 1/2 years proposed to me September 29th of 2017. So we are coming up on a year of being engaged and he gets almost angry when I bring up a wedding. I’m 23. He’s 26. 27 in March. He still lives at home and won’t stop buying toys (side by sides, dirt bikes, expensive rims and tires for his truck) now I’m by no means saying I should control what he does with his money but he keeps saying he wants a house but he won’t even go look at them with me. I try to plan a wedding and he won’t give me a date he won’t do anything. I was never asking to get engaged and get married 5 months later. I was wanting to plan a wedding for 2019, which was 2 years away from the proposal date. He’s immature. I honestly don’t think he wants to leave his mom and dads house but how are we supposed to grow as a couple? I was never really nagging about a wedding but i feel as if he’s always had commitment issues. He has said things such as “it’s just a piece of paper” “my mom and dad were engaged for 8 years” “I’m in no rush” “what’s the rush” “we need to be financially stable” which that one really gets me because we both bring home good money and pay our bills. He made 8,000$ in the last 2 weeks so I don’t believe that’s an issue but it’s always an excuse. He always puts the blame on me and I end up feeling bad about it or even bringing up a wedding. Last night he told me “I don’t see you out trying to get a house” which I tried to calmly explain to him that I shouldn’t be out buying a house. WE should be out buying a house. All of his friends are out of their parents house. He’s so immature and I’m starting to wonder if he’s ever going to grow up at all. I need advice. ☹️",25Aug2018,1
384,"I'm giddy inside. Anxiously waiting for his texts. I smile to myself whenever he texts. I smile just walking down the street because he talked to me. I smile all around the house for absolutely no reason. I'm giddy and happy about everything. I don't even know if he likes me though. He visited. I became wooden. I was so tense, shy and nervous. He even joked why I was acting so weird. I have a tendency to act like a child around my crushes. Even though I'm adult in my 20s. I start feeling thirteen again. ",25Aug2018,1

I don't know what other people think, so it could definitely all be in my head, but I would like a bit of advice to help me differentiate it personally and also help me show that I am interested (and especially not viewed as someone who was being 'nice'!)

387,"I think I am losing my best friend who happens to be a member of the opposite gender which many people have a problem with. There is a strong push to bully people into not having opposite sex friends and I think these people, one of them his own dad, have gotten to her husband.

I want people to know up front that I believe she does want to be friends with me. I suspect her husband sees her messages gets her phone when she's out of the room and deletes my text messages to her because its very unusual for her not to text back. The last 2 times I saw her were in July. I stopped by her work (she works at a Carls Jr) and got food. The first time she drove me home and we had this amazing conversation and just like that I got over this depression I had had all summer I felt so much better. It was just like old times. The next time I saw her was a week later their. The resturant was busy and I left early because of it. But both times just like always before she never gave me any indication she didnt want to see me. She initiated hugs. Acted her usual friendly self. She never has once gave me any indication she wants our friendship to end. 

I never have felt any romantic or sexual feelings for this women. She is like the sister I never had. I do love her but in a totally platonic way like my sister. I never told her this but have told her she is my best friend. We met in a group project in a college class. This was 5 years ago. She invited me to her familys Christmas party and introduced me to her family. This meant so much to me because it was the first time in my life anyone invited me anywhere. Most of my friends are her family members. I know like 5 people outside of her family. Ive always had trouble making friends. My family has died off to the point that only my grandma and cousins/brother I dont get along with are still alive.

My friend got married earlier this summer and I was exited. But now she isn't responding to my texts. I only send 1 text every week its not like I am blowing up her phone. I haven't seen her since July 19th I believe. She went on vacation with her husband and was supposed to arrange to hang out with me the week after. It didnt happen. I mentioned her in something interesting on facebook but no reply. Yet she comments on her female friends stuff regularly. Its making me scared I am going to loose my friend. The only person I can talk to about anything with. I miss her so much.

Her husband is a nice and quiet guy. He hugged me at the wedding and I thought he was cool with me but I think what happened is he found out she gave me a ride home from work and after that I think he got jealous again. I think his dad who gave me a hard time one time years ago and made some crack at me for ""I heard some strange guy walking around here"" at the wedding. I think he may have the wrong idea based on these annoying stereotypes. What kills me is her female friend who is also a coworker and her boyfriend get to hang out with her and her family all the time. I know my friend hangs out with people and has a social life. But I just feel because I am a male it scares her off hanging out with me.

What do I do? Please dont tell me to stop hanging out with her becaus I dont want to lose this friend she is too good of a friend. Please dont tell me the usual ""you need to find new friends"" because I keep trying and cant get anywhere. I never found a friend I can talk to about my feelings like her. It's very hard for me because I am very socially awkward and I am poor. I cant afford to do allot of things to attend events and make friends. This post is really me seeking advice on how to save my friendship with my best friend.

I also wanted to clarify some things

Her and her boyfriend and their daughter have always lived together since Ive known them. Living arrangements haven't changed since the wedding so their lives are exactly as before except the fact that they are now legally married. But they were always married in the sense they were a happy family.

I never was in any type of relationship with her. Never even flirted with her. Again no sexual or romantic interest in her. She is my sister from another mister essentially. I know its weird to people but no I am not gay and I do prefer female friends because its very awkward and difficult to talk about feelings with male friends.

TL:DR Please read this whole thing before commenting on it. On the last post I made on the other forum I had to do allot of explaining about the stuff I already did in the text. Its a complicated issue and I'd really appreciate it people didnt come on here to bully me like they did on the last thread which I deleted.",25Aug2018,0

I'm a 13 yr old girl in the US. I want to talk and act like CosmicSkeptic who's an atheist vlogger and secular activist. He has a channel on Youtube and I decided I want to be like him as in:

1. I want to be eloquent: he talks so well. I don't want a British accent (it would be ridiculous bc I've lived in the US since birth), but the way he uses humor and is so charming... I want to talk like that. 

2. The way he dresses. He doesn't dress amazingly well or weird but everything he wears looks good on him. I want to stop having to think so much about what to wear and find very casual clothes that look good on me.


3. His confidence. He's so damn confident and funny and charming. I want to acheive that.
 
Right now I talk like I'm a frivolous, silly girl. I don't want to sound pretentious while speaking but I also want to sound wiser than my age. I also stutter a lot and can't find words to express what I'm thinking at the moment. I make weird sounds while talking also. AND I need to stop crying whenever I get mad or yelled at and to stop taking all criticism personally.
What I'm getting at is that the way I act is very... not confidence and eloquent. I want to write, speak, and act as well as he does. Here're some videos to give you an idea of what he acts like:

391,"I never had the best relationship with my Mother, and I left home at 18 because quite frankly I couldn't bear to be there anymore. She was a single parent since I was 12 as my old man died due to suicide - that fucked her up and she had severe mental health issues so it wasn't great growing up, we were not close at all. 

Anyway until I was in my early 20s we spoke cordially, and saw each other once every few months or so, and as time went on the time between meets grew longer and longer. When I was about 23/24 we had an argument about something I cant really remember what it was about. Days turned to weeks turned to months and then a year passed without seeing her, then the years ticked on, I'm 37 now and I still haven't seen her. Its been so long I cant even remember the sound of her voice. I've been told by a family member her health is failing, Its hard to say but I feel about as much emotion for her as a a neighbour down the street I've met only once before. 

I don't know how I would feel if I find out she has died without ever making contact with her again, I honestly feel like I wouldn't care but that might be different if it ever happens. 

Any one else been in that position before, I don't know what to do. She wasn't a very nice person when I lived with her and she was a terrible Mother, but then again she had a hard life since her childhood.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

392,"I fell in love with a female friend. Now I don't know whether I should stop hanging out with her.

I am in my late 30's and married for more than 10 years. Let's call my wife A. Now through friends I met this girl a few years younger than I am. Let's call her B. We got along pretty well and I thought she would just be a very cool friend to hang out with, and we did a few times. Mostly within a group of friends, but we had like 2 times where we had a drink with just the two us, talking about some personal stuff. Within less than half a year I had to admit to myself that I had fallen in love with her. And, I chose, for better or for worse, to admit it to both the girl B. and my wife A. I felt relieved at first; both reacted about as well as could be expected, and I though I did good by being honest. Now, frankly I am not so sure anymore, but that's only part of the problem.

My wife, as could be expected, has felt quite a blow to her confidence in our relationship, even though she says she's glad I was honest. She also says she doesn't blame me for falling in love with someone, because she can understand that such things can just happen, but she also thinks I should stop hanging out with B., at least for now. I am not entirely sure what she means by that, or what I am hoping for when she says ""for now"".

I have been telling my wife, and to myself, that having feelings for B. does not mean I love my wife any less. My wife understands this, but she says that's not the main reason why she feels I should stop hanging out with B. She says first of all, you fell in love with her so fast and apparently your feelings are so strong, who is to say they won't develop any further. Even though I am pretty sure about our marriage now, who's to say I won't be less sure in half a year when maybe I like B. even more... if that's even possible. Secondly, she kindly asks that I respect her feelings, in that she has great emotional problems when I keep hanging out with B. especially in a setting where it's just the two of us. On the one hand she doesn't want to 'forbid'  me to hang out with people, but on the other hand it raises great concerns for her when I see how much trouble A. has when I hang out with B. but still 'desparately' feel the need to hang out with B. anyway. She reasons, how important can your friendship be with someone you only know for half a year?

Now B. on the other hand, she reacted totally friendly and non-shocked when I told her I had feelings for her. She told me she wasn't surprised, and I even picked up some signals that the feelings may have been mutual already, or that they might potentially be mutual. She understands that I am committed to my marriage. But her strong belief is that such a friendship should not be a threat to a marriage, even given the circumstances. She strongly believes that the right and grownup way to deal with such feelings of affection, is to 'deal with it', by which she means: keep hanging out together, and just find a way to do that on a friendly basis. She says she has dealt with exactly such a thing herself on various occasions in the past. I strongly want to believe her, but I gotta be honest I'm not sure. She even goes so far as to say: your wife's feelings about all this are her problem, you and only you are responsible for what decision you make. She says in so many words that me hanging out with her less frequently, is making her feel sad, too. It almost makes me feel guilty. At the same time it feels 'dangerous' to hang out with B. because of how 'accessible' she is. I mean, I have this gut feeling that when we keep hanging out, me and only me is going to have to guard our 'boundaries' so to speak, because B. certainly won't step on the brakes. I mean, it's not as if I am actively scared that I am going to cheat on my wife. I am pretty sure that I can make the right decision. I guess I am more affraid of where my feelings will go if I let myself be guided by them. I am fairly certain that B. won't feel the responsibility to keep any more emotional distance between her and me than before. She's not going to take any emotional steps back in order to not feed anything that might become a problem for all people involved.

I wanna convince myself that I can be strong enough emotionally to be friends with someone from the opposite sex. I want to convince myself that I can be strong enough to have such a friendship and not have it threaten my commitment to my marriage. I feel all of this is fucked up to point of self-pity, frankly, because I feel like I didn't ask for all this. I didn't ask to fall in love with B. It would be so much easier if I could just like her and nothing more. She is a great person. I was very happy when I met her because I immediately felt a friendly connection. I feel like I have never made very many new friends along the way, let alone new friends that became really great friends that I really connected with, and certainly not recently in my late 30's. I feel like that's not an age when you easily make new (close) friends. So when I felt a friendly connection with this great person I didn't know very well yet; I couldn't believe my luck when I invested in that connection, and then actually felt my attempts answered very quickly and equally. I mean, it felt like a very rewarding friendship that was growing rapidly. So if only for that reason, I feel like I would be crazy to let this friendship or whatever it is, die. Then again, all of this may just be me trying to rationalize hanging out with a person that I am in love with. I'm aware of that.

In the meantime, my relation with my wife is somewhat chilly at the moment. I mean, we are not fighting, certainly not on a daily basis. We are still talking regularly, though not about this subject very regularly, which I am not sure is the right thing to do, or a very big mistake. We still have great sex fairly regularly. And we do all kinds of fun stuff together in the weekends etc. I am somewhat distant or silent though, every now and then, and I am pretty sure my wife knows what the reason is. So now, both for making my marriage healthy again, and for dealing with my feelings for B. in a healthy way, I don't know what to do.

I have hardly spoken to or seen B. in person in the last months by the way. I sometimes speak to her casually on social media, and we met casually and very quickly exchanged a few words a few times. I feel the desperate urge to contact her and hang out with her any time soon. But I have managed to resist that urge up until now. I told B. I would like to hang out with her sometime in the not too distant future, but that I really don't know where or how yet. And that last bit is the truth. It's not just that discussing the subject my wife has become a total gridlock. We sort of agreed to disagree on the subject. But hanging out with B. at this point will certainly create new tension or even a fight between me and my wife. And also, as explained, as much as I want to hang out with B. I am also quite scared of what will happen to my feelings if I do.

Should I just accept that to keep hanging out with B. is not very smart, and deal with the disappointment of losing what is (or could have become) a great friend that I felt I had a lot of things in common with? Will my feelings for her disappear any quicker that way? And will this help me to make my marriage healthy again, and remove any doubts about my marriage that I have to admit I have developed in the past months? And if I stop hanging out with B. should I give up any hope of ever being friends with her? Is there any hope that my feelings for her return to 'manageable' levels and I can be friends with her again in some meaningful way?

395,"This is such a petty issue but it’s quite important for me to deal with the emotions in this situation.

My mother has done a lot for me and my family. She was never abusive towards us - actually she left her ex-husband (my father) so that we could have a better life. I can never repay her. 

She did enforce a rule that to get our driver’s license, we must be at least 19. I respected that rule until my brother turned 18 and got his license. He’s three years my junior so I was 21 when this happened. I got angry because I’ve been bugging my mother to let me get my license to which she said no.

Yes I don’t need her permission to get my license but I would like to use the family cars to practice more. When I asked my mom why I couldn’t use her car, she became hesitant and said that she’s nervous because I’m deaf and wouldn’t be able to hear her in the car.

I think that’s just ridiculous because I’m the house, we can talk even without sign language. And yet my brother and sisters can use the family cars whenever they want!

396,"I'm going to try to keep this as short and simple as possible. 
I have an amazing life with amazing people in my life. All my friends treat me so well and are always there for me during hard times. 

I just realized today that I am such an annoying person and I need to fix that. 
I either am too nice or I just get sensitive and dramatic.
There are so many examples I could give you but one of them:
My very good friend just came into the same high school I go to (I'm in third year and she's in 1st). We had decided that I was going to have lunch with her the first day of school because she was new and all that. I told her my lunch time and and she told me that she'll send hers when she gets one. 
When lunch time was getting closer I was getting kind of worried because she was worried that she won't make friends and all that. So I wanted to make sure that I was there for her on her first day because I've been in her position before. 

She never ended up letting me know that she wasn't going to have lunch with me. I just wanted to know if she had someone to go to lunch with and that she felt fine. 
I got mad. I just stopped replying and was thinking of all these things that I'm not going to talk to her whenever we see and all that. 
After that (it's now been 3 weeks since school started) I didn't snap her at all besides the everyday ''GM'' and ''GN'' and I never said hi to her in school. 

Today came, couple of hours ago we had a party and I had my mind set to the fact that I wasn't going to talk to her. I just wanted to show her that I was mad. Well the start went well but then I just noticed how lonely she felt (btw there was our other friend so either they two would talk or then the other friend and me). I started talking to her and we were the same old friends again. 

We brought up the situation and she was a bit mad at me too that I just ignored her at the start of the party and then I told her why and she was like 'No you need to understand. You take things too seriously.' I genuinely, from the bottom of my heart agree with her.

I just feel so bad about myself because I create problems out of the smallest things. I'm either too nice or then I distance myself completely. 

I need to get my head straight. I need to be mature because I feel like my behaviour will make my friends leave me at one point. 
I don't know if I did the right thing. 
Just wanted to vent because for the past couple of hours I have felt so bad about myself.

397,"Scheduled movers for a very small job , less than a studio apt, no boxes. Just a mattress, headboard, box spring, couch, and medium dresser. Originally needed them at 8am to avoid heat and traffic. They pushed it back to 10am which was no big deal. At 930 I got a call from another company saying my original movers gave them my job. The original estimate from them was ""early to mid afternoon"" so let's say 2-4pm. I look for other movers or at the very least labor help and a rental truck with no luck. There was one company that could ""maybe"" do it for 2x what market rate is. I declined. At 5:15 I get a call saying they will be another 2 hours at their current job. I drive the 20 minutes from the pickup to drop off spot to wait. I am at the drop off for no more than 10 minutes when they tell me they are on the way. At that point I should have just stayed at the drop off. 

Since it's a small job I assume my priority was knocked down to the bottom. I was originally quoted $189 by the initial company. Is it reasonable to ask them to give some sort of discount at this point or is this just a supply and demand issue? I don't want to be a dick and I've been extremely patient with them so far but my day has been royally fucked by not having this done at a reasonable time and now I've wasted time and gas going from one end of town to the other to have to pick up and go back.

399,"My boyfriend [30] recently had knee surgery which will require him to be on crutches for up to 8 weeks. I was fortunate to be able to miss work for a week to do literally everything for him. I've cooked all meals, cleaned up, helped him bathe, get to the bathroom, laundry, etc. (All while having to do assignments in grad school, FML.)

Well his doctor seems to think he should be able to put weight on his knee by now, but my boyfriend insists it still hurts too much. We'll be sitting down and he'll randomly get extremely sharp pains that take his breath away. So needless to say, he can't really put weight on it comfortably. The more he moves, the worse he feels. 

However, it's my busy season at work and I absolutely have to get back to work soon since I've been out for over a week to take care of him. As it stands, because he's on 2 crutches, he can't do anything for himself. He can't cook, he can't clean -- I've done literally everything since his surgery. So how do people successfully survive while on 2 crutches? How can he cook meals and so forth? Any advice is much appreciated by this exhausted girlfriend!",25Aug2018,1
400,I have an alcoholic father and an overprotective mum that argue day-to-day about inane topics. They both neglect me they won't pay for my school lunch nor purchase essential hygiene products for me. I'm failing all of my high school classes.

401,"Okay so I really need to leave the nest so to speak. I live with my mom because I don't have transportation to get to work, and public transportation can't get me to work unless I'm willing to spend a lot on cabs.
I finally hit the breaking point when my mom decided to play a joke on me and my siblings: saying we won the lottery and were going to live in a house. We were so happy, but didn't tell anyone due to nerves. 
Long story short, she made my sister cry today, and I think we need to leave due to some words said.
I don't have my license, I don't own a car, I lost all my friends years ago, and I have no one who I can stay with.
I'm freaking out; it just happened.

Today I wrote two posts on r/movies and both of them were completely ignored, like ""1 view, 100% up votes, 1 up vote"".

If I switched to the Account of my brother, I couldn't find my post.

Is this an implication that I have been shadow banned?

Can you be shadow banned of a certain community or is a shadow ban for the complete web site?

How can I do something against this, and how are the possibilities of successfully outdo the ban?",25Aug2018,1

404,"I have a 31 year old older brother who still lives at home and constantly causes arguments and flies off the handle over nothing. He pays no rent, bills or anything yet always has something to complain about, especially when it comes to food. Our parents still work full time but are nearing retirement and have done everything to give us the best opportunities in life yet we have turned out so different from each other. He got himself into a decent bit of debt which is why he hasn't moved out yet because he needs to pay that off first before he can even think about saving for a mortgage. He has an average paying job but constantly blames the state of the world or economy for his problems yet fails to realise that a good portion of his past mistakes have lead him to this point, even going as far as blaming our parents despite everything they have done and continually do for him. He is totally unhappy with his life even though many people would kill to be in his position and I feel as though he is taking it out on everyone else. It's now getting to the point where my parents are beginning to resent him, and so am I, and they just want him gone. All I want is for him to be happy and successful but he just moans and then proceeds to change nothing and no advice we give him is taken on board. It makes me sad because I feel as though there will be an event in the near future leading to an irreparable rift between my parents and I, and him and the last thing I want is for him to be kicked out of the house or family unit. My Dad doesn't speak to any of his sisters and my Mum never sees any of her siblings so us four only have each other. I know there is happiness in him somewhere and he can be kind at times but I just want him to realise how lucky he is and find direction and be happy but any attempt to help him is just met with aggression so it's pointless. Just wondering if anybody else has experienced this kind of thing or has any advice on how to deal with it? I'd never get him to family therapy so that's out of the question.

Thanks.",25Aug2018,1
405,"So I used to really love my job. I took a lucrative promotion a few years ago in another department and all was fine until everyone started treating me like less than garbage about 6 months ago, seemingly out of the blue. It caused me to slip into a deep depression and suicidal ideation. Which I ended up going to the hospital for. My boss is supportive of me, which matters, but I don’t want to go back and face each of those assholes who pushed me to suicidal thoughts.  I have severe anxiety about returning Monday. I can’t quit or else I’ll lose my house and have to declare bankruptcy or something. I’ve applied to a few jobs within the company and outside the company and of course that takes time to hear anything back for an interview and to get offers. I’m sort of at a loss. Mostly wanted to vent to someone other than my (amazing) support system and to get an outside opinion on what to do. ",25Aug2018,1

409,"hey there guys, i need some... help.   
i currently live in Pennsylvania and had to move back in with my emotionally manipulative and abusive parents. my therapist says i need to get out, and go far. 

my job offers transferring to lots of different states. i could go as far as Texas, but they can also transfer me to Jackson, Georgia. i don't know much about Georgia besides what i see on television, and it seems very nice. i wouldn't have to live in Jackson of course, but around the area.

should i move there? is it a good place for a young woman in the 'prime' of her life? thanks ahead of time - i really am lost.",25Aug2018,1
