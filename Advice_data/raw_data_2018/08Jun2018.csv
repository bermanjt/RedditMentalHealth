0,"My girlfriend recently told me that for her senior project at our high school she is going to go to a bunch of supposedly haunted places in our local state and see if she can record any paranormal activity, I don't really know if I believe in that stuff hardcore. But anyway my whole family is huge on that stuff, and both my mother and my grandmother want me to ""defend"" myself as they don't want me to be followed by a demon or some shit. I really don't know how I would defend myself from something like that, and i'm too socially awkward to ask someone who knows about this kind of stuff in person so naturally i'm going to Reddit to solve my problems. Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks!",08Jun2018,0

2,"This is my first post, so please excuse me if I've done this incorrectly, but I really need advice right now on what I should do in regards to my mother and what she's done in the past, preferably in a way that helps me fix our relationship.
To start, hroughout my life, I've never really gotten along with my mother, and it's come to a point where I'm not sure how to handle the situation anymore. I would love to mend my relationship with her, but I'm not sure if it's possible nor if she even wants to. I'm currently fresh out of high school, and should be attending college in fall.
When I was younger, my mother would hurt me. Before I turned four, it used to be spankings so hard she'd tell me she broke the blood vessels in her hand, making me look at her hand afterwards to ""see what I had caused"". Eventually, she stopped, since she grew tired of  hurting herself. Up until I was about 12-13, she resorted to popping me on the mouth with her hand to where I'd be holding onto my mouth with tears in my eyes or dragging me across the house by my hair. As I grew older, this became less common, but even a year or so ago she showed me that she was still willing to hurt me when she slapped my leg as hard as she could while screaming at me. I asked her once why I was the only child she had ever laid hands on (I have two younger siblings) and her justification at the time had been ""if you punish the oldest one, the other ones will watch and learn.""
I know I've always been the least favorite, my younger siblings have even noticed it. My mother has called me a b*tch on many occasions, reverting to name-calling very quickly, especially as I've grown older. She's never cussed at my siblings to my memory or theirs. While with her in stores she'd be happy to spill to cashiers about how much of a problem child I am while I stand next to her, heavily embarrassed. I'll admit, I wasn't the perfect child when I was little, but I definitely didn't like being mean. As a child and even now, all of my teachers told my mother I was the best behaved student they had ever had - quiet, calm, and sweet. Only to have her laugh in their face as I watched her tell them how horrible I ""actually was"". Even now she's shown that she believes im still ""evil"", looking shocked when my siblings once stood up to her when she was telling me how bad I was by telling her I was one of the nicest people they knew. Two things I've been struggling to forgive her for, though, were within the past year. I've been dealing with a lot (sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend, etc.) And she once told me that ""it must not have been THAT bad if you're still around him (we had classes together). You must have enjoyed it a little."" And more recently told me that I make her feel like she has to ""stand there and take it"" when I calmly asked her to not continue to allow strangers into my room without my permission. (She had been screaming at me,giving mocking apologies, and name-calling right beforehand, I didn't raise my voice or call her names.) 
I've wanted to go to therapy to help deal with a lot I've been going through, but she's refused. She demands to know exactly why I wish to go, tells me I'm overreacting because in her words ""oh no my parent hit me boo hoo"" when I hadn't even told her the reasons, and refused to take me after letting me go one time. I had a second appointment lined up that she agreed on but once the hour had come she had refused to take me nor reschedule. At one point when I tried to have a serious talk with her about how I think I may be struggling with depression she told me that ""everyone gets depressed"" and used my older cousin walking in as a chance to ask them ""you remember being 17? Everyone gets depressed. It's normal. "" And using it to tell me that therapy would be useless and nothing would help me and to just get over it.
My physical health has also become a big concern of mine. My dentist when I was younger discovered I have a weaker enamel than most that I inherited from my mother, causing me to have the damage a 24 year old would have by the age of 12. I've been brushing my teeth twice every day and flossing and doing my best to take care of them yet they've recently began to crumble. I've been begging her to take me back to the dentist for months to figure something out with him that may work more than what I have to do now yet she still hasn't even made a call. This isn't the first time this has occurred. It takes me months, if not years to convince her to get me medical care when for my siblings or my father she'll make appointments immediately. Once I had gotten a planters wart on my foot that caused me severe pain when walking for months and it wasn't until I couldn't walk anymore that she finally took me. When my appointment came to get everything fixed she told me ""b*tch I'll cancel your f*cking appointment. You can't do it without me. You need me. You can't sign anything without me. B*tch."" Before begrudgingly taking me and complaining the whole way, not caring if we were late (which we were because she didn't have any sort of urgency). Another time (well... Two times) one of my teeth roots began to die, causing me pain that would cause me to collapse to the ground in seconds without keeping water in my mouth (cooled gas buildup it was causing). Instead of helping me or calling my dentist, she looked at me, said ""eh, try to get some sleep if you can. Goodnight."" And went to bed despite me crying and begging her for help. So throughout those nights I repeatedly kept water in my mouth until she took me to a dentist at 9 or so the morning after. (Still gag at the taste of water sometimes).
My father never knew any of this until recently when I got a chance to talk to him alone about what my ex had done, which let me spill to him about everything she had done since we were alone. I have no anger towards him for not knowing. She had made sure growing up that I never told him anything. She used him as a threat (""whatever I do to you, your father will do worse if he ever finds out"". He almost began to cry when he heard this. He never wanted to be a threat and apparently scolded her whenever he heard her use it.) And she told me growing up ""if you ever tell your father anything, he'll have another heart attack and die"". (He's a three times over heart attack victim, again, started crying because that hurt him just as much as it scared me as a child). She made sure we never ""bothered"" him or told him literally anything yet as I grew older I learned that he wanted to talk to us just as much as we wanted to talk to him. (Weird part? We all live in the same house. They're still married and always have been. He assumed we didn't love him because we never talked to him. He never knew we had been told repeatedly not to growing up). Thus, he talked to her and told her he'd call CPS on her unless she found a therapist for both her and I to go to - separately and together. She told him she would. That was months ago. She still hasn't done anything towards it. She uses me as a board to complain to about everything (""I messed up on ____, your dad will probably divorce me"" [not true whatsoever, he loves her], ""I have to do *lists every problem out. I can't handle your stuff right now"", etc. Those are brief examples.) So she told me that she wants to ""give up and walk out [on the family] but that she can't."" and that she's gonna postpone finding a therapist because of everything else she has to do and I just...I want to fix things with my mom. I'm tired of being afraid of her. I'm tired of being screamed at for things I don't do. I'm tired of crying at night wondering if she hates me and if I did something or if it's simply because I look just like her. I'm sorry this was so long, I just... Really need advice on how to move forward, and I've run out of places to find it - especially if therapy won't be coming soon. I'm sorry if this post seems to ramble on about backstory. Thank you in advance.",08Jun2018,1

5,"I've been friends with this girl for all my life. We have about a 3-year age gap between us and she's older than me. She's on the scale for autism or something along those lines. She's not so great at socializing and still oftentimes behaves like a child. I know these things sound mean and I actually hate talking about the situation like this. I'm not trying to say I'm any better than her - I'm still a child myself and there are many places where I need to grow, but I've surpassed her in a lot of areas.

Whenever I'm around certain people, I try to match my behavior to them in order to make them feel comfortable. When I'm with her it feels like I have to dumb/water myself down and act younger than her or just as young. For example, sometimes she'll be unsure of how something works (concept or physical thing) or what to do in a situation and I'll have an opinion, but I'm afraid to say anything besides ""I don't know"" because I don't want to upset her if it doesn't agree with her way of thinking.

Around her family, I'm afraid to act myself as well since I act child-like around her. They know I am mature in areas where she is not, but they can't even get past the filter themselves except on rare occasions.

It's like I fear being myself. I think there is some sort of idea in our society that people aren't supposed to show any sort of maturity greater than those who are older than them.

I guess what I'm trying to ask for is behavioral advice. Water myself down? Act myself? Balance?",08Jun2018,1
7,"Maybe a month ago I finally got up the courage to go get a mental health assessment, they told me I had ""most likely"" bad general anxiety, bad depression, maybe ocd, and maybe ptsd due to certain things that happened when I was littler. They told my dad I was suicidal etc. And after he told me he wishes i would talk to him about things but he hasnt taken any further action.  Dont get me wrong, hes an amazing father but everyone has flaws.  Whenever I say the slightest thing he tells me I just need to pray about it, I'm also religious, it's never been forced upon me but praying to god more than I already am isnt gonna stop me crying every night and binge eating  or having nightmares.  It was already too hard for me to ask to get an assessment I could barely do that and I dont know what to do, for a couple months before the assessment I went to a psychologist but it didnt help much as I maybe spoke 3 coherent sentences to her in those 2 months.  I'm not really sure what to do anymore or how to ask my dad for therapy again no less than medicine if I even get to the point of being able to ask.  And how do I even talk to the therapist?",08Jun2018,1

16,"So where do I start

I’ve been trying to better my friendships with people who I have bad relations or just very under developed friendships with.
During this I ended up getting into a more developed friendship with this girl, let’s call her A
I never really realized that I liked her until helping her with a final project and getting to talk to her and know her. I decided to take to one of our friends, who will be D, and asking for help. She wasn’t much to helping but she was good at giving me hell over it. I decided to start by just DMing her a bit and during this I finally figured out how to tell a girl how I feel without being confusing
But I figured that out in exchange for forgetting to wait a bit and not go in head first. So i told her everything and made sure i was still wanting to stay friends if she didn’t feel the same
She didn’t and she was completely okay(or so it seems) and stated that we could still be friends
I replied with
“Yeah, that would be great!”
And we had a decent conversation and I was rather satisfied over it.
Fast forward to today
She wasn’t at school(half days, she doesn’t go to them) but D did,  I asked her a last time for help and she said that I didn’t need to be a creep over dm’s
I asked what she meant and she claims that A said that I was creeping her out by dming her. This felt awful to hear but D has been known to lie at times.
But if she is being truthful I need to know how I can fix this and possibly get a chance in the near months,

So I’m in the middle of a predicament. Right now, sadly, the only reason I am in contact with my parents is because I’m in school and I need them for fafsa. I’m not going to go into my reasons why, but understand they’re good reasons. Every year I do what I have to do. I tell my mom when the deadline is. I set dates to do the taxes. I fill out everything short of my parents ss numbers and uploading their taxes. Every year my mother does her taxes at the last minute and almost costs me my pell grants. I don’t want to drown in debt once I get out of school so my fiancée and I have been talking about getting married much sooner than expected. The plan was to marry after college but we both have situations with our parents where it would benefit us more to get married next week and do our fafsa as a married couple. The obstacle is this: How am I supposed to tell my mother next year that I don’t need her help with the fafsa? Or my taxes? What’s a good excuse that won’t hurt her? I love her even though she makes my life difficult and I don’t want to hurt her. And just so you guys know, I don’t have any problems with getting married. This dude is my high school sweetheart.

One is a revenue analyst job in Colorado (i am from the midwest), but the problem is it underpays for the work and location. I was going to see if I could try to leverage them to get a bit higher starting pay since I am being offered a similar job here at home that pays better. Those two are salaried. The last option is as a financial rep - advisor for a local financial group. It pays commission. I am so unsure of what I want. 

I talked to my best friend about it, and I think he summed it up pretty well. I want the safety of salary, but I also want to step outside of my comfort zone and try selling financial services. 

I am so unsure what to do, so I thought I would ask everyone else what they thought and try to get outside opinions.

to assist the analysis of the situation;

I live at home, I am currently unemployed, the higher paying salary at home doesn't start until August, but I cant start selling products until I pass the certification exams, which I would have passed by the end of the month.

i live in a small town with my mother. we live in an apartment near my school, i have about 3 or 4 friends and i’m not bullied, but not popular. i see my dad once a month for a weekend, and i’m chill with him, too. my life sounds nice, and i’m not complaining because it’s been much worse for us, but i’m not happy. i’ve been at this school for just over 2 years and i’m getting so tired of the people here. i can name so many kids here who smoke marijuana, theres also a girl who’s snorted cocaine, a guy who lost his virginity at 8 years old and a girl at my table who’s had an abortion. “well thats just high school.” errr! wrong, i’m in a grade 7/8 class. great environment!

i’ve gone to 6 different schools in my 9 years of the education system and i know what to do, how to act, etc. but if i move again i actually wont be a little shit like i was every other time. moving would be very easy for me and would be new start.

i’d like to move in with my dad over the summer and start new... heres the issue though..

my mom has been going through a hard time lately. we’ve been scammed and robbed lately and financially we aren’t doing too well. she’s stuck in a relationship with a guy who loves her that she doesn’t love back and he literally lives downstairs. her jobs and business, and her friends and stressing her out and i’m her only support system left. thing is though, and i know it seems selfish, but i can’t stay here. this town is really trashy and boring and i hate it. my friends are so annoying and i can’t do anything about it but fake smile because i don’t want to hurt anyone. i’m going crazy and i need to go. 

my friends already know that i wanna move, but my mom doesn’t. how will i tell her? if i moved i’d probably see her 1-2 weekends a month. she literally misses me so much after i sleep at my friends for a night or go to my dad’s for a weekend. this?!

A week passed and she asked me why I hadn't taken her up on the date. I told her that I didn't think it would work out because of the above reasons I mentioned.

41,"I have got to have the worst case of “hover parenting” possible, mainly from my mom. I live OUT of the house, and I’m financially independent from my parents, yet they (mom) schedules things for me, and then she gives me a pathetic forewarning about it. If I were to object, she follows up by saying “it’s because I love you!” It’s angering me more than anything. She then gets pissy whenever I ignore the appointments, whether it be the dentist or the eye doctor, and then she scolds me for the bill she’s stuck with. She then tries to make **ME** pay the bill. 

She can’t seem to understand that she’s the one making the appointments. I’ve tried telling her that I’m 23 and I can make my own decisions, but that doesn’t stop her at all from still scheduling appointments for me. Moreover, she claims “if I don’t schedule your appointments, you never will” I tried telling her that I take perfect care of my health. I don’t need a dental appointment. Another thing that angers me, is my **GIRLFRIEND** is a dentist, and she reiterated to my mom that my teeth are good. That still doesn’t get through to her. 

I’m at my end here, I get so sick of my mom trying to schedule appointments for me, and I’m far enough away from her, that I can’t just drive to my parents’ house and say “stop it”. They just find whatever dentist/eye doctor is closest to me, and schedule appointments. The thing that burns me is my mom does NOT do the same to my older or younger sisters. ",08Jun2018,1
42,"I’m a 19 year old girl and I always lived with my dad since I was 8 after the divorce. I couldn’t handle my dads new wife so I moved in with my mom and it turns out she’s also a narcissist. She doesn’t do anything for me and when I need help she doesn’t care, she doesn’t help. My car broke down and I asked to borrow her car for college and work and she just said no even though she works from home. She tells me I’m sad and pathetic because I’m crying pretty often. I guess I’m overly emotional but when your life changes completely and you have no control over anything, it’s pretty traumatizing. I’ve already been down on myself and I’ve gone to her for a hug and she will pat me and then kinda move me away from her.

50,"So today when I was coming home, I was turning into a lane and a motocyclist was in my blind spot, so I didn't see him until last second. Luckily, I swerved so I didn't hit him and he also swerved a little and lost control, falling off his bike. It was at low speeds, so he wasn't even bleeding. We exchanged insurance info as well as drivers license, he said he didn't want to make a claim so now police was called. When we were in the parking lot, looked like 2 minor scratches on the bike, one which he thought he could fix. Called back later and said there might be more damage and was gonna look at the part price tomorrow and also welcomed me to come see the damage he spoke of.

Overall, he seems like a nice enough person and I don't think he's trying to rip me off - and I'm not trying to avoid any blame, it was ultimately my fault that caused it. However, I'm wondering, should I just go through insurance? I'm afraid it might be one of those situations where I pay for one part, then another thing comes up, etc.",08Jun2018,1

Neither of us really drink, but a couple of months back she went to a party (she told me literally 15 minutes before she got there) and drank a lot and tried kissing another guy. She failed to do so because her friends wouldn’t let her, knowing that is not what she wants. 

She swore she told me everything that happened that night, and I still had a strange feeling about it. I later found out about the “kissing” story from the night, and she said “I was going to tell you eventually”. 

Well now I have anxiety and worry so much. When she goes out with friends, I worry. Although I don’t think she would do anything to jeopardize our relationship, I still worry. I even get a sick to my stomach feeling sometimes.

Is she always going to act like that when she drinks? It worries me if she drinks and I’m not with her.

56,"My older brother (26) took a lot of drugs in college and played football in high school so through some combination of drug use and possibly brain trauma, his head got fucked up pretty badly. He went from a straight A student with tons of friends to a shut in with 0 social skills. He stays in his room 24/7 and is clearly disconnected from reality when talking to him. Sometimes what he says is literally incoherent as in it makes zero sense and nobody can understand what he means. Like he is saying words and using logic that he thinks is reasonable, but it’s clearly nonsense. 

He refuses to get a job or socialize and expects my parents to provide for him despite my parents begging him to. If my parents refuse to give him money or buy him anything, he goes on to guilt trip them saying he’ll just leave and that he knows they hate him or other crazy stuff. He moved in with my parents once he graduated from university, and since then has had one job as a seasonal worker at Best Buy. The job lasted three months and he hasn’t worked since. He goes to interviews probably once a month or so, but always does some kind of ridiculous self sabotage that shows he’s either delusional or doesn’t want to get a job. For instance, the other day he went to an interview with a hoodie and a beanie on, and his resume also has his nonsensical ramblings on it as well. 

About three weeks ago, my parents woke up to the sound of him jumping (and smashing) a flat screen TV in the hallway. My parents had no idea what was happening, and moments later the police arrived. He had called the cops on himself and told the police that he felt like he was going to hurt someone. He went to the psych ward for a day and was given meds to take for a few days.

Two days ago, my mom asked him to drive her to the hospital for an appointment (she was going to have a procedure done and could not drive herself back) and he told her to kiss his ass. This came completely out of nowhere, like it was completely unprovoked. This kind of thing isn’t uncommon with him so my mom just called my sister to come pick her up. My sister came (with her two year old daughter) to pick my mom up. My sister and my mom and my niece were in the living room about to leave and my brother comes out saying that he’s going crazy and that my mom and my sister think it’s a joke. This whole time they are just trying to calm him down and diffuse the situation, but he insists that they aren’t taking it seriously. He grabs a knife and starts slicing his chest multiple times and everyone starts freaking out. The cops were called and now he’s in a psych ward and he’s refusing medicine. 

With all that’s happened with him, my family doesn’t feel safe living with him and it’s also financially draining on my mom providing for adults as she’s the only one with an income. What options does she have to ensure his safety but not have to live with him? She would rather risk her safety and live with him than know that he is homeless. ",08Jun2018,7

58,"I'm going to try to keep this as short and coherent as possible since it is kind of a long story. If you have any questions about certain things or events feel free to comment and I'll clarify. 

So, my friend group and I have been together forever. I met my best friend, Ann [19F] when we were both in middle school and we met our best friend Leo [20M] when we were in high school. We call our little group a squad, mostly because it sounds funny and gives us this weird little mental picture of us walking around in matching outfits. The squad has gone through many iterations through the years and a lot of people have come and gone but, through it all, it was always me, Ann, and Leo. 

Last year, Ann's boyfriend [23M] introduced us to weed and the squad became a squad of stoners. We always had fun sober together but weed just added a new level to everything. We were all stoners together for about 9 months but then Leo started dating this guy named Evan [18F]. Evan has some personal issues with weed but he never stopped Leo from smoking it, he just asked to be left out of it but Leo really wanted to make sure that Evan was comfortable so he just stopped smoking weed altogether. It sounds a little extreme but Evan really had some deep trauma when it comes to drug use from watching family members do it so I kind of get it. 

The problem is that Ann and her boyfriend don't. Ann's boyfriend is always around but I hate him (That's a whole other post) so I kind of refuse to call him a member of the squad. Ann has not been a fan of Leo's decision not to smoke weed because she feels like he's only doing it to appease Evan. She's also been a little miffed at Leo because, as people do, he's changed since he started dating Evan and, to be fair, he has. Personally, I kind of liked the old Leo better but I do understand that Leo is happy and these changes aren't bad, they're just different. 

Leo knows that Ann is a little annoyed at him and, although I've tried to explain to him that it's not because of the weed thing, he has convinced himself (And Evan) that it's because of the weed thing. Evan is more assertive than Leo and he's had a bit of a defensive attitude towards Ann because of this. Ann is also a fairly assertive person so, anytime the squad gets together now and brings their boyfriends, Ann and Evan argue and then, later, both sides will talk shit about the other in front of me. Ann and her boyfriend will rag on what Evan and Leo did and Evan and Leo will rag on what Ann and her boyfriend did. This happens every time we get together and it's been a thing for a few months. 

I've been trying to delegate this and get them to like each other but the two are so at odds over this that it never works. Leo and I have been fairly stressed out about this and I convinced him that if Evan and Ann could just let go of their grudge, they'd get along fine. We've been working on that for a few days now.

The problem is that Ann messaged me a few hours ago and said that she doesn't want to hang out with Evan after tomorrow (We're going hiking and it's been planned for a little while now). She knows that this would totally alienate Leo and would break apart the squad but she just can't do it. I asked Leo if Evan was close to letting his grudges go but Leo said he wouldn't. So, right now, it looks like the squad is about to break into two groups: Leo,Evan, me and then Ann, her boyfriend, me. 

I really don't want this to happen. Personally, I am very tired of having to constantly bounce between two groups of people that hate each other constantly. I also really don't want the squad to break apart. We have been each other's best friends for a while, through some of our most developmental years. I don't want to lose them. Drugs or no drugs, boyfriends or no boyfriends, everything is always more fun when the three of us are together. I want to save this. I think I'm the one with the best chance since I'm literally in the middle here but I don't know how. I've never been the mediator. Any suggestions?

TL;DR I've had two friends since middle school. One of my two friends hates the other friend's boyfriend and the boyfriend hates them back. We're about to split in two over this and I don't want to. How do I stop this? Should I stop this? What's best for us in this situation? ",08Jun2018,1

60,"Tomorrow morning my SO and I are finally closing on our first house together. We are very excited to start the next ""real"" chapter in our adult lives. Spending the first day or two alone in our new house totally alone with no siblings, roommates, etc. was something special that I was really looking forward to. Somewhat of a honeymoon phase. However, my excitement has recently turned into dread. After speaking to my SO's mother tonight, she made numerous comments about how she will be with us tomorrow after we move in. She made comments regarding immedaitly wanting to see the new place, wanting to decorate, wanting to bring lunch over, even wanting to bring other extended family over! She even made a comment about how she does not want to go to the closing with us because she will ""be a nervous wreck"". She was never even invited to join us at the closing! While we were in the early stages of looking at homes and we expressed great interest in a particular one, she said, ""You don't want that one, it's too far from your job."" It blew my mind. No one has ever told me what I want and don't want. I told my SO **many** times that she is too involved. This time I told him that he needs to talk to her about backing off a bit. I explained how important the first day alone together is to me and how his parents are more than welcome to visit in a few days when we are unpacked and settled in. When he tried speaking to her about this in private, she was offended and asked, ""Who's idea is that? Yours or hers?"". My SO is now making me feel like I am the one at fault here... I feel like it's not an absurd request to make \- we are adults in our late 20's! I am not trying to be disrespectful. This is a relationship between ME and HIM, not me, him, **and** her.

63,"So first a little background about me: I'm a 19 year old college student who's had sex before but has never been in a relationship. I've definitely found myself attracted to quite a few people and of course, a lot of rejection came with it. A lot of times I take it personally and struggle to understand why a guy like me wouldn't be attractive to them. I consider myself pretty good looking, I go to the gym 4 times a week so I'm really lean and muscular, and I got a 4.0 GPA last semester with plans to go to law school and eventually pursue a career in politics.

So whenever these girls I'm into open my snaps and don't respond, leave my texts in read, or explicitly tell me they only want to be friends, I internalize it and blame myself. After all, if I've never been in a relationship then no one's thinks I'm worth it. So I throw myself into my schoolwork or my exercise, or even my job. 

I tell myself that one day when these girls see me on TV giving speeches or winning elections, they're gonna regret turning me down. I honestly just use it to fuel my ambition and drive to get where I want to be, but I understand how it can come off as bitter or even vindictive. Is there a better way to deal with this?

71,"Hey there! Let me clear up that I'm not suicidal or depressed, just unieldingly cynical. I'll do a short explanation of my 'self' but if you wanna skip past it, go for it.

I wouldn't say I live an especially outgoing lifestyle, but I am active in my community and group of friends, albiet rather small. I like to talk but am not very good at it, better at listening and observing. I find myself questioning my own goals and decisions, analyzing what other options were available and their respective outcomes, no matter how pointless the inconsequential the decision may have been.

and so, to the main point. as part of my profession, I study nihilism, absurdism, etc. and I've come to adapt a lot of the mindset they embody into my own. I am adamant that mine and all people's existence are meaningless, and nothing I do will really ever mean anything. Through this, I had initially come to the conclusion that although nothing I do matters, it is my responsibility to follow 'just' ideology and morality as though my actions did. Something along the lines of ""I'm going to die and ultimately achieve nothing, but I exist for now along with the rest of the world and It would be immature and selfish to do whatever I wanted just because of it"".

And as such, I do. I run my local Green Earth Organization and organize coastal cleanups, volunteer at nearby orphanages, Teach at theatre classes and early learning centers; but at the same time, it all means nothing to me. I could wake up tomorrow with all my efforts wasted and feel nothing but mild annoyance. I have no quarrels or conflicts with anyone, but at the same time I am not an especially popular or exciting person. For better or worse (And although it does sometimes slightly bother me to be lonely), I think my general status in any function is ""Someone who is simply present, acknowledge when necessary"". I don't anger or sadden easily, but I feel rather stuck in a constant state of melancholy. Of course there are people I love, like and dislike, but i am only truly affected on a very few number of them. I've come to accept I may have a minor social disability, but it doesn't really hinder my life so it's not something I'm too concerned about.

Although I have absolutely no interest in dying, the only reason I choose to continue existing besides my 'moral obligation' is my desire to complete the same purpose all people have; a family. Beyond creating a family and giving them stability and happiness, I have no true desires or ambitions. While obviously I don't want to achieve this goal through immoral or abrasive means, the process of getting there has no affect on me.

Just like anyone, I have hobbies and interests, but the true problem I'm coming into is feeling ""human""; I am tired of living my life like a reptile. I cannot bring myself to have naive hopes, aspirations or conflictions, but at the same time I don't want to keep living as a spectator to my own existence. I want a reason to live beyond moral obligation, but I know full well I don't fit into the societal system where people thrive on emotion and abandon foresight.

With that in mind, what path should someone like me take? I know family and love is already enough to sate most people, but in a way I feel just the same obligation (albiet more personal than true duty) towards this as my morality. Thanks for reading the plea of Albert Camus' knockoff cousin ;)

77,"Long story I suppose, and not as important or extreme as other posts here. Please bear with me. 

Started 7 years ago as a dual major Astronomy and Physics at my local university. Was doing well enough, when I started all of a sudden doing crazy well! Supporting 20odd credits with flawless (for me) grades, not needing sleep, spending hours and hours inventing new ion pulse engines and designing rocket boots, learning to weld, building Tesla coils, thinking I was a surprise genius. I crashed soon enough afterwards and was diagnosed as bipolar. What followed was a hellish 3+ years where I was on enough medication to power a small city, and where I drank intensely. During this time, I stayed in school (a mistake, I agree) , where I could barely keep it together. I hallucinated, had violent mood swings, drank like a sailor, and was overcome with anxiety constantly. I essentially took the same exact classes every term, either failing or withdrawing, for 7 semesters. 
I got very awkward around my peers and teachers, and was convinced that my professors were talking about me behind my back. I swore they looked at me funny in class, so I started to not attend. I started exhibiting signs of ptsd, bursting into tears near the physics and astronomy buildings, having the shakes et al. Friends and family convinced me I was imagining these things, and that they were symptoms to be conquered.  I had numerous encounters with professors, either pity filled interventions, accusations of abusing drugs and alcohol, or blatant conversations where the professor would say I didn’t have the mental ability for the degree I was attempting. 

It’s important to note that during this time I was trying so hard to force the same level of inspiration and love of astrophysics that I had felt when I first had enrolled, when I was unnaturally high. My life was characterized by continual failures and the inability to regain that inspiration, since by this time, I could barely read for more than a few seconds let alone succeed in school. I have stacks and stacks of interesting science books that I started and couldn’t finish from this time. 

Flash forward to my last year in school. I had accumulated enough random credits in physics, math and classics to justify a full degree, albeit in general sciences, but with counseling and practice I felt I could try for the proper physics degree again, starting anew. 
To my shock, every time I added a course, i would be administratively dropped within a few hours, with no explanation. this went on for a few days before I went to my advisor. 
This advisor told me that the professors of the astronomy and physics department had contacted her to reach out to me and Express their request that I change out of their colleges. Their express words were ‘we don’t want to fail you anymore’.  
I was crushed, and I ended up taking the General sciences degree. After all, if I went to the dean or made a case to force them to allow me into their classes, I would be subject to their hate and all of my ptsd symptoms would be confirmed. 
I left school to dick around with a home business for a year, while trying to find some sort of job. 
It has been nearly 2 years now since I graduated. I still love math and physics and astronomy, but I never ever seek them out. If someone hands me a problem to do I will do it and enjoy it. But I can’t find that inspiration from before, all I have left is fear and a history of failure. 
What do I do? Should I give up? Move on? I have other interests, but I don’t want to give up on the dream I had years ago.  I don’t want to prove these professors right, but I also cannot muster any fire for anything resembling physics, mathematics or astronomy. I am terrified that I will fail again. ",08Jun2018,2
79,"So my SO's younger sister recently revealed to her that their brother has been physically abusing her for some time now (sister is 11, brother is 16), and I'm kind of in a weird place about it. I haven't known them that long but her sister is a super cool kid and while her brother is fine I'm not at all shocked that he would do something like that, he seems to have some serious mental issues. The more basic part of me wants to beat the shit out of him, but obviously that's not something I, as 23 year old man, can really do. Her parents have become aware of it recently too and are apparently trying to figure out how to deal with the situation. I know I need to just stay out of it, but I feel a strong urge to try and help resolve the situation.

She is in a cosplay group and likes to go to this big yearly convention, which I have no problem with. I’m not gonna tell her what to do, she’s her own person. The only problem I have about the convention are the extremely creepy guys there, most would randomly touch her thighs, some would take pictures up her skirt, guys would flirt with her until she tells them she’s underage, the worst was drawing, uh... pictures of her. Today was just the first day. Is there anything I can ask her to do to get them to stop or at least make it known she does not want people harassing her?

83,"I have a problem deciding whether my standards for friends are too high. I just want friends who are fun, positive, humble, adventurous, loyal, and don't gossip, I've dealt with quite a few groups in the past decade

Group 1 consisted of my high schools friends (All guy group). I had moved into a new high school and they were the only people I felt comfortable with. It would always be a good time with these guys all the time. They brought out the best in me terms of making jokes. However, the issue I had with them is their competitive nature and their need to always 1UP people. They use to exploit girls for sex and talk about which girls they had sex with as if it was a game. They also talked about people behind there back all the time and felt the need to perpetuate their dominance in the group against other people.

Group 2 consisted of people I meant in college the first few days. They seemed very cool when I first met them (All guy group again). They were completely different from the guy group I hand in high in every way. The didn't exploit girls at all. I clicked with them better than I did with anyone, The problem with them was they lacked adventure. They loved playing video games and it was a hard task to get them to come out of there dorms, unless it involved food. Eventually I decided life was too short to be wasting with guys who didn't have a passion for life and making new experiences

There were other groups but just to keep it short, I cut them off mainly due to gossiping. What would you recommend I do from the experiences I've had? I know everyone has flaws but the ones above just seem like deal breakers. 

Note: I try not look for the bad in people. Quite the opposite actually. It can be depressing cutting off these people, but something tell me I should have. ",08Jun2018,1
85,"He is already such a pain to live with. Everyday we argue or fight over the dumbest of things because he just gets offended so easily. While typing this he got angry at my mom because he clogged the drain. Somehow it's always our fault that he screws something up which he does daily. He lacks almost all common sense for a person his age and while I do love him, I can't wait to move out and finally be away from him, atleast for most of the time.

There are alot of reasons why he won't be suited for the job but the interviewer hasn't lived with him his whole life and that won't be apparent until he actually works.

No, I didn’t take the pic without his permission but he posted it on his Snapchat story and deleted it after a little while.

What I’m planning to do now is go to his parent’s house so that he’d get grounded and i’d no longer feel threatened by the gang he brought on me or fear my life everytime I go out there OR just let him go and let him get away with him sending me threats over and over (which would affect my life heavily).

89,"I've been friends with this one person (going to avoid pronouns just in case) since sixth grade and we were basically siblings. However, once we entered high school they started to fuck me over with things such as relationships and friendships. For example, I was into someone they ended up hooking up with this and hid it from me for months and was not even the one to tell me. As for friends, they would purposely not invite people I started to get close with to events, in which they would invite many people, after that event when we got somewhat distant. Whenever we'd get more distant they'd purposely be nicer, just like the friend I met in sixth grade, so I'd get sucked in every time through her ways of manipulation (kinda hard to admit that, I used to consider myself strong willed).

90,"So I contacted someone who I have had a bit of a tumultuous relationship with during the past semester. I was very needy and did pressure him a lot. However, he consistently said he wanted to have sex as fwb and it just never worked out (either he was busy or I was, and it was really annoying). He also took advantage of me a few times and asked for a lot of my notes. When I apologized fixed because we had had a texting argument and I was definitely pressuring him to have sex, then he asked for a nude pic which I sent. Today I contacted him once more because I do think I have feelings for him, and I wanted to see if he'd ever speak with me again. We had a wonderful conversation online and he said he wanted to hang out sometime when he got back since he is now out of state. The thing is that he deeply hurt my feelings last semester and I have trouble trusts by him at all. He mentioned nude pics again but then apologized. I don't know if I'm thinking about this as clearly as I should be, but he always shows up for coffee and lunch, and other stuff, if I don't really pressure him a lot. Just not for sex. I think if he actually just wanted to fuck we would have a long time ago. The thing is that I have a long history of being extremely obsessive and controlling and bombarding people with excessive attention when I like them. I did that to him for months and I'm terrified of actually forming a fairly close relationship of any kind with anyone. I'm working through my issues with a counselor, but I'm not sure if this person is a healthy friend that have, and I'm not sure if I am in a healthy enough place to manage myself and not objectify and harass him with two many texts...and it's tough not to be obsessive. My counselor said I didn't need lithium which I had been on; but we are working on changing my thinking patterns. I feel that this person had the unfair responsibility of calming me down and I don't want that to happen again but I am already wide awake sweating profusely because he hadn't texted me back after a long conversation, even though he outright told me he was interested physicalky at least.

92,"I will try to make this as short as possible and try to explain myself in point form:

-I currently live in Canada and have been graduated from university for 4 years now. 

-I have gone through 3 different jobs since then because the recession forced me into retail for the first year or so out of school. Then landed something slightly better paying so I took it. Now I am at a job that I could end up earning quite a bit of money at and many would consider to be a ""decent"" line of work.

-I have had MAJOR seasonal mood disorder since high school. I have tried 4 different types of antidepressants to try and cope and none have worked. They either didn't do anything, or they made it worse. I will never take another one of those things again.

-Every year for as long as I can remember my mood disorder has gotten worse with every winter. This past winter being especially harsh brought me to the breaking point. I had my suicide all planned out. I was going to drive to the woods 20 minutes from my house on New Years and hang myself after drinking a bottle of my favorite wine. I had the wine and rope bought and in my trunk. My note was written. One of my best friends showed up unexpectedly that night and insisted on bringing me along to this gathering he was going to. So I didn't end up doing it. It was still a close call and made me realize that I honestly don't know how many winters I have left in me.

-Ever since I noticed I had seasonal mood disorder my goal in life has always been to move somewhere warm. I wouldn't honestly care if I was making just enough to have a small apartment and my gaming computer. As long as I never had to see snow again. I have been committed to doing this ever since I started working. I don't go out much, I don't take time off work,I don't date, I don't buy new clothes. You might say that anyone would be depressed if they lived life like this, but that's not the case. Ever since the snow melted I feel like my regular self again. I go outside and long board. I go spend time with friends. I am happy even though I am working all the time during the week at a job I hate and don't have a single friend at.

- A few months ago I got some bombshell news from something that I did on a whim one night while bored. I got accepted into a very prestigious school in Australia for a field that I have been interested in ever since I was in university. It's a very difficult field to succeed in, let alone get into and is one of the most competitive out there. On top of that not everyone gets a job when they graduate. Only some of the best.

- Going to school there will put me in a very huge amount of debt. Think like $150k worth. If I go I will also be putting all the money I have saved for moving somewhere warm on the line. The line of work I want to get into is viable for getting citizenship in Australia, but only as long as it stays on their list. It is on the list for medium to long term development so I think that indicates it will be on there for a while.There are other ways of getting in but they are all difficult to say the least.

-If I finish schooling there it will not make me very employable in Canada. Some people with foreign degrees in this field do find jobs in Canada, but they are very far and few between. If I did my degree over here I honestly don't think it would be worth it. I would still have winters to deal with, and this degree is one of the hardest one could attempt.

-With that being said, this is an education into a line of work I really want to do. For all intents are purposes this is as close as it gets to a ""dream"". If I fail I will not only be returning a failure, but I will be coming back to winter on top of it all. Am I mentally strong enough to be able to deal with that? I honestly don't know the answer to that question.

-Nobody should bother with ""suicide is never the answer"" talk with me. It won't work. I have read too many pessimistic philosophers and can assure you that I am the type of person who borderline religiously disagrees with you. Have you ever heard and Atheist convince someone of a lack of God via a reddit chat? Didn't think so...

So, is it better to potentially condemn myself to a future of complete financial doom for a chance to not only get my dream job, but to finally move somewhere I won't want to kill myself for half the year? Or is it better to be realistic, stick with where I am in the hope that I will be able to power through the winters well enough not to just end it before I even get there?",08Jun2018,0
93,"So, around a year ago, my best friend killed herself.  It’s been hard, but I’ve learned to cope with it.

94,"Hi there /r/advice! I know it's late, but I was hoping someone could sort of help ""guide my hand"" in this. I've not planned this post at all, so I may ramble- do excuse me!

I have to break ties with my friend of almost 10 years, and I need to do it within the next 24 hours.

I visited him for his birthday recently, and his behavior during my entire stay was... disappointing. We're the same age, but it feels as if he stopped maturing past the age of 12. I'll be sparing a few details, as I'm afraid he may (somehow) find this, but it's been a long time coming, and he's recently done something that warrants me breaking it off with him- if not for my own health, then at least so that he can get his head on straight and we can each follow our own paths.

I've been composing a letter for nearly an hour now- I'd like to run it by anyone willing to read, if that's alright:

&gt;[Name],

&gt;We’ve been friends for 10 years. Not many can say that. That’s why it hurts me so much to have to be writing this. This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do, but, for my own sake, I need to do it.

&gt;We aren’t on the same wavelength anymore. We used to be a really great pair of friends, and now… I can barely relate to you. I’m sorry, but, for my own health, I’d prefer we not continue to be friends.

&gt;I’ve wanted to tell you goodbye for a while now, but it was never the right moment- we each have had things going on. And as nice as it was to see you in person, it, sadly, only made composing this letter all the more difficult. I hope you can forgive me for waiting so long, and for dragging this out.

&gt;I will always cherish our good times- we had a lot growing up, but, as we each have been traveling our own paths, we’ve grown to hold different mindsets. I no longer feel this is a rewarding friendship for me.

&gt;I hope you understand, and I wish you all the best in life.

100,"A few months ago, I worked for a small town newspaper. After hearing about accusations of bullying within one of our schools, I published a request for parents to send me information.

The next day I received an email from the superintendent of that school. It was in no way threatening or even rude, but he asked us to stop the investigation. He also mentioned his friendship with the publisher and mentioned the newspaper's working relationship with the school (The school was one of our biggest sponsors.) 

That day the publisher told me I had to stop investigating, so I resigned and continued the investigation on my own. I have interviewed several parents and collected their stories. The state news agencies do not seem to be interested, so I plan to publish it myself on The Daily Kos.

A decision I keep wrestling with. Should I include the email? There are many cons to that. One is possible liability in leaking an email. Not that I have much that they could sue me for, but still a hassle.

But I also don't want to throw my newspaper under the bus. This is a very small newspaper, its struggling to keep its head above water. If the school stopped advertising that would probably be enough to put it out of business. 

More than that, the publisher is 80 and this is all he has. 

The reason I'd consider publishing the email to begin with is 1: I don't want to feel like I'm covering something up and 2: I feel like more people would pay attention if they knew about this email.

My feeling is that this story won't get too much attention either way at the start. But if there's an incident that garners the serious attention from the state news agencies, someone will stumble onto the article again.

102,"So, my dog, Roscoe, is a 75 ish pound English pointer/lab mix. He’s 3, and neutered, and generally very sweet. Mostly scared of other people and tends to hide a lot when people come into the house. Definitely a “flight” rather than a “fight”.

There’s a dog park at our complex, which we like to take him to so he can run around unleashed. He’s played with a couple other dogs there (one at a time) and been apprehensive but friendly.

Today, there was a 3 month old golden retriever/lab mix there, and Roscoe was VERY excited to play with him. The issue is that Roscoe got a little overexcited and was seriously snarling SO meanly at this poor puppy. His tail was wagging and he was smiling, but he sounded like he wanted to rip the puppy apart. It ended up scaring the puppy a little, and Roscoe also stepped on him a couple times which caused him to yelp in pain and run away scaredly.

My question is how fragile would a 3 month old retriever puppy be? His owner seemed understanding and really liked Roscoe but I can’t get rid of the feeling that Roscoe might have hurt the puppy or broken one of his ribs or something, since he’s so big and stepped directly on the puppy’s tummy.

105,"Hi, thanks for opening.

My grandma is 84. I hardly ever get to see her because I live far away. I'm visiting her for the first time since I was little, and I noticed a couple things I never did before. 

1. She lives with my aunt, my aunt's husband, and their daughter. All three of them spend most of their time out of the house. My grandma is home alone for nearly the whole day, every day. She's lonely. Either they haven't noticed, or they just don't care. 

2. They treat her like a maid. She's pushed to do all the cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc. all by herself, and she barely gets any appreciation for it. My mother and I are planning to talk to my aunt cause of how fucking ridiculous this is. 

3. Finally, a lot of her kids (even outside this immediate family) yell at her because she has poor hearing and apparently she can't hear them otherwise. I think this is a load of bullshit. Regardless, I'll be taking her to get a hearing aid this week.

My mother and I will be with my grandma for a week. I feel terrible for her, but I'm not sure what to do. I've been helping with chores and such, but I feel like this isn't enough. I want to show her that I care and that she's loved, but I'm not exactly an affectionate guy. I don't know how to do this correctly.

Please give me advice on what to do to help her and how to be more caring/loving while I'm here. Also, please feel free to let me know how to continue this after I leave. I'm not really sure what to do besides call her more. Thank you.

106,"So I was in a non-injury accident a couple days ago. 
Unfortunately the damage costs just about as much as the car is worth. It is totaled. 
My insurance company said it will buy the vehicle off me for a little over $9000. 
I need a vehicle to get to work and do just about everything else I do.
I know $9000 won't get me much, so I was wondering if it's smart to put a down payment on a car and pay monthly or just find a vehicle I can outright buy. 
I've always bought my vehicles outright, so I'm scared to make a monthly payment. 
Any advice would be appreciated!

107,"Let me give you my current financial situation:

I'm 29, I have minimal bills, those being limited to $300/mo for groceries, $243/mo for my car + insurance, and $115/mo for my phone. Sadly, right now, I live in a basement apartment mom rents out a basement to me because the cheapness is easier for me to bear than an apartment in the area I live, but I'd like to get out of here soon. Lots of negative history. Irrelevant.

Now, I do have an AA in Liberal Arts with honors, which has thus far counted for essentially nothing other than to get employers to look past my GED. But the reality of living in a basement at almost 30 years old with a meager-paying job I could've gotten without college, and no seeming ability to get something that pays a living wage, becomes more and more suffocating and stifling every day. I work 40-45 hours a week just to say ""I'm alive at least"". I don't know how I've even kept my girlfriend. 

Putting aside depressing realities, I've finally concluded I'd like to go back to school for Industrial Design/Product Design. I haven't done an immense amount of digging, but all the sources I read from seem to indicate that going to school for Industrial Design is time-intensive with a lot of take-home-type work. Which makes me think that there's not much of a way to balance a full-time schedule with a full-time job. Worse, I suspect that a program that demanding probably doesn't accommodate a part-time academic schedule—you're either in it, or you're not.

I really want to do this. I've always been a designer at heart, but never had the courage to follow through until now. And now it seems there's this impenetrable block. I can't give up the car or phone; they're lifelines. And I have to feed myself. *And* I can't stay with mom another three to four years. It's depressing as it is already, and at 30, it's also just pathetic. It was pathetic at 25.

Maybe I just haven't thought it through enough to really build a solution. That's why I need your advice. Experience, insight, anecdotes, whatever you can provide that will help me work this out would be immensely appreciated.",08Jun2018,2
108,"Hello, all. Summer break just started for me. I have panic attacks mostly triggered when I feel like someone is talking about me or when I feel scared about something. I had one today. 

My parents are usually nice on the outside. They pretend like they don’t give a damn about college and that they are different than other parents. They aren’t. They are worse. They talk about me and how I don’t do anything and how I am useless. They think I don’t hear them but I do sadly. But when I am near, they always say, “Don’t worry. You’ll be fine. Any college is good.” Lies, lies, lies. Then sometimes they say, “Look at *x*, he’s doing so well.” •lists accomplishments•. I fucking hate it (excuse my language). 

I do want to go to a good college and I do want to do something that is productive. I know they want me to do that too. The thing is if you want me to get into a college then PUSH ME GODDAMN IT. Don’t be a two-sided....either push me and HELP ME. Or not care at all. 

My family as a whole has given me anxiety and I hate myself for everything. For not being like other successful kids. For not doing anything. For not being what they want me to be.

As I got into high school, thing have gotten so much worse. Everyone around me is so accomplished and motivated. I want to be like them but I don’t know what to do. My parents never signed me up for anything so I have no talent. They supposedly don’t care about my grade but I still get A’s (sorry for my condescending tone). 

I have social anxiety and panic attacks which I don’t tell anyone. I always excuse myself to the bathroom so I can try to breathe, cry all my tears out, and calm down. I tried to tell them about my anxiety but they say, “look at the kids in Africa. They don’t even have the time for depression.” I want to stop my panic attacks and  anxiety but I can’t. They and many others things contribute to my anxiety. 

I have no friends to talk to them about my problems so I’m ranting on the internet. I’m sure no one has read this but it feels good to let all the anger and doubt out. Thanks.",08Jun2018,1

119,"I'm a dog walker in the U.S. and I was asked by some regular clients to stay in their home and watch 4 dogs. I've always felt at ease with the family, we get along well, the dogs adore me and the owners know this as well. 

They'll be gone for 12 days, it's currently the 7th day, and while trying to take a cute selfie with one of the dogs in bed I noticed a camera above the closet. It's very high up and out of sight. Going into this I knew they had cameras because of an attempted break into their detached garage last year: 1st At the front door for packages. 2nd In the kitchen that overlooks the living, dinning room and kitchen. 3rd I assume they have one out back. 4 in the guest room I'm sleeping in. 

Now the mom (call her Jane), while texting me information about their flight plans, etc told me there were cameras in the house. That's not what bothers me since I'm a rational person that knows it's legal for them to have cameras. She specifically told me that there wasn't a camera in my room/guest room. But here's the kicker, the guest room doubles as a nursery for their adorable grandchild (infant) so I understand completely why they would have one in here. Honestly I don't know how to feel/deal with this?

My boss and I are both very low confrontation with people in general, but especially clients. I mean, even if Jane told me there was a camera in the room, but that it would be off I'd have felt better, seriously I'm reasonable. Now I just feel lied to and like my privacy has been violated. Also I can see the green light for it and it blinks red at times (yikes).

121,"Hello Reddit, sorry for the throwaway but it's a bit of a delicate subject. 

In the very near future I will be ending a long-term relationship where we have shared an apartment for the past two years. I'm looking for advice on how to cause the least possible disruption and chaos for them. Here's my plan. 

Our lease requires 60 day notice for cancellation, although I will be moving back to my parents during this time (one bedroom apartment) I intend to pay my half of the rent for this period. The only utility we share is internet, which is in my name. For this I would leave my modem there still for the 60 days, but would expect them to cover the full cost for the internet. This is where things get tricky. 

Most of the things in the apartment are mine, from before we even started dating. The bed is mine (would leave this for the 60 days) the PlayStation and related accessories are all mine (though they have purchased some digital content, but it's owned by their PlayStation account) I am on the fence of leaving this for the 60 days as it's primary purpose is as a multimedia system. The computer, which is the biggest deal, is also mine. It's a fairly beefy gaming PC that we both use a lot, though all the peripherals are once again mine. This is the main thing that I would take with me day one. This would be a huge inconvinience for them, but other than giving them a day to move any of their important documents to a drive or the cloud, I cannot leave this behind. 

Dish and kitchenware is split between the two of us. I am thinking to leave it at the apartment for the first month and then together we can sort out who's is what and I would take some then and some essentials at the end of the lease (the toaster oven for instance is mine but I would not want to leave them without)

Is this sort of gradual move out viable? Am I not being generous enough? Or should I just take everything that is undeniably mine right away?

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I tend to overanalyze in stressful times and this is certainly one of those times. ",08Jun2018,7

124,"Hi everyone, thanks for opening.

So to kind of preface this, I need to explain somewhat of my family’s background. 


Growing up, my family was your average midwestern middle-class household. We had a fantastic homelife growing up with emotionally mature parents who worked hard, disciplined us well, and instilled in us a set of morals and ethics to make sure we weren’t terrible people. I always respected my parents, one, because it was the right thing to do, and two, being the good parents they were, they deserved respect. 


However, 11 years ago my Father died of a pulmonary embolism due to a genetic blood clotting factor (that none of our family were aware of) after an unfortunate accident at work. He was the pillar of our family, and afterwards, we all kind of fell apart. 


My brother developed intimacy issues, I fell into a spiral of drug addiction (JFT clean since May ‘11), and my mom turned to a path of self-destructive behaviors, including alcoholism and jumping from terrible relationship to terrible relationship. 


Over the years as trying to grow as a functioning member of society, I’ve learned how to place boundaries with my mother (with whom for a long time in my active addiction I had a codependent relationship with) and while it has helped me in many ways, it has created somewhat of a rift in our relationship with each other. 


She’s somewhat aware of her alcoholism, but has no intentions of getting any help for it, and has fallen into this mindset of stubbornness and a, “I’m the way I am, I can’t help it, and if you don’t like me for who I am, then that’s not my problem,” mentality. Several years ago she “retired” and lives off of my father’s retirement/life insurance/social security/etc, and has no other income besides that. When she’s not drinking, she can be somewhat reasonable and a nicer person, but she’s almost always drinking. 


Another difficulty is that she is co-owner of a vacation home in another town with my uncle (her brother) and she lives there, seeing as how it was too expensive to afford living in our hometown and pay for the vacation home. She has a sense of entitlement over that home as she lives there, even though she is only co-owner, and it causes constant feuds between our family and my uncle’s. 


We also have aging grandparents who are still semi-independent, and she feels the need to try and tell my brother and I to attempt to take over responsibilities for them. We are always helping them out when they need it, but as they still are somewhat independent, they like to do some things on their own. She wants us to take over the responsibilities that they still enjoy doing on their own, while she is only willing to do the minimal amount of helping out so that she appears to herself that she is doing a great deal. 


When we try to reason with her, she throws a fit and says we are disrespectful to her, and guilt trips us any way she can, the worst being how “If your father were alive he would be ashamed at how you’re treating your mother.”


I simply am at a point where I want to completely cut off contact with her and love her from a distance, but it is almost impossible since she is at every family gathering we have. I want to just scream and yell at her, but I know that’s not the right thing to do, and that’s not the kind of person I am anymore, or is it the kind of relationship I want to have with my mother. It’s so hard to see the woman who raised you turn into this person who is such a shell of herself who I hardly recognize. I just really love my mom and I miss her so much, but I hate who she’s become. 


I just want to know if there’s anyone else out there who’s dealt with a parent or family member like this, and what you did to try and make life better. 

**TL;DR** Alcoholic Mother is getting unbearable, and I need to find some way to interact with her while not letting her affect me emotionally. ",08Jun2018,1

I haven’t had a serious or meaningful relationship since she and I broke up, but I’ve never really correlated that fact to our breakup; I’ve always just felt I was focusing on other things and hadn’t met the right person.

I grew up in a really strong family. My parents relationship wasn’t perfect, but I always saw them as best friends. My dad can be manipulative and aggressive, but not abusive physically. My mother is a wonderful person, who puts everyone but herself first. We are trying to help her with that, especially now.

He told her that he was married, but that it was strictly a “business relationship”, and that their marriage was open. This couldn’t be further from the truth, and my family has always been seemingly tight knit and traditional. My brother discovered he was texting somebody a lot, and it turned out to be this woman. My brother told my mother and my mother confronted him. My dad admitted to having an affair, but had no remorse. Didn’t shed a tear. My parents have been married for 26 years and reporting his affair to his devastated wife and children was as matter-of-fact as it would have been telling us he’d got a flat tire. He said he wanted to help fix the marriage but blamed his affair on my mother’s refusal of intimacy. He insisted that his affair was a natural result of my mother’s personal issues. My mother was sexually abused when she was a child so intimacy has been a struggle, but rather than trying to help my mother, he blamed his affair on her unwillingness to “fix her problem”. He actually considers the emotional scars of his wife of 26 years as “problems”. No empathy.

Despite all this, he said he wanted to try and repair the marriage. Well, he started talking to the woman he had an affair with again not even a month later. I don’t think he ever stopped communicating with her, and I don’t think he ever wanted to fix the marriage. He didn’t do a thing while my mother started therapy. My mother found and confronted the woman and told her about my dad’s real situation - that they never agreed to an open marriage and that our family was totally blindsided to learn my father was stepping out on us. The woman felt awful and never spoke to my dad again. 

My mother was pretty devastated at this point, and she and the children (including me) agreed he needed to leave. He wasn’t around much by then, but when he was, he slept on the couch or another room.  Mysteriously around this time, we started having serious financial problems. My mom’s bank card was getting rejected for $2.00 purchases and the likes. Credit cards were getting cancelled. I’ve been buying groceries for the house. Supposedly the business is just in a slump, but we suspect he might be hiding money, or spending it before it gets to the bank. We also found out he’s seeing a new woman. She’s 24. My father is 50. She lives on the east coast so we don’t see him going around with her, but we know he showers her with money. She knows my dad’s married and she’s okay with it. Fucked up.

Sometimes I think he might have gotten addicted to cocaine, because he says things that are absolutely absurd. We found out through a friend of his girlfriend (who hates him) that he tells this new girlfriend that his kids “can’t wait to meet her”. This of course is a huge lie, but he’s luring her into his life and she doesn’t know how awful of a person he really is. The divorce will happen pretty soon, but they’ve been dating for at least 4 months all ready, and maybe longer. It’s so embarrassing that my father is dating a girl younger than my own wife, and I’m 25. She’s barely out of college and she’s dating my dad who’s probably the same age as her own father. It’s such a bizarre relationship, and the fact that she doesn’t suspect that there’s something very wrong with my dad is so confusing.

He also recently got a $4,300 a month condo, fully furnished. Again, my mother can’t buy eggs some days.

I’ve not been silent about this. I’ve told him many times about how painful this has been for me. My mother cries regularly because she’s afraid of what the future holds. She spent 26 years putting her dreams aside so she could raise 4 kids. When she met my father, she was a model in New York, and had recently graduated university with a finance degree.  My father abandoned her without hesitation after all her sacrifice. I thought this might be a mid life crisis, but I’m starting to think it’s who he really is. More time keeps passing and it’s just worse by the minute. That’s the hardest part. I looked up to him and I think his good fatherhood has been a charade. It wasn’t even 6 months after my youngest brother turned 18 that he decided to leave and start having affairs, and neglecting his family who supported him all these years.

He says he loves his kids, but I honestly think he only loves to be *loved* by his kids. **He feels no remorse for what he did**. How can he love us? He’s so fucked up, he doesn’t ask us how we’re handling it, or care to apologize for the suffering he’s caused. I get it that not all relationships work out, but he could have got a divorce and left cordially.

I don’t talk to my father more than I need to any more. He doesn’t seem to mind. That hurts a lot. I always looked up to him, but he’s turned out to be pretty awful. It frightens me. I wonder what other parts of my life could be a complete lie. My family was what I thought would remain rock solid my whole life and it got ripped to pieces as easy as buttering toast.

I’ve spoken my peace to my father multiple times but it doesn’t even phase him. I don’t know what I can do at this point. I’m trying to just move on but the reality of my world being shattered is just too much.

Maybe some people will read this and say I’m melodramatic, but I’m being honest when I say that I’ve experienced death in my family many times and this is worse. I can’t make sense of my past, and so I can’t find peace. How can I accept that somebody who was such a huge part of my life was just pretending to happily support me? The first chance he had to leave his life behind, without any legal dependents, he took it and ran. Not even a year.

What can I do? I’m moving on with my career and my marriage but a part of me is just totally fucked at this point. I loved my family. It wasn’t perfect but it was my family, and I thought I’d always have a father I could count on for help and advice.

How do I get over this? How can I grow from this? I don’t want to be damaged forever. It’s all really fresh, so I hope that in a year or so I don’t feel so broken, but sometimes it just comes down on me like an anvil. That’s why I’m on Reddit right now. Typing this out in my bed while my wife sleeps, and I’m stuck awake contemplating my life, and everything I thought was true.

My father will have to pay alimony, because we live in California, which is a no fault state. After 10 years of marriage, the wife get’s 50% of everything indefinitely, unless she gets married again. Finances aren’t our biggest worry. I’m trying to be there for my mom and younger siblings, but it’s a heavy burden.

I’ve listened to my father’s side of things, and he basically blames everything on my mom’s lack of intimacy. I think he’s been addicted to porn for years, and that my mom really wasn’t that unromantic. After all they had 4 kids together. I think he’s had a sex addiction since before the marriage. But he won’t walk about porn. He tends to avoid conversations and defaults to “It’s all going to be all right.” Then he goes back to heavy drinking, neglecting his family, and seeing his new girlfriend before he’s even finished getting a divorce.

TLDR: *My dad has had multiple affairs before the paper work for their divorce could even be completed. My dad’s moved on from his family of 26 years like it was nothing. I don’t know how to cope with the loss of something that meant so much to me, and seemed so real. I think my father never loved his family, but felt some gratification from having dependents and people who looked up to him. He left only a few months after his youngest child turned 18. How can I heal from this? How do I overcome this kind of loss?*",08Jun2018,7

146,"Hello everybody, english is not my native language so bear with me, there could be some things lost in translation in my writing.

I have this weird relation with a friend and I don’t know how to act with her sometimes.

Story time: When I was 16 I started to date this girl, let’s call her IMP this was probably my first ´serious´ relationship. Everything started when her mother asked me to teach IMP older brother to shuffle cards but for some reason IMP when to learn too, and eventually we started playing some card games and after some time we were a couple. Everyone in her family was nice to me, not so much her relatives (except maybe one of her cousins that wanted to flirt all the time). She and her father are fighting maybe 50- 60% of their time but they care for each other. But at the time Imp was always asking her mom to divorce him. After 3 year we broke up when I was in college and she started to date some other guy like a week after so even though we ended by mutual agreement I have always thought that it was fishy, since her friends didn’t like me and everyone of them thought that guy had a car and was perfect for her in every sense, yada yada. 
I didn’t avoid her, but also didn’t worry to keep seeing her.  Sometimes we talked in messenger but I deleted her because eventually she will always bring comparisons with her boyfriend and every time I saw her in the street she didn’t answer my greetings and looked angry (even though we live 1 street away we only met like 5 times in 8 years by chance). 
I dated a couple of girls in that time, but we broke up eventually.
Maybe 4 or 5 years ago she found me on FB, and we started talking it seemed she was having troubles with that boyfriend and since we were friends I ‘listened’ her problems, they were just conflicts with his family, because they tried took advantage of her family, etc.
One cold Saturday morning I was coming home from work and found her outside, since it was 6:00 am (I work at nights) I let her to go in, we talked for a while, told me that they broke up and I went for something to eat but when I came back she wasn’t there and after looking for her and I found her on my room, we had sex and she leave at noon. After that we started seeing each other a couple times a week, for like 3 months, I theory we were going to do out on Valentine’s day but she stood me up, and since I was worried I called her home for the first time in maybe 10 years but her father told me ‘wrong number,’ of course it was the right number, she called me from that just a couple of nights before but I didn’t say anything. She ghosted me, hahaha.
Almost 2 years later she added me on FB again but I didn’t accept the invitation, but since I didn’t was angry I would read and reply her messages later, apparently that 14 of February went she stood me up ‘the love of her life’ and his parents went to ask her hand and she went to live with them, until the night she started sending me messages again because that night she ‘run away’ that night after we talked for some time she wanted to go back with me but I could trust her  enough to be in a relationship with her, I mean we can talk and I can listen her complaints and doubts, we can listen our fears and frustrations and I trust her enough to talk about my problems but not to be with her she has been a friend for me and I learned a lot from her, and from  the mistakes I made when I was with her. I love her, I really do, but I can’t trust her, and for me trust is the most important thing (that and having a nice ass).
So we have been friends the last couple of years, I go out here and there and she always met ‘fantastic boyfriends’, ‘this is the real one’ only to get cheated and took advantage of, by now I’m kind of tired of hearing marvels of every fucking guy she knows, yeah maybe I am a little jealous of the compliments because ever single of them was the best at something, to make her laugh, to understand her, the funniest guy (yeah I know this could be redundant with the beat one to make her laugh), I don’t want to date or marry her, she is someone I love, but not in that couple sense is just, like a really close friend. From those times some years ago before she ghosted me I found something, even though she is cute and still have a nice body I don’t find her attractive anymore, in 3 months I could not cum having sex with her, yeah I have the erections, but every time we  fucked her I was thinking in other girls.
So my question is, why if I don’t find her attractive anymore, if I don’t want to be with her and cannot trust her, why does it upsets me listen of those other guys?, why am I so angry?, she is always inviting me to ‘play cards’ like when were kids, or to go to X or Y, but never have time for something I want to do, so I stopped inviting her but every time I see her, I have to listen about N guy, like being in a relationship is the only thing that matters, yeah almost every time we joke a lot and I still have fun being with her, but how should I act? Should I be more distant?

155,"My gf and I have a child just about two years and a half now. But recently I’ve been struggling with how the things are in my life. 

Information about me: 
26 Yrs Old
Working
College Grad

Info on gf: 
24 Yrs Old
Working
No diploma but wants to go back to school

So my issue atm in short, is she wants me to fully support her and go back to school. But she’s the type of person that likes to spend money and has the mindset of having more money means I spend more. 
I told her I’m willing to take care of her and build up our families future because right now she works more than me because she struggles to take the responsibility of our child. 

I’m the one who watches our daughter mostly and pretty much does the things my child needs without hesitation. But for her I have to always tell her to help with the things our kids ask or needs. I’m the first responder. 

She then tells me how I need to build a future for our family but the thing is that I really want to.. but I just am overwhelmed with all the work I put into our daughter plus working at the same time and all the household responsibilities. I’m the one that loses on sleep while she just sleeps in. 

I appreciate that she is working 40+ hours a week but I just don’t think it’s fair because I’m also working, although not overtime hours but just around the 40 hours mark with some weeks of overtime. 

I recently started finding other ways to make more passive income but am struggling to make time to build that because of how I’m rarely given peace and quiet time to focus having a child around 24/7. She said she would like to work less but says she is afraid I can’t support her lifestyle.. which is like spending money on unnecessary things like traveling/clothes/ and random pointless things. She just likes to spend money and I’m the type of person who hates buying things that aren’t essential. 

In short, I’m struggling with building a better life for my family because of how I’m taking the majority of the responsibility of our daughter while my gf just works and relaxes on her days off. 

I also told her that this year is the year where I’ll make more money, I just need time to myself to focus on it. She just struggles so hard to watch my daughter.. so I can’t fully focus on my tasks because she can be careless at times. 

Any advice to overcome this feeling I have? Some days I’m really motivated but can’t find the time to focus on my tasks because I’m either so exhausted/overwhelmed or have to give attention to my daughter. ",08Jun2018,1

158,"We hired a cleaner to clean our house and it was her first day yesterday. She turned up over an hour late and left early.

In the time she was here (1h40) all she did was clean some countertops and wipe cupboards down in our kitchen. Our previous cleaner could do the whole house in that time.

I phoned up the agency we got her through and they said ""well  if she did a bad job you shouldn't have paid her"" but the problem was I didn't realise how little she'd done until she left.  They said they'd put out a request for a new cleaner, but also sent an email later on saying 

"" In order to continue to attract quality, reliable cleaners and most importantly 
to ensure that we retain them, we are constantly monitoring the market rates 
for this type of job.

domestic cleaning industry. We also consider the national minimum wage.

But first off: IT'S MY FAULT. I know I should be more prepared for this, and there are no excuses... But, please don't hold that against me. I am really in need for some help, and I hope I can count on you, reddit.  I need  your advice on what my daily routine should be , and what should I watch in order to achieve that. 

Obviously I need to study my ass off and take some days off my morning job, but my question is about my hobbies/daily activities/occasional date with my gf/food/snacks and what ever you can think I should do/not do, in order to maintain a healthy balance. I am going to go hard on this, full-time, so I was worried not to burnout or harm myself.

My usual day looks like this:

* Morning: Wake up time: 7:40 am. Breakfast at 8:00 am (usually eggs/omelet with salad and avocado). Work at 9

* Midday/Afternoon: Finish work at 3:00 pm. Lunch at my parents house at 3:30 pm. Chill/nap till 4:30 - 5:00. Study till 7:30 - 8:00 pm. After that I could go to gym for a couple of hours for heavy weight training (3xweek) or take a walk/run for more than an hour. 

* Night: Shower after workout. Fast dinner and study till 12:30 - 1:00 am.  Then Sleep

If weekend, I don't work in the morning, so I study more and/or go out with friends/gf for food or drinks. 

Also, what should my daily goals and healthy ambitions be with the prepping, and if you have any techniques and strategies that I could follow in order to assure I would be at my best in 10 days. 

My current level of my thesis preparedness is around 15%.

A point I should probably make is that this isn't the final presentation of my thesis. Meaning the final presentation is set later the summer, where I would correct or add whatever my supervisor pointed in in this pre-presentation set in 10  days, complete it. So, I could get away with an incomplete presentation of my work, but I want to reach a good point with it to convince my supervisor to give the final go.

I want to believe that he would make the stretch and give his approval, but I wan't to do my best! Also, this presentation is public, so there is a chance that other students/professors could be there, but this is the last of my worries. 

So, thank you Reddit for your time reading my post. I look forward for your input. Any advice/tips could be helpful and they surely would make me grateful for your support.

You turn me into an alternative version of myself that is sexy, bold, and that cheats on my boyfriend. Your letter drove me insane. I don't remember saying half the things you said I did. That's crazy. It's crazy making thinking about you. Trying to forget you. I need to get you out of my head. My life. I need to move forward, and you make me spin in circles. I love my life that I've built. I love the future I'm planning. I love my boyfriend. That's why I need you out of my life. Thank you for giving me the space I needed when I asked for it. Thank you for every time in the future when you want to reach out... and you know that I can't handle it. I'm sorry R, I really am. I'm hoping for you... all the happiness you deserve.*  

*\- A*  

Some background: Five years ago I met this woman, we fell in love and it became the most intense thing I've ever known. Pure, raw, organic, passionate. When I met her I knew she was the one, no doubts in my mind. This was the woman whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. It was bitter sweet though and she ended it a year later.  

Every year since then we've come back in to each others lives, and each time I've hoped and wished that this time would stick. But Murphy's Law love me and something would happen that would lead her to disappearing, and the cycle would start all over again.  

All I know is that much like her and how I make her crazy, does the same for me. When I think about her, My heart feels like its about to burst, my mind races and my soul screams (all in a good way). And when I'm with her, she becomes my world, I see nothing else, no one else.. and I did the one thing I told myself never to do, cheat... But I did. We did. This time around I was with someone, her also being in a relationship (as the letter shows). I however took the plunge, ending my relationship, me engagement... because this time seemed so sure. We had met back up, and this time she was open and honest about her emotions, her feelings. She initiated the honesty and conversations about the past, present, and future. She told me she loved her boyfriend but wasn't happy, that she regret ending things between us so long ago, and that she wanted to be with me, wanted to be together.

I never meant to put her or myself in that position, never wanted to make things complicated. I only ever wanted/want to be with her.  

Much like the past, she disappeared again when things because to intense. I don't blame her, I gave her space and time, while all the while losing my own mind. A thousand and one questions racing through my head. Eventually I wrote a letter asking what happened. Days turned into weeks, which turned in to months. Eventually she contacted me asking for my new address, which I replied to. Then I receive the letter above.  

For me, its never been just a flight of fancy, this was the woman whom I wanted to marry without questions, doubt, or remorse. She's the woman of my dreams, the one I'd Love, Live, and Sacrifice for. From what I understand from the letter, is that she's scared(?), scared of her emotions, and chosen the ""safe"" choice.I get it, comfort and safety, I did the same with the woman I was seeing. I love and care for her deeply and the relationship was indeed good, but, something was missing. Something major, and as much as I wanted to make it work, I eventually came to the realization that It never would. With that being said...

A part of me wants to let things be with my runaway ex... 

Another part of me doesn't want to let go because I see her going through the same thing I did...

""We have but one life to live"", this is something I've always taken to heart and I do my best to follow it.  

I told myself to fold one thousand cranes before I do anything, If I decide to do anything. This'll force me to meditate and contemplate. Granted, if I do end up doing something, what would I do? Write another letter? Ask to meet? Approach her?

* Begin revising on next module for my exams. (I could realistically finish this today if I was focused).

* Going out in the evening. (But it'd be alone and I don't drink. And I have work tomorrow, and it would take me around 2 hours each way, I could study on the train).
* Meeting up with someone. (I had a date with my boyfriend but cancelled because I felt too busy and insecure).
* Binge eating and binge watching NetFlix.

179,"I am usually the guy who gives amazing advice to others, that actually helps them go through stuff. 

I am good at it. Except when it comes to myself. So i decided to ask for advice.  


**Short history:**

* 5 years ago a girl broke up with me. After that, in a short period many shitty things happened that destroyed me.   
And i am inspired by *13 reasons why*, and Hannah story to do this.   
Because i relate to her a lot.  
Except, i tried commiting suicide back then, and decided to never do something like that again. Mostly i didn't have the courage And it's probably because i was stupid ""or smart""  and took a serrated knife to cut my throat. And realized how painful it could be. But, to move on.  


**Today:**

* I haven't had a girlfriend for 5 years now.   
I tell myself that i should wait until i am fully prepared, until i have a good job, i can support myself fully, and her, until i learn all i can about relationships, until i become a man. That's what i decided to follow for some time. Figure out myself, and then start connecting. But honestly, it's not working out.  
I realize that i may be missing something in my life. I have moved, i have literally 0 friends, not because i am socially awkward or anything, but because of the succession of the things that happened.   
And i realize that i may be closed off to these things because of the past pain and betrayal.  But also that it must not be emotionally healthy for a human being to not have friends, to not speak to other people outside of his mom.  


**The question:**

* So. What advice would you give me. Should i get back into dating? Should i make an effort to make more friends?   
Will it improve my life? Should i try and open up to people more, say what's on my mind, ask for help, show that im not doing good? Show that the mask that i put on is not me, and show that im struggling?

183,"Background: I've been at this job for 3 years but for the last year or so I've been struggling with anxiety causing me physical sickness. I had a lot of sick leave and flexible working - which was fine for a while (my employers were amazingly supportive) but it got to a point earlier this year where I was brought in for a disciplinary and given a written note to be on my file for 12 months. 

This was in April. Now, I've been told that they're re-structuring the company and a management position will be created, which they will be recruiting for this month. I've been encouraged by both my manager and the company's director to apply and been told that the disciplinary won't hugely affect my chances (""we will be hiring based on who has the most experience, that will be the most important factor"") but in the application form there's a question about how many days I've taken off work due to health or illness.

Basically I just found out that he plagiarised a lot of his book, and I have proof. Upon finding out I was excited and told my inner friend group, which I now regret. Basically the information is going to get out now (which I have no problem with) but I'm trying to work out what to do from here.

Whenever I’m trying to get to sleep, I’ll just hear thoughts that are completely random and out of nowhere, like “I can’t believe he broke the piano” something random like that, when I’ve never seen someone break a piano. I don’t know, it’s hard to remember examples, like last night It was like conversations, quick and short, like a story I was telling myself, and the second I clicked on that they were there they disappeared?

I wasn't there for all of it, but it seemed like they put it behind them for the time being, and dealt with the emergency.

So for some background: I am 18 and my girlfriend is 17. I have been out as a lesbian since I was about 15 and my parents don't accept my sexuality, but they tolerate it. My girlfriend is trans but closeted and lives in a strict baptist household in Virginia while I live in NC. However, she is coming to a university that is close to mine so that problem is out the window. Now, she has been on HRT for 4\-5 months meaning her physical changes will force her to come out soon. I have met her parents and they liked me, of course they thought we were a straight couple. I am afraid for my girlfriend, but also, selfishly I am afraid for myself. I am afraid that they will accuse me of causing her to become trans after they find out that I am a lesbian (she knew for a long time before she met me so of course this is ridiculous). And more\-so, despite the two of us never having sex, we have been somewhat sexual with each other so I am worried about false accusations etc. Angry parents are a force to be reckoned with.

193,"Hi everyone, I am 15 and in 10th grade. Just yesterday, the entire class left to go see a school football match and me and my friend didn’t go. We had separate classes so I went up to my class and was completely alone. My physics teacher soon arrived, took one look at me and told me to go fetch the attendance booklet.

After I brought it, he asked what I wanted to do. I asked him if I could go join my friend and he could let me off the hook for today, but he decided that we were going to do physics since I’m not very good in this particular subject. I sat right on the front desk, in front of the board, so he could write stuff on and I could be close instea of way in the back. But he chose to sit next to me instead, disregarding the board entirely.

This is where it gets really weird. He was telling me about his grandpa and how he was a masterful artist and described his paintings in great detail. I was amused and nodded along, then he mentioned his dad. His dad passed away recently on November due to cancer, and I instantly felt a pang of hurt. I didn’t know know what to tell him and he was quiet so I just said I’m sorry about your loss, sir. He appeared really shocked, thanked me and continued writing on my notebook (the thing abt his grandpa was sth he remembered bc he saw a doodle I made).

Almost immediately after he begins writing, he places his left hand on my right leg (he was to my right), and let’s it linger there. I ask what he’s doing and he says ‘doing what?’ I tell him to please remove his hand, but he ignores me entirely! I scoot further away and he just inches closer, still writing on my notebook mind you! I eventually pushed his hand with my own and he retracted, but like 2 minutes later there it was again. The dude was saying NOTHING!! I was curious as to if he had any conscience and just let him put his hand on my leg, which slowly moved to my upper thigh AND THEN stopped on my waist. This 50year old guy had his arm wrapped around my waist. I started getting scared at that point an it was like 30 minutes to the bell. He told me to write something and guided my hand with his free hand, while pulling me closer with my chair with his other hand, and actually used so much force that my head was squished on his left torso. I tried to break away and he was pulling me really hard and I almost started bawling uuuuhgh

Eventually he relaxed and I broke off got up and started shouting, and he started CRYING. HE WAS CRYING and telling me this weird shit about his dad and mom and his wife and I felt so fucking bad and scared but I just grabbed my notebook and ran off.

197,"I’ve almost made up my mind, but I wanna hear whether what I’m thinking is a solid decision.

So I left uni in December and got an internship at a great nat’l magazine for the summer. It’s a really great program: past interns have gone on to work at The Atlantic, Vice, New York Magazine, The Nation, all places I’m super interested in. While I’d love to continue working there in the fall, they presently have no opening entry level positions in the city I’m based in.

I work in Citysville, but live in another nearby city - let’s call it Townsville. I also work part-time in a bookstore, work that I like a lot but doesn’t pay suuuper well.

While I’ve been looking for full-time work in the city where the magazine is, I’m not wildly optimistic about the job market and don’t yet feel confident enough in my journalistic skills to dive into a full-time job. 

I have had three editorial internships in Townsville, but they didn’t at ALL teach me the things my current internship is. Speaking of Townsville, there are literally no jobs in my field in there. There is ONE newspaper and they hire mid-career journalists. My best bet is to continue to seek work and freelance in Citysville OR apply for work outside of these two cities and go where I’m hired because I have loans and  bills and shitty credit to worry about.

Thing is, the bookstore recently offered me a full-time job and a promotion for when the internship ends. The promotion would come with a raise, up to about $15/hr, and more hands-on experience working with publishers, visiting conventions, etc etc. And I do like the job; rather than just selling books I also get to curate sections in the shop and organize/host great author talks. If you told little 18 y/o English major me this was my life now she’d do a backflip.

I am very very very lucky to fall back from a prestigious internship (in my field, no less) to a full-time job at a cool bookstore offering a living wage. And there are a lot of reasons to stay in Townsville: I got a gorgeous apartment on the cheap, I have friends I want to get closer to (and sort out my intimacy issues), I’ve made some great relationships with local businesses (free movies and discounted wine, hey-o!), I don’t have to do long-distance while my partner finished his media degree, and I’m always only 20 minutes away from my dad. 

Plus, my specific kind of journalism requires I read a lot of books I haven’t yet. I can’t afford to go to grad school, so working at a bookstore, freelancing on the side and devoting a lot of my time to reading before really trying to kick off a career at a magazine sounds like a dream. (I want to work at the New Yorker someday.) At my age (22) I want to start laying the foundations for my adult life: relationships, mental health, physical health, education.

However! Another thing I really want to get right is my money, and student loans are already rearing their ugly-ass heads. Already got a Nelnet letter in the mail. I’m going to try to defer them for six months but after that? I need savings.

And again, ain’t no jobs in Townsville. It’s kind of a toxic city that I don’t like. I’ve tried corporate but that didn’t work out. I’ll still be seeking work in Citysville while at the bookstore - and the bookstore has provided me with some great connections to people in my field so I def don’t want to leave it for a 9 to 5 having nothing to do with it - but I worry about struggling financially for the next, like, two years because I didn’t uproot my life by taking a job in Delaware or something.

So far my decision is to stay. It seems like the mature one, I think: staying to nurture my personal and professional relationships as well as my intellectual developments, so when the time DOES come to relocate, I’ve got a great support system, resume, portfolio, and my partner can come along rather than stay behind. Plus, I’ll be in proximity to the magazine in Citysville in case they ever do start hiring. I just worry a lot about the money because bills sure do pile up, and I worry I’m making the wrong choice because my journalism prof in uni always said to take a reporting job anywhere to really start a career. Plus, freelancing is hard. I’ve done it before and am doing it now but depending on it? Ugh.",08Jun2018,1

199,"So I've been renting out an apartment for nearly a year now, living here with my dog, my roommate, and her dog. Two weeks ago, I found out that my dog has fleas. He's had fleas a couple of months before while I was living here, and I thought I got rid of them. I figured back then that getting him on a new anti-flea pill and doing some vacuuming of the house would be enough, which it wasn't.

I did some research and learned about how hard it is to get rid of them, and how the flea eggs can lie dormant for up to six months. I've read DIY tips on how to properly get rid of them, but I decided that I would rather just get the exterminators on the case (and I would pay for it myself; money isn't an issue). I talked to my vet about that, and she said that both the dogs would need to be treated at the same time while the exterminators took care of the house.

But the problem is that my roommate isn't agreeing. She said she isn't willing to stay out of the house while the exterminators take care of the house, and that she isn't willing to take her dog for the vet for flea treatment; she already took her dog for flea treatment at the vet, but she wouldn't listen to me when I said that it's important to take care of the house too. She actually said I was paranoid and insane for wanting to get the exterminators.

I talked to our landlady about it and she told me to try to talk to her in some way, and I told her she wouldn't listen no matter what I say. Another problem is that since around two months ago, my relationship with the roommate has really gone south (she snapped at me for not doing enough to keep the house clean; something I disagree with, but whatever. I've just made the effort to avoid talking to her since then.) So since communicating with my roommate is not possible and the landlord has no idea how to deal with this, I'm not sure how to go forward here.

One option would be to just cancel my lease early and go back to living with my mom (wouldn't be a problem, she said she wants me to go back home with her).

208,"
Two years ago I had an abortion, I was 22, maxed out on my finances and living in a one bed student flat full of damp and I was scared as hell at the prospect of having a kid - I knew from the second of finding out I was preg I was going to terminate. Cold, but truth was I felt like a character out of that film, Alien. 

It was awful, and the day I got it was pure relief. 

I have never regretted the decision I made. 

HOWEVER. 

The guy I was getting involved with/becoming close to, I revealed that I'd had one as part of the conversation as we were chatting about prolife/prochoice - and he says he has no issue with it, but then over the coming days, decides that because of that, 'we aren't compatible'.

I'm convinced it was because I told him this as we were peachy fine before. He couldn't give me a reason either. Just that we were 'wrong'.

I asked my male friends, and several of them tell me that 'it would bother them a bit' if the girl they were dating had had an abortion in the past. Some said it might even be a reason to breakup.

I am just ... so freaking scared that I'm now damaged or something? 
Tainted goods? 

I have no qualms about my past and everyone has some form of cross to  bear in this life, but what if every guy I like can't handle my past?

What if I've ruined it with Mr Right before I've even met him?

Just freaking out. And some might say 'well don't tell your future boyfriend, lesson learned', but that doesn't work for me either. It's something I want to feel I can be open about without judgement. I am passionate about women having the right to their own bodies. I don't want a sordid secret. I want to be accepted, regardless.

It's also on my medical history, and my closest friends all know about it, and it just *would* come out. ",08Jun2018,1
209,"As a recap to my current situation, I recently found out I was pregnant. I currently have a 4 year old with my ex and have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years. 

When we found out I was pregnant his immediate reaction was to get rid of it and for me to get an abortion. 
I refused and eventually, he got comfortable with the situation and was rolling with the punches until one weekend he decided to go out and not come back home. I found out he was cheating on me and now I don't know what to do. 

He sent me money for an abortion but on the other hand he was telling me not to do it. I do not want to get an abortion but I feel that it's the only thing to do because what he has done is unforgivable and I can't even stomach how unfaithful he has been. 

I feel like my current child and I will suffer with him in our lives, especially including another child into this mess. 

I don't know what to do. I am 16 weeks pregnant and have an appointment scheduled. I don't think I can go through with it. ",08Jun2018,0

212,"I don't mean depressing in a casual sense. My internship is just flat out sad a lot of the time. 

I am working for an NGO in Athens that helps unaccompanied minors who are fleeing wartorn places like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The city also has a lot of immigrants from Iran, Pakistan, and recently Yemen, and the organization I work for provides social services (like English classes social workers, therapists, a soup kitchen, and a small shelter) as well as legal services since most of the kids are looking to move to other countries in Europe to hopefully reunite with family who got separated. The kids are genuinely great and are just kids in general (the good and the bad), but they've had to go through some unimagineably terrible things to get to where they are now. And for most of them they're confronting the incredible challenges they face as young kids (we work with people up to 16) who have known nothing but conflict and instability and are without their parents to lean on for support.

A lot of the time it's genuinely inspiring to see how well they've dealt with the terrible hand they've been dealt, but it's also simultaneously depressing to see the place I'm working at deal with the limited resources they have. The kids deserve to grow up away from this shit and it's genuinely very heavy work, but you absolutely need to put on a good face so that they have some source of emotional stability, however minor. 

The NGO I work for genuinely does good work and has been given numerous awards from the Greek government, UNHCR, and European Union for the way it's run. Funding isn't a problem for the most part (within the scope of its mission), but it's still a Greek business so there are some pretty inefficient practices. For example I teach an English class a few times a week in addition to the other stuff I do (mostly working institutional stuff, working with kids, and helping the lawyers), and it's impossible to plan adequately for. There's no registry of who is interested in English and what there level is, there's only one classroom so it's impossible to separate kids by level and the class is first come first served so kids can't go consistently or they're very depressed and won't come to class that day, and there are so many new kids every day that there's a different group every lesson. 

Today I had a class and had to bring copies of 10 different worksheets and lesson plans because I didn't know who would be there. The class is capped at 10. Today of the 10: 8 were beginners (2 didn't know the alphabet and had to basically learn to write backwards [their native languages use Arabic script, mostly] and 6 could read but only knew a few words) and other two were quite advanced. I played Simon Says with them for listening practice to start out and gave a quick lesson on the present tense which didn't suit everyone in the room, then I gave them all separate worksheets while I taught two of them how to read very simple words (I speak a little Greek which has helped immensely) and walked around answering questions that anyone had. It was successful for today, but it's really tough to give them the time they need when every kid needs individual attention. I've been giving private lessons to the kids afterwards, but I don't even know if I'll see some of them again if they get the money for a smuggler to go elsewhere (which happens pretty frequently). A lot of the kids get involved in selling drugs or street prostitution because they're desperate and can't see a way out. I live in the same neighborhood, which is pretty notorious for petty crime and has a high number of immigrants and refugees, and I'll see them out past midnight just hanging out in the main square smoking cigs or weed. One of the most troubled kids (he definitely has untreated ADHD and probably PTSD) is an 12 year old boy who already has a tattoo on his forearm.

The staff that works there is genuinely inspiring as well. I don't know how they see what they see and can moderate their own emotional reaction so that they can help the kids when they need it most. I was talking with my direct supervisor over lunch, and he very casually pointed out an 12 year old kid from Afghanistan who's always super polite and just a positive kid overall. He told me that when he was much younger, he stepped on landmine that caused him to go mostly blind and lose one of his legs (he wears a prosthetic and pants, I couldn't even tell). I don't know how having seen what he's seen he can be so genuinely kind and receptive. I guess that's a positive takeaway: that these kids can go through so much and still be doing as well as they are. 

I'm actually crying quite a bit as I type this, and could use some advice. How can I cope during the duration of my internship? I'm very very grateful for the opportunity to work there since it's good work and directly related to my research, but it's often pretty tough even though there are some quite positive moments.

214,"First and foremost, let me start by saying both of my parents care deeply about me. But I honest to God wish my parents had gotten divorced when I was younger.

I'm now 29 years old (almost 30) but I was thinking about my childhood lately. My father just did not know how to be a father. He never spent time with his kids. He always wanted to do things ""as a family,"" but when we went out, he never participated. This was also to the detriment of other family members. He wanted to go to the pool, but my mom didn't, yet he still made her come with him. I was in Cub Scouts when I was younger, yet the whole family had to come to meetings, including my mom and sister, who sat there bored to tears.

He also put other families before his own. He took a family friend out to drive when she was 16 to help learn how to drive. When I was 16, I drove with him once and it was nothing but him belittling me and criticizing me. He always baked treats for his coworker's birthdays at the library, yet he never baked anything for me, my sister or my mother on our birthdays.

It also seemed like I could never do anything right in his eyes. My sister could have committed a mass genocide and my dad would still love her. I once put my mom's lipstick on as a baby and he flipped out. He cried when my sister got accepted to college. When I got accepted, he said, ""That's great, PAKMan1988. Congratulations."" And he always talks about how much he hated the way his mother treated people, and yet he treats people the EXACT SAME WAY.

My mom and I, on the other hand, have a fantastic relationship. She had a crappy childhood, too, but she learned from it and what not to do. Other than the fact she was way too overprotective with me, I have no complaints about the way she raised me.

This morning I was talking to her and we somehow got on the topic of my dad - she was walking the dog, so he wasn't around. And we talked about all the horrible things he's done, and I flat-out said to her, ""I wish you would have divorced him."" My sister has apparently told my mom the exact same thing, independent of me.

Does that make me a terrible person for wishing that?",08Jun2018,11

He was funny, random, and we started talking a lot. We talked on kik and on Xbox live but he didn’t wanna share me with the friend I’d met previously. I being very shy at the time too didn’t see any thing wrong with it too much. But I gradually got to meet them and we all became best friends. I did not have feelings for the guy I talked to more. Although he did for me. I told him I only wanted to be friends and it seemed like he was okay with it.  I did however start to talk to other guys outside the group of friends online. If I was in a part with a  guy that he didn’t know, he’d jump in and weird them out, then they never talked to me again. He’d constantly do this. He wood say he wanted to buy me things and I always said no thank you, as I feel so bad about people spending money on me. He kept on and on about it until one day I caved in. Still felt bad about it. I sent him 2 t-shirts because I wanted to make it fair. He was a very unhappy guy, always getting himself banned on sites. Then he’d constantly moan about it.  I told him he should probably stop intentionally pissing people off online of he’s going to moan about being banned. I even tried to help him loose weight since he’d constantly moan about that too. All I ever did was try to be a good friend. He even started getting nasty with me for no reason. He would message me on kik. And if I hadn’t replied in a minute he’d message me on fb, then steam, then YouTube. He even made multiple fb accounts and kik accounts and xbox accounts. 
Anyway I started to get close to one of the guys in the  group of friends and we started to get to know each other. But the friend I tried helping would cut across if I tried speaking to the guy. I the guy I liked even told me the obsessive guy had even told people that I wanted his kids . I never said that, I always said some say I want to have kids and he offered and I said no. So he Obviously twisted that. I ended up texting the guy I liked and we agreed if we was going to date we’d wait to tell him because I didn’t know how he’d react, But a friend told everyone and the guy heard about it and flipped out. He started talking shit on us, he told people that we leeched money from him but I never did. I’d never do that. He has sent his ex on to my YouTube channel to say nasty stuff. He blocked me on every thing but if I play gta with my bf and his friends the guy will jump in, and try causing shit. I know this is all online stuff  but it’s bothering me.

When I was younger I used to do semi decently on my exams. I think I was more motivated and disciplined to actually sit down and do my work. When my mother passed away 4 years back, I think things started spiralling downwards since my mother was usually the one who made sure I sat down and concentrated on my work. From then on, I started procrastinating a lot and not do my work. This habit has followed me up till now, where I'll be taking major exams this year. I'm failing almost all my subjects and I dont know what to do- I dont even have the motivation to do well academics wise even though I know I should, especially since my exam results will determine a lot of things. I procrastinate by lying on my bed by reading comics and watching videos, and I know I shouldn’t be doing it but I do so anyway.

223,"Backstory:

About a week ago, the parking spots in front of my SO's apartment were taken up so I chose to park across the street on the curb in front of a different parking complex. I had parked there several times before without issue, so I hadn't paid too much attention to my surroundings and quickly left the car to head to my SO's because I was excited about going to dinner.

The parking spaces I parked next to were for 3-4 cars(so several people at the complex could park there), and angled to where if you were parked in them within the lines, where I was parked wouldn't have been an issue. What I *didn't* notice was a giant truck parked across all four parking spots(so no one else could use the lot) and the back angled directly at my vehicle.

Fast forward a few minutes, SO and I are leaving for dinner. Fellow neighbors at the complex are outside having fun with their families, there's chatter, general good mood. As we're getting in the car to leave, a large muscular man yells ""Hey. HEY. Who's car is this?"" loud and aggressively, pointing at my car. Everyone gets quiet. I notice I'm behind the truck and say, ""Oh! That's mine. Sorry, I didn't realize."" and I smile, start walking towards my vehicle to move it. He stares me down in silence, still obviously pissed off(this happens for a while, I have to get across the street). Right as I get into my car he smiles and says thanks, winks, and leaves.

Okay, whatever. He seems like kind of a dick, but no big deal, right?

Well just yesterday I park in one of the spaces directly in front of my SO's apartment, and I hear someone yelling hey aggressively. I ignore it the first time, but it continues so finally I look up and he's talking to me again. Tells me to come over to him, to which I say no. So he just starts yelling across the street. ""I saw that stupid smirk you had on your face when you went to move your car. I just couldn't get it out of my head. Did I do something to *offend* you and that little boyfriend of yours?""

I say no, it was just an accident. I didn't notice you to the right of me. He goes on to ask about my plates (they're not native to my state), insinuates I'm probably pretty intelligent and observant despite the color of my hair (I'm blonde), and says he just has a really hard time believing that because of that stupid smirk I had on my face.

He's incredibly angry while going over all of this and is approaching me, so I just apologize and grovel because I can tell that's what he wants. He's much larger than I am, and I'm honestly pretty afraid of him since he seems unbalanced.

But this whole stupid parking incident happened a week ago, I had totally forgotten about it since it lasted no more than a minute, and he brought it up again. I'm worried he's going to do something to me, or my vehicle (which is, unfortunately, incredibly conspicuous). I'm at my SO's all the time, and he commented he sees my car around a lot. 

Am I overreacting? Is there anything I should do? I never want to run into him again. I'm worried what he'll do to me.

227,"Apologies for the long post, its hard to encapsulate everything in this situation succinctly.

I am an early twenties male who lives and works on his own far from family. My sister, age 27, is having an increasingly difficult time maintain emotional stability for the past year or two. She used to be fine (although always a bit emotional) and have self-confidence, humor, and intelligence until her mid twenties. Then, after some crises, she moved back home with her dog to live with my parents. Now she has frequent mental collapses on the depression and paranoia/schizophrenia spectrums. My mother is an absolute saint and will never give up on her, but I can tell she is tired and turning to me for help. They have already spent $10k+ to help her in any way possible (read below for why). Here are the nuances:

&amp;nbsp;

- She has a history of drug (at LEAST marijuana) and alcohol use for about a decade, and under her new household (my parents) is forbidden from using. But she is an adult, and we cannot tell if she is lying or not. We somewhat believe that this usage, coinciding with a particularly bad boyfriend, led to the continuing breakdowns.

- The episodes happen multiple times a week. She cannot stop crying, cannot perform tasks, refuses to get out of the shower or her closet, etc.

- According to my mother, my sister does have healthcare through Medi-Cal.

228,"For as long as I can remember I’ve had pretty bad anxiety especially when I was around people. The last five years, since I moved away to college, it has gotten progressively worse. Over a specific two year period I had also dealt with some pretty crippling depression that left me sleeping almost 20 hours a day, feeling helpless, and spurred on thoughts of committing suicide on several occasions. I’ve since improved on that and very rarely feel that lost, but the anxiety has worsened, not improved.

Being in large groups overwhelms me and I tend to withdraw into myself. Hearing a constant stream of loud noises or voices causes me to somewhat “blackout” for lack of a better term and I can’t hear or process anything going on around me (the loud noises or what I was focusing on or who I’d been talking to).

My SO is extremely understanding and supportive but you can tell it frustrates him. We travel quite a bit and our last two trips I couldn’t seem to bring myself to talk much, have fun, or stay awake. I spent most of our three day trip hiding in the hotel room taking naps. I feel terrible that I’ve ruined a few trips like that knowing we spent a decent amount of money to go.

I panic, I shut down, I can’t breathe or see or hear, and I don’t know how to control it. For me, I want to be able to control it or rid myself of the unnecessary anxiety so I can function normally. For him, I want to be able to control it or rid myself of it so he doesn’t need to worry or become frustrated.

How do I combat this without seeking professional help? My career choice does not allow me to seek medical/professional help for mental struggles, and I love my job and it continues to be my only release from my issues. If I lost that, I’d have nothing for my anxiety and now infrequent depression.",08Jun2018,2

231,"Apologies for the long post, its hard to encapsulate everything in this situation succinctly.

&amp;nbsp;

I am an early twenties male who lives and works on his own far from family. My sister, age 27, is having an increasingly difficult time maintain emotional stability for the past year or two. She used to be fine (although always a bit emotional) and have self-confidence, humor, and intelligence until her mid twenties. Then, after some crises, she moved back home with her dog to live with my parents. Now she has frequent mental collapses on the depression and paranoia/schizophrenia spectrums. My mother is an absolute saint and will never give up on her, but I can tell she is tired and turning to me for help. They have already spent $10k+ to help her in any way possible (read below for why). Here are the nuances:

&amp;nbsp;

- She has a history of drug (at LEAST marijuana) and alcohol use for about a decade, and under her new household (my parents) is forbidden from using. But she is an adult, and we cannot tell if she is lying or not. We somewhat believe that this usage, coinciding with a particularly bad boyfriend, led to the continuing breakdowns.

- The episodes happen multiple times a week. She cannot stop crying, cannot perform tasks, refuses to get out of the shower or her closet, etc.

- According to my mother, my sister does have healthcare through Medi-Cal. Apparently one of the many doctors she saw prescribed a medicine for schizophrenia that helped for a month or two but was too expensive to continue without insurance covering it. Part of the reason so much money has been spent is because my sister has been going to all kinds of therapists and doctors.

Also, I love hanging out with my friends and she has probably hung out with them 2-3 times in our relationship. She is extremely, extremely type A and I am pretty type B (which causes her to get very mad at me when I’m the least bit disorganized). I am also the only one who initiates sex, which makes me feel terrible and pushy. I love her, but these problems are seeming harder and harder to deal with...

We dated for about 4 months, after which she said she stopped having feelings for me, so broke up, and she started dating someone else. We didn't talk at all for about 2 or 3 months after that, when I messaged her about wanting to be friends again.

 We mostly play games online, but we ended up going to an event together to hang out. After this event, I came to a realization, I still have a lot of feelings for her and like her a lot, but, she doesn't for me, And she's dating someone else now, so I just am looking for a friend. The next day she tell me that she still has feelings for me, and isn't dating anyone else, but isn't looking for a relationship(addition, I asked her if she wanted to go on a date and see what happened from that), but said she loves me still.

237,"The title says it all. I was physically/sexually abused for nearly a decade. I was told that if anyone found out what I was going through, I would be beaten up even more. Several times, I reached out to the teachers and neighbors for help, but all of them blatantly ignored me. I even called the police on my parents once, and nothing came out of it.

When I was in late teens, I was consumed by so much anger and hatred. As a result, I used to refuse to care about anything but my own well-being. Nobody cared, nobody helped me when I was in a living hell... so why should I be bothered to care about others? That was my thought process. In a way, I hated society for failing me and ruining my life. It didn't help that people in my hometown spent so much time gossiping about my past, like my scars and bruises were their entertainment. I think I was genuinely misantrophic for a while.

Now I am trying to heal my past trauma and overcome trust issues that prevent me from having positive, meaningful relationships with others. I tried free counseling and therapy (could not afford other options), but somehow talking about my past experiences made things worse for me. I was literally bed-ridden for days after each visit. Therapy made me think about things I would rather forget. And I was physically getting ill because of it.

I've had a few girlfriends in the past and he always asks me how I get them but truth is... i'm gay but didn't really accept that at the time (he doesn't know i'm gay btw).

244,"My mom drove 2,700 across the country to visit me and brought the dogs. I have a small condo and a room ready for her. It's only been three days, but I feel like I don't want to go home and I don't want to spend time with her.

I spent a lot of time and money preparing the place for her. I built her furniture from IKEA, painted her room, and hired a maid to clean the whole house. I bought her a TV because she insisted she wanted to watch TV when she was here. Spent around $1000 dollars just to get everything ready for her. I really felt like I went out of my way to make her feel welcome.

When she arrived, she called me and derisively said she thought the place was disgusting and more or less said I should be ashamed to live like this. She seemed to have the expectation that, in the six months I owned the place, I should have totally renovated it. She commented that the appliances were old and I should be replacing all of them *immediately*. I hugely taken aback by all of this; for example, she complained that ""the washing machine was old"" and I need to buy a totally new one, *today*. I asked her what was wrong with the one that was there, and her only comment was that it was ""from the 90s"". She couldn't provide any explanation of anything wrong with it. She had the same commentary on the bathroom, she said it was unusable. I asked what the problem was, and should I get a plumber in to fix it, and she said that the tiles were too ugly and I needed to replace the floor.

It's not like I haven't been working on home improvements. In the few months since I bought it, I painted the entire interior of place, replaced the floors upstairs with hardwood vinyl, and replaced all the blinds. I installed new smart home appliances across the entire house (Nest, Hue lights, keycode door lock). She is saying this isn't even close to enough. She thinks I should spend 20k\+ to renovate the house to make it ""liveable""; things like marble countertops, new floors, a whole new kitchen arrangement, etc.

When I told her I simply don't have that kind of money sitting around, she seemed completely surprised. She said she would have to review my finances and see why I don't have the money, and she said it in a very accusing tone (I am a single 26 year old guy and JUST bought a house 6 months ago). She commented heavily on how much I spent on gym stuff (gym clothes, boxing gloves, hand wraps, gym membership; \~$200/month). I told her that was my main hobby and she said I should cut it out completely to put money into renovating the house. She also commented on how much I eat  takeout food. I told her I leave for work at 7:30AM and get home at 10:30PM so I don't really have time to cook. She says I should stop spending time in the city after work and come home to cook.

This continued to the point where I felt like she was forcing a lifestyle on me. She was saying I should get a puppy. I told her I don't think I have the time or finances to facilitate for that. She also said she expects that I should be married within the next 2 years, but I am not even in a relationship.

246,"Heyyyyy so here I am finishing up a work trip. Please help? Apologize for lots of text and formatting - on mobile etc. etc. 

This is the third trip I’ve taken with this company, and there have never been any ground rules put in place. 

This is an example from our last trip: when I asked how they would like me to fill out my time card, they were surprised I would consider getting paid(?!) because they were paying for travel, conference, food, etc. (I’m not salaried. If I’m not clocked in I’m not getting paid.) We’re on the same page now, but I plan on chatting with them about everything else and want to present a sound argument. 

So some background - my bosses are VERY frugal and very religious. When it comes to meals and whatnot, they just kind of expect me to go wherever they go, in the car they rented. I’ve suggested nice cheap places, and they find fault with those somehow (”It took too long”, “I liked the stuff at {cheaper restaurant} better”, etc.).

We eat lunch together, and they order the cheapest thing &amp; share a water. So often when I’m ordering I don’t get what I normally would out of respect for their values. 

They also had us all fly in two days early, so they could go on vacation. And they kind of expected me to go hang out with family? All my family lives 6+ hours away..... So I rented a car and got a sweet, cheap AirBnB and hung out on the beach. 

Do they pay that? Do I pay that?? My reasoning is that I wouldn’t have spent the damn money on room/board if I wasn’t here. I would’ve been working at my other job and this have a net gain rather than a net loss. 

In their defense - boss offered to extend the hotel stay for those two extra days, but I didn’t know my plans at the time (I was investigating the family thing). Plus I’m not staying by myself in a crappy hotel without a car in a strange city. 

I’m just very confused about reimbursement in general. I want to create a policy for the future - I’m trying to quit soon and this is my last trip, but I don’t want the poor sucker who comes after me to have to deal with this). 

One more thing - this trip cut into my actual vacation, so I just drove to/parked at the airport. They offered to let me ride with them....

Last time I rode with them, I felt insanely unsafe. There wasn’t an air conditioner, and my boss is a terrible driver (like he’s texting clients while driving). Then when it came time to drive me back to my house, things got real weird. There’s a city “B” about halfway between the airport &amp; our city “A” - my boss’s parents live there, and that’s where the kids stayed while they were on the trip. So they’re like “well we were just going to stay in B and drive back in the morning so we didn’t have to wake the kids. So we can wake them &amp; drive home or you can take this car. Or you can spend the night, we have plenty of room!”

They have 9 kids and when they’re all riding together NO ONE gets a seatbelt... so that’s not an option. I drove the stupid car home (no A/C, also no working seatbelt). Sooo for this trip I declined the ride to the airport. I also parked in the second-cheapest parking, because I felt safer (it was 10 pm). So do I get reimbursed for that if the option to ride with them was there? Should I get reimbursed for my full parking price, or the cheapest available? 

I’m over thinking this. I really just want to know what other folks do so I can a) feel respected by getting reimbursed properly and b) make it so the next person does too. 

Oh and PS I know I need to grow a pair and tell them when I’m uncomfortable. Working on it. :/

I like helping people, and I love going to school, and actually profiting from it, but the job is simply just soul-crushing.
Even though I have a desire for helping people, you still quite literally get treated like garbage at times... But this isn’t only the costumers - it’s my colleagues too. This is especially the deputy manager. She seems to genuinely dislike me - which is fair - but she can keep her condescending comments to herself. She doesn’t though. For instance: I have been sick this week with a fever, and since I live alone, I’ll be online entertaining myself. My sister tagged me in some post about unicorn candy on Facebook, and I responded with the unicorn emoji. The deputy manger saw this, and immediately confronted me, and told me, that I was well enough to come back to work.
I really don’t feel, that I’ve done anything wrong, and it actually just upsets me. I know we are from way different generations, and we probably have different opinions on this matter. This isn’t the only case of her being “weird” towards me. She doesn’t give my other colleagues this attitude.

My biggest issue right now is basically getting up in the morning. I hate going to work, but it’s a part of my education, so I can’t quit working without having to quit studying too. It’s something that crosses my mind all the time. The only reason I haven’t done it is because of the whole economic side effect (rent, food etc.). My parents would probably have a fit too, but that’s really the least of my concerns.
If I could chose for myself with no consequences whatsoever, I would move to the capital here, and just write my freaky poems about empty voids inside of me, listen to my freaky music and be all artsy and free spirited

His flirtations and advances can be quite flattering, but I try not to encourage them, since I don't want to be a dick. Overall, we have a really good friendship.

One stop on our trip, we went to some natural hot springs. Like most hot springs, these are clothing optional, and functionally nude. I am a fairly conservative guy in my personal life, and would never go to a nudist camp or linger in the locker room without a towel or anything like that, but whenever I've gone to hot springs I've gone nude, and we did this trip.

My friend feels strongly that this is an indication I had changed my mind about a relationship with him and was sending him a green light. I can see where he's coming from at some level, but I don't agree. This was at public hot springs where other groups of friends and where families with kids were, not something private or romantic.

As you can imagine, the problem with a fight when you're on a trip like this is that you can't get air to breathe, and it became pretty strained. All the worse that he can tell that I don't actually agree that I sent him a major green light here, despite apologizing.

258,"I am 19 years old. My mom's best friend has two sons, one who is probably around 25 and the other in his early thirties. I know the younger one personally but do not know the older one. The older brother owns a cleaning business that cleans retail establishments and my mom hooked it up so that I could work for him for the month of April. The younger brother trained me for a day, and I worked and received no complaints on the quality of my work or anything like that. I was supposed to be paid at the end of April, so when the beginning of April came around, I (politely) started asking about  my pay. I first communicated with the younger brother and he said I would have my money this week for about two weeks, then I started communicating with the business owner wondering what was taking so long. He said he lost the contract with the store I cleaned because it was on thin ice before I started working there (one of the employees did not clean consistently enough). He then said it was not my issue and he normally wouldn't pay me, and he is not paying his brother, but he will pay me because I am friends his mother. I thought this a bit much, but that was family matter and was none of my business. Another week later, nothing, so I send him a long text explaining that I would like the money that I earned, and if it would make it easier he can send me half this week and the other half the next. About four days later, he sent me half through Zelle. 8 days after that, I texted him ""Hey, what's up with the other half?"", and he called me. He was mad that I asked for the money because I guess he felt I wasn't being polite enough (even if I wasn't, so what; you're a month late on my pay.), and started acting like he had a problem. I told him I just wanted what I worked for and he was just like ""Nigga you'll get your bread"", and hung up. A few days later, nothing, so I text him threatening him with court if I do not have my money by friday (today). He told me to meet him when he is in the city and I told him I do not live there anymore (I don't). I do intend to keep my word and take him to small claims court, but would it be worth it? Would the fees be larger than my pay? I guess he thought he could take advantage of me because I am a generally very nice and friendly young guy, but I won't tolerate anyone stealing from me.

TLDR; guy i worked for was supposed to pay me (under the table) and didn't. is it worth my while to take it to court?",08Jun2018,1
259,"She is one of the most genuine people I have met. I only really talked with her once a few years ago, but she was like a kindergarten teacher for adults - kind, unjudging, and  engaging. We had many friends in common so we became Facebook friends. 

She became pregnant with her second daughter and the pregnancy was tough, but she gave birth and everything seemed to be going well. So many pictures and happy posts. But then there was an emergency, and her baby ended up in the children’s hospital, and she and her husband had to deal with taking her off life support as tests found there was no brain activity. 

Maybe I’m not close enough to say anything at all, but I’ve been through tragedies and I know it feels good to know people care, even if they aren’t very close. My problem is I don’t know exactly what to say. “Hugs” and thoughts and prayers are not helpful. I’m sure she has many people close to her she can cry, yell, break shit, get shitfaced drunk, whatever she needs to do with (I know those offers helped me). I just don’t know how (or if I should) I can tell her I think about her and my heart is breaking for her and her husband and other daughter.

260,"I'm 21, living at home with my family. 

I go to therapy as often as I can (usually every other week because it is a 20-30 minute drive from my house and I have to have a ride from a family member. I don't know how to drive. I've tried a few times when my permit was not expired, but I am very anxious about driving). 

I see a psychiatrist and have been trying many, many different medications to get my mental health back in order, but haven't had much luck. In combination with the medication I have been trying to workout, eat healthy,  and do things I enjoy. 

But I haven't been able to do that because I had surgery recently and was stuck in bed/ at home for about two weeks. 

I finished my first semester at community college about a month ago. 

I had a part time job (10 hours a week) for about four years, but quit at the beginning of this year because my mental and physical health were making it hard for me to continue going in. I was always missing days of work from the beginning. This job was walking distance from my house, so I didn't have to worry about driving. I do not know how to drive and have bad anxiety so another job doesn't feel like an option at the moment. 

I wanted to sign up for summer classes at my community college, but I haven't been able to leave the house (a combination of anxiety and recovering from surgery). 

Since I cannot work, I do my best to take care of the house so my mom doesn't have to (she works full time, dad is retired and does nothing all day). I spend a lot of my time cleaning and taking care of the house. Twice in the past 6 months my brother has told me I'm not doing enough around the house even though I pick up after everyone and make sure I'm doing more than my part since I know I struggle to find work and get to school. I don't want to live here in an environment where I do not feel appreciated or respected for what I try to do. 

I want to go to a four year school to get away from my family, but I can't transfer yet. I did well in high school but I did not get the chance to take the SAT, so I feel limited to where I can apply / I don't have the money to go. Which is why I tried out community college. It was not bad, but I am still stuck at home. 

I can't move out because I do not have enough money. I have about $200 left from when I worked part time. I don't go out because I do not have friends and because I do not have money to spend on entertainment. 
I want to get away from here, but I feel as though my options are very limited / I do not have any because I do not work and I do not have enough money to support myself. Is applying for disability an option for me? Would I be able to move out if I receive disability? How do you apply to a four year school when you did well in highschool, but  did not take the SAT and do not have enough credits yet from community college to transfer? How do I move forward with my life so I don't feel stuck anymore? 

I feel so guilty for wanting to leave because my parents are very supportive, but their own personal problems, my brother being very rude to me, and me constantly having to pick up after everyone is really weighing me down and I want to get out of here. 

This is very wordy and a bit of a rambling mess, I'm sorry about that. If anyone has any advice on what I can do, I would appreciate it very much. I want things to change, but I don't know what else to do.

262,"Good afternoon,

So there's this neighbor that lives directly below me, and she always complains about noise no matter how small it is.

I then decided to leave a sticky note on her door with my number to text me whenever there's a noise she hears so that I can try to figure out what it is and how we can resolve it.

Fast forward three weeks, she finally decides to respond. She continues to be sassy in her messages, accusing me of lying. I then told her since her initial complains, I have gotten fuzzy slippers, have tried super hard to walk quietly at night, and done everything I could. She then complains that I haven't done anything and feels disrespected because ""nothing has changed"".

So I then tell her, well okay then, this situation can only be resolved if both sides are willing to help each other out and that everyone has to deal with noise at our apartment complex because of how thin the walls are. She then calls my messages ""manipulative"" and then proceeds to threaten to contact management personally and then blocks my number.

Management now wants to talk to me in person today, and I'm not sure what to expect. I feel like it's in my favor because this person honestly seems like a trigger happy snowflake that is coddled and wants everything her way (she even told me in text that one night, the noise got ""so bad"" that she called her mom crying for help"").

Not sure what to do or how to approach management. I have text messages that clearly show that I have been as kind and accomodating as possible.

266,"   I'm an international student in Germany coming from non-EU country.
   So I started my Computer Science study in 2016 and expected to graduate in September 2018 taking 4 semesters. Initially everything went as I planned, but in the Summer 2017 I had severe problems with my health. For almost 3 weeks I had severe headaches, practically disabling me for that period of time. I went to the emergency and later to my home doctor, but they could not really identify the problem. The best they could do is to reduce the pain. I think that was a migraine, but so far I did not confirm this with my doctor.
   As a consequence, I had to skip several weeks of classes and I managed to catch up and pass most of the exams only now and 3 are still left. I have also started to write my Master Thesis but I'm progressing fairly slowly, because the exams that are left still require a reasonable amount of time. I'm also working part-time as a student and that slows me too, but I can not afford not to have this job.
   For these two years, me and my girlfriend went through a long distance relationship (actually, we are still going through it). A lot of people in the beginning were saying that it's simply not possible, but we made it anyway, having visited each other every 2-3 weeks for a couple of days. She studies in Poland and now we're married.
   My funding from scholarship ends in September, and I'm afraid I don't know what to do next. I will pass my last exams in August but to be honest I think that finishing my thesis by that time sounds unrealistic. I want to move to the location closest to my wife, but this is only possible if I would find a job there (which is not that easy as it seems for recent graduates in Germany, especially struggling with German). Since I'm coming from a non-EU country, I also need to extend my visa: either as a student or apply for a Blue Card (again, in case I find a full-time job).

TL;DR An international student struggles to decide what would be the best next step, since his scholarship funding is going to finish soon, but he needs to finish his degree and wants to live closer to his wife.

Suggestions and thoughts would be much appreciated, let me know what you think. Thank you!

268,"So uh, hi. I'm a 15 year old guy, and the title pretty much explains it.

I've seen the girl with my father when I was a kid. She (the same as all other mistresses) bribed me and my older sister to having us accept her, but as time continued on, my father hid their relationship more as my sister and I matured and sawthe immorality of it.

Mom found out about it when I was 10, but she wanted to make both me and my sister happy by sticking with my father for us (which is very unhealthy for their already-slim relationship)

Moving forward to me in my 10-11s, my father set up a computer shop that was nearer to the girl's house. They'd meet up more frequently than ever, and since my father kinda lived independently in that shop (he would come home to get food for him to eat there, or pick me up so I can spend time playing PC on the weekends), he probably had her visit his shop frequently, especially when I wasn't there on the weekends.

12-13s, father now went to Japan with sis to work there for approximately 3 months, and that probably damaged their relationship with his mistress because of the distance. Came home after his time there and lo and behold, I still see him secretly communicating with her.

Now, in my 15s, my dad and sis and also went back to Japan again. Same situation when he got home. He continued calling her at night in secret while my mother sleeps with my 5 year-old baby brother. Only thing that I'm afraid of is that thot might spoil my brother the same way that he did to me.

The difference between me and my sis? My father still kinda believes (or trusts me more than my sis) to keep it all a secret. 

I want to put an end to this. I want to talk to him man-to-man and try to put an end to it. And if it doesn't work, I don't know, injure him into breaking up with her or something, I don't know. 

Any advice?",08Jun2018,14

276,"Hello reddit. So here's my story. For the past nine months, I've been solo managing a difficult project at work. The target goal for my project was to be within a 60/40 success/failure rate. Anyway, a Lead of a different team(we share a manager) has been VERY critical of my project. He was routinely telling his team and my manager I was failing 90\-98&amp;#37; of the time. I knew those numbers were WAY off, so I always ignored him. However, I was constantly stressing out because the Lead was telling my manager these false &amp;#37;'s daily. My manager always had my back until about two weeks ago, then my manager started to quote that 90&amp;#37; failure rate. Anyway, my newly appointed Lead challenged that &amp;#37;. We reviewed the numbers, and discovered I was actually at a 38&amp;#37; failure....which was within my target range. At that moment, I felt extremely relieved, but also pissed off that the other Lead was making up data. I told my manager that Lead has been very unprofessional, and was the sole reason I had a couple anxiety attacks at work. My manager said he'll make sure, that going forward, results are measured on ""data"" and not ""feelings."" 

Anyway, now for the part where I need advice. The past couple days, I've noticed that ""lying Lead"" is trying to engage in positive conversation with me. To be honest, I have no interest in being friends with him, but I do want to maintain a professional relationship. The lies he was spreading caused me to have anxiety attacks (something I've never experienced in my life before...and I feel for ANYONE that gets them on a regular basis) at work on a couple occasions, and his entire team thinks I'm a moron. Now, I can live with his team not liking me (it's staffed with temp workers, so they'll be gone in a couple months) but the mental stress he subjected me to for nine months isn't just going to disappear because he's suddenly stopping by my desk to tell me about ""free donuts in the break room."" (that's what I mean about his recent ""positive conversation."") I feel like I still need a week or so to cool down, and then I'd like to schedule a 1\-on\-1 meeting with him to move on. 

How would you all suggest I handle this issue? ",08Jun2018,1
277,"I'm deservingly letting this get to me and break me, basically.

Right, this is a pretty fucking wild ride, and a long story; but I hope I can gain at least a sympathetic smile out of this massive fuck-up! Or not. I feel so dang bad. I'm sorry in advance, I know I'm such a bad person for doing this.

So, I'm not gonna lie, my maths teacher is a dang snack. He's the youngest teacher in our school and honestly, it's literally like one of those teen movies. We're basically all crushing on him. He's married. An incident happened at the previous school he taught at where a student used to follow him to his car and I think they also found his social media. But, boy, did they not fuck up as badly as me.

So there's this girl - we'll call her Mya - who's an online friend. She's into older guys and stuff. Mya is also a giant snake. I figure she'll find my maths teacher attractive, so as any stupid, stupid teen does, I send her a link to his Instagram, and she's fucking shook.

But, OP, I hear you wondering, just how did you manage to find his Instagram? Well. My stupid self literally made an Instagram account pretending to be a random teacher so he'd accept me. And then I found his wife's Instagram. She's hot, not gonna lie. So I save some photos into folders with silly names and give Mya the password to this Instagram.

I later realise how wrong this is and delete it. But maybe I'm too late.

You see, Mya has been acting off lately, and the other day she randomly asked for his Instagram after I stated that he was leaving our school to work at another one after July. I sent his profile as a message, and then she asked what school I go to.

Weird. I send a link to the school website, and my alarm bells are kinda ringing. Now, we've DMed about him as any teenager would do, and I've made a few jokes here and there. I always thought she was in on it, but yesterday - a day after she'd asked for his name again - I receive some strange threats... in the form of one of those 'How well do you know me?' quizzes.

You know the ones. The ones that you post on your Snapchat story because you're jumping on the bandwagon. So she's the first person to view my story. And when you do this quiz, you leave your name.

A few minutes later, I see some results. And one gives me chills; from somebody called 'I'm exposing you slut'. Interesting. They've decided to place me in Slytherin, state that if I could have any superpower, I'd pick time travel, and have stated that my favourite colour is black - basically making me out to be a guilty, evil witch. All of the personal questions, of course, are correct. This person clearly knows me and is fucking with me.

And soon after, there's another name. 'Watch your back skank'. And it's obviously Mya. I just fucking know.

I spontaneously have a paranoid breakdown over this and freak the fuck out on my Instagram story about Mya. I remember that she can see it a few paranoid slides in and softblock her. Who knows if she saw it? Then I remove her from my Snapchat. It has to be her.

But then, my good friend paranoia shouts, 'what if those were empty threats and now she's going to do this shit?'

Yeah. So here's my current situation; I'm probably going to delete Instagram. I never use it, I have like two irl friends who I can contact using Snapchat and I want to minimise the evidence. This girl probably has screenshots of my fuck-ups just ready to email to the school. I'm going to cut all ties with Mya and pray that my snack of a maths teacher can get the fuck out of my school and that Mya is just fucking with me.

She has his email, from the school website, his Instagram, DM proof, probably multiple screenshots (it seems as if this was planned, and I fell right into it), the name of my school, my name, and my Instagram username basically gives away the fact that it's me. I'm deleting that ASAP.

TL;DR - I trusted a snakey online friend, catfished my hot, married maths teacher and I'm currently in a sticky situation because I've invaded someone's right to privacy and this person probably has lots of proof that it's me and I'm basically having a breakdown.

Feel free to ask any questions, I've probably left something out in the midst of my freaking out. And, yes, I know what I've done is really fucking bad. And if I get confronted... who knows what'll happen?
But, ya know, in hindsight I'm kinda glad that Mya gave me an anonymous heads up.

None of our previous downstairs neighbors have ever complained (not to us or our apartment manager, who is pretty hands-on and would have told us to quiet down).

From the start of it, I feel I’ve been putting more effort into planning outings, meet ups etc. My new friend always leaves the outings early saying she’s “busy” and “has too much to do” but frankly, I don’t know with what. She is just a normal 9-5 worker like me. She mentions having to do errands or is tired as reasons. 

One example of this is her trying to plan an outing after not responding to one of my texts for quake. Then she backed out of it saying she has to much to do. I then invited her out to a group gathering which she attended but didn’t hang out afterward to get drinks saying she has to do laundry. Ok, it’s whatever. The other day I randomly messaged her I’m going out if she wants to join after work, she backs out again saying she has to much to do. The next day she messages me how am I doing and all, but I feel this friendship isn’t worth it anymore and I went to cut it off. For me I love meeting people face to face, and for at least an hour a week or so, and the fact that’s not happening here isn’t making me want to continue. I want advice if I’d be an awful person stopping this friendship. 

For my other friend at work; things are a bit more complicated. When we first met when she came into work, she was nice, we clicked quickly and became work buddies. We began discussing relationship and political and social issues all over lunchtime at work and it was nice to have a friends like that. I even went to her with a problem or two and she helped me out. She told me about some of her problems and past issues however, she never hung out with me outside of work even though I’d try to coordinate for us several times. This made me a feel a sad, because I don’t know why she won’t make time for me outside work, like I’m not worthy of it, but I let it go. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago I am very distraught at work over personal issues of mine. I’m feeling very depressed and sad and almost get into tears at work. I immediately go to my fiend in this state asking if she’s free to talk because I want to speak to her, she says not now but later in the afternoon. Yet she never stopped by or asked what’s wrong. I couldn’t believe it, and if I hadn’t spoken to my brother in law, I would have been in a very, very bad place. So I didn’t know what to do. This issue really got to me so I’ve stopped saying hi or talking to her at work. She tried today and I just gave very cordial responses. The strange part is, I don’t feel entirely bad about it. 

Am I wrong for wanting to cut off these friendships for these reasons? Thanks very much for reading all this text in advance. ",08Jun2018,1
286,"I've worked at my (very small, \&lt;25 employees) company for 2 years, I recently just strong\-armed my way into a raise (the only one thus far) after my boss messed up my taxes for the second year in a row, costing me a little over $2500 in total. Previous to asking for a raise, I have never gotten negative feedback from either bosses or any of the dept. heads I've worked with, and after asking for more money, they said I was unapproachable and not engaged in the company. I'm the only person performing my role, which makes a good bit of profit for the company and has brought us into a larger area of work. They have a history of not respecting or showing value in their employees.

Yesterday,  my boss emailed the company saying there is a ""non\-mandatory"" event outside of working hours at a baseball stadium where they will be announcing something, and they would really like if everyone is there. I have a pretty strict post\-work personal schedule that my dog and I rely on; exercise (for my dog it means he won't eat my things because he's bored and for me, it helps with my anxiety and stress\-exacerbated IBS, so it really is essential in my mind) eating healthy, safe food (they have never been invested in providing foods or drinks that are safe for me \- gluten, dairy, egg allergies), it's on a Thursday, which will likely mess with getting to bed on time (sleep is also incredibly important for managing my symptoms), and time with my S/O. I don't want to attend because of the fact that I'll be at work all day, have an hour to go home, and then have to go to the stadium, and I need time away from the office to manage my stress and anxiety levels. 

Another employee emailed him saying that she had tickets to a show that evening and wouldn't be available to attend and he emailed her back saying she could come and leave early to go to the show. I am trying to sort out what I should email him to let him know I can't attend without looking ""unengaged"" in the company or that I am simply making an excuse, because it really does impede on the schedule I have come to rely on to stay healthy.

**TLDR;** my boss wants us to come to a ""non\-mandatory"" (yet 'very important and he doesn't want any of us to miss it') work event after hours, he doesn't respect personal time and it is essential to my health and well being to maintain my schedule and routine. I need advice about what to say to him to let him know I can't attend.",08Jun2018,1

Now, I have tried xanax a few times, i love it. It is detrimental to my health of course. I smoke weed everyday but get tired so easily. I have giant creative blocks that don't allow me to create what's in my head.

292,"So there’s a girl that I follow on social media due to mutual friends; she’s been with her boyfriend almost 4 year, they live together and are engaged.

I have a dating app on my phone and saw him on it, so I swiped to match with him. He messaged me being very flirty and asking for photos, he also then said that he wants to ‘sort something out’ so we can meet up. I didn’t respond to these and then called him out for having a girlfriend, which he denied. I then sent him proof of this in the form of a screenshot of her social media account, and he promptly deleted his account on the dating app.  

However, I’ve got screenshots of what he said but I don’t know what to do; chances are he has been doing it behind her back for a while, and I know if I was her then I’d want to know. However, I also don’t want to get involved in their relationship when I barely know her, but I would hate it if I was her and nobody told me.

Advice?

293,"I've been dealing with the last few days and I'm not sure what to do at this point, how to address or where to start now. 

About a month ago I purchased two Samsung Q7F TVs from a Well known retailer, the 65"" was brand new and the 55"" was open box but I was assured it was never used, after inspecting it and making sure nothing looked damaged I went for both of them, worst decision ever.

Day 2 of owning this t.v a weird background lighting flicker occurred like the ambient light sensor feature had a freak out moment so turn the feature off and back on and low and behold no more flickering, fast toward that day I tried to turn on the TV and there wasn't any image, I could hear menu sounds but nothing but black screen and back light, so I called Samsung and after jumping through troubleshooting they sent a technician to my home as it was under warranty,

I'm here from Boston in El paso and I'm guessing since they don't have a service center here they sent someone they contracted from Another a state over to my home, the couple didn't speak English so they just asked me to the best of there ability what the problem was, why they didn't know already I have no idea
But I explained to them the issue and told them ""I have to get ready for my flight it leaves in 4 hours are you guys OK?"" they shooed me off and started working it, roughly 45 minutes go by and I come out of the guest house from grabbing things and briefly asked them how much longer and they looked at me confused, so I said never mind, gave them both water and continued packing, another 30 minutes go by and they're still with my TV open, at the time I should of noticed they had it screen down on the carpet but packing and my flight was more in my head so I'm freaking out about that.

I asked what's going on I've really gotta go and get out of here to make my flight and they say to me ""not yet not yet"" so I'm going back and forward between the guest house and master bedroom making sure I don't forget anything and 20-30 more Minutes go by and they make a noise I guess to get my attention.

The t.v was put back together and still not showing an image, so I asked if they had other cables to try that and pointed to my cables, they go in a box and pull out a new One connect wire and low and behold that was the issue this whole time, the man now has my t.v on (When the screen in on you can't see any problems) he Insist on bothering the colors and contrast and all this saying the Playstation blew the t.v which was absurd but at this point I'm in rush and insisting I really had to go I go to the bedroom grab my suitcases and by my door so they could understand I meant NOW.

Fast forward 24 days later I return home and the TV is in the same spot they left it leaning against the fire Mantle in the living room and its early, the sun is hitting it just right ans my jaw dropped, you could see the scratches all over the screen from when it was on the carpet dragging and moving around, I called samsung once they said I have to call the company they contracted, 

After asking why when they sent them in the first place I eventually ended up with because you do, so after calling them and trying to handle a huge language barrier she says to me how can it be there fault, they put the t.v on the carpet, ""carpet is safe"" ...... I live in Texas... Carpet is full of dirt, rubble and etc from time to time where is your logic? She still refused and then went on to blame my Kids could of did it, I DON'T HAVE KIDS?! I Called samsung back and after loads of hoops I speak to someone who says they'll contact they're manager and waiting to hear back and here's the rrssponse I received.

Screen: https://i.imgur.com/EpY6Zd0.jpg

Any suggestions would be appreciated at this point. 


Also I guess some thing I should note 
I don't live with anyone, no kids, roommates etc, and those Who own an Qled know the intense black screen and you don't just see these scratches until you walk close up to the screen, you also can't see them when the screen in on unless deep black content is on screen which is why I didn't see these when they showed me the t.v on.",08Jun2018,1
294,"Hi there, I could really use some advice on how to approach my grandmother about her compulsive spending and gift giving.
I love my grandmother very, very much, and I appreciate that she wants to give me things, but I am very concerned about how much money she is spending and how frequently she is doing this. Especially since the gifts are not very helpful to me.

I wouldn't feel as much of a need to confront her about this if I wasn't in the situation that I'm in. I am a 22 year old female, I'm chronically ill (so I can only physically handle a  part time job), I have a lot of bills, and I am living paycheck to paycheck with no room for unexpected expenses, or anything remotely recreational. I'm lucky if I have 40 dollars to spend on doing anything ""fun"" by the end of the month, but it generally goes into my savings because I just can't justify spending it.

I know that beggars cannot be choosers, but these gifts are very stressful to receive and it makes me feel really horrible. All of the money that goes into buying these gifts adds up fast, and that money could really help me right now.

My grandmother is fully aware of my situation, yet she doesn't buy things that will really help me in any way, like food, gift cards, or other essentials. 
She knows that I struggle to buy groceries, have been wearing the same clothes since I was in high school, and absolutely cannot afford my medications for my illnesses. 
Instead of offering to help me with those kinds of things, she will purchase a lot of things like lamps, pictures/picture frames, shelves, jewelry boxes, furniture, and other household decor. 
I have told her many times that she is very kind and thoughtful, but I don't need things like that and I really need help buying essential items, but she continues to buy the unhelpful things instead.
I really don't want to rely on her for financial help in the first place because I feel horrible about it, but if she is insistent on buying me things, I would really like to be able to use them.

I would really appreciate any advice :)

TLDR; My grandma buys me *a lot* of things like household decor, but I could really use some groceries or money instead, and she is aware of it. How do I talk to her about this?",08Jun2018,8
295,"We have been dating for over a year and a half. In the past year she became very depressed to the point where she wasn't getting out of bed nor going to class. When she reaches out to her parents for help they are so callous and unreasonable about her mental health and well-being to the point where they drive her to tears almost every time they interact with her. She is so sweet and kind and as a result very fragile and her parents are very stubborn and confrontational. She's always horrified to go home or pick up the phone when her parents call in fear of being chastised out of nowhere. For example, just yesterday while on the phone with her father she began to cry after being ridiculed and after a failed attempt to hide her tears he responded, ""Oh so now you're gonna go cry and crawl up into a little ball in bed?"" a reference to her being unable to get up when very depressed. I just graduated from college and she was unable to graduate on time this year because of her depression, which only made her parents angrier. Now she's being pressured to find a full-time job when she is trying to improve her mental health first. Recently she had started feeling better overall after starting new medication but is ""cut down at the knees"" by her parents whenever she is feeling good. Neither her nor myself have the financial requirements to be able to support one another independent of our parents and it's absolutely heartbreaking. We live about an hour away from one another and try to see each other as much as possible as it seems I'm the only person she can truly turn to. But at the end of the day she must return to her household where her parents await to berate her. When ever I'm at her place her parents put on an act like nothing is wrong when I know all about it. We've even sat down and spoken to them about how she needs to be handled less harshly and with more care, which they seemed to understand when we spoke but hasn't translated into anything positive. Long story short, I feel helpless. I don't know what to do, if there's anything I can do, to help her in this situation. I simply want to take her away from them but can't afford to. She tells me that she can't take this abuse for much longer and it really worries me as I'm currently powerless to make a change for her. Are their any suggestions of what I could do to help other than being a shoulder to cry on? Should I confront her parents or just stay out of it? I really am at a loss to the point where I'm reaching out to field any advice on the subject matter at all. Thanks for reading through if you've made it this far.",08Jun2018,1

For example, I recently qualified for 401k and I told her that I am signing up for 401k and then she starts telling me I should put in $200 per paycheck and then she whips out a calculator and then calculates how much I should put in every paycheck.

Another example is health insurance.  My mom is asking what insurance my company using, how much is the premium.  That I should not take the HSA because you lose it...

Telling me that I shouldn't color my hair or cut my hair short because its to pretty to cut and that coloring my hair damages my hair (which is true), but it's my hair and I can cut it short if I wanted to.

297,"I’ve got runners knee that I’ve had for about 1-2 years now, can’t remember how long. 

I can’t carry groceries properly, if I buy groceries I have to carry one item into my house at a time - so after shopping it takes about 20 minutes to carry all my items into the house. My knees genuinely cannot handle more. 

My body can’t handle any exercise other than a light, short walk which I do try to do everyday. 

I have tennis elbow too, so I can’t work out using my arms either. 

I work with a physiotherapist who gives me light exercises and my knees were feeling better. They hadn’t been in pain for about a month, until:

 last week Saturday I had sex and the guy was pushing down on my back so hard, like it felt like he was trying to push all of his weight onto me and my back, all the pressure and weight went to my knees so freaking hard during doggy style. Lots of guys do this, and they don’t notice they’re putting pressure on me and if I was a girl who didn’t have jumpers knee it might not matter or hurt me. But because I have jumpers knee it hurt and offended me. 

I didn’t want to tell him to ruin the mood, I just got out of that position as soon as I realised it was probably bad for my knee. We were only in it for a few minutes, less than 5 but it ended up hurting me knee for a week, until now. Like I said, my knees hadn’t been hurting for a while and I didn’t think he would press down on me so hard. 

I felt disabled and pathetic so I hadn’t told him about the knee thing this time, and my knees hadn’t felt sore in a while so I didn’t think I’d need to tell him. Even when I tell guys they ignore me. I don’t look like I have an injury, so they don’t get it. 

But after that sex my knees have been KILLING me, it’s been a week, and I regretted that sex so badly because of it. 
They creak and I had to walk up stairs at one point this week and that hurt me badly. I feel so upset as my knees had been improving. 

Overall in general I can’t exercise to get the most healthy and best looking possible body I could have which is soo frustrating even though I explain to guys my injury they never get it, trust me I explain to guys so much and still do things to hurt my knees during sex so I can’t have sex. They always beg for positions I already explained I can’t do and never understand why I can’t do certain pisitions, and some get put off when I tell them about my injury, so I just give up on sex.

298,"I found out I needed glasses when I was 7. I'm now 19 and I've been wearing glasses forever. I hate how I look with glasses and want to wear contacts, but they are so painful to put it sometimes, and I constantly have a sort of distortion on lights (similar to glare with glasses, but like double the effect). I have tried 3 different pairs of contacts (shaped in different ways but all the same prescription).

The first pair I was told was a trial pair, to see how I can adjust to contacts. After 2 weeks of wearing them without glasses, I still liked them, but the painful 10 to 15 minutes it takes for me to put them in is frustrating. I've had two other custom pairs that the doctor advised me to try, and they both are the same. Painful to put in, and light being really weird, I'm starting to just give up on wearing contacts. I'd rather have the 3 second unfolding of my glasses and slide them on rather than the 10 to 15 minute struggle to put contacts in. 

Everyone else I talk to says ""you get used to putting them in"" and in a way I have, but that still doesn't help the light issue and slight distortion.

301,"Hello guys! I'm 19 years old and about to turn 20 in about two months. I'm been attending community college for the past 2 years where I was focused my classes on pre\-med and am pretty much guaranteed to any top tier UC schools for any biological science majors. I have a 4.0 and have completed majority of my prereqs to transfer.. However, I recently started coding on the side (html, css, javascript) through codeacademy and it's pretty fun for me. Every since I was a kid I wanted to become a doctor, but as I started coding I feel like it's more worthwhile and in my favor (financially). I believe I have an entrepreneur mindset, I'm always thinking of new innovating things that can hopefully benefit society, but I never had the skills to develop them, which is why I wanted to learn how to code.  

Pros and Cons of Pre\-Med:

Pro: I most likely will transfer to UCLA as a psychobio major where I will hopefully maintain a high gpa. I transfer in 2019, so I got one more year left in CC where I'm completing my last set of physics and Ochem. 

Con: If something goes wrong, I'm left with a shit major where job prospects will be very difficult and terrible pay. Med school debt, my prime (20s) gone. 

Pros and Cons of Computer Science:

Pros: Demand for the job is insane and can secure a high salary upwards to 100\-200k (starting sal) and above (depending on if I go into blockchain). I get the set of skills to begin to create and develop any ideas that come to my mind. 

Cons: I spend another 2\-3years at community college where I begin to fall into the community college student stereotype. This path is not secure nor guaranteeing me to transfer to a top tier UC like CAL or LA, which is where those crazy starting sals are typically given. ",08Jun2018,1

He showed me their pictures and asked if it was them (first names only) , what kind of cars they had, and then wanted to know if they were usually at home.

I feel really judgmental because of the fact that I don’t really have a desire to hangout with them anymore. I also don’t want to “ghost” Sarah—- but I don’t know what to do. Is it normal to not be able to mesh well with people even if they’re super nice ?,08Jun2018,3
320,"Well, my lease ends on June 30th. I’ve been looking for an apartment and everything was set but there was competition and someone got to deposit their money for the place I was looking at before I could, which was a huge bummer. 

Now I’m on the look out again but a lot of places are asking for pay stubs and credit checks..

The thing with that is due to some poor choices of my boss, her business is currently shut down so I’m not on the books anymore. Even when I was tho only a small portion of my pay was on the books. I have a job lined up for cleaning but I believe that would be off the books. 

They also want credit checks and my credit is not the best.. so I’m quite concerned.. 

Not all places I’ve looked at have asked for pay stubs but many have. I’m wondering if anyone’s gone thru this and if there is any way around it. ",08Jun2018,1
321,Hey there! I am a 21 years old dude. I am not gay but I guess I am bisexual. I love girls but I sometimes find myself attractrd to to the same sex.

322,"I (16M) am at my with's end concerning this. This year has been one of my best. I was pretty passionate about being in my school's band program, and was happy with my mechanical engineering career path. I also took to creating a rough draft of a novel that I may or may not push out there some day.

But by the second semester, something happened. I stopped practicing music and writing as often as I did, and started to be indifferent towards my career path and a lot of stuff. I just stopped caring, I guess. And now, I can't seem to find a reason to do anything!

People tell me that this is still the age where I'm figuring out who I am, and that I still have time to think about what I'm going to do with my life. They use this line all the time, and I still feel like I should have a vague idea of what I'm all about and what I'd like to do. So when I have to force myself to do things I used to love, I feel like an idiot because I don't feel like I know who I am.

Is there something wrong with me? Is this just a natural change in my interests, or have I let myself fall into this rut? And assuming it's natural, what's the best course of action? Trying to rediscover what made me so passionate about these aspects of my life, or just moving on from them?",08Jun2018,1
323,"Oh, Idk. I'm sick of things. I decided to take a summer class and I have no roommates. Basically goto class in morning and spend the rest of the day isolated and alone. I hate this, I get isolated, I don't feel like going out, social anxiety creeps up and I just feel worthless being on the couch all day doing nothing but mess with laptop/phone, go on reddit, anonymous apps, and watch youtube, Netflix and the news all day. Like, why am I living? 

I have a year left of college, my parents support me financially, I've yet to have a real job. I used to be so socially anxious. My freshmen year I basically hid in my dorm and only went out for food/water. Next year was about the same but off campus. I tried getting help the end of 2017. Things did get better last semester, got involved in a church group and a couple organizations. My class schedule was also spread out and I was kept busy with just classes and the extracurricular activities. 

Well now it's the summer, and most people I met last semester graduated or aren't in town. I've never really had a close friend to just hang out with, that kills me more than anything. I feel so socially incompetent, I'm 21 and I've yet to have a real job. I guess I could just work at a fast food place, grocery or some other store but I have such high fears of having a mental breakdown or something. Like if I can't work a basic job providing customer service how the hell am I supposed to get an internship and a job after college? Only one year left.... One semester really since I have to do an internship as part of a class for the Spring. 

Idk, I just don't see stuff panning out. I just sit here, alone, isolated, and do things to try to avoid reality, some which may be destructive to me. I hate this. If I killed myself I wouldn't have to put up with it anymore. I see people with friends and doing stuff with their lives and I feel trapped in a box, never to have that. Why suffer? Like I believe suicide is wrong and I think physician assisted suicide is going to just cause more issues. Like, why should I go on? Why should I bother to survive? To not kill myself when others are doing it and governments are promoting it? If I'm merely just a tool to be used, I can easily be replaced by a robot. Ending myself would mean more resources for others, is that not a good thing? 

And people pretend to care ""Oh, don't do that"", do you really care about my life? You don't know me, no one knows me. I bet if my views don't align with your own you would just push me outside like anyone else. I hate this world and humanity. Idk, I'm tired. It's just the same thing, over and over....

326,"My son overheard a conversation coming from my next door neighbor where they were talking about robbing us. They knew our schedules. They know I’m often home alone. They know our cars. There was one among them trying to talk them out of it. So, I really don’t know what to do. I have taken steps. 

They seem so nice and always saying if there was anything I needed, just to ask. I also offered to pay half of the fence repairs they did. They told me it was fine. I am absolutely floored at hearing this and now very afraid of them. 

Today, I’m having an alarm system installed and I’m getting curtains so the neighbors can no longer look inside. I’m also thinking of getting another dog. I have a very old and gentle lab, which would probably do nothing. Of course, they mentioned this too. 

I just don’t know if I should go to the police. Like I said, I’m home alone a lot but don’t want any riffs between us. I’m hoping the alarm will send a message that we know what they said and keep them from trying to rob us. 

But what if they are robbing others?
What if they come after me anyway?
Or was the conversation just bullshit?

328,"So my best friend's father had been suddenly hospitalized in his hometown for renal failure, he was a diabetic and had suffered already major complications from it, even losing a few toes if I'm not mistaken. I hadn't had seen my best friend in more than a week due to my mom being in town (both my parents live in different cities from mine so I usually spend all my time with them whenever they come visit), so I decided to call him to catch up, and I get the news that his father was seriously ill, though he hadn't been declared terminal yet as he was expected to go through dialysis. He sounded very worried as he told me he had stayed behind, so I told him that I could lend him the money for a bus ticket. He replied that it wouldn't be of any use as the man was expecting to see his four children before him. 

To be honest, I had sufficient money to lend him the money needed for all tickets, however, I have an upcoming trip (this coming Wednesday) to see my dad, and I know I'm probably going to spend quite a lot on that, though I have my tickets covered, as I'm going with my sister, and if I run out of money at some point I'm going to run into trouble with my family as I'm supposed to have much more money than I do now, as I did an extra gig a while ago and was supposed to keep that money for this trip, but I had spent it all (never saw this coming as my friend's dad was doing just fine a few weeks ago) and didn't want them to find out, so I made a point of keeping as much as I could from my allowance in order to have a little bit more than enough for the trip, by not paying any bill that could wait. However, as I realized the seriousness of the affair, I told him then I could lend him money for two tickets. I was fully aware that I might not see that money back and was totally OK with that. I would still have had a fair amount of money had I lent him for the four tickets, though, but in my mind I had thought that I would still need to keep as much as possible as I didn't know what expenses I would run into when visiting my dad's and didn't want to risk running out of money and being discovered. I was afraid my family wouldn't be very understanding if I told them about this, as they don't know my best friend (why that is, is another issue altogether)

At this point, it is worth noting that my best friend is an autobody worker. We live in a Latin American country, where that position is not as well paid as it might be in the US or Europe. Still, my friend makes a decent amount of money from his trade, but is ridden with debt and is basically the sole breadwinner of his house, as his dad could no longer work due to his illness, and neither can his mom. He complained to me several times that his other three brothers barely to the expenses of the house, if at all, in spite of working with him and making just a little bit less. However, it is worth noting that didn't influence my decision, as they are not bad people at the end of the day, just younger and immature.

Back to the events of two days ago, my best friend asked me to call my dad, who is a doctor, to ask him for references for a cardiologist that could see him before being transferred to a bigger hospital for dialysis. Then my dad tells me that as it sounded, his condition was very serious, and my friend asked me once more if I could lend him a little bit more of money. I replied that I didn't had any. He then made the decision to send his younger brothers to the city where his father was hospitalized. A few minutes later, his sister called from the hospital to say that if a medicine that the doctors were administering him did not work, he might not wake up the following morning. Then I finally decided to tell my friend that even if his two younger brothers were going, I would lend him the money to go. He then replied that he preferred to stay back as he was fearing the doctors were not treating his father appropriately due to lack of money (this is all too common in this country) and he would try to sell the family car in order to obtain money for the dialysis, then go by plane with that money the following afternoon. I asked him whether he was sure of that, and if he thought that he could sell the car in just one day (I didn't).  He replied that he was confident he could get the money in any other way if not by selling the car, and that he was confident his father would resist. I then joined him to the bus station to send off this brothers, but he took money to pay their tickets. As he was going through a difficult time, I didn't tell him anything about it, and thought he might need the money for something else. He then asked me the money and gave his brothers some pocket money for the 10\-hour trip. Then I joined him first to pray to a church, then to dinner, which I paid (wasn't anything fancy), except for a burger for his brother that stayed behind with him. I asked him to call me if he needed anything, which he agreed to, and then he drove me home, as it was late my family was already nervous about it.

The next day, I called him at midday to check up on him. He told me that planes were fully booked and no seats were available till 10 pm, so he was hiring a shared cab to go to his dad. So I assumed he got some money already and went about my day. Then this morning he texted me to let me know his father had died before he arrived to the hospital and couldn't bid him goodbye. I felt sorry for him and told him my condolences. He didn't reply further and of course I decided to just give him some space to grieve his loss. However, as time started to pass, I couldn't help feeling guilty. I am aware that it was not my sole responsibility to get the money for the tickets in the first place, that there are three other able\-bodied adults that are children of the same man, and that in the end, I offered the money for him to go, but that he preferred to stay back just one more day. But I can't stop thinking that if I had accepted to lend him the money for the four tickets in the very beginning, he would have just gone two days ago and reached his father on time. I am grateful to be alive, that my best friend is alive and that he will keep his two kidneys (he was already preparing to donate one to his dad had he survived), and that my own father who is a diabetic too is alive and healthy, but I can't stop feeling guilty about this all and I don't know how to get rid of this feeling.

Thanks for reading, any input, actually any comment will be welcome.

TLDR.\- Best friend's dad has died this morning, I had offered him money to reach him as he was hospitalized in another city but my best friend wanted me to lend him money for he and his three brothers to go. I said I could only lend him money for two tickets. Later I offered him money for him to go as well, but he preferred to stay back to procure more money for medical procedures, traveled only yesterday and couldn't reach his dad on time.

330,"Ok so let me start off by saying, I'm really /really/ bad at asking for things like this. I get paranoid and over think.  TL;DR at the end. THIS IS SUPER LONG I'M SO SORRY. 

I started this job in October, I caught on really quickly and all my coworkers and managers were extremely impressed, including managers from other departments. Other department managers would literally ""fight"" over me, saying that they wanted me in their department. I was basically acting assistant manager within two months, as the assistant manager before me had just moved into a different department, and she trained me to do all of her responsibilities. If my manager was out, everyone knew to come to me. I eventually gained enough confidence to email my manager, saying since I already was doing all the responsibilities the assistant manager does, if I could officially be promoted and have the title and the pay increase. She said we'll talk about it next week (this was on a Friday).   


That next Tuesday we have a company meeting, and they have us do something new\-which is take a little quiz. They gave us a power point with some information, talked about it, and then had us take the quiz. I honestly didn't think anyone was going to read the answers, but I try and do my best on everything I do anyways. It wasn't too hard, it was just critical thinking based off the power point and information we just got. 

The day after, I get a call from one of the owner's/partners of the company (there's 3). He asks me to come into his office, so I immediately start to freak out. I go into his office and he's sitting there with my department head. To sum it up, he said my test was one of the top 5, and actually impressed him. He wanted to promote me to a completely new department, like it just opened a month before I had moved there. He said it would come with a raise.

After a week, it's extremely easy and I get the hang of it. I asked my new manager (who's super down to earth) about the raise, he said to ask the owner. The owner said I have a 3 month ""probationary"" period in this department to see if I'm a good fit. 

It's officially been 3 months. I'm worried about two things.

1) Minimum wage is going up in my state next month. What if they don't want to pay me more than that minimum wage? (I'm currently making minimum wage.) 

2) My company is KNOWN for being extremely cheap, avoiding raised at all costs (there's a high turnover rate with really strong employees because of this). I'm afraid they're going to tell me something like ""I'll give you one dollar now, or you can have two dollars if you wait 3 months.""(Something they've done before to someone else getting a raise after being promoted)

My rent just increased so I'm really relying on this raise to help out. I don't even know how to bring up the raise again in the first place! Do I email her asking for a meeting? Do I wait until minimum wage goes up? What if they try to cheap me out\-do I just look for a higher paying job? Any advice is greatly appreciated! 

TL;DR. My company is known for being cheap\-my 3 month probationary period is up and it's time for my raise. I don't know how to go about asking for the raise, or what to do if they try to not raise it since minimum wage goes up next month. ",08Jun2018,1

336,"I work at a part time job at a hotel and go to school. So I only work two days a week. My paychecks end up being two weeks (32 hours + overtime). I always have overtime. With our shift scheme there's only one person working at any given time. Because of this, I have to wait for the next person to relieve my shift and that person is habitually late. I'm talking 30 mins, 45 mins, 1 hour, and 1 hour and 30 minutes late. Never on time. I always have overtime.

Well, two weeks ago I got overpaid. I did the right thing and notified my manager. He said he will deduct the difference from my next paycheck. Well, today I checked my bank account and noticed I only got paid my 64 hours, no overtime. I asked my manager to double check my hours and get back to me. He kept referring to my working 64 hours (according to the schedule that no one apparently follows). I essentially told him to actually check my time stamps this time and hung up. I don't want to stay even a minute more than I have to, but I'm required to. The fact that I'm not getting paid for the extra time spent really pisses me off. 

Do I have any recourse? All the time stamps are written on a piece of paper and can be verified by the security cameras, which I do not have access to.

338,"I work for a television show and it has been fun because it is more laid back and fun than a normal week-long environment. However, there seems to be more drama as I rise in ranks. I have recently started training with the production manager whom had started to enjoy ""put-down jokes"" on me. Meaning I'll come into work 30 minutes early just to make sure I'm here and ready to do the autonomous work. He'll consistently come in every time 30 minutes later questioning if I'd been there. I let it slide the first two times. I've been in training for 2 weeks now and it has consistently been happening every single day. When I left to the restroom one time before he came and he was sitting there when I came back he questioned if I had even arrived before he did. I just feel so offended because I work hard to make myself worth their investment.

They also like to buy us dinner sometimes after work. He bought seafood which is nice because I'm pescaterian but then like 10 minutes in I got a quesadilla and he said out loud, ""Is that your second one?"" I say no. He says, "" I'm just calling you out on your shit"". What?! What boss says that and in front of everyone. He just consistently makes me feel like a criminal and like I have to be his slave simply because he is training me

I spoke to him about it yesterday and initially he didn't take it well. He kept saying that he is giving me an opportunity and if I don't want it I can just stop training. I despise this point of view because he acts like I have to be his slave because he chose me for training. I stay firm on the belief that it is a two way street. I provide service and you provide income. We are both putting into the equation. I am not a servant that needs to be grateful and be oblivious to the abuse going on. He then lies and says he never said these things. I'm other things he downplays and says it only happens a couple times out of fun joking.

After the talk, he apologized but I just don't feel comfortable training with him anymore. How can I work with someone who is just put to catch me on some crime I never commit? With someone who consistently without evidence accuses me of crimes and socially embarasses me? Who then says I need to be grateful for this opportunity and denies any wrongdoing? It's harassment and abuse.

I'm not sure what to do. I got a raise because I started training with him. They're a small company and if I stop the training they have to find someone else and may retaliate and be pissed off with me because they spent money on me for 2 weeks training me.

347,"TLDR (alt acct for reasons):
An inactive mod for a subreddit is active elsewhere else &amp; is avidly ignoring issues regarding the subreddit. I think they don’t want to let go of the mod position &amp; I’m afraid I might get blocked from it if I push them.

There’s a *certain* moderator for a subreddit I follow that’s completely ignoring people who message them about an issue that’s become too big of a problem to ignore. 
Multiple people want to change that &amp; a few have messaged the mods through the subreddit, tagged them, or even messaged them directly.

One person in particular is completely active—haven’t checked the other one yet, but both were tagged. Last night when people started questioning where the mods even were, I noticed the one I was looking up was offline.
So I waited all day &amp; they still haven’t responded.
I’ve seen them constantly comment on things as recent as 1 hour ago, so they’ve obviously seen the tags / msgs / comments or at the *very least* seen the notification. 

I have *never* seen any of the mods post anything on the thread &amp; it’s very apparent that they’ve abandoned it. A few people want a new mod too because these mods have been inactive for 2 yrs.
From what I can tell, this person likes to blocks or kick people out of subreddits if they anger them. They seem to be the mod for a few other unknown subreddits.
I want to stay on this subreddit, but I’m afraid I’ll also get booted if I push farther into the topic.

349,"Hello, to summarize. I have been working at my job for 1 whole year. It's definitely had its ups and downs and I have struggled quite a bit. For a while I figured I would just quit when my 1 year was up, but I changed my mind and decided I wanted to create a better brand for myself at my job before moving on. The truth is, I make a lot of mistakes at my job. Sometimes mistakes that affect my customers, sometimes mistakes that affect my managers.

One of my managers has taken the biggest brunt, and she is also incredibly linear and straightforward in her communication. She doesn't like fluffiness and wants us to get to the point. I feel like she resents me because of the times I've made more work for her. I'm honestly committed to doing everything in my power to lessen my mistakes and exceed my expectations at work. I felt like I haven't been able to communicate my feelings effectively to her or apologize correctly. My idea to start off on the right foot before I begin my improvement journey was to ask her out to coffee in the morning before we work and apologize and let her know what my goals are. 

Is this too unprofessional? We already have coaching sessions and I'm unsure if speaking of these feelings/issues outside of work is the best idea, but I would like to. Thank you for your advice!",08Jun2018,3

351,"So i’ve worked in this store for quite a few years, since I was 14/15 (i’m currently 18.) 

My manager has never really freaked me out- he’s about 20 or so years older, balding, fat and a little creepy. But generally harmless, I thought.

Where I work is an all-male environment- I am one of three girls and the other two are double my age and maybe more. They have children older than me.
Typically, being around all boys, this is just a lot of sexist jokes, inappropriate conversations about sex- nothing I truly minded, because I could deal with it and besides it’s all harmless. 

So my manager turns to one of my co-workers (I was NOT present, I was told this) after seeing me outside the store and says simply ‘you know, I don’t feel so bad now she’s 18...but she can’t get it’ as in, he’d have sex with me.

I feel a little creeped out and scared of him now. I went through years of councilling because I was abused by an older man for years, so my fear may be justified, but is it just a harmless comment? 
If I report it, my other co-workers will hate me. They won’t tell me things and I’ll be left out and miserable until I leave there in October. They generally think I’m a little uptight as it is as I don’t join in with their lewd comments about random women and telling on my manager after I promised I wouldn’t would make them hate me. 
It’s really hard to get another job around here with these long type shifts too, so I don’t want to do that. 

What freaks me out is that he’s literally watched me grow up from a 14 year old kid to a 18 year old...and he wants to have sex with me??? Also, ‘now she’s 18.’ - so he fancied me before? 

I want to mention it to our boss, but they will all hate me and maybe I’m just over reacting. The comment wasn’t said directly to me and I have no proof, but it has made me uncomfortable and upset. I don’t handle this sort of thing very well and now I pick up on things like him looking at my ass when I didn’t realise before. 

So what do I do? Talk to my boss or let it slide? Is it just boys simply being boys? ",08Jun2018,2
352,"So long story short about 5 hours ago i was in class like any other day and my teacher started talking about cinematography and proceeded to say 'anyone who isnt mature enough can leave right now' i decided not to because i didnt think it was gonna be any big deal but then she started talking about this review she did about about a japanese movie; please dont make fun of me but the movie she described really fucked me up.
It was about a guy who had a fetish with metal, who got ran over by a car and turned into a metal man and he wounded himself to shove a pipe in his cut and then he had sex with his wife with his 'drill' penis whom his wife got very aroused by and who he later killed in the intercourse.
I dont know if i have the right to feel this disturbed, but everytime i see metal now i get some sort of PTSD and it disturbs me and makes me feel disgusted. So bois who has some advice for this shit to stop?   Btw, for any weirdo out there the movie is called Tetsuo.
Look it up if anyone thinks im exaggerating.

So recently I went on a trip to Strasbourg with my university and realized how much of a dream it was, like the city was nice, people were friendly and food was great. I decided to make it my goal and my mother who was there with me to visit her friend seemed to like my idea. But it all changed when we came back home to Dubai; literally second day after our return she turned aggressive towards me blaming me in wasting money and being lazy, yet during our stay I’ve only spend 150£ on myself (it was mostly food, transportation and few souvenirs) while she spend over 600£ on dresses and expensive trips to her friend in Switzerland. 

After that I was placed in a choking situating where my family wanted to go back to Russia for the summer where my dad is while I wanted to stay a bit longer and spend some time with my gf and friends. Yet my family kept pressuring me to the point where I developed a cold out of anxiety and depression.

To rub a salt into a wound, my dad got pissed me at me for not playing PUBG Mobile with him for a couple
Of days yet during those couple of days I had intense fever and was still forced to decide whenever to leave or not.  So he got mad to the point where he told mom that he doesn’t want to play with me ever and it was bothering me for a couple of days as now me and mom can’t leave to Russia cause of my sickness and we gotta stay back and wait for me to get better.

Essentially over the last few weeks after I’ve returned, I was bullied by my family who essentially make me
Feel like I am a fat lazy monster who torments them for his own amusement. I don’t know how to deal with them and how to respond, I know it’s gonna sound pathetic but I am 22 and I got no choice but to live with my parents until I graduate yet even after that I don’t think they will stop bullying me.

IT Job Pros:

* Higher starting salary

* 9-5 schedule

Cons:

* working in an office will be boring for 40 years

NYPD pros

* retire as early as 42 with pension

356,"First I need to tell you guys the background info. Hes worked at a local store I go to for like 3 years now and I’ve had a crush on him for about that long too. I had just broken up with my boyfriend and I felt adventurous so I thought it was about time I do something about my crush so I gave him my number. 

He acted surprised but he was like oh thank you! And smiled. I always thought that there was a romantic vibe between us so what could go wrong? Well it turned out he texted me saying “Hello (my name) this is (his name). It was so kind of you to grace me with your phone number today, I hope your Barnes &amp; Noble experience was most pleasant” like what? That sounds like a sales pitch. Why text me if you don’t want to get to know me.


So I responded at 12 and he left me on read and hasn’t responded. It’s been 5 hours and I know he most likely has a life and I’m dramatic but I feel like I’ve been rejected. But why even bother to text me then? Should I give him some more time to respond before I try to move on? ",08Jun2018,0

Anytime my husband and I are intimate, afterwards I start thinking about it. It’s gotten really bad the last 5 to 6 months. It’s to the point where I have a hard time trusting my husband, I’m constantly afraid he’s going to leave me, I’m sad and I can’t control it or snap out of it which causes me to become frustrated, which leads me to snapping at my husband over little things. We have fought so much other the last few months that it’s destroying my relationship and I’m becoming someone I don’t like and someone who I don’t know.

 My parents got that replaced with another new Samsung *smart* TV (smart move, right /s), this TV lasted a month before breaking for *no reason*! but under warranty, Samsung sent someone out to fix it. it lasted another month or two before breaking *again*. 

so now my dad is without a tv at all for a few months already now, while we try to get this resolved, and is being forced to make payments on this tv that he cant use, lest his credit be destroyed. 

we first called the company several times, but Samsung either dodged us or just refused to fix the problem. we've called the kmart store they bought it at, which is shut down now but they were of no help. we spoke to sears about it (sears owns kmart and my parents bought the tv with a sears credit card and are still making the payments to sears), but they said to contact Samsung. we have called Samsung several times, spent hours at a time on the phone with them, to no avail. they have now voided the warranty on the tv, and they refuse to do anything to resolve this.

373,"Hi Reddit, I will keep this fairly simple.
So yesterday, I stayed late in college doing some work and I got stuck at a point. So, I ask a girl if she was in the same year as I was. She was not, but since she sayd she was a second year ( I'm master's degree student ) I asked her if she needed some help. She sayd yes so I helped her, and after that we started talking and really clicked ( or I thought we did ) .
We talked for 4+ hours straight and after that I gave her a ride home. During the talk I asked for her number and she seemed really happy about it, huge smile and all. Unfortunately, my phone was dead so I gave her mine and she saved it and made a call so I could get hers when I turned on my phone. I saw her doing this! I sayd goodbye and I went home. 
Unfortunately my voicemail was not turned on for some reason, so I couldn't see my missed calls. I even called the phone company but there wasn't anything they could do.
So I went on facebook and added her and when she accepted I sayd this ""hello, I lost your number :( "". No answer. Then after I got off work sayd this ""I going to college after 7. If you want we can join"". Nothing. Both messages were seen.
My question is, did I got rejected? I feel it came out of nowhere. Usually I get rejected I get a no, or something like that. I didn't had any intentions beyond friends either so I really baffled.
Even when I reject someone, I say it usually in the nicest way possible. I think it's just good manners... This never happened to me. 
I want to ask her if everything is ok, but I don't want to be too obsessive you know? I think I will wait a couple of days and after that I will say that.
Do you think this is the right thing to do? I don't get why people do this.

If you need anymore details you can ask and I will reply ASAP.

Note: I don't like Facebook, so there I have only 3 posts and 1 photo. Maybe that scared her off?? I have no idea.
I only have Facebook because it's almost mandatory nowadays.

375,"My wife and I have a giant six-bedroom house. It's just us. We have five cats and a dog. I know it's a lot, but to be honest, since the house is so big and cats are so independent, it just doesn't feel like we have too many. They all get along and have their own spaces. They're all really well-adjusted and are seen regularly by the vet. They also do really well with change. People who visit us sometimes go a year before saying, ""Oh, you got a new cat?"" (Nope, same one that's always been here...) They're also surprised that our house ""doesn't smell like there's cats here."" Also, we work from home, so everybody gets plenty of attention.

We had six cats, but our eldest passed away a few months ago, and we've been considering adopting. My wife and I thought we should be open to adopting a bonded pair, to keep them together, since we really love cats and we have the room and resources to take care of them. But we also wonder if that's just excessive. We weren't planning on telling the more judgmental members of our families.

Legally, we're only supposed to have five pets, but I don't think anyone would report us since anyone who's close enough to us to know we have five cats and a dog can also see how well we take care of them.

Is it crazy to get one more cat? Is it crazy to get two? For what it's worth, we didn't expect to have as many as we did (kept rescuing strays), and I really don't think we'd ever look at our six or seven cats and go, ""Well, we need more cats."" Thoughts?",08Jun2018,2

381,"I am a female in my mid\-twenties.  
I took a job several years ago in a call center. I learned the job quickly, and was given a slightly better position out of the call center. After working that for a year, I felt I wasn't being trained correctly and eventually got a job in the business department which would allow me to learn more about health insurance.  
This started off fine, but I quickly understood the environment was no better than my previous. I am the youngest employee in the office. I have remained as respectful and hardworking as possible, realizing the ""millennial stereotype"" was going to continue to be a hurdle for me here.   
My coworkers are much older than me: one is in her 50s and one is in her 70s. We were given new responsibilities which overloaded an increased workload. I would do my reports, then moved into the shared reports, which WEREN'T TOUCHED. I became the only one maintaining the shared reports. When a staff member would be out, I would have an impossible workload but just about kept up. At one point, I couldn't keep up one of the shared reports (BOTH coworkers were out). I asked for help, and was criticized for not asking for help sooner. Fair enough, but the report was fresh and couldn't have been caught sooner.  
Several other things took place: I discovered major changes in insurance companies and workflow changes resulting from company merges, ect. I strongly feel that any other company would have rewarded this discoveries or at the very least, looked fondly upon them. Not me though. I was ignored while also deemed a know\-it\-all but catty old ladies. It would be 4 months and somebody else ""discovering"" the same changes before they would be implemented. That person was rewarded. I shrugged it off and worked around it.  
This is when the micromanaging began: I was called in for ""being on my cell phone too much"" and ""being rude to patients"". None of this was true; in\-fact, these were behaviors my other 2 coworkers displayed. Regardless, I respectfully apologized and did what I could to not give a reason for that conversation again.   
Most recently, I was spoken to for ""being out of my seat"" too much. This is what set me off. I was presented a ""report of my computer usage"" that showed enormous 20 minute intervals of not being touched. I tried to say that was impossible, but my boss genuinely believes this report is accurate because she ""saw me standing there and socializing"". I have obtained my own telephone history which shows that I was on the phone with our IT department resolving an issue, but I have not used it to defend myself yet.   
This whole situation solidified my suspicions that my boss is relying entirely on word\-of\-mouth, essentially gossip, from her longer\-standing employees. This puts me not at the mercy of my work ethic, but at the mercy of catty middle\-aged to elderly women who openly dislike my generation. I do not have any supervisors to use as a reference to leave the job, as they all have the same opinion. They sneakily filled a low\-level supervisor position with someone who has no experience in that particular department, without even considering me: someone with management experience as well as experience in that particular workflow in one of my previous jobs.  
The worst part is, either none of them have even attempted to run all reports which would show my true workload \- or \- they have and are trying to bar me from leaving a position I excel at. I do not make enough at this current job to be able to meet major milestones such as housing my family.  
I just don't know what to do anymore. I know, for certain, this has to be some form of age discrimination. I cannot explain it otherwise. I remained quiet and non\-opinionated, tried to avoid being a target but it just happened anyways. Has anyone else been in a similar situation before? How do I get out of this? Or, as someone who has lost all shits to give and may just go to school, how do I prepare to fight back?  


TL:DR: my office is full of middle aged and elderly women who have decided they dislike me for reasons I cannot determine. They gossip to my boss, who believes them, and I am trapped in my position as a result. How do I save myself?",08Jun2018,1
