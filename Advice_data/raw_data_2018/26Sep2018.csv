5,"So, my boyfriend of around a year and I are discussing me moving in with him after my work contract is up in May. The only thing is, I have three cats, and he has a dog, but the apartment he currently lives in only allows two pets. Also, he has stated that he doesn't really want anymore animals let alone to live with three cats. I don't want to live with a dog but I'm willing to for him, and he said he's willing to live with me and o of my cats, because that would be fair. (One cause he has a dog, and two because that would hit the two pet limit). 

He knows that this is a huge struggle for me and really hurts me, and he said he understands if I can't do it and we have to part ways. I'm so torn on what to do. I love love love my cats, but I really love him too. Two of my cats belonged to an ex-boyfriend, so I don't have the same bond that I do with Fancy, but I still love them.

I don't know what I should do. It's a bad situation from both ends.",26Sep2018,1
6,"I just moved to Colorado from California three weeks ago. In the month preceding my move I began searching and applying for jobs. 

I had a phone interview with this small SaaS company; the manager and I hit it off really well over the phone. The problem was that since I wouldn't be in CO for another several weeks, she was hesitant about moving forward with the interview process.

Also, when she asked where I'd be living I mentioned I wasn't sure but gave her a location that was a viable option at the time - which was 45 minutes from the office.

40 minutes in California is ""normal"", but in Colorado that could be a huge issue when there's snow.

She said she'd prefer someone who lives closer because they don't want someone who won't come to work because they're tired of the drive - or more realistically can't come to work because of snow.

At any rate, she said to call or shoot her a text when I arrive and mentioned they're slow to hire because they want to find the right fit.

Two weeks ago I figured I'd call and see if they were still looking to fill the position. I left a voicemail and didn't hear back. 

Then last Wednesday she called and invited me for an interview, which was last Friday.

It lasted for an hour and a half; and everything she talked about reinforced me wanting the job. I spoke with the CEO/CTO/founder.

Not only does it pay well for my background and level of education; it's a great opportunity to learn and is a very stimulating environment. It's also a small team - it would be me, herself, and the two existing team members.

I felt iffy about some parts of the interview, but overall it went well. She asked me to email her three references, which I did within a few hours after the interview.

Yesterday she emailed and said she'd be speaking with my references and following up with me soon regarding next steps.

Today - literally less than an hour ago - she called and invited me for a follow up interview on Thursday to meet the rest of the team. I was ecstatic!

I also mentioned my boyfriend and I found a place to live and would be signing papers tonight.

She congratulated me and asked where. Now for some reason in the back of my mind I didn't think it was that far but when I told her the location, I could tell she Google mapped it and the tone in her voice kinda changed - and she mentioned it was a 40min drive. 

She sent me the invite to the interview and everything but I felt like an idiot even bringing this up as she seems really adamant about hiring someone who lives within 20 minutes commute time of the office.

Anyways, I postponed signing the lease until tomorrow to buy some time to think about it. I really don't want to miss out on this opportunity, and I hope I didn't shoot myself in the foot.

Any suggestions on how to address this on Thursday? 

Do I risk losing a place to live for a potential amazing job?

Or do I risk losing a potential amazing job for a guaranteed place to live?

My boyfriend really wants to live there because it's an ideal location for his job, but I would be making around 30% more than him.

7,"Hi, in this moment I feel very anxious about the whole thing. Sorry for any grammar mistakes (please point them because I am not english speaker).

Basically I have been accepted in a new job after 1 year of unemployment...The thing is...for them, I am unemployed for 3 months.

I lied about the time I spent in a internship, my last work experience. I lied because I lost my job in a very embarrasing situation with only 4 months. And before this job, I  lost a job after 8 months in a big company. So, to not look like someone who can't hold a job, I told them that I was a intern for 1 year till the end of my graduation, and the small company couldn't hold labour costs for a formal employee. Well, this excuse could be very real as we are facing highest rates of unemployment in a shitty economy where labour costs too much thanks to bureacracy and taxes...I am 24 years old and I haven't started my carreer yet.

The problem:

I found a very good opportunity and after 2 interviews I was very excited about the job offer. Last thursday the HR guy asked for contact of my former employer and coworker. Shit! I thought! They will contact my previous boss and discover that I lied about the time I worked there! I pannicked, so I contacted a coworker that I used to have good relationships and asked her to help me if someone reaches her, to cover up my version. Thanksfully she agreed and wished me the best. I sent an email to my former boss (and owner) explaining my situation and also asking him to lie for me...I said I was sorry for putting him in this position as it was something unethical...Well, he didn't answer it. Probably didn't give a shit since he is overseas...and I know that he doesn't has time for bullshit, his company has already enough problems...After this crazy idea, I sent the HR guy the emails.

Still, the next morning they called me to tell me that I was approved and asked for my documentations...Ok, they probaly didn't check anything! One of the documents was the  Reference Letter. Shit again! 

Today I went there to handle my docs 99%, ok if wasn't for the goddamit Reference Letter. I told them that I probably wouldn't get it because it was a small company and they don't have HR and my former boss is traveling. She told me that she would contact the Hiring department to check what to do if I don't give them the letter, but still on the next call , she would tell the day I will start (next week) and asks for the Letter.

Now I don't know what to do, because the Reference Letter needs to has a stamp and it will say that I worked there for 4 months and not 1 year.  Even if I wanted I dare they would contact me back...that company is a mess, they probably don't have any documentation about me anymore as I was just an internet and not a formal employee.

I am freaking out about the possibility of losing this job over such small thing like that. My position is junior, for inners. Perhaps it doesn't even need to have previous experiences...Like, it is a security company but nothing that they need to full check my background...

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do:

\- Tell them it was not possible to get a reference letter and insist that I can't no matter what.

\- Tell them it was not possible but I could try the other company that is way more organized (still they probably won't do it too)

\- To try and contact my boss asking for a reference letter and photoshop it if needed

\- To calm down that is perfectly reasonable to not have this letter (laws doesn't make it mandatory or obligate companies to give reference letters for former employee).

Anyway, how can I assure my lie?

11,"I've never been a school-person. I know a lot of people aren't ""school people,"" but I mean I REALLY hate school. Just graduating high school pretty much drained my heart and soul, and starting college immediately after is just beating my dead corpse. Through out HS my parents forbade me from getting a job so I could focus on school, and once I graduated they said if I drop out of college Im kicked out of the house. Now I'm forced to go to college and it's eating away at me like nothing else. I'm not antisocial, I just absolutely hate school. If I drop out I get kicked out of my house, and have no job because my schedule is so intrusive that no employer will touch me with a 10ft pole. I ditch my classes a lot and Im barely maintaing Bs and Cs. I don't even want to drop out, I just want to take a semester break to work and let my mind reset. And the cherry on top is that I have to drive an hour to and from school with money I had to take out a loan to get because I live in the middle of nowhere and that's the closest college. How do I improve my situation? Saying ""Just finish school"" is of absolute no help. Also if I fail or drop a class I lose my financial aid and I'm gonna get kicked out.

- Ive been seeing both of Them
- I feel guilt toward both of Them
- I feel guilt toward the husband.

The married girl feels like I'm up to something as she isnt getting enough attention. She says she wants to leave her husband to be with me.

Lately I've realized that I'm a person that I would despise if someone told me about him. And I am truly lost right now.

- I feel like the married girl is my soulmate
- I feel like the girl I've been seeing is too young (20) for me. I am unsure if she is a match for me as she just does what i say. (She seems to lack personality).

15,"Trying to be more financially responsible. Parents offered to give me money for a laptop since my hard drive gave out on my old one. I happily accepted said offer and purchased a pretty nice gaming laptop. Didn’t have a whole lot of time to think the decision through being busy with work and life, not that i’m unhappy with the laptop choice or anything. Here is the issue

I spent the whole budget. Part of me is now saying, wait a second, I could buy a very cheap laptop that will serve 90% of my needs and save some cash in the process. I won’t be able to play quality games on it, but i’m unsure that I actually want to. Computer games are fun, I enjoy them, but ultimately I feel like i’m wasting my time. Putting hours into something that isn’t really worth putting time into. They are fun to relax with, and just enjoyable in general, but I could spend that time doing something better for myself or with others etc. 

So what all this boils down to is should I keep the nice gaming laptop, enjoy it, have fun with it, maybe waste more time on it than I should.

or

Return it, buy a cheaper one that won’t allow me to play quality games. Save the difference of a few hundred, and not be tempted by the ability to play quality games. Although i’d still be able to watch netflix etc.

Anyway working a full time job while trying to run a wedding planning business is a lot of work as clients are demanding.

Today, they texted me (at midnight) saying that they're having people over to show the room prior to my move-out close to the end of the year and while it's my own fault for not looking at my phone before I left the house, I really didn't appreciate it. I knew they would be showing the room in the future but with no indication of when and they both assured me they wouldn't show the room without me being there. 

Initially, I told them it would be okay to show it without me but upon reflection I'm not comfortable with it, especially having my room open to my cohabitators all day without me being there. I don't have a whole lot of space to hide my valuables and unmentionables and I'm terrified that they'd go in and make judgements. 

I'd like to tell them that I'm available when I'm available and that they have no right to *tell* me when to have my room open and offered to take pictures as a backup. I'd like to tell them that after the way they've treated me, they are not permitted anywhere near my private living space.

33,"I am a male in my early twenties.  
My parents are currently coming to the closure of their divorce settlement. I currently live with my father who is a fantastically hard worker and amazingly selfless for his children (me). I have not been in contact with my mother, in person or verbally, since December 2016 \[Wow time flies!\].

*Background*  
From as early as I can remember, I was a close observer of a completely defective marriage which included intensely distressing domestic violence, verbal and physical abuse (of which both engaged in). In addition to this, my mother was intensely possessive of me (and my siblings); she did not allow us to go out to friend's houses, enjoy our own music at home (in my own personal space), and essentially engage in any hobby or task that we found interesting. She essentially suppressed my childish expression for essentially my whole childhood and even into my late adolescence. 

From the beginning of school (Age 6), my mother would force me (and my siblings) to read encyclopedias (well beyond our understanding) and solve problems from advanced math textbooks that were 2 years beyond my year level - threatening us with belts and pulling our ears (each of which I had received at some stage). If you got below \~80ish percent on a page of 30 problems, she would beat us with a belt or pull our ears. What I had to read in the encyclopedia had to be summarized in writing, and we have to recite what we remember. The same outcome was imminent if we performed 'poorly' according to her standards. This occurred up until the 6th grade.  Other than that I cannot remember much about my childhood apart from school and studies, because frankly me memory from that time is suppressed.

My father would work afternoon-night shifts Monday-Saturday and would be asleep when we were awake and he wasnot home when we were at home after school. The only day I spent with him was on Sunday - the day during which majority of physical and verbal alternations occurred. It was quite a surprise if there was not at least an intense argument on this day.

I did not realize until about 2015 that my mother is a possible schizophrenic, and this is a view that I have quietly discussed with each of my siblings, father and family friends (all of which agree). She was (and probably still is) intensely paranoid as she would barricade the sliding door to her bedroom at night with large furniture, she would dye her hair 3 times a week, wash her hair and face about 3-4 times a day (each in very close succession), would buy and throw out dozens of soaps a week, hide her belongings on top of a standalone wardrobe, believe people were always tampering with her make-up and belongs (which nobody was). 

To summarize, my childhood and early adolescence was complete horse-shit. Between the ages of 15-20 I was in a state of depression. A dark cloak over the years that could've been and should've been some of the most memorable times. But they weren't. I never got treated by a professional - I internalized it and self-treated (attempted) myself. I finished school and entered a prestigious college in my field of choice.

 I went on a holiday with my father to his country of origin to see the country and meet his family. First half of the holiday was the touristy part (which I enjoyed a lot) and the second half was with the family. I met my extended family from my father's side and they were amazingly welcoming to me. I remember going to bed the first night of staying at their house - I started crying thinking about how 'loved' I had felt from their hospitality. \[I'm tearing up myself right now thinking about it\]. They welcomed a complete stranger whom they did not know at all, and made me feel 'at home'. This was a very eye-opening experience for me. This roughly correlated with the time where I stepped back and wondered to myself... is my  'family' normal? Is my mother normal? I now know the answer no. When we arrived back 'home' my father told me he had decided he had enough and was divorcing my mother. My natural response was ""Yes!"" - a celebration - a potential refuge - a potential escape from her. My father was planning on moving out to a relative's place. Me and my siblings begged to go with him. We were all in pain. 

My mother found out about the situation when she left home on a Monday morning and came home later that afternoon to find us and all our belongings gone. We left all the furniture and just took what was sentimental to each of us. I took my childhood photo albums and clothes - that's about it. Haven't talked to her since. 

*Now*

I am in a good mind-frame now. Looking back now I was depressed for a significant duration of childhood/adolescence. I found an outlet through gym/eating healthy, reading, meditation, fishing etc. Over time I have come to terms with my childhood and accept that it cannot be changed. A quote that rings true with me is: "" Just because today is the worst day of your life doesn't mean tomorrow can be the best day of your life."" Every day I try and make my life better - Life might be a crazy ocean BUT I have control over the rudder. 

I am in good mental and physical health, close to finishing college in a great (and lucrative field), have an amazing relationship with my siblings and father, have great friends, picked up amazing hobbies that I LOVE etc. (But I have commitment issues with girls but I'm working on this).

The divorce settlement is close to closure. It's just a matter of time before the shackles are off *my* family. What hardships my father/siblings goes through - I go through as well.

*My Question*  
What would you do in regards to my relationship with my mother?  
Should I pretend she never existed for the rest of my life? Should I see a counselor? Should I forgive and forget?  
Ps. I've never been to a counselor or medical professional w.r.t my mental health because I feel cured now.  
I just want to feel truly free and have no regrets - but I also want to be reasonable in my approach.  
Any advise and points of view appreciated. ",26Sep2018,2
34,"Firstly, I'd like to apologize in advance, incase this is the wrong sub to turn to for this kind of help, please do refer me to the correct one, if possible.

Now, here's what's going on. 
My relative lives in the USA. I live in the Czech Republic. My relative bought me an iPhone, costing $390 without tax (with tax $412). 
The shipping cost would be somewhere around 25-35 usd. 

I see there is a %21 VAT law here. 
How do I calculate the amount of money I'd have to pay, upon collecting the package? 
I used one website to calculate, it gave me a total of 80 usd more or less. But, then I used a different website, and was given a total of $470 more or less. So, now I'm very confused, ans starting to worry about this a bit. 

Yes, I completely understand that this is not a problem relatable to the other problems on this sub, and I do apologize for that, but please, if possible, help me. Thank you loads.

40,"I am a 26 M single dad with two children, ages 1 and 3. I live in the upstairs apt above a group of men who work construction, or some kind of industrial job.

My kids live with me about half the week and they spend the other half with their mother. Because they’re small, they like to play and run and just be the kids they are at this age. I do my best to be courteous and to keep them as quiet as possible, but that doesn’t always work out given their how old they are. They’re both generally really well behaved and listen to me most of the time when I tell them to be quiet. I put them to bed at 7 in the evening and they’re quiet until morning.

My only interaction with my neighbors was on a Sunday when my kids were being loud and I wasn’t being as vigilant about keeping them quiet. One of them came up and asked if we could be more quiet and I apologized and told him I’d try to keep their sound more under wraps. He was also annoyed because they were trying to watch football below (which I totally understand being a fan myself).

Before this, whenever they would be loud the people below me would bang on their ceiling (my floor) below us. And I can usually keep my kids quiet when that happens. It doesn’t always work out, but it works most of the time.

Tonight at around 5:30 in the evening, they were running back and forth across my apt. I’m honestly not sure how much noise it makes below given that my kids are so little. But my neighbors started banging anyways. So I tried to keep them quiet with some success. The banging continued to the point where I felt like I had to tiptoe across my kitchen to just to get something. They pounded so loud it was like I was having a rave in my apt. 

Honestly, I feel like I’m doing everything I can to keep my kids as quiet as possible, short of throwing them in their cribs to cry (which no one wants). They’re small and I’m not willing to completely squash their childhood fun to accommodate my neighbors. They don’t have to deal with it for half of the week since my kids don’t live here half the time anyways. The fact that the bro was so upset to bang my floor at 5:30 in the evening is ridiculous to me and not justified at that time. They’ve never once woken up and made noise in the middle of the night, which would be a different story. Not to mention I NEVER complain or pound on my floor when my neighbors play their music with a heavy baseline below me.

I’m just sick of trying to pander to these guys and I’m not sure what else more to do about it. They know I have kids and I try to be courteous as I can, as I know they can be loud. But I lost my patience with this bro banging as loud as he was during a time when noise can be expected from anyone, with kids or not. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",26Sep2018,3

42,"To start off, I want to keep this as concise as possible because I know I can go off on a lot of tangents here. Sorry in advance if that happens but there is a lot to be said that I think contributes the predicament I've found myself in.

&amp;#x200B;

To put this into context, I've been stuck in a rut for quite some time now without the slightest sense of what to do with my life. I've been an avid musician since the age of 6, but I've got some hang ups that paralyze me whenever I even try to touch an instrument or compose a song. I've been working in the tech industry for a number of years and I've always found myself in a position of responsibility but always find myself being taken advantage of, then subsequently passively taking advantage myself because I get pissed off and don't really know how else to deal with the situation, and lets be honest, we all have to make ends meet somehow. I've considered going back to college, but I've signed up for college twice in my life and both scenarios ended up with my finishing a few classes then becoming very frustrated and quitting mid semester. I have fears that if I started again it would end with the same result. I have a lot of skills that I've acquired by teaching myself. I have a lot of drive: when I want to get something done I don't quit until I'm satisfied that its perfect (call me a perfectionist I guess). 

&amp;#x200B;

To expound upon my current situation, About 6 months ago I moved back in with my parents who live basically in the middle of nowhere due to the fact that rent was becoming too expensive where I was and I have been in a situation where I found myself in debt that I needed to pay off (as of right now I'm halfway there, which is awesome, but still a work in progress). I work from home for a tech company and I kind of hate my job as I know they're taking advantage of me and everyone else who works in the tech department for sure (that's just another story entirely). I can't just quit my job because I still have debt that I need to pay. I'm honestly at the point where I don't even want to work in the tech industry anymore because of the companies that I've worked for (I've worked for 3 different companies, but to small and it seems like all companies treat their people this way in this industry). As I've stated, I've considered going back to school, but the only thing I can think of that is worth spending my time learning is music. While I was pursuing music in the past my family and friends weren't incredibly supportive. People would tell me to do other things because the music industry doesn't make money ""unless you're famous"" to which being famous never really interested me anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more to this but I don't want to ramble on to further con-volute the situation, but I'm open to advice and at this point I know I have to be transparent about the details considering I'm asking for honest advice. Thanks for taking the time, Cheers.

43,"Sigh. Sorry for the long post guys, I'd really appreciate it if you read through. TL;DR read title (but the post explains it better)

Already posted this to r/Anxiety

Just a little background: I'm a guy in college. I have terrible anxiety and it usually goes up and down but I'm REALLY good at hiding it. I can talk and make a connection with anyone. I can make people laugh and am pretty good at making friends in general. There's a bunch of reasons why I got better at thid specific part of my anxiety but that's not what I wanna talk about, I just thought it'd be helpful for y'all to know what kinda person I am.

So I've never been in a relationship, never asked anyone out/been asked out. Never kissed anyone either. (This hurts to write as well because in real life I appear to be so confident and at peace that it terrorises me to think of what my peers would think of this side of me.)

I revealed this nervous/anxious/constant worrier side of me to a couple close friends recently. Well we had a great talk but at the end of it they revealed to me that a girl they're close friends with (that I've only talked to a few times here and there) likes me a lot and thinks I'm attractive.

It was the equivalent of gaining the ability to fly but losing it once I was in the clouds - I felt amazing for a second but then immediately felt sick and queasy. My stomach was churning and my face was burning up and my hands were shaking.

This conflicted so hard with my self image and general hatred of my own appearance that I had a physical reaction to it.

It doesn't help that the girl is absolutely gorgeous either. The only reason why I wasn't nervous around her before is because I literally thought she was 100% gay but apparently she's not.

Also, she has said this to them on multiple occasions and first admitted it a few months ago. She also has anxiety which I honestly didn't know, she just seemed so put together and composed (hmm, sounds familiar) so she doesn't go out of her way to talk to people unless they talk to her.

I went to my first real party the other day (yay milestone) and had my first drink (YAY MILESTONE). It was about 10-12 people, she was also there. She was a little drunk and was flirting with me a lot and being really open with me. She's so cool to talk to, you guys.

Anyways the few days after this have been absolute hell. According to my friends I shouldn't ask her out cuz she needs time to get to know people and be comfortable around them. So I'm gonna try and get to know her better. I've been kinda texting her about general stuff and she's been doing kinda the same. We talked a while in class. Everything's ok on paper.

But to my anxious brain, every time she takes a while to respond or everytime I'm talking to her my brain goes ""Oh well she obviously hates you now, that's great you fucked it up"". Meanwhile, I'm just trying to behave normally, struggling to remember how I behaved around her anytime in the past when we met.

I'm willing to take it slow with this girl, I can completely understand if she needs time to warm up to me. She's super cool and relatable but also very mature. Also, as I said, pretty af.

I just want my fucking brain to stop telling me that I'm fucking this up while in reality, up to a few days ago I've been blissfully unaware of the fact that she's also attracted to guys too, which means I've been super normal and 100% myself around her without looking at her as a potential girlfriend or anything. And she likes me as that person! So why would the fact that she likes me make me behave differently now?! I'm fucking done with this, I wanna have fun and get to know her, but I can't do that if I'm multitasking between having a conversation and wrestling my brain to submission at the same time.

I don't know if this is me just venting or just asking for advice. I don't know. Just tell me something, anything that would help me calm down for a goddamn second. I mean, this girl likes me for God's sake, can my brain not be a miserable cunt for once?

46,"I'm kinda in a predicament because I don't know what to do. My father passed away in August and he ended up being cremated. The ashes were supposed to be split half for his father(My grandfather) and then half for the 3 children which includes me. Now I'm only 17 and I have a younger brother who's 12 and an older sister who's 21, and my grandfather and sister really hate my mother. She kinda starts problems left and right with everyone in my household. So after my father was cremated my grandfather gave a half of the ashes to my sister for her to hold on to. She ended up taking a trip down to Pennsylvania and took the ashes with her and gave them to my fathers half-brother. After I heard that me and my sister had a falling out because she didn't inform me or tell anyone she was doing that and I thought it wasn't right without consulting anyone. So once my Mom found out that she tried contacting my fathers half-brother multiple times and my grandfather. My grandfather spoke to her on a couple of occasions saying he'll talk to his son about calling my mom and talking about getting the ashes for us, but we never got a call back from him and I'm pretty sure at this point he blocked my mother. So then my mom tried calling my grandfather again and she called around 3 times without him answering, so he got snarky and texted three times saying ""What do you need now you called three times."" So my Mom just told him he won't answer the phone and stuff and she just wants to work out what to do, and then he threatened her saying if she doesn't leave him and his son alone he will sue her for harassment, and he also said he gave half of the ashes to one of the three children and it's not his problem anymore, yet he told me and my mother if my sister or anyone refuses to give the half of the ashes to us to call him and he'll work it out, but he's not doing any of it. So now my Mom wants me to call my grandfather or my dads half brother that has them and ask for them, but I feel it's probably gonna start and argument and it will lead to them blocking me, which means we will get no where. We have no money for a lawyer to help with us, and I don't really see them trying to work it out with communication so I really don't know what to do.",26Sep2018,2

48,"I recently quit my full time job in June. I was there less than 1 year, and I let my big headedness get in the way of wanting to work there - so I quit and gave my two weeks. My reasoning was a mix of a few (truthful) things:
- my mother in law has early onset Alzheimer’s. I had to help take care of her, but after she was kicked out of her family home for violence, she resides in hospital now and I don’t need to help anymore.
- I found another job. 

I let everyone know I left because of reason A, and everyone, including me, was actually sad to go. I wanted to leave because of my supervisor being so terrible, but overall she just really cares about me due to me being significantly younger than the other employees. There was some bullying from the older women, as well as passive aggressive comments - but nobody ever believed me due to seniority. 

I just feel liked I really screwed up. I’ve been unemployed for almost 3 months (job #2 didn’t work out, management was running illegal things so I left) I contacted HR and let them know about my mum and that I’d like to come back if they’d have me; I said I’d love to come in and talk about a possibility of me coming back.

I received the following email:
“Hi J,
After discussing it with [financial representative] and [former supervisor] we’ve decided to not re-offer you employment at this time.”

I was CRUSHED. I waited about 2 months, and then contacted my former supervisor, an email in the form of an apology, apologizing for my behavior (which wasn’t bad, i just got caught up in the older women’s gossip) She said the following in response:

“J
 
This was a very nice email. Thank you.
 
Take away that you did do a good work while you were here. It was unfortunate that you let your age be an issue for you. Your age was a non-issue with management and the rest of your team. Only you are the one who seemed to bring it up so often and feel it was a problem. You became your worst enemy about your age and should have given yourself more credit about being a hard worker.
 
I wish you luck in your future. You really do have a lot to offer, give yourself more credit.”

52,"So this issue is fairly complex and involves quite a few moving parts. First off some background.

I worked with a Company for 7 years out of Japan, back in 2015 I decided I want to come back to the states so I did. Since then my old employer and I have come to agreement for me to come back, its a significant promotion and an exciting opportunity. Right after I accepted the offer I was injured, this was back in may. I tore my stabilizer tendon on my right knee. I have since had surgery and have completed several months of physical therapy. 

In the last 4 weeks of Physical Therapy my Therapist and I have seen large improvements in my muscle development (which is now our primary focus). Not only that I'm very comfortable with living in Japan, I understand the system and have already had a friend in Japan help me find a doctor who is prepared to take over my care and refer me to a new Physical Therapy in Japan. 

My doctor has told me the first 3-4 months of recovery will get me to 70% and the last 30% of recovery will take 9 months. I'm basically at the end of my 70% recovery period or I will be in 3 weeks. My employer needs me, I got a project I have to start working on, I want to be over there already. 

Some other factors

* One of the reasons why I left Japan is because of an expensive divorce, which resulted in me having to file bankruptcy (in America) I'm currently on a Chapter 13 payment plan, but I'll be converting to Chapter 7th. The thing is I must convert by October 19th. When I do this I will lose my car. I'm OK with this since I won't need a car in Japan and its not like I could ship an American car to Japan to begin with. I am losing my car sometime after the 19th and although I could live a week or two without a car where I live after that it would get hard.
* I have to inform my landlord of my decision to move out by the last day of the month or I'll have to pay rent for November, I don't want to pay November rent money is tight already.
* I also have to quit my current job, this is less of a concern though as I'm fairly confident I'm laid off as soon as I get back (my current employer in the states has laid off my entire department, I am literally the only person left in the department because I was hurt and my Union has protected my job, hence my benefits due to my injury)

So my decision is this:

* Listen to my doctor, get ready to pay November rent and tell my new employer in Japan that I'm not sure when I'll be cleared but its not looking like October. This could risk my position with my new employer in Japan (They've been pretty accommodating, but there only so much waiting they can do, the position needs to be filled and they got other people who want it)
* Tell my doctor I'm flying to Japan in October as my employer in Japan has discussed and fly sometime after the 20th (cause of the bankruptcy) but before the 1st of Nov and that would mean I would notify my landlord I'll be moving out in October.

My doctor doesn't feel like i'm ready. I don't think he's been around me enough to understand the improvement I've had. Both my Physical Therapist, and my Doctors PA think that it would be ok for me to fly later in October. I spoke to both of them and they both agreed that sometimes my doctor has a habit of keeping people on maybe a bit longer then required just to be safe. And if I had more time, and less issues I wouldn't mind doing another 4-6 weeks but I got other things that have got to happen and if I stay another 4-6 week it really fucks up my finances.

To top all this off I already have plans in place to continue my treatment in Japan. Which in my opinion will cost me less money and be just as good as whatever treatment I could get in the states.

53,"I’m going to try to keep this short. I’m a college student and recently got out of a long-term relationship over the summer. I’ve been having a great time being single, but I feel like I must be doing something wrong because every guy I genuinely try to get to know does not give a shit about a conversation it’s just sex/hooking up all the time. 
I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong to give off that impression. Recently, I asked a guy I’ve had a ton of classes with and always thought was pretty cute if he wanted to hang out sometime and he said yes and we’re supposed to meet up Thursday, but I’m getting the impression that he just assumed I meant hook up. I feel like I must’ve done something to give him that impression. But I guess what I’m really asking for advice on is how do I ask someone to hang out without the implication that I want to hook up. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good hookup, but as a girl, I feel like it’s never really that good for me because most guys just wanna get off and obviously don’t care if I get off or not. 
Maybe I’m just picking the wrong guys, but I just had faith in this guy because he’s driven, hard-working, and funny, but now I’ve just lost all hope. I’m not sure what I’m doing to make others think I’m so easy. Sorry if this is vague, I’m just exhausted. 
My plan with this guy is to just apologize tomorrow for giving him the wrong impression and let him know I just honestly wanted to hang out and that he doesn’t have to come over if he doesn’t want to anymore. 

TL;DR How does a girl ask a guy out without giving them the impression I’m just trying to hookup?

54,"Hi, I (M/21) have a long term best friend (F/24) that can be really aggressive and intrusive sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I was raised by women only and sometimes I can have a feminine way of behaving, acting or talking, I don't know. I've heard a few comments throughout my life and people often ask me if I'm gay. I don't usually like stuff that men are supposed to like simply because I didn't have a role model to get me started on said subjects. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is, despite that, I am 100% straight, without a question.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I posted a few instagram stories talking about something really important and motivating people to work out, since I'm just now starting to fight back my depression and I decided to try some physical activities. It was a huge step.  
But I used that snapchat filter that puts you a nose ring and long eyelashes. I thought I looked nice. You can see it for yourself on [instagram.com/nathanbakker](https://instagram.com/nathanbakker).

&amp;#x200B;

She replied saying WTF is this? I'm sorry I don't wanna offend you but this is SO gay.   
Then, she went on talking about how much people talk about this to her, even though we don't go out together for YEARS now and people barely know we are friends. She was literally saying she was SURE I was secretly gay and didn't have the courage to come out. That there's something about myself that I gotta accept and embrace. The kind of conversation she was having was like ""dude, I know it, you just gotta accept it and you can come talk to me about it, I'm your friend"". 

&amp;#x200B;

And I am SO sick of this. She knows I have several complexes in this subject, because people would always say that and I didn't understand why, it wasn't my fault. It created a permanent self esteem damage and she knows it.  And she doesn't think about her words for a second and fire them all without any sort of restriction. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sick of her way of being friends, but she's pretty much the only friend I have.   
I really wanna tell her to fuck off and never see her face again, but I'm kinda afraid of being alone, since I just broke up with my 3 year long girlfriend. 

  
Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

Now the sucky part... About ten years ago when I was a young man barely 20, I met this girl that just absolutely took my breath away, in every sense of the phrase. She is just.. wow. Ever met someone that you just immediately imagine spending the most glorious life with? Even back then I knew she was something special. I'm much more spiritual now than I was then, and now I know that her soul just vibed with mine in the best possible way. Our relationship didn't last long, same as most young loves, and it ended in a not so great way (completely her fault, she's admitted as much). A year or so after it ended we hit each other up on Facebook and just talked shit out, blah blah... And ever since then we've been pretty great ""friends"". She lives on the east coast, while I'm in the midwest, so it's not like we've seen each other over the past 10 years. But she's always been ""that one"" to me, my Great White Buffalo if you will. All the time... Every time I spoke to her, I'd get those butterflies, that yearning that lasts for days afterwards until it gets out of my system. I've just always loved everything about her. These long 10 years, she's always held a piece of my heart, even if we only speak once or twice every other month or so.

And now I know she feels the same way, the exact same way I do. After I got engaged, she messaged me and (very respectfully) told me how happy she was for me, but that I've always been HER Great White Buffalo, HER greatest what if. I was very happy she told me, but at the same time, now I'm in this position. Thinking of her a little too much (even more than I used to, which was still quite a bit), wondering what kind of life we could have had together, what could have been different, how happy we would be... If it would have been easier since her son isn't autistic and all (NOT bashing autism, but let's not pretend it's easy diving into a relationship with someone that has an autistic kid. It's VERY difficult and trying at times, it is what it is). I just can't seem to help it.. it's aggravating. 

I don't know what I expect y'all to say or do to help me, I don't know. I love my fiance, to the Moon and back, I do. I just also know that I've spent years pining after someone I've always wanted, only to now know much too late that it could have been her engaged to me now, her I'm marrying, her I'm planning to spend the rest of my years happy with.. if only one of us had just effing said something. I feel it turning into one of the biggest regrets of my life so far. Of course I feel super guilty for these thoughts, and of course I would never act on them.. but I can't stop myself from thinking about our little ""if we're single at this age..."" pact. 

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? Or know someone who has? If so, please... I don't know what anyone could do to help, but maybe just talking to someone and spilling my guts would center my mind and clear my thoughts. Never been in a situation like this, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Please feel free to speak your mind, unless you're gonna be an unrelenting Dipshit about it. Thanks in advance.

Also, sorry... Definitely wasn't long story short haha 😄

58,"Ok so when i hang with me female friends im always super like concerned and get super mad with dudes when they do whatever, like if a guy tries to flirt with one and she doesn’t like him, id get protective and try to get him to leave. And stuff like that isnt super weird, worrying is normal with friends. But what gets weird is that im concerned and worried for a friend who i have no need to be like this, she doesnt do illegal stuff, the worst part of her home-life is that her brother sucks. And she doesnt have to deal with guys being guys with her. And i hate that im always worried and i wish i could be more laid back considering that i literally cant do anything about the problems. Hell i get annoyed at stupid things that happen to them, like if a guy looks at them. So basically, is there anyway that i could not be like this?",26Sep2018,1
59,"Let me give some backstory. I'm 21 and in my final year at college. I live with my mom, step-dad, and younger brother (12 y/o). There's always been small fights between the family and that's normal, but this year it's gotten VERY bad. There isn't a day that goes by without screaming in the house. My brother/mother have a huge control freak problem, and when they butt heads it becomes unbearable. Step dad also gets involved and yells as well. It's a constant fight in the house (nothing physical) but mentally it is absolutely destroying me. I've brought up this issue with them many times, and nothing has changed. I've spent a large portion of the year documenting my brother's behavior (jotting down EVERY instance of poor behavior) and sitting down and talking with him in hopes of fixing his shitty behavior, but he just doesn't care how his behavior affects others. We've tried therapy/psychologist, and the situation just gets worse. I can't take it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

The only option I have is to move in with my dad, which is also a problem because him and my mom can't stand each other, so I know this will cause more issues between them (which I try to avoid at all costs) if I leave for good. This will just add more stress.

How do I deal with this situation better? I've been in such a shitty place mentally because of this. Thank you for reading.

60,"So I just recently moved into a new apartment complex, so I don’t really know my neighbors yet, but I am fairly certain an older person lives next to me. They have a pretty annoying small dog that barks every time you walk by the door, but only when you walk by, so it isn’t disturbing when I’m inside. 

Yesterday, I noticed my neighbor had a package sitting outside their door when I got home from work. Didn’t think much of it except that it was still there the next morning. I decided that if it was still there when I got home from work today that I would knock on the door. Well I did, and got no answer except for a constant barking. It should also be noted that the dog was barking before I walked up. I could hear when I parked.

After that knock, the dog will not stop barking except for brief 15 minutes breaks. It has never been like this before since I moved in a couple weeks ago. I also didn’t think about it until a moment ago, but that also means the dog hasn’t been let out to go to the bathroom at all the past two days at least.

The package is still just sitting there and leaning against the door, so I know it’s not a case of that they just didn’t notice it. I’m worried they might be injured or possibly passed. I also feel that the dog is maybe trying to alert someone.

Am I just paranoid or should I be worried?",26Sep2018,1
61,"I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to ask this.

I (24F) recently moved back to my home state and found a job in manufacturing (paper magazines, specifically). Going from working a desk job and not exactly being active to being on my feet 12 hours a day has been a huge change, but good in a lot of ways.

However... my feet are absolutely killing me. I have a pretty good pain tolerance, and I don't mind being a bit sore - but I'm talking nearly tear inducing, ""all-I-can-think-about-is-how- much-longer-until-I-can-sit-down"" pain, especially in my heels.

As I mentioned, I work 12-hour shifts, with a generous amount of five 30-min. breaks throughout the day. We wear steel-toed shoes as well.

I've just started working here, so I'm not fully adjusted to everything yet... but I've bought gel insoles specifically designed for work, new socks, everything I can think of short of taking benadryl to help.

62,"A little backstory: Back in Fall 2016, I enrolled at a 4-year university straight out of high school at 17 years old. It was a 1 hour drive that I had to make every day. I went for 2 or 3 days, but felt like it wasn't right. I don't know what it was, but I felt out of place, whether it be because I was so young and not ready, I felt too overwhelmed. I decided to drop out(I got a full refund since I did it before the deadline) and after my parents basically seemed to be on the verge of kicking me out, I decided to enroll at a local community college. This was going well, I had about 40 credits, but I ultimately decided to transfer back to the university this semester. 

I had that same overwhelming feeling when I started about 3.5 weeks ago, but decided to just deal with it, hoping that it would go away. It hasn't gone away, and I think it's actually gotten worse. Right now, I'm only taking 3 classes(the minimum to be considered full time). I've done so poorly and fallen so far behind in Calc 2 that I'm fairly certain that I'm going to fail. I can't motivate myself to study. Even when I do study, I struggle with the material. 

I'm a computer science student, and I'm having this much trouble on purely sophomore-level classes. I'm beginning to think that college just isn't right for me. The biggest problem is that I don't know what IS right for me. My parents would probably kick me out if I tried dropping out without a plan for a well-paying job, so I'd need to have a plan. 

I could probably go back to get my associate's in computer information systems at my community college, but I don't know what value that degree would have. My dream job is to be an ethical hacker, but I can't see myself getting past the required math classes and even some of the upper level programming classes. 

To me, it just seems like a classroom environment is not meant for my style of learning. I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm just wasting money by staying at this college. I'm probably only going to receiver 8 credits this semester(at most) and that's only for 3 classes. 

Any advice?",26Sep2018,1
63,"I bought some acid for a friend the other day, no intention on using myself. I was going for some tin foil low key to wrap it up, but my mom saw me and was immediately suspicious. I told her i was just gonna play with it and stuff, and i'm fully aware that this a terrible lie. She was super suspicious and after i went to school she searched my room and found all my weed, not the acid tho. She was really really super pissed at me, and even more suspicious about the foil. She has no idea about the acid. I'm giving it to my friend tomorrow and it won't be an issue any more. But, i kept up that the tin foil was irrelevant when she questioned me. She seemed to buy it somewhat, but i am a terrible liar. Later she came into my room demanding to know what it was for and that she didn't believe me. Again i told her it was a red herring. I have no idea what to do from this point. Once the acid is no longer in my possession, it won't be as big of an issue, but i'll have it for the whole night.

64,"My friend Beth has been in relationship after relationship for as long as I've known her. She'll break up with someone and immediately find someone else to date. Beth is known for her low self esteem and lack of confidence, which I think is the reason why she stayed in that relationship for so long. I think her self hatred fuels constant codependent relationships. 

When she was 16, she began dating a girl that no one liked. I assumed it was my jealousy that caused me to dislike her, but the more I talked to people about her, the more I realized she wasn't a good person. She told Beth's friends that they were slutty, faking depression for attention, horrible artists, etc. I couldn't wait for them to break up.

Three years later, her girlfriend went off to college, and Beth couldn't take the long distance. They broke up, and Beth immediately found someone to have sex with and talk to every day. I wish she would have told me these things as they were happening, but I didn't know for weeks. I had to hear it from a mutual friend. 

We were all waiting for the day when she became single again because she needs to be. She needs to learn how to love herself, even when no one else will, and especially when no one else will.  She can't find her self worth in other people anymore. Of course, we've all told her these things. We've all told her that she can't see that new guy, that it's not good for her. She just won't listen. She actually rolls her eyes, as if it's funny to watch the friend that we love fall into another trap that she's wasted years in. I don't know this guy, but I know her. Hell, he may be great for her. But she *needs* to take some time for herself.

65,"First, I need to give a little context so you don't think I'm crazy.

So, I've been really into painting historical symbols. It started with painting different flags over time. One of my paintings was several panels showing different versions of the American flag (I'm an American). My style is to paint the older flags with a ""older"" or torn looking appearance, and the newer ones have cleaner edges and clear symbols. Well it was only a matter of time before the idea of painting the German flags came to mind. In all honesty, I had it in the back of my head the whole time to paint a Nazi Germany flag, but I kept pushing it off. I finally did it. It kind of made me feel powerful, to have a painting with a symbol deemed so taboo by society. 

A bit of time went by between my paintings, quite a bit of time. I had just settled into my new house, and one day, I had an urge. I had an urge to paint a straight up swastika, and I did. And my god, did it look incredible. I do have to say, it is one of my favorite works. That same feeling came back, that I had made something that carries so much symbolism with it, especially that of hate, that of, if someone saw that painting hanging in my room they would see me differently. In fact, I did hang it in my room, even in the living-room. Two of my roommates did not care too much, but one said ""I'm okay with most things..."" (for context, this is your white dude who says nigger pretty often) ""...but we can't have that up""

So I took it down, back in my room on the wall. However, even I couldn't keep it up for to long, lest it greatly offended someone and change their view of me. I stripped the canvas from the frame, rolled it up, and hid it in the back of my closet. I was kind of sad to take it down because it was, purely artistically speaking, a well done painting.

Now, I know this is already going to get down-voted because it's literally me talking about a swastika that I painted, but hear me out. I am not a Nazi/Neo-Nazi, or whatever you call them, I'm far from it. I want to share a few thoughts that went through my head before I even dare mention my costume idea. Firstly, I think it's important that we recognize what the swastika symbolizes, in this context at least. It shows how propaganda is such a powerful tool to manipulate the minds of the masses. If we forget about the swastika, and it's effect, then some other symbol may be used, in fact I believe this is already the case. Companies use rotational symmetry to get us to remember their brand better, which is a form of manipulating us to associate certain goods and services with their brand. Moreover, it's important to remember that the swastika was only a symbol for a political party, no different than the democrats donkey or the republicans elephant. Sure it now carries with it this much deeper connotation, but my point is that symbols are powerful, and even before they are associated with major themes of hate, they are associated with something, and when we see them repeated, we are very much manipulated by them. They are just as much as propaganda as yellow journalism may be.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is my idea for a costume, you ask, or presumably may have already guessed... its  Nazi Solder Uniform!

&amp;#x200B;

My goal with this is to make a statement. To remind people of the Nazis, the \*real\* Nazis. To remind people of the swastika, and how such symbols may be used as a tool of propaganda. I wish to challenge the societal taboos by bringing to the forefront what we try to hide away, because I believe that it is dangerous to hide away these symbols of the past, because they remind us of exactly that, the past, and what happened. They remind people to talk about these things, so that we don't fall under the same trap. Now, I know onlookers of my costume may not think of any of that, but I would hope it sparks some discussion about it, either between them and their cohorts, or if they approach me and ask why I am doing it. I am a bit nervous about people getting violent with me, but I will try to be around people I know.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you all think about this? Plausible? Terrible, terrible idea? Harmless? Harmful? Should I think more about this, or just go for it and start the process of getting the costume already?",26Sep2018,0

67,"This may be a little gross to read, but I have a legitimate phobia of throw up. Everything about it from the sound, smell, taste, look. Everything. If I even hear someone gag I instantly cover my ears and squint my eyes. The last time I’ve puked was when I was around 5. I didn’t have a real issue with it then. 
I think what may have triggered it, was one night my sister came home after a night of drinking. I was around 10 and she was 17. We shared a room. I remember she threw up, and I can still hear the sound of it hitting our garbage can. Did that trigger my phobia of it? I remember she didn’t empty the cab and so the smell of it lingered in our room all night and I was horrified. It’s gotten to the point where I won’t even drink socially anymore (I’m 20 now) in case I throw up. Nye a few years ago I did my first shot, and the next morning I was hung over in the bathroom shaking in tears because the potent alcohol kept sliding up my throat but my body was too scared to throw up so I didn’t.

71,"Long background short, my older brothers are actually my half brothers (2) because they had a different mom, but my sister and I have a new mom with this same dad. Ok so 1 of the half brothers is a normal kid and doesn’t get into to much trouble, but my other brother is a druggie, and gets into a lot of trouble. He does things like stealing his mom’s car to see his dealer to get his drugs and my dad doesn’t really care to do anything and the mom got pissed and threw him out. My dad and brothers meet my mom pretty soon and then that all happens and the druggie brother starts stealing her money because Dad won’t give him enough or whatever and my mom stops that there and she never trusted him again . This builds up until my sister is born and then he just chokes her out of nowhere one day and it pissed my mom off a LOT. She gets furious and tells my dad to get them in control because they aren’t her kids, so it’s not her responsibility to take care of 3 kids when only 1 is hers. My dad defends them and my mom just stops talking to him after they try to have another baby, but it turned out to be a miscarriage and my good brother leaves to get a job in the military, 

This is where the story starts~  2 years after the miscarriage my parents try again and that’s where I come along. So I didn’t even notice the problems until I was 10 when my mom told me that we had to leave when we got the money because we weren’t safe. 2 years ago was the breaking point because my dad cut my mom’s power off in her room, and my brother stole money from me which I was saving up to help pay for the house, and one day I was just taking a shower and when I get out, I get a set of clothes, and I go to the kitchen and everyone’s yelling at each other and all that. My dad called the cops because my mom “assaulted him” when in reality she just gave him a little shove because he was in her face and she didn’t like that, I can’t confirm because I didn’t physically see this, but that’s what I was told happened. So my mom gets in the cop car after we explain everything, and she goes to her dad’s house, and I just sat there crying for 5 minutes because I had no idea what even happened and didn’t understand the whole story. She comes back a few days later and she wakes me up for school, but she said don’t get ready for school, we’re leaving now, and we pack everything we need as fast as we can and my sister wakes up and calls my dad, because he’s at work (big truck because he’s in construction) We were just about to leave with our things and he pulls up and blocks our way, and he tells us to get back inside, and we don’t of course, so he tries to wreck into us to kill us, and my mom takes a small opening he made when he tried to pull in and saved us. Then we lived at my grandpa’s house until we could get our place, now we live together and my brother’s in jail for more drugs and attempting to kill people. 

SO now that I’ve said all that, I can say that I thought I got over it in 2 weeks or close, but 2 years later all of the sudden I can’t stop thinking about it and I’m just in school and I’ll randomly start bursting into hysterical crazy tears, and I don’t know why, nothing really phases me and I could think about that completely fine for the longest time, but now whenever I think back it’s almost as traumatizing as it was back when I first got out of the shower and I can remember every detail perfectly, how do I get over this?

Also at lunch today, I was listening to Artzie Music, and because they use Lum for the visuals on the video, she thought I was looking at ""scantily clad women"". I was shure that the video didn't violate the District's AUP, but of course they thought I was looking at some sort of hentai, I showed the video in question to my parents and even they thought it was ridiculous. When I ask to be left alone, I get a spell about how it's their job to hover over me. What should I do? I feel like I am being discriminated by the staff and when someone else does this stuff, they get away scott-free.",26Sep2018,1
84,"My (18F) friend (18F) is something today that really hurt me. Normally, we would joke around and I honestly wouldn’t really care when she made subtly racist (I’m Asian) jokes or comments. But today I had a stack of paper on my desk and she took one and it happened to be the summary of my doctors visit. I asked her to give it back, not because I have anything to hide but that’s just something I wanna keep private ya know? Anyways, on the side, it had my weight on it and she kept repeating it and laughing. I know I’m overweight but she really didn’t have to laugh about it in my face. I asked her multiple times to give it back and she wouldn’t so i got up and left. I ignored her for the rest of the day because I was too hurt to say anything (we had class all day together which made it awkward). Then she confronted me but I just shrugged it off because I felt like she was trying to play the victim. I don’t know what to do now or how I should confront her about this. She’s a really good friend besides the comments she would make. How should I approach her? 

TLDR my friend laughed at my weight and wouldn’t give me back my medical records. I’m really hurt about this and don’t know how to talk to her about it ",26Sep2018,6
85,"My best friend (let's call her Carly) is an extremely talented circus artist living in Las Vegas and was in a couple of the big shows there. She's from the UK and married her best friend to stay in the US, but I don't think they finished the paperwork fully before her wife decided to suddenly abandon her and take her money with her. 

On top of all this, she has a serious injury involving potential nerve damage in one leg and has been on crutches since June and barely able to move without pain. She's not able to see a specialist because she can't afford it right now and the pain is slowly getting worse, so she can't perform for work. She also can't fly back to her country for medical attention because she won't be able to come back due to the whole paperwork thing. She's tried reaching out to her wife and even her wife's family to get her money, but there's only been silence.

She doesn't have family that is willing to help her, and her ""friends"" in Vegas have done nothing but ""aw I'm sorry"" and left it at that. She's so deflated and too scared to make a GoFundMe because she truly believes that no one will respond or care. She's afraid to tell her story in fear of burning future bridges in terms of performance opportunities, and is also very private and is hesitant about people knowing her situation. As much as I'm encouraging her to reach out and ask for help, she's finding it almost impossible. 

The worst part is, she's just about to seal a deal with an investor on a company she's wanting to create that could solve all of these problems she's having. They're ready to work with her in 8 days I think, but she's running out of a way to stay afloat with zero money and about to be evicted (in I think 4 days) if she can't come up with $3,000 to pay her rent/late fees/electric/etc. She certainly could use more than that, and I've sent her some meals and dog food so her pups have something to eat for a while, but she's running out of time. 

Is it wrong of me to want to set up a GoFundMe without her permission? There are so many people I know who would be willing to help this wonderful woman in a second if they really understood what was going on. I'm trying to drive to Vegas to be with her and help in any way I can, but I don't have much more money to spare. 

This gal is such a light and so selfless and doesn't deserve what's happening to her. Any advice or guidance would be super helpful, reddit!

86,"Hi, it is often said that exercising, doing sports in general is good for mental health. I go running/jogging on a regular basis, and I find that often, when I finish my rounds and am exhausted, I have intrusive negative thoughts (e.g. about bad stuff from my past) for a good 30 minutes.

Is this part of the process? I don't suffer from depression or anything. I just sometimes dwell on bullshit from the past and it always seems to come up when I'm running.",26Sep2018,1
87,"Dude, I don't even know if I'm doing this right cuz I've only lurked for a few years and have never submitted anything.

I'll make this as short as possible because I want to guide my friend the best that I can but others may know better or at least have a less biased opinion than me.

My best friend of decades is in a bit of a situation. We've known this dude for over a decade and they ""dated"" for MAYBE 3 weeks, they didn't so much as date as much as she wanted to feel things out to see if she was ready to date since her fiance had died 7 or 8 months prior and she thought she might be ready but wasn't sure if it was something she could not feel guilty about doing.

To paraphrase the ending of it, she was more than up front that most likely it wouldn't work due to uncertain variables and he (always being a decent friend) pretended to be on the same page. One week in he's already confessing his love, pulling me and other friends aside, asking for our blessings so he can propose and also his intentions of asking her parents. Needless to say, we all reminded him this was stupid of him to think and he needed to be more concerned with her mental health around this situation and reminded him they aren't even dating just seeing if she is capable of doing so.

She ends things with him cuz under the facade of nice guy was a racist, bigot feigning victimization of a cruel world and it just wasn't possible to make it one more God damn day with him coming over. Then  the endless amount of texts how he refuses to believe it and they were in love and he considers her and the sweet beautiful boy her and her fiance had he had considered his family and it wasn't fair and he wasn't going to accept it until reasons a-z were met. The messages got angrier and more suicidal, her parents started receiving crying messages and even I've had to hold his hand through plethora or dumb moments that wouldn't amount to shit to the average dater.

She finally blocked him on The Book because of the same reason. I still chose to hold his hand and steer the conversation away from her when he's feeling aggravated, because she didn't want to throw him into the path of desperation.

Here's the advice part. I've already changed the locks, done all that but in the weeks following the block her parents have endured 5 flat tires on her mom's car and 2 on her dad's. Is it really that big of a leap to assume it was him or can flat tires really occur like this.

If it happened to her we'd know who did it and 3 of the flats were on the tread side while the rest were on the wall of the tire itself. They were thumb tacks. Not nails. 


Also, during the ""fallout"" my friend had reached out to an ex of his who had told her the entire years of their relationship he had talked about my friend nonstop to the point it would worry her.

Also, also, this is the type of man that when his ex started dating someone else 2 years later and got pregnant he responded by leaving her voicemails saying he wished the child would have down syndrome. When the baby was born and had down syndrome he taunted her for months.",26Sep2018,0

I didn't want to come home and see my dad either because I didn't want to feel it was real.

90,"Hey everyone, 

So, recently I've encountered a few people who seem to give advice or what they think is constructive criticism on subjects they really have no idea about or are very new to the subject being discussed. 

Here are some examples: I have been competing on an Olympic weightlifting team for about three years and have been doing the sport for about five. We train in a cross fit gym that we rent monthly. A woman from the cross fit class usually hangs around watches us and chats with her friends. Several times she has come up to me with advice that she thinks will improve my lifts. This advice makes zero sense, she's pretty much just throwing a word salad together to sound smart. Also, I've seen her lift and she has awful technique and this will inevitably lead to injury.

Another person is my neighbor. I work as an engineer and he is a retired airline pilot.  He is constantly trying to give me advice in regards to my career. Things like the difference between computer programs that are commonly used in my field. He has no idea what he's saying at all but I just play along.

I encounter both of these people almost on a daily basis and I'm sick of it. I want to tell them to stfu you have no idea what you're saying!! But I'm too nice. I believe they feel inclined to give me advice because I am a lot younger than both of these people. I want to make it known they have no clue what they're saying without burning these bridges too badly.

95,"I needed you. To feel normal. To feel like I’m not alone. And you’re slipping through my fingers like water. I never needed someone like this before. It’s strange and rather disturbing to say that to myself. Maybe it’s my makeup. I always need someone to be there for me. Or else I’ll drown myself in the hole that I obviously created to be able to live with myself. I needed this dependency on you. Like a drug. That’s what they all say when they’re in love. It’s like it’s an addiction. All of us have one. It’s just that mine, intended to be a person. Sure you don’t need me. And sure i can be independent on my own but i want you and i need you. And it’s crazy and i know you think we’re going too fast and I don’t give a shit. What if you don’t actually have the time of the world what if you have shorter than what you wanted. Do you wanna spend it just idling around waiting for a miracle? No, you go do what you gotta do with your limited timeframe. This is way unhealthy but i never really cared about being unhealthy before so who gives a fck right? I don’t. I don’t care if my whole fckn world revolved around you. I don’t. I love you. And you can be my everything and i can do anything for you. But i know that being healthy and normal are all you care about. I know that. But are you happy? It’s subjective. Of course you’ll say you’re happy with shit. But I’m brutally honest in my head at least. And i always say to myself that I don’t need you. I don’t physically of course. But i want you and that’s more excruciating. Yeah maybe I’m a little coo coo. I know. I’m kinda weird sometimes. I act so strong but I’m a marshmallow on the inside. I watched that comedy special with Daniel Sloss again. Especially that part about the jigsaw puzzle. Because it made me feel things i guess. And to be honest. I wanted you to be the middle of my jigsaw if that matters anymore. I know why i was so drawn to you. You’re the only one that i dated that is not entirely dumbfounded by me. Meaning most of the guys I’ve dated fell completely head over heels in love with me. And you’re the only one i think didn’t do that. I may sound a tiny bit narcissistic. But i always have a countdown up until the time that they say those i love you to me and my time is actually pretty good. Which is a month before they fall in love with me. And i know you don’t want to know these things “in my past” emphasis on the quote. You’re the only one that didn’t do that. And because I’m a bit of a narcissist. I kept dating you. And i felt more in love with you than i thought i would be. It actually bothered me that you didn’t say those things until i said it to you. I might say i may be in love with you than you are to me. Which scared me shitless. Anyway, all I’m saying is. I’m not perfect, I’m funny sometimes. I mess up all the time. I’m the most stubborn person i know, I suck at the kitchen but I’m learning and I always nap. This girl wants to keep dating you because you’re my best friend. And where would I be without you.

97,"My best friend is pregnant from her previous relationship and she is going to be moving away for what will either be a year and a half, or worst case scenario for what might be forever. She says that she wants to come back but things can change in that amount of time.

Right now I feel so lost, and I don't know what to do. I have only known her for 6 months now but over that amount of time I came to become best friends with her and I found out that I loved her. At one point it seemed like she had similar feelings for me but after she got more into the pregnancy its like she has tried to distance her self from me. Recently she has opened herself back up more and its almost like how things were before but I know that it can all change anytime.

The thing is that she is going to be leaving this week and I don't know what I should do. She already knows how I feel about her. But since she is going to be so far away for so long I don't know if later on she will feel the same way about me still. It also doesn't help that where she is going to there is a 17 hour time difference from where I am at. I'm worried that she will meet some other guy while she is away or that she will end up going back into her previous relationship because I'm not the father.

How do I control my emotions after she leaves when its like all I seem to be able to think about is her?

All was good. We had a great time, laughed, and all that good stuff. 

But the past month he’s been distant. Normally he would invite me over to his place and that’s when the “benefits” part would happen or “friends” part. Recently, he hasn’t. (Btw I hate intruding and stuff so I never really “ask” to come over, and it’s out of the question. I’m just not that type of person. My place isn’t really the place for the things we may do so that doesn’t really work either)

So I was thinking that he might have found a girlfriend, but he hasn’t. We both had that understanding that if someone else comes into our life we would tell one another and stop the “benefits” part of our relationship. 

Then I started thinking about things I might have done, but nothing comes to mind. 

I assumed that he might not have enjoyed the “benefit” part of it, but after each time it would happen he didn’t seem like he wasn’t enjoying it. 

When I try to hint at it during the few times we text he just brushes it off.

Today it's the worst case ever, it has evolved to something that doesn't let me concentrate and be focused on anything..I repeat the same word more than 100 times a day and I say it like 4 times every couple minutes, when I step out of a carpet I always touch the corner, and when I hear a plane I always have to look at it (I live near an airport) and I try to say to myself not to do it but I just can't. if I don't do it, I feel like something really bad will happen. I also started placing shoes in a certain direction and I don't know how to stop it, I told it to my parents and they said that I just don't have to think about it..

Please, can somebody help me with this issue? I want to stop it already, it's getting really messy and annoying.",26Sep2018,1

121,"Hi reddit,

I'm born in Hong Kong and moved to Canada when I'm 11yo. During the time I'm living and studying in HK, I've made a lot of friends and childhood memories. However, I'm forced to move to Canada due to family issues. My friends and memories I made with them are very precious to me, so when I came to Canada I am very depressed. I have no way to contact them because social media was not as popular back then, and none of them have their own cellphones. I couldn't make any friends at all when I came to Canada because of my poor English skills. I don't even know how to response to people when they talk to me. So I started to kept quiet, my self-confidence begins to fade and now I couldn't even hold a conversation with people. I don't even remember how I used to talk to people when I'm in HK. I can't make eye contact with people, and I'm very awkward. So I begin to shut myself at home, skipping school, and just browse the internet or just gaming all day. I've lost interests in almost everything. And it's been like this for 6 years, I'm now starting to lose it. I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I'm very worthless. 

I tried talking with my parents about it but they don't understand what I am feeling. They just told me to try to ignore it and study hard, but I can't focus on studying when I'm under these conditions... I'm not a smart person as well, my grades are shit and I skipped a lot of school. I am afraid that I can't even graduate from high school. My parents are not bad persons and I don't blame them for not understanding. They take care of me a lot and that only makes me more depressed and feeling useless. I have a brother who's currently studying in university, this adds up as well. My family is what I have left and I love them more than anything... yet I can't do anything to make them happy... I want to become a successful person in the future, I don't want my family to worry about me. I've tried studying but it's not working. It took hours for me to understand things. I'm now suicidal and don't know what should I do in my life anymore. I'm very interested in computer science and it's the only thing I'm interested in since computer is the only thing I have when I moved to Canada but I don't know where to begin. There are no any computer courses at my current school. What should I do?

Thank you for reading. I'm sorry If my English is poor, I hope you can understand my feelings. It may not be accurate due to my poor English skills.

I was severely depressed in high school and that didn't exactly correlate to the best of grades, so getting into university was a struggle in itself. I've been out of high school for 2 years with a part time job as a valet, hanging out with the same friends and making zero progress whatsoever in leading a fulfilling life.

My high school friends just entered their 3rd year of university and have amazing new social groups, are learning and developing themselves so much more than I could dream of doing outside of school. I'm slowly becoming the ugly duckling and it makes me sick. My depression was numbed by not having any obligations in the open world but now that I've become disillusioned I feel the emptiness striking me harder than ever and I don't know how to cope.

How do I pick up the pieces of my life? I feel extremely dejected and if I keep falling behind everyone I know at this pace, I know I'll become suicidal again.

125,"I live on the bottom floor of our triplex and my neighbors upstairs smoke weed pretty frequently. I personally don’t care that they do, but it makes my entire studio apartment smell especially in the bathroom. Usually I don’t mind the smell because I just burn some candles, but there are times where even candles can’t mask the smell. 
She never answers the door when I knock. I’ve knocked two different times when I moved in to introduce myself, then two other different times when I had some questions regarding the apartment. She’s been home for all of those times but for some reason just doesn’t answer her door or even come out of her apartment. 

I used to smoke often, but stopped for personal reasons. Even when I did, the smell always made me a bit nauseous. I could care less what they do, I just wish they would blow out the window.

How can I resolve this without telling the landlord? If i report it then she would know it’s me and I’m not trying to cause any sort of problems. I don’t think she’s very fond of me because I lock the front door to the house when I get home from work (I get home late) and she often has friends come and go throughout the night who don’t have the key.

I am in a dilemma and could really use some advice. I am pretty torn and can't seem to decide. Here is the situation:

1. I am currently unemployed living in an expensive city with a pretty good job market. I have been unemployed for 6months. I am in the tech industry. 
2. I recently got a decent job offer, though I am not keen on the actual job. 
3. My lease is ending this weekend (by Oct 1.)
4. I am currently about 30k in debt.
5. 26 y.o. female 

My two options are: 

1. settling down: moving outside of the city to have a cheaper lifestyle, taking the job offer (though I am not keen on it and it would be a long commute), still keep applying for jobs so hopefully something better comes along, and perhaps getting a dog. Work on some side projects for additional income to help with debt. 
2. Moving to Mexico until the end of the year. I know some people who are currently living in Mexico in a very safe city. I would do some volunteer work there. Keep working on side projects to hopefully generate additional income for debt. Very cheap living so little expenses. 

Obviously #1 is the responsible thing to do. #2 seems like a good idea since I am unemployed at the moment, I dont know when I can take such a prolonged break and try something new. 

Any advice would be appreciated- about what you think, how I should go about making a decision, and your experiences.

135,"I [21 M] am a college student in my senior year studying computer science. I really love computer science (so much so that I tutor 5 hours a week for free) but have been having issues with my studies recently. 
For all of high-school I was a pretty decent student, but my high school was pretty low quality and I graduated with a 95% GPA, basically a 4.0 GPA, with little to no effort. I took AP and honors classes and got B’s here and there. I didn’t really put much effort into school and that translated to applying for college. I only applied to one reach school (made the university but not the program I wanted) applied to one safety school, and basically applied to one other school because I didn’t know what else to do. I eventually accepted at that third school and started in computer engineering but switched to computer science because I preferred programming to electrical engineering.
My first two years of college were basically high school 2.0. I had to put in a small amount of effort but I could pass all my classes with only minimal studying. Junior year was the first year that actually tested me. In the fall I took Calculus 3, two high level computer science courses, cryptography, and one or two gen eds. I feel like I responded to the pressure well. I was able to pass all my classes with 3.5’s or better and I was actually coming out a semester early in terms of progress because I had taken some college classes in high school. 
Unfortunately, good student me didn’t last in the spring. My courses weren’t as difficult and I wasn’t carrying as many credits, but I actually failed a class for the first time ever(Probability and Stats). I didn’t fail because the class was difficult, I failed because I basically didn’t do my homework or study for the tests. I basically lost all motivation. 
This semester is more difficult than the spring, as I am now working on my senior project, however, my motivation is shot, and on top of that I’m having trouble focusing on any of my studies. I basically do all my class work an hour before it’s due and I feel almost like I’m physically unable to put in any effort. I still really enjoy my classes, I just have a complete inability to focus and not procrastinate.
All through childhood I was a pretty rambunctious kid, but I was never a distraction in class. Now I can’t seem to help but try to crack jokes in class and can never pay attention all the way through. In fact I’m writing this at 2 a.m. instead of working on my senior project milestone which is due at 7 a.m.. As a kid I would always joke that I had ADHD but that it wasn’t bad enough that I couldn’t control it, but to be honest I never fully believed I was undiagnosed ADHD, since I breezed through school. I feel like my life is totally spinning out of control and I can’t seem to care, but I’m afraid of seeking help and basically being told that I’m just a shitty person.

TLDR
I was a good student all my life but now at the age of 21 I can’t focus or even care about my education, and I’m afraid of seeking help and being told that in fact there is nothing wrong with me, I’m just a shitty person.",26Sep2018,2

Me and my friend hang out with this girl nearly every day and shes incredibly flirty with mainly me but I'm not sure if shes interested in me or my friend or if he is really interested in her. 

Pretty much I \[19m\] have had this long time friend \[20f\] who has become increasingly flirty with me and my friend \[19m\] ever since I broke up with my ex-girlfriend. I have talked to her sister about how flirty she is but I'm not sure as to if I should take this as shes into me or if shes just messing around. She is also single but at times when we hang out one on one she jokingly calls me ""boyf"" or tells me and my friend how shes going to marry both of us eventually. She also likes to cuddle with me or my friend in which shes really touchy and feels my body and flaunts her butt. She's also mounted me like the cow girl position multiple times but never my friend, which I find pretty strange, like if im sleeping on the couch during a movie, or if im laying down. 

I went to Maine for about 4 months to fish and my friend and her didnt hang out all that much, maybe like once or twice every other week but as soon as I got back we started hanging everyday in which she'd call me and not my other friend to hang out. Sometimes she would hit my friend up to hang out but she mostly calls me since I've known her for a good 4 years.

Multiple times have I had friends mistaken us as a couple and we've even taken my younger brother out and about. She jokingly always says that we never take her out on dates but from what she says she has a ""mans"" which is some random guy from her college but always complains as if shes not really interested in him. She's even brought him up with me when we hang out alone and she acts like she not too interested in him. Shes also given hints like how she could never date somone thats more skinnier than her as I'm a little husky and my friend is pretty built but yet she likes to cuddle with me even when we're with her other friend. 

We even had a group party trip to a really rurual area and I got close with her friend and almost hooked up with her but she, the girl im confused about,  sent out my friend to stop us in which she then spent the majority of the night in my bed watching netflix

140,"So - when I was a kid my parents sucked. Mum's method of conflict resolution was to scream at the top of her lungs. Dad's method of conflict resolution was also to yell, behave intimidatingly and then offer no reasons as to why I was in trouble - just that I had done something wrong.   


Fast forward to adult version of me, nearing on thirty. I can't take criticism without trying to justify my self. Like if somebody has an issue with my behaviour, I am quick to point out that they also have done things A, B and C to frustrate me and I've let it slide instead of confronting them about it - and that they should give me the same benefit of the doubt that I gave to them. So when somebody has a problem with me I can't help but say something along the lines of 'these are the reasons why I did what I did, these are the reasons why I think you should not have a problem with my behaviour.'...

144,"I graduated about 10 years ago with a Bachelors degree in Film Production. I was naive in the sense that studying my passion will lead me down the path I needed to start a career. Working in the industry wasn’t what it was cracked up to be. The long hours with no pay and the cliques that form on set drove me nuts. I’m not a bar guy or a smoker and just wanted to do a good job and get noticed, but such things aren’t meant to be. 

Skip a few years and odd jobs later, I end up working at a hospital with decent pay and full benefits. One of the perks was tuition assistance, which made going back to school an easier step. Just needed to keep my grades above a “C” and they will cover the cost of classes. Tried going into Nursing, but Anatomy and Physiology kicked my ass. Plus they wanted me to go backwards in education and start on an associates degree, which to me seemed like a waste of my time. Did well in my Chemistry and thought about going further with it. 

Instead, I decided to go for my MBA and was accepted into a program for Business Intelligence and Data Analysis.  First roadblock came in my Macroeconomics class, where Calculus is being heavily used. Being an art major, I never had to take Calculus, only pre-Calculus. When the instructor started doing production functions and derivatives on the board an sense of dread came over me like a deer caught in the headlights. 

I feel I’m way in over my head. I tried YouTubing some Calculus videos that have helped me learn some essential things, but there’s no way I’m gonna learn graduate level calculus by the end of the semester. The first homework assignment that was given completely threw me for a loop. The amount of work I put into it was driven by absolute fear. I was able to complete some problems using examples and calculators found online. Honestly, the fact I was able to complete even 80% of the assignment still amazes me. 

Yet, I feel absolutely defeated in class. Don’t know how I’m gonna continue at this pace and it’s just the beginning. I scheduled an appointment to meet with the instructor today at 430pm and I’m dreading how to approach this topic.

I feel like a child, and the idea of me being 21 in January is jarring to say the least. I feel like I’m having some quarter-life crisis, although my life hasn’t been lacking. I’ve lived alone in several countries, travelled Europe and Central America alone and with friends/SOs, and been to university. I’ve had relationships, but I feel like I’m lacking in friendships. I have an irrational fear that people don’t like me (working on this) and I tend to not let friendships develop deeply because of this. I’ve heard the horror stories of how difficult it is to make and keep friends in your late twenties and thirties, and this fills me with immeasurable dread. I do not want to be lonely and friendless forever! I transferred universities recently and I’m having difficulty meeting friends as a junior, because I’m not in the underclassmen bubble where everyone is excited to meet new people. I’m sad to think that this is going to get worse and worse as the years go on. I also fear “adulting”, and I have absolutely no desire to be a wage slave for the rest of my life. It frightens and depresses me to the point where I’m actually considering becoming a cloistered nun (I’m Catholic). A life where I don’t have to worry about making friends and undergoing wage-based jobs to make ends meet sounds actually decent. 
The physical aging aspect is also terrifying. I use anti-aging creams because I’m convinced that in the next several years, I’m going to become an absolute crone, riddled with health issues. I realize this is vain, but not looking 19 anymore is scary. I don’t want to look old! 
It’s scary even saying my age. 20 already seems impossibly old, and 25 seems ancient. To think that I’ll have to call myself a thirtysomething in less than ten years gives me vertigo. 

I guess just want advice on how to come to terms with getting older. I’m up at 3 am having a crisis about this, so sorry if this seems ranty. Aging scares and depresses me, and despite having a pretty rough adolescence, I feel like I’ve recently gotten stuck in a weird rut of arrested development where the future seems damningly bleak. Hearing adults talk about how awful it is to have to work full-time and have mortgages and how lonely it is being an adult makes me sad and kind of hopeless. How can I get over this fear, and come to terms with the inevitable fact that I will be getting older for the rest of my life?

i’ve also hooked up with another “straight guy” all this time with no romance. i like penises in my mouth, but not in my butt. and i jerkoff to porn that doesn’t have vaginas bc they gross me out. so i know i’m not straight....but


i didn’t believe it  was a defense mechanism until i fell for a girl this summer and have that hope she’s into me BUT whenever she does something that makes me think she’s into me, or whenever i think it’s time to shoot my shot there’s a part of me that wants to just tell her i’m gay so we can still be friends after she rejects me. does that make sense? 

i picture myself walking on the beach with a girl tho.... but i could never imagine putting my penis into a vagina...ewww.

150,"Hey all. I've posted this on r/trees as well. Wanna get advice from both smokers and non smokers

So I've been dating this girl for 2 years now. I'm 18 in college and she is 17 in high school. My brother has recently introduced me to the wonderful world of weed and I have been smoking for about 6 months and less than twice a month. I dont like lying to my girlfriend about anything so I tell her everything. The first time I told her I had smoked weed she hated it but it seemed to not bother her after a while. I had thought she was warming up to the idea of marijuana. I was very wrong. The other day she told me it was ""the drugs or her"". I had tried to open her mind a little but she wont budge on the topic an inch. She said that she would break up with me even if I vaped. At all. Like not even water (if that's even a thing).

I dont know if its enough of a reason to break up with her over this. I dont smoke often Maybe once a month so it's not like it's a big part of my life. but it also makes me think of what else shes closed off on.

She is still in high school so maybe her opinions will change as she gets older but I doubt it. What do you think i should do?

I should also probably mention that her grandma died of cigarettes several years back as well and is a big reason why she is so against it all. I've also explained everything I know about drugs, moderation, harm reduction, ect

151,"Im so fucking fed up with school its ridiculous!!!! Ive been doing school non stop since pre-k and im currently a junior in university doing mechanical engineering. I say nonstop because right after highschool i jumped straight into college and have beem doing summer classes amd full semesters every since. 

Im burned the fuvk out. I dont wanna fucking do this anymore. The thought of doing any type of assignment or reading a chapter about literally anything makes me suicidal. 

Ive realized how short and blessed i am being alive and that all i need is already with me. My family amd friends. Going into college i was obsessed with the idea of becoming rich. But for the past few months ive realized momey aint shit. I just want to live my life to the fullest amd enjoy every day without being locked and dragged through school. I want to live, meet women, go on adventures, travel the world, and spend time with my parents. 

I know id be able to make it out there in the real world. I already have a couple of really good paying jobs i can go to that dont even meed a degree. I found them through friends and just networking with people.

Im not one to waste what i already invested tho. I have over 70 college credits so i would end up gping back eventually. The things holding me back is that i know my parents wouldnt like this idea. And secondly, i feel like i wouldnt be able to fully enjoy being free knowing at some point im going to have to go back. 

What should i do? I feel lost, going to school depressed as fuck everyday wanting to take the next plane out of here and explorw and have fun.",26Sep2018,1

153,"I'm a 19 y/o Male, my parents basically told me to get out of their lives when I turned 18. So i moved in with my grandma. My uncle also lives here but he's a 36 year old man who hasn't left the house since his last day of high school if I had to take a guess. My grandma never talks about him but ever since i could remember he has lived here and never leaves the house. He's scared to talk to people even his own family, basically a hardcore case of social anxiety. Which I assume is from being a massive loser and not talking to anyone but his parents for years. I've been here for a year and when I say he never leaves the house I'm not exaggerating, he literally hasn't left the property according to my grandma in like 14 years since he came back from an incident where he got sick and had to be taken to the doctor. He has never had a girlfriend, or a job, but I'm ranting too much I think ya'll get that he's very weird. Anyways he's given me creepy vibes my whole life but I'm only now realizing how much wierder he actually is. At nights he listens to some sort of radio show where depressed people talk about how their lives have gone downhill and I hear him in his room laughing. He listens to it often, he also thinks I dont notice but he constantly stares at me while I'm playing games on my PC in the kitchen. My sister lived here like 8 years ago when my parents kicked her out and he poured water on her laptop after 9 months because he was mad she was living with them. He also tore up a lot of her clothes and basically trashed all of her stuff. Of course he didn't pay for anything my grandparents had to, and it's not like they're rich. Hes been acting very passive aggressive towards me lately, my main worry is he'll kill me in my sleep. If he was acting ""normal"" I wouldn't suspect anything but I feel like very uncomfortable going to sleep some nights, especially because lately I've been thinking about how I dont want to die since my life is finally going in a good direction. Rn I'm getting hired with the city as a collector but it's going to take around 2 more months before I start, but the job will pay more than enough for me to live on my own. In the meantime I'm working for minimum wage with a temp agency. My original plan was to stay here for one more year so I could save enough to buy in cash whatever car I want, so I could have one less bill whenever I live on my own. Not sure if I should just trash that idea and move out once the city hires me or risk it and stay for the extra cash. I feel like I will be on the news one day where I was killed in my sleep, but not sure if I'm being rational or not.

Basically what I'm asking is if you were in my situation would you stay?

TLDR very weird uncle who lives with grandma and has nothing to lose gives me vibes he wants to kill me, not sure if I'm overreacting but I want to stay with grandma to save extra cash.  Wondering what others would do in a situation they feel uncomfortable in.",26Sep2018,1
154,"A few days ago I (19F) went to a party, got drunk and cozied up to a person (19M) who is a mutual friend of mine. We hung out a little before but as we both got drunk, we were affectionate with each other and such but didn’t have any sexual contact, just handholding and cuddling.

Today I hung out with him again (this time he and I were sober) and just was not feeling it. Our values don’t align well and I just feel that the feelings and affection only happened because of the alcohol. I plan on telling him, face to face what I’m feeling but how can I put it nicely that I’m no longer and suddenly not interested. We are in the same friend group and would like to be friends, but I just can’t see myself having an intimate relationship with him. Fearing that he might as why, I really don’t have a definitive reason why, it’s just that it doesn’t feel right to me.

155,"Long story short, I dropped out of a media college course last year due to having a bad breakup with my boyfriend and I just overall didn’t enjoy the course. 
This year, I decided to go to the only other college nearby which is an hour bus ride and an additional 30 min walk. I’m taking performing arts, drama and photography. 

My problem is, I’m not waking up on time (5am) to get up, get ready and catch the bus. I enjoy my subjects but I’m not really making friends and I’m already behind in my work. I feel as tho an apprenticeship close by would be more suited to me however, I can’t find any that would help me out in performing arts. The college I’m at provides a course to improve your acting, singing and dancing which is just what I need. However it’s just too far and I can’t see myself doing this for 2 years. 

I don’t have any friends either which is originally why I wanted to go to a college. However I’m just dreading every single day because I have to wake up and travel for an hour and a half. It’s taking up my whole life and I’m miserable. 

Should I drop out and try and find an apprenticeship? Even if the apprenticeship won’t help me in performing arts?

159,"Occasionally, bad memories run through my mind.

Today, it was a memory of me at my second job. I was only 20 at the time. I was a cocky asshole. I also had a big mouth. So other than saying things I shouldn't have about the school (I was working on campus, in an office environment)...I remember also responding to by 65 year old boss (frail, old lady) like an asshole.

Back then, I was all about work ethic (based on my experience from sports, but had little idea of what a long career was like...so I had my head up my ass). I remember my old boss talking about her being excited for retirement and I told her that I hope the week goes by slowly.

I. Can't. Fucking. Believe. I. Said. That. 

The whole office treated me differently until I graduated (not sure if it was that comment or my big mouth saying some other stupid thing). They never fired me though, so maybe that feeling of being treated was in my head?

It's been many years since (roughly 6). There's obviously nothing I can do. I've never stopped working since then and realize the struggle that goes on...I can't imagine what she had been through up until 65.

I've improved. I keep my mouth shut almost always and have a better understanding of not just careers, but people. I get along well my coworkers now at a different job. I don't say meaningless, harmful things to others.

Still, these bad memories creep back. How do you get over them?",26Sep2018,1

Just the other day i tried to join a conversation by throwing a joke in but one of the guys just gave me a ""you are fucking stupid"" look. then he said ""dude, just stop"" before returning to their conversation.
 I think the worst part about this was that i was completely dragged down by someone by them giving me the reality of the situation. And it was hard to accept, but deep down i agreed with them. I was fucking stupid and i did need to ""just stop"".

 No one seems to want to hang out with me even when i tell them ""hey man if you want to grab some food sometime let me know"" the last time i talked with anyone outside of work was months ago. I have no family, no friends, and honestly no reason to live. Ive abandoned my dreams and feel like a complete puddle of sadness. 

Right now my room mate has his GF over. I can hear them talking, having fun, etc.. through the wall. It scares me that i know deep deep down that i will never feel the spark that they share. My life has swallowed up my every hope of becoming a decent person.

164,"I was in a long term relationship which ended 1.5 years ago, partly because she was planning to move away for a year and partly because I was struggling at the time (as it now turns out with a quite deep lying depression) which made the last few months of our relationship quite tough. Despite this, we stayed relatively friendly and kept in touch quite consistently. She recently moved back from her time away, and having had some major life break throughs in the last year, I felt in a much better place to maybe rekindle things.

We met as friends and everything seemed as though she'd never left, and it really felt like something was going to happen between us in the near future. Flash forward a couple of weeks and in planning our next chance to meet up (I had been on holiday and she was getting ready to go to University so we decided to wait a bit before seeing each other again) it turns out that she now has a boyfriend and doesn't feel comfortable meeting up with her ex so soon into their relationship.

I really struggled with this information as I had built up in my head what our new relationship would be like and I really felt (and still feel) like she is the person I am meant to spend my life with. I generally don't believe in fate or destiny or anything like that, it is more that I can't see how I could find someone who would be a better match, as nobody I know has ever really come close.

In this situation, I felt like it was best to lay my cards on the table and tell her how I felt. As a movie fanatic, I'm sure you can imagine how I expected this to go, however sadly she instead told me that she is very happy with this guy and that, although we had something special, she's in a different place now so she doesn't feel the same.

This was crushing, and all that keeps running through my mind is the fear that, even if I do find someone else, I'll never be content knowing that maybe what me and her had could have been even better.

Sorry for the long paragraph, I haven't really posted on Reddit before but I am in a place right now where I feel like I need to know how others have coped with similar situations.

2nd time was for University once again and I chose to apply pretty far away. I returned home before I even became homesick because of family matters. However, before leaving I still was very nervous and probably upset that I was leaving even though I knew what I needed it.

Wednesday, September 26, 2018

In the past month or so, i’ve been thinking a lot about how my mind works, and how it works compared to others. This is due to the fact that in current life (homeschooled with no car and no means of transportation) i’m left with very little to do, and as a result very little to reflect on. This cycle continues in the sense that when i’m doing nothing I am thinking, but having few experiences to think about because i’ve been doing so little. Such has been life for the past 10 months (minus a trip to europe with only my sister in which I was in survival mode) This seems like a very negative experience, and one that many people describe when explaining their depression. Over the past months since i’ve began living like this, i’ve been waiting for the day when I become depressed. I expect it to happen, but I have no reference of what depression feels like, other then that other people have accounted for it being pretty bad. Whenever I am feeling sad (which is rare because so little happens that there is little to be sad about) I remind myself that this state is temporary, and beneficial to me in the sense that it gives me a chance to look inward and understand my own mind. My entire life I have been fed information, moved constantly, met new people, all the while learning that few things in life are permanent, and change is the natural order of things. I understand change, so the idea of laying in my bed staring at the ceiling isn’t one I dread. There is little point in dreading things I cannot change, and instead I should be focusing on the things I will change when I am able.

Because I have been subject to this state for a period of time, and because I have learned to completely let go of previous friends, and not try too hard to make new ones (because I know they will go eventually), I hold very little value in social interaction. This is partly because it is something that I know I can’t get much of in my current state, and partly because I’ve had so much in my life before this year. I have met so many people and engaged in so many social dynamics, only to find that in my room there is no one who reaches out to talk to me. This isn’t because they hold spite against me, but because they are simply experiencing new things in their life, and have no reason to talk to me. People forget people, as I have forgotten many in my life and as people should so as to keep focused on themselves. This is a concept I familiarized myself with in the darkest chapter of my life thus far, in which I moved away from the closest friends I had ever had, experienced a divorce which permanently seperated me from the man who raised me to be the person I am today, and was met with the heart failure of my biological father whom I had been avoiding contact with for the 4 years before he had passed. When met with all of these obstacles over the course of a year, my mind began to shut down. I developed a complete lack of emotion, and became “suicidal” in the sense that I didn’t care if I was alive or not. I had no wish to die, I simply didn’t care. I had come to accept that no one else was going to be giving me a reason to wake up in the morning, and this was something I had to find myself. This complete lack of emotion led me to not make any new friends in my new school, and I openly welcomed fights, because in my mind I didn’t care if I got beat up. My sense of self preservation had all but left me, and I began talking shit to anyone who was more “powerful” then I was. This meant larger kids, popular kids, and teachers. Anyone who I knew had some sort of authority over me. Because I felt so stripped of purpose, the arguments, and winning arguments, made me feel less weak. Unfortunately, this also led to people punching and pushing me, and oddly I had no desire to fight back. Why would I? I wasn’t angry at them, because I wasn’t capable of mustering enough emotion to be angry. Instead I would laugh, because In my mind I had won. I had used my words to cause people to act violently towards me, and it that sense I had gained control.

After this time of emotional distance from myself, and as I slowly began to cope with the obstacles I had faced, I began to transition into a state of mind in which I turned my numb state of depression into a state in which I removed myself from responsibility. This transition is when my life began to get a lot easier, because I started to realize how much other people cared about everyhing that was going on around them, particularly high school, and when I noticed how stressed and unhappy everyone else was, I realized that my lack of emotional investment was allowing me to completely avoid everything that was making their lives hard. I figured that I was smart enough, and that high school was going to do little for me in terms of education, so I was sleeping in class, making fun of teachers, and all around just trying to enjoy my experience, and not let anyone else’s drama affect me. While in practice, this mindset was not very different from the one I had in middle school, it was different in the sense that I had realized why I was doing the things I was doing, and how I could turn them into positive things in order to coast through life until I was able to work and go to college, where I would kick into gear and start trying.

This state carried me to the point where I decided that it would be best for me to do online school for the entirety of 2018, until I was able to kick things into gear in october when I turned 16 and could start working and driving (useful things when compared to high school). This brings me to present day, where I have less than a month before I am 16, and I am ready to begin my life. As of now I am still an unaccomplished dropout, but I have been quietly biding my time and planning for what I am going to do in the world.

One point of interest that has come into question is my “friendship?” with [girl]. Other than my friend [guy], who was my buddy in school and lives down the street from me, I have had little interaction with anyone outside of my household in the past 10 months since leaving school. I met [girl] at a Halloween party in 2014, and “met” is overselling it. I didn’t have any conversation with her, and I had little reason to think about her after meeting her once. This was when I was still fairly stable, so I was socially capable and still open to making friends, but I just didn’t interact with her very often because she wasn’t in any of my classes or my lunch. Something I know now that I didn’t know at the time, is that 7th grade [me] was attracting half of the hormonal girls in the school, and I was still a year behind (I had skipped 3rd grade) on the ole hormone thing at the time so I was not picking up on anything. I was like Hellen Keller. Because so many of the females had a thing for 7th grade [me], I eventually stumbled upon [girl 2]. I never talked to her, but I thought she was pretty and funny so I had a crush on her, bc that was how it worked. [girl 2] had a crush on me at the time so for the rest of that year we would text on kik messenger, because she was bad at talking and I was 12. 12 yr old [me] didn’t know that [girl] had a crush on him, and probably wouldn’t care, because he didn’t ever talk to her outside of large gatherings of mutual friends. At the end of that school year, I had moved into my Mom’s new boyfriend’s house (now husband which is where I live now) after divorcing the man who had been raising me for my entire life (my mom and biological dad had divorced shortly after I was born.) This move was very hard for me because over the course of my 7th grade year I had made the best friends I had ever had, despite [school name] middle school being my 5th school in 7 years. The move is what sent me into my downward spiral, which was then punctuated by the death of my biological father in 2016. Over the course of all the time that [girl] had known of my existence, and I had all but disappeared from her life (in which I played a very small role besides being her 7th grade crush for a short time.) But yet even with this detachment, and 4 years for both of us to completely change, she decided to begin talking to me over snapchat and arranged to see a movie with my friend [guy] and I. While being a small and seemingly normal gesture, this caught me off guard, because no one from [school], (including my close friends who I had close relationships with and had met their entire families) had talked to me at all consistently in over a year. Yet [girl] for some reason decided that she wanted to not only talk to me, but arrange to actually spend time with me and my friend who she didn’t know at all. This was more than any of my old friends had done, including the people who it sent me to a very dark place to be forced away from. Because of this, my relationship with [girl] and the way I think of her in my mind is very confusing. This is because she has been more accepting of me then almost any of my “friends” have been, yet I don’t know her. I haven’t had the chance to talk to her enough, and I have no idea what she thinks of me, or why she would ever want to spend time with me when everyone else in my life is distancing themselves from me. This is made more confusing by certain ideas she’s had, such as going to my high school dance at which neither of us would have any friends (and i would have quite a few enemies.) I only wish that I could talk to her more and maybe figure some of this out, but I don’t want to seem like I “care” too much about this seemingly meaningless friendship, so at the moment it feels like poker.",26Sep2018,0
171,"I'm 17 years old, I graduated high school early over the summer and I'm currently taking a gap year. I plan to start online at a local community college next year and then transfer to a four year afterwards. 

Transferring opens a lot of options regarding which school I can attend, a lot of the universities in my state have guaranteed admission contracts with my community college. I can choose to either stay at home by commuting to a near-by university or taking classes online through a different university, or I can live on campus and go to a university that has a lot more options I'm interested in pursuing. 

Here's where my issues are: I suffer from Schizoaffective disorder, which is basically Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder mashed into one, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. For me, Schizoaffective disorder gets worse with stress, and CFS causes me something called PEM which basically means that after a few consecutive days of generally normal school activity, my entire body just crashes making it very difficult to function by the time I get home from school. I'm also not receiving any psychiatric treatment for my Schizoaffective disorder because my mom doesn't trust/approve of the medication and my dad isn't very supportive of my mental health issues. Despite this, I'd actually be considered pretty high functioning in relation to the disorders I have. 

There's a lot of risk into going to a college where I'd have to live on campus because I'm not sure whether I'll be able to handle it either physically and/or mentally, but I'd also really prefer to get away from home, since I'd really like some independence and because, while my family isn't horrible or abusive, they're really hard to live with and it ends up taking a toll on my mental health.

173,"What started out as the ""love of a lifetime"" is a neverending nightmare. A little background: ex arested for arrempted strangulation, convicted of felony battery, with my (then) 5 year old daughter involved, and she was mildly injured. 

We divorce. My parents have the locks all changed. He breaks in within a week, destroying every new lock/doorknob. He has his friends follow me, take my photo, some walk up to me to call me a bitch/slut/whore. 
He makes sure I am unable to stay in the house. (Refuses to sign quitclaim, etc). Constant conflict despite a CPO and supervised visitation. I get a job, move hours away, but he still gets kids two weekends a month, and during summers. He messes with the kids' heads at every opportunity. For instance, their first summer away, he sends them to a bible camp for a week. Despite never going to church once the whole time we are together, he gives them crosses, new bibles and just before they get out of the car to come with me for the new school year, he tells them that mommy doesn't believe in Jesus, and that she's going to hell. So much crying. What should have been a happy reunion for the kids, was instead a traumatic experience. Change the scenario, then rinse and repeat, for years. I cheated on him for years, even while I was pregnant he tells them. (Yeah, guess who actually did that?) He hand delivers my father a personal letter detailing my supposed sexual exploits, some in the same day, one after my grandfather's funeral. He tells everyone that I was drunk most of my pregnancies, drive drunk, leave babies home alone, and on and on. Our marriage counselor told me he thought my former spouse was a sociopath. When we meet to exchange kids, he calls the cops insisting that I vandalized his vehicle. There plenty of were witnesses to the contrary. Seven years after the divorce was final, and I am still getting harassed. But, reddit, I screwed up. Two years ago, I wasnt able to get a hold of my kids. Days and days go by. I finally cant take it anymore and make the hourslong drive to his house. My son answers, lets me in, and I wait in the foyer. After about 10 minutes, his gf comes into the living room, demanding to know why I was there. (The ex is at work, and I dont have a custody agreement with the girlfriend.)  I explain, tell her I am going to take the kids for a bit. She says, well, did you ask MY permission? 
My inner momma bear wanted to clock her, but I just said Im taking my kids. I start rounding them up, sending them to the car, and SHE GRABS MY ARM, she's on the phone to someone, telling them I kidnapped the kids. My OWN kids. I leave, call their dad, leave him a voicemail explaining, and tell him I will bring them back later. An hour later, after talking to police on the phone, I let him know Ill bring kids home the next morning. I even send an apology text to the both if them. I repeatedly decline to issue a statement to police, thinking it would anger the ex. They called and bugged me about it several times. (I know, supreme stupidity. Fear of ex became a theme that led me to make stupid, stupid mistakes, like not pressing charges,  or not reporting abuse.) So yeah, you could say I fucked up to the nth degreenof fuckupitude. 
And that, is how, a few months later right after dropping my kids off to their dad, I was arrested for kidnapping. It was reduced to misdeameanor disturbing the peace, and tresspassing. I have PTSD, so I let the lawyer handle the court thing. In the meantime, the ex and the gf get married, and even though he never gave a damn before, he filed for SOLE custody. 
My health hasnt been great, but going from being a semi successful professional/single mom to being arrested, on probation and the EXTREME stress of seeing my kids suffer because of choices I made.  They did nithing to deserve any of this, but they are the ones who suffer. Plus, now my health isnt great. I was laid off, and between my anxiety, PTSD, and migraines, and taking care of my kids (my son has special needs, but the story for that is that I am making it all up for attention)...I do not want to give up or give in... but right now, it feels so hopeless. I am a mess. Ive never had any kind of issue like this in the previous decades of my life, but I am suddenly sick all the time. Over time, everything I own is mysteriously broken, dressers, table, my son's brand new bed. Locks are useless. My kids say their dad has been in our house, breaking stuff, that my stuff is hidden in his wife's office. I start getting crazy rashes. My hair falls out in clumps. I sob at the drs office because they have that, well, she's crazy look. All my kids baby photos come up missing. My email/social media accounts get hacked. I go to wash my hair, and there are worms in the shampoo. At first, I tried to tell people the garbage that is hapoening, but they seem incredulous, so I stopped. It sounds CRAZY.  Ive called the cops a couple of times, only to have my kids tell the cops that they don't know what I am talking about, that nothing has been broken. I know who I am, what kind of a mom I am...not a perfect one, but a good one. There is no too deep  depth, or too far edge to the love I feel for my kids. I try not to let any of this show that it's getting to me, try to be stoic, but I feel as though I am suffocating. Pull stupid pranks, steal my stuff, smear my name...all if that is meaningless, but the kid? They are being hurt and damaged and some of that is on me. I cant lose them, but I am going to. My lawyer filed a request to quit the case because ""our relationship had deteriorated"". Yeah, my broke ass tried to save money by emailing instead of calling, and that account got hacked and viola... it looks like I just haven't bothered to respond to document requests, etc. I had to borrow money for the last retainer, and I am not ina position to hire a new lawyer for trial inless than a month.
I am a fighter, but I... can't see any light. Reddit, please say you brilliant folks have a few ideas to help a sister out. Thank you for hearing me out... it helps to not feel so alone. 

TL;DR ex is trying to get sole custody of my kids. He sucks, but more importantly I need to keep them safe.

For context I'm 24yo working professional sharing the house with two friends who I work/have worked with.

We work a variety of day and night shifts, and have never made any fuss about us sleeping during the day, we understand that it's a family housing area, kids are noisey, we've never made a fuss.

However, our neighbors on the left of us are just god awful. They consistently text our landlord really passive aggressively, complaining about our back garden not being trimmed to perfection as it affects their view from their window?

There were some cigarette butts outside our front door, and I mean that, literally outside our house, and they came in brushed them right up to the porch and messaged our landlord to say it was unacceptable because they're 5yo child was outside eating them? Hello, how exactly is your child coming onto my property and eating my rubbish my fault?

And the dog. My word. It's basically animal abuse, I've never seen it walked once while I've been living there. It's left unattended in a muzzle out in the estate for huge portions of the day. It has been outside my front door barking at 2am, 6am, all hours of the night, and just barks all goddamn day and they've repeatedly ignored me very politely asking if they could walk it to calm it down a bit, and then continue to complain to my landlord about literally nothing.

Mutual breakdowns and self harm in front of the other person and stuff like that. I thought I was insane but also that I was the only person who could help them and them me. We knew each other when we were kids and grew up in neighbouring towns and basically there was this whole like fantasy narrative around us being together forever/soul mates etc. tied in with them cheating and lying then opening up our relationship and us just constantly being angry. I finally broke it off when I realized that they were pressuring me into sex.

I avoided them but stayed civil as they are in my friend group, I went to therapy, I shared with my friends, just tried to be happier. 

Last year my best friend started a romantic relationship with that ex, and they have been together ever since. I stopped talking to her (they both live somewhere else) because the whole thing was unbearably confusing and painful to me. I don't mind friends dating exes! But this one was so hard. I warned her to be careful and I haven't spoken to her in like a year. She was the person I would think of when I felt like the world was closing in.

Thankfully I do have one close relationship left now and I am surviving, but I still cry about this probably twice a week. I saw a post she posted if him which declares her love and lists all of the things they have done together. Stuff like that just ruins me. These are both people I love(d) so much and they both let me down so badly and now they are enjoying their lives together without me in it and I'm here crying over two people that have hurt me the most over a year later.

I don't know if i should try and be friends with them or just decide never to talk to them again but right now whenever I think about them I just feel overwhelming self doubt.

184,"Hi, so to begin I dropped out of Universtity in November 2016 a few months after starting a Maths degree. I withdrew due to mental health problems, primarily anxiety that was preventing me from enjoying my time there and getting the most out of my experience there. I found a job in February 2017 and attended a few sessions of CBT therapy, but it wasn't in their budget to continue with further sessions. 

I reapplied and found my way onto a sponsored degree course at the same University for a different subject. I am being paid a salary and the company is paying my loans for me.

Although I felt like I had grown as a person over the last two years, having worked full time and experienced a bit more of life before returning I amm still feeling the exact same anxiousness and depressions almost immediately after returning where I am barely leaving my room and not experiencing University much at all so far.

I was just wondering if it would still be best for me to continue on this course I am currently on, or change my path to something that may benefit me more. If you need me to expand on anything please let me know in case I have skimmed over any details. Thank you for all the help!",26Sep2018,1

193,"I’m a single man and my best friend is a recently married women in her late 20’s. She has no time for me anymore and it’s just been breaking my heart. I have terrible relationships with most of my family and the family members I’ve gotten along with has died. This female friend is really my only friend and she is the only person I can talk to about anything with. She is the nicest person. I consider her my sister and we used to have the most amazing fun times together. Joe she’s too busy to text back.

I live alone. I’ve been  attending meetup groups but have yet to meet a friend like her. Then this summer I thought I could make a friend with this one girl, Heather at the place where I sell my plasma for money. Heather was a screener and she was a very extroverted nerd but lots of energy and a big heart. (Just like my best friend besides the nerd part) Everyone loved her. I was making small talk all summer. Then suddenly last Tuesday night after not seeing her for a couple weeks I find out she was fired. One employee said “she made a mistake” . None of the employees would tell me the reason but I assume it had to do with something scandalous by the way they want to change the subject. It just really hurts so much. It took me 5 years to find another girl like my best friend and she’s gone. I didn’t get to the point where we exchanged social media. It was just the small talk phase. 

Now reason I want female friends so bad is because i can’t talk about feelings with male friends. I’m not looking for sex or relationships. No I’m not gay.

199,"Lets start with some background info... I'm male, mid twenties and currently in college. Parents are super religious and I try hard to be as well. Had a few girlfriends so far but nothing serious. Now here comes the fuck-up...

A few weeks ago I went to visit relatives who live on the other side of the state. It's really far away. We arrived, unpacked, etc... Later that night my aunt went to visit a friend of hers and made me come with because she can't drive and my dad and uncle went out somewhere. We arrived and I greeted them... pretty chill so far. 

The couple had a son around my age and he was pretty cool and invited me to play some video games with him in his room. He was playing a certain game that I also played alot back home and thats when I noticed his username... Its the same person that I regularely play with online... I was like wtf dude you're Bulldog101 !!! (Not his actual username) He's like yeah what about it and I tell him mine... His eyes widen and he's like ""Thats you?!? Wtf bro thats insane !"" I knew he lived in the same state but thats about it. Never thought we'd meet.

Anyway we played a couple of hours and then he invited me to hang out at a local club and we had some beers and he beat me in pool a few times... it was pretty fun honestly.

For the rest of the trip we hung out almost every day... and the more we hung out, the cooler this guy got. He's into all the stuff i'm into... We like to play the same games, watch the same kinds of movies, both of us hate sports lol and he even likes the same anime as me... At one point I joked that he'd be my perfect match if only he was a girl...

Later on I found myself staring at him... alot. At one time he caught me staring and just laughed it off. At this point I knew something was wrong... Am I falling for this guy? Not possible. I'm straight. WTF is wrong with me!?. All these questions ran through my mind. 

Finally the day came when we had to go back home. We said our goodbyes and off I went. ""It's finally over"" I think to myself. Now I can get back to my normal life and this 'crush' or whatever I was feeling will go away. Damn was I wrong.

It's been about 2 weeks now and whenever I sit still and let my mind wander this guy pops up. It's gotten to the point where I think about his face all the time and replaying all the conversations we had in my head.

This isn't right. At night I pray about what to do and I pray that God will help me forget about him. Just to be clear: This is the first time I've felt like this about another guy. I am against homosexuality. At one point I prayed and cried and begged for help for hours on end but so far I haven't gotten an answer.

I don't want to go to hell but at the same time I can't/ don't want to forget about him. I don't know what to do and it's driving me insane. When I think back at how the two of us sat alone in the dark just talking and that he was sitting so close to me and we looked at each other in the eyes when we talked...those brown eyes staring back at me... fuck.

I honestly don't know what to do and i'm trying to forget about him by staying busy and fooling around with girls but even when I'm with this girl that I really like, it just doesn't feel the same... It's like something is missing. I don't even know if he likes me or not. One part of me wants him to like me but the other part wants to forget about him. Was he just messing around when he picked me up and swung me around after I insulted his favorite rapper or was it more than that. When he wanted me to stay at his place overnight to play video games, why did i decline? Why was I so stupid? Did he really just want to play games with a friend or was it more than that. Oh how I regret it.

I haven't played with him online since then because i'm scared of falling for him even more. I honestly can't take it. Even while writing this it feels like I want to cry because I love God so much and want to obey his rules but it hurts so much that i'm scared that I'll break. I'd give anything for an answer but the way I see it there are only two choices: Forget about him (this is kinda impossible given the fact that i've tried but it only makes it worse) or to confess to him and try to make things work(also impossible given that I can't live without God in my life and i'm scared of chasing the guy away since I dont know if he likes me as well)

203,"I'm  not professional footballer(I had not been training for 6 years, but in  this past time I played it actively - mostly futsal - almost every  evening and also afternoons and feels like I learn a lot in this time),  but I love to play football and want to put out the best in me to the  field.

Back to June, when it was the last  time I had played it in group with friends and afterwards I began  summer holidays. I had spent most of the days in this holidays at least  kicking ball into wall to simulate passes, joggling, training tricks and  so on... In the last month (mid August - September) I had noticed I  somehow started losing everything... or at least it feels so... I have  feeling I'm unable to control the ball in-air as in past(like I don't  have that 100% control of the ball), and also passes (air passes)  started becoming inaccurate, mostly on balls which should be easily  passed to somebody.

Now there's also  other thing. I had also started playing in Sunday league and this is  where I noticed I feel really uncomfortable with ball - only  occasionally I relax and make good passes or dribbles, but otherwise  most passes are made out of panic. I also tend to get tired in just few  runs. I'm good at sprints, which I actively use in game, but what feels  unnatural is that I get tired a lot sooner than when I had played  football with friends(I make for example 3 runs and start breathing  heavily and getting pain in legs - which later causes me to be unable to  explode and run).

These both things  might be mind related, but I don't really know what I should do. I  pickup ball very often to either juggle/pass in wall/shoot at goals on  playground, I try to concentrate on ball or play with instinct, either  way it feels like I'm losing something. 

What shall I do?

\*Edit  1: Another thing is, that till now, playing futsal with friends was  easily achivable, since we had turnhall really close and could play it  whenever we wanted.

206," Hey hey hey, first timer here okay. Be easy on me. Male, 23 Years old.

So this is how my first time goes. I was with my girl, never had sex before tho she is not a virgin. Things got to the next level and i was NOT EXPECTING SEX AT ALL

Should've had a condom with me. I was having sex with her, not too deep though, with her standing against the wall. As i came, i dragged my penis out and came all over like a maniac LMAO. So the thing that I'm afraid of, is that i told her you don't need to worry since i came outside (which i did) But i guess the first blow (that contraction which releases the semen) might have gotten inside her. I've talked to many people they say that you don't need to worry much since she cannot get pregnant because

1. I practically gave her 10% of my semen (maybe even less)
2. I was standing so that is not the ideal position for conception
3. I dragged it out immediately so even if i did cum, it didn't go too deep
4. Speaking of deep, i didnt go deep either
5. She checked herself to see whether i came and she said she didn't see any cum when checking with the finger

So what are my chances? The only thing that's bothering me is that she was on her 15th day of the Cycle (the fertile period). Should i be concerned? I'm scared if i tell her that, she won't ever have sex with me since she isn't my girlfriend or anything. Knowing I have ""ZERO GAME"" lol. (Which is true actually lol )

While we were both pretty drunk, she confessed her (new) boyfriend was being (phisically) abusive and she didn't want to hang out with me because she was afraid to open up to anyone about her situation. On top of that, she is depressed and stopped going to therapy and taking her meds because he doesn't want her to. 

I immediately told her to get out of this relationship and go back to therapy (and repeated it the next morning when we were sober again). She keeps saying she loves him, but also that she is scared of what he would do if she broke up with him. I told her she can count on me if she needs help, but I don't think she wants to reach out. 

She is back to not replying to me and I can’t think of any other way to meet up with her. I’d hate to just leave it like this when she told me so much. 

Is there anything I could do to help her? What can I tell her to make her want to meet up with me?

I'm located in Eastern/Middle Europe so keep that in mind when recommending institutions/options for help.

TL;DR How can I help a friend, who is in an abusive relationship?

209," Hey there... I have a problem were I didn't said what I really thought. I've been talking to this girl over a year know. We always had our way of thinking, had some similarities and some things that were different. There was a point where I started to like her and, because of that, we started dating. We didn't go out many times, but we always had great conversations and had physical contact with each other, glanced at each other and all sort of those things. The thing is that we never kissed, I had lots of changes to do that, but I never done it, and I don't know why... I trust her allot, but in August we started to had some kind of confrontations, we had many discussions and some of those, to me, there wasn't a particular reason to it... It got to a point where we had to talk about the things that weren't alright, Wich was yesterday. To me, it was looking like she wasn't making a point, and was kinda overreacting, but yesterday we talked about it and it seems that I was hurting her in some ways, which I didn't really had a clue that was going on... I felt terrible, and we got to a point where she needed to know what we were, in a relationship or just friends, this is were I was stupid, I said I preferred the friendship because I was afraid of losing her. I didn't said what I really said because I felt that I wasn't able to give her what she needed... I never wanted to hurt her, it wasn't what I wanted, I just wanted to give her the best, but I only made her suffer because of not defining what we really wanted in the beginning... I feel awful... I said that to her, that I wasn't sure that I would made her happy and she understanded that. Still, she said that we could still be friends, but I think that I lost her... I need help, I don't know what to do... I really like her, and I should've said the truth... ",26Sep2018,1
210,"Not me, but my SO.

The first situation was her Godfather that passed away. There's a savings account with my SOs name on it with a decent amount of money in there that was left FOR HER, that the bank won't release to her because we don't have a death certificate. We don't know how to get it, because she is estranged from that side of her family. She got something from the state that says that the guy is dead , but it's not an actual death certificate so they will not release the savings account to her even though her name is on it.

&amp;#x200B;

The second situation is that her mother passed away in June. In her will, she left everything behind to her, but in the will, it has her name that she goes by and not the name that's on her drivers license, so that bank will not release the checking account to her. We brought the death certificate, things with both of their names on it, but because the will has her nickname (just a shortened name..Like if your name was Victoria and it said Vicki or something), they won't give her the account. We have SO much proof that it's her mother and that she's supposed to have it, but they're hanging onto that one detail and won't budge.

214,"So my girlfriend of 1 year and 4 months broke up with me about 4 weeks ago. School had just started, and she lost feelings over the summer because we never got the chance to hang out, and we didn’t text much. She has always had problems with depression, her family, and her body. She had kidney stones in 8th grade, and she may not be able to have children. She has been more stressed then ever these past weeks, because she’s been consistently staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning doing homework, and has developed an addiction to coffee. In a group chat we are both in, she has stated that she was considering suicide because she has a c in physics, and that she her hands shake uncontrollably, and she has eye twitches. Her parents are making her go to the gym twice a week on top of this, and her dad has called her a “fat slut” before. A week ago I told her that I didn’t want to talk to her for awhile, not to punish her, just that I wanted to work on myself. I still have feeling for her, want to her back with her and help her. She doesn’t want to be with me. I want to talk to her about how she’s doing, but I just told her I wasn’t gonna talk to her for awhile. I don’t know what to do. Should I talk to a counselor?

215," 

Lets start with some background info... I'm male, mid twenties and currently in college. Parents are super religious and I try hard to be as well. Had a few girlfriends so far but nothing serious. Now here comes the fuck-up...

A few weeks ago I went to visit relatives who live on the other side of the state. It's really far away. We arrived, unpacked, etc... Later that night my aunt went to visit a friend of hers and made me come with because she can't drive and my dad and uncle went out somewhere. We arrived and I greeted them... pretty chill so far.

The couple had a son around my age and he was pretty cool and invited me to play some video games with him in his room. He was playing a certain game that I also played a lot back home and that's when I noticed his username... Its the same person that I regularly play with online... I was like wtf dude you're Bulldog101 !!! (Not his actual username) He's like yeah what about it and I tell him mine... His eyes widen and he's like ""That's you?!? Wtf bro that's insane !"" I knew he lived in the same state but thats about it. Never thought we'd meet.

Anyway we played a couple of hours and then he invited me to hang out at a local club and we had some beers and he beat me in pool a few times... it was pretty fun honestly.

For the rest of the trip we hung out almost every day... and the more we hung out, the cooler this guy got. He's into all the stuff i'm into... We like to play the same games, watch the same kinds of movies, both of us hate sports lol and he even likes the same anime as me... Even our birthdays are on the same day believe it or not. At one point I joked that he'd be my perfect match if only he was a girl...

Later on I found myself staring at him... a lot. At one time he caught me staring and just laughed it off. At this point I knew something was wrong... Am I falling for this guy? Not possible. I'm straight. WTF is wrong with me!?. All these questions ran through my mind.

Finally the day came when we had to go back home. We said our goodbyes and off I went. ""It's finally over"" I think to myself. Now I can get back to my normal life and this 'crush' or whatever I was feeling will go away. Damn was I wrong.

It's been about 2 weeks now and whenever I sit still and let my mind wander this guy pops up. It's gotten to the point where I think about his face all the time and replaying all the conversations we had in my head.

This isn't right. At night I pray about what to do and I pray that God will help me forget about him. Just to be clear: This is the first time I've felt like this about another guy. I am against homosexuality. At one point I prayed and cried and begged for help for hours on end but so far I haven't gotten an answer.

I don't want to go to hell but at the same time I can't/ don't want to forget about him. I don't know what to do and it's driving me insane. When I think back at how the two of us sat alone in the dark just talking and that he was sitting so close to me and we looked at each other in the eyes when we talked...those brown eyes staring back at me... fuck.

I honestly don't know what to do and i'm trying to forget about him by staying busy and fooling around with girls but even when I'm with this girl that I really like, it just doesn't feel the same... It's like something is missing. I don't even know if he likes me or not. One part of me wants him to like me but the other part wants to forget about him. Was he just messing around when he picked me up and swung me around after I insulted his favorite rapper or was it more than that. When he wanted me to stay at his place overnight to play video games, why did i decline? Why was I so stupid? Did he really just want to play games with a friend or was it more than that. Oh how I regret it.

I haven't played with him online since then because i'm scared of falling for him even more. I honestly can't take it. Even while writing this it feels like I want to cry because I love God so much and want to obey his rules but it hurts so much that i'm scared that I'll break. I'd give anything for an answer but the way I see it there are only two choices: Forget about him (this is kinda impossible given the fact that I've tried but it only makes it worse) or to confess to him and try to make things work(also impossible given that I can't live without God in my life and i'm scared of chasing the guy away since I don't know if he likes me as well)

Over the past year and a half, I’ve watched his life slowly deteriorate. He lost his job and he’s now on disability, and he’s not motivated to get his life back because it’s “easy” to be on disability. 

The last time I visited him, his house was a wreck because he was trying to “organize,” he was drunk at 11am, he had spend about $2000 on movies the night before, and he had hand puppets hung over all the lamps in the house because, he said, “they protect the microphones.” 

I keep telling him that he needs to get help, but he ignores me. He lives with his ex-girlfriend, but she’s mostly just not present from what I can tell, and it doesn’t seem like she cares.

220,"And all of this is in highschool so I feel, in some ways, that it's not as serious as I make it out to be. Yet it is dead serious to me apparently.

For starters, there is this girl I really really like. We got to know each other a few weeks ago when school started. We're in the same class. Over the weeks we've known each other I developed more feelings for her. Way more. It came to a point where I felt like I needed to share them with her. That was this Friday. I didn't do it in person since we never meet (she's ""busy"" all the time. I know why now.) and she kindly made clear that she isn't interested in me. All good, I can handle it, I thought. Ending the conversation in a peaceful and respectful manner.

Next thing I know is me sitting in my bed, crying atleast twice a day. I thought I meant SOMETHING to her.

Now I can't concentrate on school. I don't have motivation for my hobbies. Im almost obsessively  jealous over her friends talking to her everyday (idk I guess im weird) and im constantly listening to sad music (stuff like eminem - rock bottom etc.). Instead of pushing myself up, im dragging myself down even more. I can't help it.

Every little cool thing is later negated by me thinking about her again.

Am I depressed? How can I stop my obsession over this girl? I just feel like she is THE one. 

She's not exactly sporty, just like me. She loves the english language more than her own, just like me. She's beautiful, funny and spontaneous. She just doesn't have interest in me. And it makes me feel sick.

221,"I'm 19, my whole life I had emotional pain, I'm to the point where I want to just drown myself with drugs. As a kid, my mom hit me For everything and put boyfriends over me. My grandma was there for me, but ever since I got in my teenage years everybody started treating me like shit. Don't know why.

I hit 17 and my grandma didn't want hugs from me anymore, criticised me, said Imma be a drop out (I graduated and I always worked hard in school), she said I was stupid and I can go on and on.

My mom apologized for everything, I forgave, then she did the same as my grandma. When I was jobless she said I'm lazy and all that when she knew I was struggling to get a job and disowned me and kicked me out.

My father disowned me at 14 just because I moved back to my mom's after living a year with him. And got back in my life at 16. He didn't let me see my baby sister. So that hurt a lot.

My baby sis that lives with my mom loves me, so I got no probs with her.

But my whole life consisted of being bullied, talked down to, disowned, kicked out, beat, ignored, and verbally abused every single day. I cannot remember the last congrats I got.

Now I'm 19, and it's all caught up to me, I've managed to get an apartment and a decent job. I've changed my number and cut off my family. Excluding my sister. 

She tells me my mom misses me and is sorry about the past, but that's not even why I stopped talking to her. She disowned me and kicked me out when I was jobless just because I slept alot....idk how that makes sense. But I almost slept on the streets, but my grandma let me stay at her home, but every single day she's yell at me and talk shit.

Now my dad's trying to be more involved in my life, and wants me to get to know his family, but I don't feel comfortable, and I don't have love for him like how I did when I was a kid. He says he loves me and encourages me to go to college and tries to motivate me.

But ever since he disowned me and didn't let me see my other sister, and said he didn't love me anymore when I was 14. It's just not the same anymore.

19 and I abuse a non addictive drug, but I'm mentally addicted to it and it gets me fucked up. I feel dead when I'm super high and feel at peace.

But now I'm tearing from time to time and I'm starting to get more depressed than what I was before. Having suicidal thoughts, anger, sadness, anxiety, tiredness.

I had to vent, but I don't have enough for a therapist, I don't believe in God, so no chruch; don't have a doctor cuz I only have enough for bills, food, car, my drug. But starting my second job soon.

I'm on my way to abusing alcohol as well.

Its hard to build a new life when all I know is people attacking me, and I feel alone. I have a great girlfriend but I'm not going to put my stress on her, nor do I even wanna talk about it with her. And I cheated on her like 3 times, because I was insecure and love being desired, but I stopped, because I realized I was being selfish and insecure.

My family has depression and I have depression and mood swings. One day I'm confident and charismatic and another day I'm antisocial. But lately I've just been a wreck.

Ever since she came out as bisexual last week she’s been acting really weird.

I like this boy and my friends were trying to help me “get” him. They wanted to start the “plan” today, this means they wanted to try to get us alone together so he and I could talk. 

Since I didn’t want to talk to him, to get he and I alone together so we could talk, Sophie and my other friend had to convince me to go. I’m not a very easy person to persuade so they just dragged me there. Sophie has a really really strong grip so she was gripping my wrists really tightly *I still have the red marks from her* I really didn’t want to go to him, so I was trying o weasel my way out of her grip. I was also telling them to stop but they just wouldn’t, it was really strange. 

Sophie has also been really distant from me. 
When this whole boy extravaganza happened it looked like Sophie was enjoying hurting me. She just wouldn’t let go of me when she was holding my wrists. 

Anyway, I’m writing this asking for help. I honestly don’t know what to do.
I have some theories on what is going on, my main one is that she could be possessed. Sophie is quite fit or whatever but her grip was so strong. When she was gripping my wrists I kept telling her to let go but she had no empathy. I honestly think something more twisted is going on.

In that time I had made a considerable effort to move on with my life, but have been unable to so do so. Definitely not for a lack of trying. It's just that losing her, my home, and my direction in life been tough on me to say the least. 


The divorce was finalized a couple of months ago but not long after things got worse for me and I had to move back home. Before leaving, I was at a party with a mutual person we both knew that said they had slept together before we separated. I got upset and let her know hiw disrespectful and shitty I thought it was. I should mention I was very, very drunk at the time. 


This was about a month ago. She had responded saying that it was false and that it was all a lie. I didnt know what to think at the time because I did have my suspitions and she is an extremely flirtatious person in general. But since then, I have reason to believe the person was in fact lying for the intent to hurt me. 

I feel I should have given her the benefit of the doubt and also not lashed out in the way I did. I want to reach out and apologize for being a shitty person because I feel so guilty about it. But I also dont want to be a further bother and think it might just be best to not reach out at all.

I was living at a house for awhile that was good and took me to see a therapist which was a great help and helped me work through a but until I was very calm. In high school I got kicked out for throwing a desk at a teacher (one thing that lead to therapy) found mediation and help and it got to the point where a few years after that (made all new friends) but everyone always tells me you're always so calm and relaxed, how are you always so zen? Stuff like that. I had really cooled down a lot thankfully. 

In 9th grade I started smoking weed and at first it was just a fun thing to do with friends while we skated around on the weekends and such. I started to use it more and more until it was daily. If I was upset about something or just felt sad I used it as a medication of sort. I had anti-depressant meds but always hated how it made me just feel dead instead of anything. Throughout the years I used it as my only medication and psilocybein (spell check) but after my time with therapy I felt I was good and it was just already such a daily thing already I didn't see a point/nor did I want to stop. 

Fast forward a few years to now and I just have such an uncontrollable rage build up. Mainly in the mornings before a cup of coffee and a dab but it carries on a bit after. And sometimes comes back during the day. I hate it though and I don't know what to do. I'm not really in a position to be able to afford having/going to a doctor or taking meds. Much less able to get a therapist. But I want to be able to fix or control it. Just the smallest things set me off or if something isn't just right in the spot it's supposed to be in. I'll get so mad it's hard to do some things or my hand will slip on the door when I go to open it and I get insanely mad at myself over not being able to do something so simple and I can feel it turn on others at times. I work at a rental place in a park so I see a lot of people and I can usually keep it together pretty well during the day. But man I would hate to lose it one day.

We had planned a trip out to Laughlin and I ended up getting tired on the way so I let her drive. Although the drive up she wanted to listen to “her” music in her Bluetooth. Idk what happened because I was sleeping, but she hit a coyote on our way up. She offered to fix it but I ended up taking care of it. From that point, me not having a car, she started acting funny. Started mentioning she has the dick in our relationship because she makes more money. Almost like she forgot what she did to my car... anyways she broke up w me because I face timed her. She said I don’t trust her. When later this day she said her hair was going to be done so I wanted to see. (Maybe we don’t need to FaceTime daily idk) didn’t expect that to cause an argument. It’s like she puts me in a position where idk if she’s mad at me or not. Anyways the whole rest of the night I was confused so I tried talking to her. Long story short I’m obsessive and controlling to her. Being this is my first real relationship I agree, I’m still learning my faults. 

The way she’s handling this is weird tho. 
She’s blocked me from iMessage but has me on IG. 
She’s kept 1 pic of me in her profile

238,"I'm at a crossroads here, and I need some input from folks who are outside the situation.

I'm a recent college grad, and I've just gotten accepted into a highly selective internship that would be a good resume builder and is relevant to my degree. It's basically a once in a lifetime kind of thing, and the perks that come with the internship make it a really fun and exciting opportunity. The company is a huge name, and I've heard that doing this internship can help lead into careers with them, or at very least it makes resumes stand out. A friend of mine has done the internship previously and he adored every minute of it. I mostly applied to see if I could get it, not expecting to get accepted.

But, I also have a lot of concerns about it. It would be several hours away from home and for a longer period of time than I've ever been away before. It would also be an expensive internship - I would get paid, but housing and general living expenses will be costly, plus car payments for a car that I likely would not have with me because I'd have to fly out (not having the car and the freedom that grants me is another con). 

Additionally, I realized during my field study in my final year of college that I'm probably not actually going to be happy in a career related to my degree (lol at my life, right?). 

Meanwhile at home, there is a full time position that is tangentially related to my major but would be more appealing to me, plus with better hours and actual benefits. This job could lead into an actual career, whereas doing the internship would essentially push back my starting in the ""real world"" an entire year. However, this job is not a sure thing.

There's also personal reasons that are pulling me to stay closer to home - my father has cancer and is about to start chemotherapy. His doctor gave him an estimated 5-10 years left. My dad and I are incredibly close, and disappearing for half a year when he only has so much time left hurts to consider. Plus, my mother does not drive so they both might benefit from having me around if his body doesn't handle the chemo well. 

If you were in my situation, what would you do? Would you go for the internship or the job at home? Feel free to ask any questions if there's anything that I accidentally left confusing or anything! ",26Sep2018,2

243,"First off, if I am posting this in the wrong subreddit please just ignore.

Some backstory and details

-We are both 22

-We live apart


I first met my now girlfriend back in 8th grade. We were very close friends for about 7 or 8 years. During that time, I really just thought of her as a very close friend. We liked the same TV shows, listened to the same music, and had a very similar sense of humor. About 6 months ago, something changed in me and I felt that dating her would be a natural progression of our very strong friendship.

We have currently been dating for just over 6 months and things have been alright. Nothing feels new or exciting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing I think, but I will get to that late. I feel comfortable being in a relationship with her since we have been good friends for such a long time. She is very important to me and I only want what's best for her.

This is my first, REAL, long-term relationship and I am still learning the ropes of what to do/ what not to do, and the same case is with her. This is also her first real long-term relationship. Over these past couple of months, however, there are a lot of things that I have been struggling with mentally that I am afraid will ruin our relationship. 

1. Communication can be difficult.
-
I work 2 jobs right now, and she is transitioning between jobs at the moment, so our schedules are very very different. She usually gets off work around 3 or 4 while I don't get off until about 9, depending on the day it sometimes goes until midnight. Text messaging is our ***only*** form of communication at the moment. Not because of time constraints or technical difficulties, but because she doesn't like speaking on the phone or using facetime. This can be difficult as I will be in the car driving home when she is wanting to talk before she goes to bed.

Not being able to talk on the phone when we are apart has lead to a few arguments. Mainly because we are misinterpreting what is being said through the texts in terms of the tone of voice. There is only so much emotion you can convey through a text. and at this moment, I feel like I spend 20% of our texting time actually having a conversation, and the other 80% of the time explaining something because it was being misinterpreted, and I am sure the same goes for her.

As for actual in-person conversations I have with her, for the most part are pretty great. Like I had mentioned before, we both have a very similar sense of humor, and we both have a very quirky way of speaking with each other. When we cut loose and are able to just speak to each other in a super casual setting, we *really* cut loose. Almost everything we say is either funny, silly, ridiculous, or just straight up nonsensical. In short, we are just trying to make the other laugh. Something that I think we both struggle with though, is knowing when the joking stops, and when we can still be silly. There have been 2 instances where she said something to me that really hurt my feelings and vice versa because we didn't know when the joking stopped, and when the serious business started.

2. The sex isn't the best.
-
As a forewarning, I am very worried that I am being too narrow-minded, and too selfish about this subject and again, am just looking for advice about this....

 Now as I previously mentioned, we are both very new to being in a relationship and I expected there to be some awkwardness when it comes to being intimate. Now let me say that she is very pretty and physically attractive, but when it comes to being intimate, it is still apparent that she is still trying to learn the ropes of what to do. Kissing is dry and very plain, she isn't really doing much in terms of ""exploring the medium"" if that makes sense. 

The sex is really isn't something that I have enjoyed very much. The first couple times we had it, we were nervous but excited, but were both unsuccessful in terms of reaching climax. That's ok though, nothing wrong with that right? It was our first time! Six months later, however, and I have yet to reach a climax with her. After that first unsuccessful attempt, I thought maybe that now that I am in a new relationship, maybe my masturbation habits from back in my single days were coming to haunt me, so I quit doing that cold turkey in hopes that that would help. That was 6 months, and so far, things have not really improved. I am happy that I am able to pleasure her and make her feel good. In fact, that is what makes me the happiest in terms of our ""physical relationship"", but in terms of actual sex, the frequency of it has fallen drastically for a few reasons.

 We have both been very busy with work and just have not had time. She also likes to have sex after we both go to the gym, but for me personally, I am drained and have trouble supporting my body after going to the gym. I literally have zero energy left. And finally, I am just embarrassed/ scared at the fact that no matter what happens, I am afraid that I won't be able to reach climax while having sex. It is both physically and mentally frustrating for both of us. 

3. I want what is best for her.
-
All in all, I am really just asking for some advice on some things that we can do better to make sure that our relationship doesn't fall apart. As aforementioned, this is my first *real* long-term relationship, and all I want is for her to be happy. I try and tell her that at least once a day. We are both looking to hopefully move in together soon, but there are just some points throughout my day where I am just not sure if I am comfortable with moving in with her yet. I could go into detail about our problems with choosing apartments blah blah blah but this post is already too long.

If you made it this far in my rant, I just want to say thank you for taking the time to read what I have to say. Just so it has been said, I have talked about all of, if not most of these points with my girlfriend. I am posting this here to try and find gain some wisdom from someone who probably has more expertise with relationships than I do.

Thank you! ",26Sep2018,3

245,"Bit of a back story.... My daughter has been diagnosed with multiple forms of anxiety and is a very literal person. When the class was told (last year) during state testing that no one was to leave their seats, she took it as she literally could not ask to go to the restroom and there was an accident where she needed a change of clothes. 

So she brings home a math test 2 days ago where she failed it for not labeling her answers. Like if the question was (just a for instance). Cindy has 5 cookies and Joe has 3 cookies, how many cookies are there in all? She did the work, got the answer correct but didnt specify that it was 8 COOKIES. She just put 5+3=8. Of course, the math problems were much harder than what I showed here. No where in the directions does it state she was to label the answers (adding the word cookies).

Another section had area/perimeter math problems. The problems states what the measurement unit was to be used. For instance, a problem was worded such as ""a rectangle where the width is 2 INCHES, and the length is 12 INCHES, draw a solution for the rectangle"". She did the rectangle correctly but didnt put 'inches' by the numbers around the rectangle.... 

Should I appeal this grade? Should I speak with the teacher or principal? I feel like its nit picking when the directions were specified in writing nor verbal, stating that the answers had to be labeled. None of the homework had been marked wrong when the answers weren't labeled. I dont want to be ""that mom"" but I also want her to get a grade she actually deserves.",26Sep2018,3
246,"I have known this person for 37 years. We knew of each other in elementary school, were best friends in middle school, in the same clique in high school, but then pretty much grew apart and mostly only communicated over email and then Facebook for the past 20 years. One day, we had differing opinions on a topic on Facebook and I realized I really didn’t know her anymore and we only “like” each other’s posts very occasionally. This was the only time I commented on something she posted and she flat out said I was wrong about a topic I’m very educated about. So, 5 months ago, I unceremoniously un-friended her on Facebook. She has sent me 3 messages this past week. I haven’t read them, but I think it proves my point when it took her so long to realize I was gone.

247,"I got 'promoted' at the company I worked for a year doing a paper pushing job, to doing logistics.  At the old job I wanted a more dynamic change, applied for this, and boy did I get it. 

I shadowed the very complicated position for a week and got flown to the area that was freshly set up and I was hired to run. Things went well there, definitely a nice change and opportunity that I enjoyed.  Mind you I was working from 9am-6/7 every day that I was there and now that I'm back to base for good I am working 8am-6/7. (10 hour days I was told during the interview process) 

I woke up this morning and realized I hate the job.  I feel trapped because I feel like I have had so much invested in me - hours of training, being flown to a new place, and I have a course to complete next week.  But I HATE the job.  Its difficult, I have to juggle so many things, the hours are crazy, the pay is miserable (promise of 5K more a year after 3 months) and I hate getting up in the morning.

252,"Hi r/advice! I’ve never posted here before so I’ll try to keep it as brief as possible. TL;DR at the end.

The situation is basically this: I’m in college now, two months into my first year. I really like it—my classes are interesting, I’m making friends, everyone is friendly and helpful. But with this new freedom to pick my courses and really think about my future, I’ve realised that what I came here to do—study neuroscience and eventually go to med school—isn’t what I want to do anymore. The only thing I can picture myself doing as a career is writing.

I’ve been writing since I was a little kid, and it’s always gotten good feedback. A few people have told me I should be an author but I brushed them off because I never thought I was good enough and because I was convinced I could never make a living that way. But I’ve been practising and getting better and I try to write as much as I can but college is really getting in the way of that. Ever since I was 14, I’ve written every single day—even if it’s just a sentence or two—but in college that routine has been interrupted and it’s killing me. I’ve been having panic attacks again for the first time in years. I’ve written a ton of short stories and I’m working in a novel draft, but I’m making painstakingly slow progress because all my time is taken up by classwork. 

I’m feeling more and more like the best, most productive version of me is the one who writes, and the most exciting work I’m doing isn’t even in my classes, but typing stories into the Notes section of my phone late at night.

I don’t think a creative writing degree is worth it. I have no desire to get one. I just want to write what I want and put my stuff out into the world, and I don’t care if nobody looks at it or buys it, I just want to have a chance to make stuff I’m proud of. Besides, a writing degree wouldn’t be worth the money—my family isn’t terribly well-off and I don’t want to be in debt because of something that only marginally helped me hone my technique. I want to talk to my mom about all this, as she’s really supportive and lovely, but the prospect of not finishing college when I’m the sole person in our family with this sort of opportunity is really scary. My brother dropped out to join the army, my cousins both got kicked out of school/dropped out and are unemployed, and I’ve wanted to go to college for a long time—I’m the only kid in the family who everyone is counting on to work my ass off, get a degree, and become super successful and wealthy, and I’m terrified of making the wrong choice.

So, a few questions:

1.  Should I drop out/take a leave of absence to follow my dreams? Or is there another option? I know I can’t keep doing what I’m doing now; it’s not sustainable.

2.  My mom is coming up to visit next weekend, how should I talk to her about this?

Thanks so much if you’ve read this far.

TL;DR - My passion in life is writing but I’m in college studying neuroscience. I want to make a career out of writing but I don’t know if it’s possible and I’m considering dropping out or taking a leave of absence once I figure out my plans for the immediate future. Is this a reckless idea?",26Sep2018,12
253,"A few years ago I dated someone that was  younger than me, I was twenty and she was sixteen. Our relationship was great at first, her parents even considered me a part of the family. I'd made sure that everything was okay before I jumped into the relationship because that was the only and still is the youngest person I'd ever dated. I was attracted mostly to her family's support and unconditional love for me, being that I spent most of my life in foster care. It felt nice to be normal. That was even the first time I'd ever truly celebrated Christmas or Thanksgiving.

&amp;#x200B;

Two and a half years later we had a really rough breakup, it was inevitable, we were just too different. She was just starting college and I already had a full time job with bills to pay including rent. She still wanted to do a lot things that I didn't care for anymore and I found myself lecturing her. I found out that she was secretly selling nude photos to random men online, even though money was never an issue for her, as a matter of fact, her family are extremely well to do, but she claimed it was because I wasn't giving her the attention that she needed. I also found out she was sleeping with someone else, a friend she had been hanging out with for the past few months leading to our breakup, I'd never been much of a jealous person, so I didn't care who she hung out with in fact I encouraged her to spend time with her friends and opposed to coming over my house and watching TV. 

Obviously I was crushed, and  that's when it dawned on me that I was dating someone way younger than me, we ended it and I felt bad for several years to come.

Fast forward to the present and I'm in a great relationship, I have a budding career in music, a house and a good dog. My partner is an extremely hard working, and I'm extremely lucky to have her by my side.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning at about 3am I got a long message from an unknown number; it was my ex. We hadn't talked in years. In short, she claims that I ruined her life and that I stole precious years from her. 

Not only have I felt bad about it for so long, but this might be my worst nightmare come to life. I have always been really careful with relationships. I always make sure everything is a 100% consensual, never abusive, and I certainly never took more than I'd given. I looked at her social media and I thought I was looking at a complete stranger. It seems as though after her and I broke up she had a string of abusive relationships and bad decisions. She runs a popular Instagram account with 10k+ followers  where women call out abusive men. Even though it was years ago, I can't hep but feel guilty. I also don't want this to ruin my potential career as an artist and I certainly don't want to tarnish my partners reputation, because she's an objectively good person and has nothing to do with my past. I've had an extremely shitty life, I've never won at anything and this is the first time I think I'm on the right track. I'm nowhere nearly as popular as my ex on any platform, I have a very small group of friends. I've never made enemies. I don't have a history of dating younger women, but she might make me out to be a predator that I know I'm not.

Firstly, I (17M) am studying for my A Levels in secondary school. However, I'm currently failing (I'm doing okay in Biology but am struggling in my other two subjects with D's and E's becoming more common, with it being too late to change them). I also have trouble concentrating on these subjects, at school or when doing homework, and I have no idea how to focus. That would be okay if I had any other options to what I wanted to become (for instance, I want to become a scientist, but I feel as if that is becoming an unrealistic dream), but I have bad hand-eye coordination/dexterity, and would be useless at any trades. So I have no other backup routes I can think of. I also have no real hobbies, nothing I would say that I'm really good at- only average at best- when it comes to school, sports, other hobbies, hell even video games I'm only OK at. I feel as if I'm struggling with a large amount of self doubt right now, especially if I'm good enough to get into university or a decent job. On top of that, I also feel as if I have no real friends. There are people I get on with at school, but I don't know if I would call them ""true"" friends. I've never been invited to anything except for one trip to the cinema a few months back, never had a true ""best friend"" for years, never had a girlfriend, that sort of thing.

I'm not depressed or anything, I think, but I don't exactly feel ""happy"" with my life either.

258,"i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this or not but i've been wondering what to do about this for a while and i figured i'd post here. anyways, when i was younger i had a friend who was like my best friend and i went to private catholic school with her. i lived about three neighborhoods away from her and we hung out all the time. however around third grade my mom put me in public school instead because we didnt have enough money to keep sending me to the catholic school, and even while in public school i still hung out with this girl all the time. after the summer in between fifth and sixth grade we fell out and stopped talking. i kinda forgot about her for the entirety of middle school but the strange thing was that even though we lived in the same town, after that summer, i literally never saw her again. i didn't see her at the grocery store, or the mall, or at the 4th of july celebration that my town has every year (that i used to see her at all the time). i didn't hear from her or her parents (who were good friends with my parents) at all following that summer and both me and my parents just forgot about her in general. however in 2016 i was cleaning my room and i found a drawing that she gave me buried in my desk and i suddenly had an urge to try to find her on the internet to see if she maybe had any social medias so i could reach out to her. i must have searched for two hours but i couldn't find a single mention of her or her parents at all. not even on facebook. at the time i shrugged it off and went back to cleaning my room, but just this past january i went back to try to find her again. i found only one thing that might have helped, and it was just a mention of her mom on the website for the school district she works at. i was so confused as to why she completely disappeared. i still haven't seen her around in any public place at all, and i know she hasn't moved away because i passed her house while driving one day and i recognized both her parents' cars in the driveway. i sent her a letter in february (because i don't know her email address) saying that i'd like to get back in touch with her and so far i haven't gotten any response. i have my own friends now and i don't often think about her but i still think it's so strange how she still lives like three neighborhoods away from me but i haven't seen her out in public at all since the summer between fifth and sixth grade. i wonder what happened to make her completely disappear like that. i'm kind of just rambling now but the bottom line is that i'd really like to get back in touch with her somehow but i feel like i've tried everything. i don't want to try to go to her house again because that's fucking creepy and i'm not a stalker. so, is there any other way that i might be able to talk to her again? any suggestions are appreciated. thanks.",26Sep2018,2
259,"Alright I need to keep this short but I'm 20 and my brother is 30, my mom owns a store that she acquired in the first place just so me and him could work there but he opened up his first business when I was in high school years ago so I couldn't do anything but after that he hired his fiance to help him meanwhile I was rotting at home cause I had a lot of free time.

I thought perhaps I wasn't qualified for the business he ran(graphic design and computer stuff) Idk anything about graphic design but I'm good at computers. So, he ends up switching his business to renting wedding dresses and how ironic he asks me to help him clean up before they open up, we even moved some furniture which was a pain in the ass. Meanwhile we are cleaning he says that he'll let me work and will give me a salary.

Nope after that, I was never asked anything again from him, its not just this, he just thinks about himself and his wife, not even my parents, my mom doesn't wanna say anything even though she doesn't agree with anything he does, she just tries to avoid being stressed idk.

This guy has his own business so you know he earns a lot but it's sad that even though I helped him with stuff, still claims he did everything by himself even though my MOM gave him store but yet she doesn't get any profit, only him and his wife do, she even gets her family members to sit at the store meanwhile he never asks me that.

Whenever we talk, he just talks about himself, like I don't fucking care, my life is fucking shit, I had a job and lost it, I don't have any social life and you don't help me out at all like I'll work for free, I just want something to do for fuck sake.",26Sep2018,2

261,"So, the other day we started a project in physiology, to see which ethnicities society considered most attractive, and which one society felt least attractive. We were given a list of ways to come up with data, and I chose tinder.

Now before you go and bash me, I only went on there  for this project, and I made it very clear in my bio and messages that this was part of a Psychological study. 

As I started getting matches and messages, the realization hit me like a brick. 

Not everyone is like my bf, and I don’t have to put up with how he, or his parents treat me. I’ve been truly unhappy in my relationship for almost a year now, but I stuck with it because I thought everyone was like this. 

News flash, not everyone wants to spend weekends at their farm over hanging out with their gf, not everyone listens to their mother’s every begging call, and not everyone treats their future like it’s a game. I’m getting sick and tired of his actions, and I don’t want to deal with this anymore.

263,"I live in Colorado. I am a tiny female. I chose to leave my home due to my abusive brother. I have a part time manager job, looking for more work, looking for housing, roommates, everything I can.

I have my car with most of my stuff in it. Sadly, I had to leave my senior cat at home. She wouldn't be too happy with me being in a car all the time.

I do not want my coworkers to know, but sadly my coworkers are the only outlet I have to sleep on someone's couch, so that's a no go for me. I want to remain happy and have my composure with my employees.

My question is, is there a good place to park my car at night? Do truck stop showers let people like me in? Is there a loophole where I can remain clean, sleep well while having my car? 

If I created an ad on Craigslist for a room, unable to pay security deposit in full, would I have any luck telling people about my situation?

264,"I work in a gov biolab as a contractor. When I started I was thrown in with no direction as to what my main job responsibility or requirement is. Seems I’m expected to find my own way. I work with 15 other contractors who each have niches in different areas and tend to stick there. There is not a lot of work for all of us and work that does come usually isn’t assigned to me so I find myself bored most the day. I ask ppl to help and afterwards I never hear anything from them. I’m very passive and rather not beg  people for work. I work better when I have a job or responsibility laid out for me for me from the start. In my last lab I was in charge of a biorepository which is essentially a lab sample inventory. I really enjoyed this work and have knowledge in sample database management. 

Last week I overheard some coworkers complaining about how disorganized their freezers are in lab and there are so many samples just stored away nobody really knows what they are. I took this issue to my boss and let him know that I have experience and can get the freezers organized with a searchable spreadsheet/database available for whoever needs to reference an archived sample. He said that’s awesome and he will email me a meeting time to pick my brain and find a starting point to how the samples can be organized and what can be tossed. This was last week and I still haven’t received that email. 

I need some sort of input before I get started since I don’t know what some of these samples are or how they should be handled. I was wondering if it would be in bad taste to ask my boss again for the meeting or continue to wait? ",26Sep2018,5
265,"Okay I have a lot to say about this.
Almost a year ago my boyfriend told me that he has a fetish for bigger girls, and that he wanted me to gain 15-20 pounds, but I think he was just giving me a ""starter weight"" so that I didnt freak out at the idea of being 50 pounds heavier. I am not fat, I have never been fat, I have never worried about my weight, or really my body type in general just because I've been healthy and never had self esteem issues. I like physical work, I like to sweat, I like to go outside and play. I'm 5'6"" and a year ago I weighed about 130-135 depending on the day.

Our relationship outside of sex was good. He treated me well, we liked to do the same things, we got each others jokes. Sex was great, until maybe 5 months into our relationship. I brought it up all the time. That our sex was unfulfilled and honestly I was unhappy with it. But it didnt seem unfixable. Even though it hardly got fixed. Well, things were still moving foreword and we moved in together, about 3 months after living together, he hits me with this shit. After we had already moved in together and started sharing finances. That's how well things were going for us, we started a joint bank account.

I was devastated to say the least, I knew I wanted out of the relationship, but we still had almost a whole year on our apartment, and a joint bank account. It would have been way easier for me to have said ""then were not right for each other"" and walked away. But I didnt, I didnt want to deal with the financial and emotional stress, we still got along really well. So I gave weight gaining a try. I understand now why girls who are unhappy with their bodies are so fucking mad all the time. It changed my whole demeanor and personality. This year have been a living nightmare. I'm constantly irritable, constantly trying to gain weight and showing I'm not very successful with it. Im always worried about my health. Constantly being overly full and uncomfortable. I dont want to look in the mirror, i dont get to go outside and have fun anymore. Sex is hell for me, he always wants to touch my stomach and just rip that fucking wound open again. When he even wants to have sex I thought gaining some would help, it hasn't helped with our sex at all.

I did manage to gain a little, I did gain about 15 pounds. But, we recently found out I'm pregnant. As a young adult all I wanted out of life was love, that was my goal, to fall and love and be settled. I realized over the last few weeks that the love of my life is this baby, I didnt know it until now, but the love I wanted was not from a romantic relationship, the love I craved was from and for my kids. I still want to be in a happy, stable relationship though. But now I'm stuck with this cloud hanging over me and it's really causing me a lot of issues that I'm going to have to deal with this for the rest of my life. It's not that I dont love him, and want us to work out. But I know there are a lot of people out there who would be okay with dating a single mom who has her shit together and has confidence, as apposed to being in a relationship with someone who I'm not totally compatible with. I just dont know what to do with all this pain...

267,"I don't want another child, and I was very clear about that. She was too until she found out she's pregnant. But she wants to keep it (she doesn't want to kill it). I cannot comprehend the idea of a child at this point in my life and I don't know what to do. 

I feel I cannot afford the maintenance costs I will have to bear. I'm in a foreign country I don't particularly like, sharing joint custody of a child from a previous relationship. The maintenance costs will mean downsizing my flat past the point of being able to share custody.

 Which means  I'll have to give up the joint custody of the child from my previous relationship, disappointing her massively and making my whole reason for being in this country moot.

I feel I have the choice between running away, staying and living a frugal life I hate or pretending to be happy with a child I know I don't want. In a relationship that is in no way ready for that.

270,"My mom is the root cause of my financial struggles. Growing up, I struggled because she was a single mother. she wasn’t single because my father died or because he was abusive and left, she purposely had me young to a guy she didn’t know solely because she wanted a baby. She was making minimum wage and hasn’t improved much since.

I struggled for 18 years living with her;
Moving place to place, no stability, living with no lights, getting evicted, etc. I never asked to be born, but she chose to have me out of her own selfishness.  I was so depressed growing up that I got heavy into drugs just to cope. Thought about suicide several times.

When I was going to college, my mom pretty much guilted me into taking out the maximum  amount that I could take in Federal student loans. I wanted to take out the minimum just to pay for books and tuition, but every goddamn semester, my mom needed me to take out extra for the rent, car repairs, late bills, etc. She promised that she would focus on making more money while I was in college since she didn’t have to take care of me. She promised repeatedly to help me pay it back once I graduated since she helped rack up the debt. I’m now $50k in debt when it should have been only half that. She also got me in bad standing with my bank because she would continuously overdraw my account. I would tell her to take out $20, and she would take out $60.

I had to finance a car because I drove 45 miles to class and 45 minutes to work opposite ways, and a $2000 car wasn’t reliable enough for my needs, so I financed a car and planned to double down on the payments. Well, my mom’s car clunked out and she had no money to buy one cash (she lived far from work too) so she begged me to co-sign on a car with her. I was very hesitant, but it was hard as a man to see your mom cry and struggle, so I agreed. She promised to pay for the car and for the insurance, and she did for about a year, but she decided to quit her job suddenly to explore the country because she was tired of the regular 9-5 life. She “trusted the universe” to help her make the money she needed to pay everything.

Now my mom is jobless because she couldn’t find a job and is now living in her car somewhere in Texas (I’m in Alabama) and I am paying for two fucking car notes and expensive insurance, and have been for months now. I only make $14/hour and my gas is $200/month for my job. I try so, so fucking hard to save, but the minute I get something going, my mom would dump all the insurance and her car note on me, wiping out my savings. Thing is, I HAVE to pay it because if I don’t, it will go on my credit, which I can’t have while trying to advance in the financial industry (I’m a bank teller).

I’m fucking struggling trying to balance all this and I’m also helping pay my grandma’s bills, who I am living with. Now, I’m taking on all of this burden, and my mom called me begging for $400 because the car needs to be repaired and she needs food and she doesn’t have a dollar to her name.  My mom lived on the road for 6 months and “lived” in different states from the West to the East Coast, putting thousands and thousands of miles on the car, not thinking about when it needs repairing because “the universe and her positive thinking” wouldn’t let it happen. She can’t even begin looking for a job if her car isn’t working, so guess who had to fork out $400 of their hard obtained savings to help her. I’m back to fucking nothing now. I was so distraught I just left work and got high. I felt like giving up.

I will never have anything with this woman and I feel like I hate her. She kept me down in childhood, and is keeping me down as an adult. I feel like dying sometimes. How can I relax and not let this overwhelm me? ",26Sep2018,7

So I'm 21 about to turn 22. I'm going to school full time to get my welding degree. I just got a basic welding job full-time paying $15.45 an hour, which is pretty good considering the minimum wage here in Alabama is $7.25 an hour. I think it will be really good experience to have while still in school.

The welding classes are very flexible; you just kind of go at your own pace. So I'll be working during the day and going to school in the evening.

The only reason I want to possibly move out is because the rules are kind of the same at my parents house as they were when I was 16. If I want to go out, I have to tell them everywhere I go and sometimes they don't approve. I can't go see my friends four hours away at another College because one of them used to smoke weed and they're afraid that I'm going to start doing that again. I have no intention to do that and he doesn't really smoke much anymore. I've also had some issues in the past and so they make me take medication and see a counselor. I'm not too particularly comfortable with that and it's hard to squeeze that into my busy schedule. I would also like to get with girls (I'm a dude) and I don't like having to tell them everything about what I do if you know what I mean. 

The thing is also they have a zero tolerance rule for alcohol and weed and even cigarettes. I don't want to get back into heavy cannabis use and I'm not much of a drinker, but it would be nice to have a few drinks and maybe a puff or two from time to time without risking getting kicked out.

They'd let me have the car if I paid for gas and insurance because right now they pay for it. I'm just not sure what to do. At the very least I would see how my new schedule works out before I decide. But the thing is I would like to have more freedom and feel 22 not 14.

286,"Obviously things are more complex than any simple paragraph or two, but I’ve seen sanity (and insanity) come from reddit, so, thank you for your genuine interest and concern: 

About two years ago, someone very dear to me, enough that he was my non-biological brother, committed suicide. He hanged himself. I don’t know any of the details, how long / if he had been planning or if it was impulsive. Or really anything. We all (self and family) had seen him just a week or two before, during the holidays. He had so many friends, they were countless. He was hilarious and we all loved him, despite a few fucks ups that we all do. His body was discovered by his girlfriend of the time, who was a flake and she is completely gone. His biological parents are hush hush about the issue, so there’s no bothering with them.

Long story short I became a hermit. I never left the house. I would honestly go for days or a full week without ever going outside. I woke up every day crying and often didn’t have the energy to leave the house. I would literally collapse upon reaching the front door handle and would spend most of the day basically catatonic on the floor. Obviously not good for either school or work. 

I tried my best to continue my schooling but had to fully withdraw from one semester (the right choice), and have had trouble ‘bouncing back’.  I received my first Ds ever in my entire academic career, and I just recently walked out of a big test that I know I didn’t even come close to passing. I was IB in HS, and have a previous BA degree cum laude, so usually I know how to do school. 

Along the same lines my work basically petered out.  Can’t keep a job if you don’t go.

I don’t mean to make this post political, but also yes I loath Trump, and I think Republicans are immoral and corrupt.  (Born in Kenya! Grab em by the pussy! Make America hate again. Tax the poor and give to the wealthy, Rip children away from their families, Merrick Garland) It is deeply troubling, every single day, their continued robbery of the poor and middle class and lack of basic morals. It honestly hurts my psyche every day.

Add to the list that I’m basically a 30+ yr old virgin (not technically, but when you’ve never been with someone you love, never been with the same person twice, and haven’t been with anyone in many years…). I know being a virgin is ok, but at 30+ it reeeeeeealy starts to suck. I get hit on by men fairly often. I am a heterosexual cis male. I seriously worry that I come across as creepy. I don’t blame anyone, but how can I stop even seeming like a creep? I’m just shy, and poor. I would never in a million years purposefully hurt or abuse or do anything bad to my partner or any woman or person. I definitely come across as desperate and probably do have commitment issues, tho can't commit if never start...

So I’m in a position where logically I see the good in life. I don’t live in a poor nation. I have the opportunity to go to school (...and fuck loans). The weather is nice despite global warming. I’ve had some great experiences traveling. I’m pretty bright, despite grades not reflecting.  I have a good family, tho I feel like I abuse them with my absence.  My physical health is good.   And the other thing is I have complete faith in basically everyone else. Like if I weren’t me I would have faith that hypothetical person could turn things around.  But...

So on the grand scheme I’d give myself a 1% to 5% chance of suicide, basically none, but incredibly worrisome nonetheless. 1% is infinitely more than zero. I suppose there is truth that it is ok to have thoughts but not act on them. Better than repression.

I have a strong marijuana habit but no hard drugs or alcohol.  I take prescription antidepressants that definitely help.  I know reducing habitual marijuana use would help, (tho I’m pro medical and rec marijuana). Have I lost all willpower?

I guess I’m wondering what is the \*smart\* way forward?  I’m in senior year, so that both means I’m near the finish line, but also have the hardest classes (quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, advanced lab...).    Should I take a break, get some stupid job and just calm down for a year and come back to finish strong? (prolly not…)   Should I suck it up and try to finish this semester (which is currently on a D trajectory,).

What other options are there?  I’m angry at myself because this is when I’m supposed to be super student, aka studying well, participating in an internship/research project, searching for grad schools or jobs... studying for the GRE,  but half the time when I sit down with a book, it just doesn’t work.  I’m not here. Noting that half the time it does work so that’s good. (but 50% = F). It hurts more this semester than last because I feel like I’m actually trying but still failing, whereas before I knew I wasn’t able to give my all, so it was unsurprising to fail. Just keep swimming?

I feel like the answer is I need to commit to a better (real-ish) job, just to get me out of the house. I work a lot of gig stuff, uber, subbing, etc. But I’m butting up against sour memories of past jobs, shit like working for jimmy johns (fuck that place and fuck guy dickface) or another employer who stole about $2k wages from me. Another job at a shitty maybe-follows-best-practice-or-maybe-doesn’t-use-the-autoclave-properly dentist-in-a-box, I have trust issues regarding employment, and not without reason.  I also feel like a serious mooch on my family.

I guess I should also mention I was serially molested as a child by my sitter, I’m hoping it unrelated, but it’s hard to say. Nobody besides her, other victims, and my previous therapist know.

Also probably unrelated but during vacation this summer I was drugged with something similar to burundanga and robbed... no physical violence luckily. 

To add to the laundry list: I live in relative poverty (tho I am grateful for what i have!). I have slight anger issues, honestly wouldn’t ever hurt another person, but I have smashed a few walls and doors. Also I’m a bit of slob, no mold or health issues, but a little more cleanliness would help.  I’m essentially (tho maybe not technically?) addicted to video games. Also my uncle, who was my true hero growing up, turned out to be a grade-A conman: ponzi schemes, dark money, graft, the whole thing. He’s divorced and gone but yay childhood heros! 

So...

Thoughts? Advice?  Call me a libtardsnowflakeincelcuck? How to turn this around? How to regain self-control? How to get a girlfriend? Or \*any\* friends… How to re-engage with school? How to find a job I don’t loathe or feel abused in?  How to turn my studies around? How to stop daily thinking about suicide? Am I just looking for a pity party? Why has everyone else been able to bounce back except me? How to get my groove back?

At least now when I cry, less often, it’s shorter, more manageable, and I don’t end up motionless for the whole day... I just end up totally apathetic... 

Ok thanks

287,"In the last few months I’ve noticed that I’ve become increasingly more rude, irritated, and just mean to others. A lot of my interactions with coworkers, family, and friends has been a mean. I’m not very nice towards them and am often negative. My rudeness often veiled as humor but in reflection many of the things I say are aren’t funny and actually just cruel. I’m beginning to feel as though I’m a bully and negatively impacting the lives of others. I’d like to stop being mean to my friends and family.

288,"I am a college student in a long distance relationship and I get irrationally anxious and upset when my girlfriend drinks and goes out. It has gotten to a point where it definitely negatively affects other aspects of my life. 

She only goes out around once a week and is responsible. We’ve talked about these feelings, but I’m definitely not asking her to change what she’s doing for me. To be honest I’m not entirely sure where the feelings come from, but I think it’s basically a mix of insecurity (she will find she that wants someone else) and fear that she’ll make a mistake due to alcohol despite still wanting to be with me.

I’ve talked to a counselor at my school, but it didn’t really help me address the problem. Advice on how to distract myself from these feelings in the moment could be somewhat helpful but not ideal. I don’t want to actively have to distract myself from thinking about it to feel better. 

I would love any advice on how to combat these feelings at the source and hopefully solve the issue. Thanks.",26Sep2018,1
289,"Hey folks. I'll try to keep a really long story really short. Moved to this apartment/condo community here in Florida about a year ago. Super nice place, gated, giant pool, fitness center, garages. I love the place, except for the management who kind of refuse to handle any issues. One issue they do nothing about is cars speeding. We have speed limit signs posted everywhere, ""10mph limit"" but people will fly through here so fast it looks like a rally course. The other day one of these folks, some redneck kid in a lifted truck saw us trying to cross the road into our apartment. He slowed down to let us by and as we stepped out he floored it. As he went by he laughed and gave us a thumbs up out of his window. This could seriously harm some one yet, nothing is done, ever, about anything.

Sorry for going off topic. The main issue is our neighbor. We only have 1 bedroom we can sleep in. There's an adjoining apartment to ours, this older guy, probably near 70 that just looks like the kind, acts like the kind who does not give a fuck about rules or what anyone thinks moved in beside us. Before that, we would sleep with our windows open and marvel at how peaceful this place was. Very quiet, very peaceful. When he moved in he decided to mount (I've seen it from outside) this gigantic, 65"" TV on the wall... In his bedroom. Not his living room, which is huge (these apartments are enormous) but instead, on the wall, in his bedroom, the wall that faces our room none the less. He also has surround sound which I used to be told (at least when I was young) a lot of apartment places simply won't allow. His is mounted on the wall, in his bedroom that faces our bedroom.

I wouldn't normally care, let him have his fun but he stays up all night, EVERY single night, at about midnight he starts his movies and watches them until the sun comes up. Loud, action movies with explosions and what not. We have literally reported the guy to the apartment community at least 20 or so times. Visits, written letters, pleas for help. It went from them warning him, to them sending the on site security to his apartment at 1am in the morning several times. He would never answer the door. Finally the security guard got so mad that from our apartment you could just about hear him trying to break the door in from knocking so hard one night. The guy opened it and supposedly claimed ""He has hearing issues and never heard anyone knocking."" Also this is supposedly why he listens to his TV so loud, all night, every night. 

The apartment place went from being helpful and trying to get something done, finally writing him a letter that he had to stop ""or else"" to switching and acting like they didn't care anymore. One night they finally said ""Look, everyone has a right to enjoy their life, listen to their TV, we can't tell them what hours to keep"" even though the rental contract states they have a ""quiet time"" from 10pm to 8am. They finally said they would send the security guard and if he could hear it from the middle of our apartment (not just our room) something would be done. He came over, said he could hear it but that it ""wasn't quite enough to do anything about."" The last few times we reported him they just get more annoyed at us like they don't want to deal with it anymore. We called the cops ONCE and when the cops showed up the guy must have seen and turned it down when they pulled up. The cop knocked on the door a few times, no answer and the cop just said ""Well, I'm sorry but I don't hear anything..."" He put this on his report making it even easier for the apartment place to ignore us....

I love this place and where we live, I love our particular unit and we don't have the time nor money right now to seek out a new property and move out of this one and into a new one. The guy went away for about 2 weeks and it was so nice, we could finally sleep again. We've done everything from putting our bed on a different wall in the bedroom (which they suggested we do but they never suggested to him to put his TV on a different wall). I started using really good ear plugs which bother me because I push them so far in to muffle the sound, we bought a loud ass old fan we didn't even need that we run all night every night ($$$) and we even bought an ocean waves white noise machine/picture thing to try and drown it out. Even with our bed on another wall and all this shit you can still hear it when you go to bed. It's like living on the back screen of a movie theater. 

The same dude has a brand new pickup, he backs it into the ""visitors only"" parking every single day and actually backs it up so far that the bed blocks the sidewalk path right next to a handicapped parking space. He does whatever he wants, no one does anything about it. This has bothered me tremendously. I've lived in apartments most of my life, I've heard noises but never anything this bad. Ever. 

Is there anything I can do? I'm so frustrated...",26Sep2018,2

My [19F] fiancé [19M] has two siblings. I have six. I’ve dealt with plenty of children over the years. 

Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE children. My nephew is the sweetest baby I’ve ever seen. But I am absolutely, positively horrified of pregnancy and childbirth. I can’t do it. I don’t want to physically have a baby. And no, it’s not going to change with age. That is something I will never do. I am beyond terrified. 

His mom [43F], when I go to her for advice, tells me “you’ll get over it. Once you’re pregnant, nothing you can do.” So I’ll say something like “okay, well then I’m not having children at all.” And she’ll get mad and say “I want grandkids. You’re having children.” 

It’s not her decision to make. My fiancé desperately wants children at some point, and I would love to raise a child with him. But I’m scared to death of pregnancy and childbirth. I think it would honestly kill me. I’m not sure he’s willing to settle for an adoptive child. But I am scared as hell. I can’t have kids. I have endometriosis so I’m not sure I’d even be able to have a child. I’m just super scared. What is another option? 

**TL;DR**- my fiancé wants children, and I would love a child. But I’m horrified of pregnancy and childbirth and that is not going to change. Is adopting a good idea? Will we still love the child? ",26Sep2018,12

I'm asking this a year in advance while I am working towards gathering documents and gaining necessary experience for my future summer job and apprenticeship next year as a web dev, I already have a letter of reccomandation from my internship this summer.

I'm entering my second year of a 5 year course (french baccalaureate+5) to hopefully be a machine learning engineer/data scientist at the end.
So far I've learnt a lot to do with web development through the course and the internship (SQL/php/javascript/merise/UML/symfony4/nodeJS....)

303,"Hey everyone.  To make a long story short, I am a college student who is about to enter my second year and I basically have no friends lol.  My antisocial tendencies/social anxiety has led me to this point and honestly I don't know how to feel or what I should do.  Part of me feels like a fucking loser because I have trouble creating and maintaining relationships. Maintaining relationships is of greater concern to me because I feel like a lot of people I end up making friends with end up being turned off at some point.  The fact that I'm in a super social college where everyone is supposedly having the time of their lives makes matters worse and gives me a great case of FOMO.   It makes me mad that I am so desperate for friends, a lot of people would argue that one can live happily without them.   This is where resentment towards my mom specifically comes in to play.  When I was in high school, I was a loner like I am now but after constant nagging and almost bullying I finally caved and found people that I liked.  At the time, I did not feel like a loser for not having friends but the idea that my mom instilled into my head that it is bad to be by yourself and being a loner is for losers has left what I perceive as emotional trauma that is making me feel like shit now.  I will admit, however, finding a group was a turning point in my high school career, I was just overall more confident and happier.  Back to hating my mom though, another thing that makes me hate her even more is that she essentially acts like if you're not a doctor, you're a loser. I was tricked into thinking this my whole life and I was unable to pursue a career path I wanted.  I took a career development class and was convinced the accounting career was for me but she had to fucking sit me down and tell me why I had to become a doctor.  I have since tried to cut off as much contact with my mom because I'm so tired of her influence navigating my life decisions.  Overall, I really want to stay true to myself.  I don't want to be a social butterfly just because society says to be a cool guy and do basic college shit.  I also don't want to be a doctor just because my mom told me to.  ",26Sep2018,2

305,"This sounds very mean but let me explain.

Also heads up, I do mention a particular sexual activity.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends and I are first-year college students so our friend group does fluctuate and is somewhat messy. Anyways, there is this guy who was introduced to us by an ex-friend (ex because he was an asshole and overall a horrible friend); let's name this guy Ryan and the ex-friend Jeff.

First and foremost, this guy Ryan is a dick. He recorded one of my friends (let's name her Amy) giving him head without her permission and sent it off to his friends. He apologized after Amy found out and supposedly deleted the video-- supposedly because we never saw him do it, he only said he did so. After that she stopped talking to him and most of us cut him off entirely.

Then, Ryan and Jeff got super plastered and damaged $300 worth of valuables of Amy's roommates stuff. They had to call an ambulance after they blacked out and one of them seized-- and ultimately damaged Amy's rep in our scholarship program. Mind you, they never paid them back for any of the damages.

Now, Jeff got the hint that a few of us weren't too fond of him and kept his distance from us.. but Ryan on the other hand just turned really creepy. He kept trying to talk to Amy for a week, even though she told him to just stop talking to her altogether. Then, my friends and I went to this party-- didn't tell him or anything. When we got there, he somehow found us and began following us around. When I separated from Amy, he came up to me and asked very aggressively where she was. Even if I knew I wouldn't have told him but he kept asking and I told him she was outside (which it was likely she wasn't). 

I realize this is getting very long so I will try to shorten the rest. 

Still at the party-- He just stood there and watched us (like five people; two couples, me and Amy) and even recorded us. He did not dance at all, just watched. Then he followed Amy and I outside, so we went back in-- he followed, went back out-- still followed. It went on like this for ten minutes until a group of people separated him from us. 

FF; Some of us will go to the dining hall for lunch or dinner and bam, he's there 5 mins later (I blame snap maps). He will walk around for a bit before deciding to sit with us and make things very awkward by just staring at us. We all see him before he sits down and someone will say they're going to say something if he sits down-- but none of them do!

I'm wondering what's the best way to go about this. He makes ALL the girls uncomfortable. I only put in the staple incidents where he really irked us but.. this guy is so creepy and possibly unintentionally so but he really angers me! Especially after what he did!

She lives in my hometown and we met only 2-3 times in past year as I'm studying away at different place. I made her my priority so she shouldn't feel sad as she was suffering through the trauma of loss of her parent. Around 5-6 months ago, I fell for her. I tried to distance myself from her many times so that I don't get attached to her and ruin everything, but somehow she talked to me always and we became normal. I gave absurd reasons for not talking rather than telling her why I did it. She used to talk about her parent and I used to think she's still in that trauma so I never confessed my feelings. I was afraid to confess as I thought she will think I was just helping her to make a move. During last 2 months though she began acting weird. Earlier she used to reply ASAP but then replies became slower. She used to say how busy she was and all other things. And suddenly few days ago she told me she got in a relationship with a guy. She had told me about her past experiences with other guys as she considered me her best friend, but this time, I didn't even had a clue. She never told me she was seeing a guy or anything about him. When I asked how it all happened, she said it just happened. I was heartbroken. I confessed my feelings when she told me she got in relationship, she said I respect your feelings but I don't feel the same and I can't do anything. She said you're still my best friend though, there's nothing awkward and its all fine. I didn't feel good though. I didn't contact her for week after that, but she talked nicely after when we talked after a week. I'm confused. She's the person with whom I have been closest yet. I got attached to her.

I contacted the office and left a voicemail saying that I was not comfortable with a group of people I do not know entering the apartment while I am at work. I received no call back. The next day my roommate sent an email expressing our concerns and was told that they cannot give us a closer time window or schedule an inspection. After a few emails back and fourth asking if we could have our inspection Friday because someone will be there they stopped responding. Yesterday my roommate stopped by the office and asked the manager, (who was very rude) why they would not come Friday while someone would be home and was told they had too many units to see and they would be coming to inspect sometime in that 3 day time frame. Yesterday I changed the locks on the apartment and left a note on the door that they are not allowed to enter the apartment. My neighbor across from me who I never even speak to also put a note on his door stating when he was available and did not want them there when he is not present.

Also, he'll literally yell at us for taking too much food on our plates, but if theres not an extra helping of food left for him to make himself a lunch for the next day, he'll make a huge deal out of it and bitch, which i don't think is fair because my mom usually prepares dinner and cant always account for an extra portion.

However, my girlfriend is **very** adamant about her opinions and if she wants to handle something a specific way, there isn't much I can do to change her mind. I get upset with her if she ever spanks my cat, but I can't do anything about her doing this to her own cat (because, well, it's HER cat). The thing is, I feel like she can be too strict with him, though. For example, when we play with her cat, sometimes he will playfully nibble our hands or fingers, but this is also something she gets upset at him for and will slap him if he continues to bites her. However, I find it unfair because she plays rough with him sometimes and I wonder if biting is the only way he is able to tell her ""stop"".

It also bothers me because although my cat is extremely cuddly, she's also a **huge** scaredy-cat. Any sudden noises or movements startle her, so I try to be very delicate with her and keep her comfortable. I love my cat very much and I really, really want her to relax more around the house. It pains me to always see her so scared, but sometimes my girlfriend will intentionally make sudden movements or slap the couch/bed to startle her and scare her away (especially when my cat is cuddling with me in bed, because my girlfriend gets jealous). I've talked to her about this, but she plays it off saying things like ""I wasn't *tryyyying* to scare her; I just wanted to flop on the bed! Maybe if your cat wasn't a little bitch about everything"", etc.

Is there anything I can tell her or show her that may change her perspective on this?",26Sep2018,20

318,"Ok.. so when my bf and I started seeing each other back in May, he was very honest with me and told me that he had a planned trip to go see his “ex” in Boston in July. We had just started seeing each other and I told him it was not my place to tell him not to go. If he wanted to go he could, but later on as our relationship started to flourish and get more serious I told him I was not comfortable with him going and spending the week with his ex. I simply stated how I feel, but never gave him a choice (me or her type of thing).  He’s not dumb so he caught the message and canceled the trip. And much later on I actually found out that they were technically on an open relationship and that she didn’t know I was with him. And that he didn’t wanna tell her because he didn’t want to hurt her feelings. But he ended up telling her the truth back in July. I know this is wrong, but I wanted to see what he told her and so I went thru his messages when he was asleep and saw that he wrote her that even though he was with me, he didn’t want her to disappear from his life. And he moved back to France in August and we’re trying a long distance relationship, last night I told him I knew everything and he pushed it off saying he was going to bed and avoided the conversation.  Do you guys think this is worth something to fight for? Am I stupid for still loving him and trying my hardest to go to graduate school in Europe to be near him? Im feeling blinded by my emotions and would like and outside perspective. ",26Sep2018,2
319,"Hi, I'm puzzleheadedPilot :).
I play and stream the video game Overwatch for a team with 7 players, a coach and manager at the top of the entry level division. I am 16 years old want, and am working towards, playing the game at a professional level. I used to play a lot of rugby but have recently stopped due to it conflicting with the training times of my team. Both parents were confused about this decision although they did allow me to quit which I was grateful for. 

The only really problem started about an hour ago when my dad shut down the Wi-Fi after we had an argument about me spending too much time playing the game (I usually scrim 2+ hours everyday alongside 1-2+ hours of playing in ""ladder games""). I tried to explain that what I was doing was important to me and I asked him to try to keep a open mind about it. 

I want him to understand that what I’m doing is my passion and very important to me so that he’s able to support me and have some sort of grasp on why I do what I do. However I really have no way of getting to him. I asked him if he’d consider speaking to my manager so she could explain how everything works and how committed I am to playing at a professional level but he refused and I don’t feel I can reach him just by talking to him as we’ve never really been very close and I struggle to open up to him.

Really sorry for the poor wording and I will be happy to clarify anything if anyone needs me to. I just really want him to understand that this is my passion and that esports are apart of modern culture.

I would also like to add I am not currently considering dropping out of school to continue a career in this and am still prioritizing my school work and retaining grades that I am happy with.

321,"Just to note, I’m fully aware my daughter is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. However I am here to guide her if need be, especially since she still lives with her father (my husband) and I at home. Though we have our ups and downs, just like any family, we are all very happy together. My daughter has always had a good relationship with her father and was even a daddy’s girl when she was very little. He spoiled her, they did activities together, and though they don’t seem so close now, there’s nothing of issue between them. I always believed this was typical for a teenage girl and as she develops into a mature woman their relationship will be rekindled in the future. I do admit that her relationship with him is different from mine as I’m the one she comes to for advice, does activities with, and casually chats with, whereas their communication seems somewhat limited. They also fight more than she and I fight. These fights are always over trivial things like violating curfews, borrowing the car unexpectedly, typical teenage misbehavior. However, he’s always been more strict than I and these haven’t been of notable occurrence since she was young, about 16/17.

So, to get to the point, when she was in high school, she worked closely on the school yearbook with an older male teacher. She had early dismissal so she wasn’t able to attend the meetings with the other activity members, and they worked together in his classroom alone. When I expressed concern she let me know that other teachers were aware of their situation and that though they sat side by side the door was always open and they were in sight. I didn’t mind this until I saw that they were texting each other back and forth. I snooped through her phone when I saw his name appear, and there were only innocent exchanges related to the yearbook, but there were also some friendly remarks such as the use of smiley emojis, talk about other school activities, absolutely nothing inappropriate, but a little too friendly more than professional. I talked to her about this and she said that all the students on the committee were in contact with him via text throughout the school year. I saw that this in fact was the case, so I let it go. 

Then my daughter brought home a big bag with her one day. Inside the back were a bag of cookies, sandwiches, and some fruit. I asked her where she got it from, and she said it was given to her by him. Then I found out that he had been making breakfast for her on a daily basis, and because he wouldn’t be attending school the next day, he make her breakfast in *advance* to bring to school. I would appreciate the gesture if my child was starving, but we are not destitute by any means. She is very healthy and I often give her money to buy her own breakfast and lunch when she’s on her way. I told her that I was starting to find his behavior strange and she told me that because him and his wife don’t have children, they seem to be more parental. She went on to say that he tells his students (male and female) that he loves them like their his own, who needs children when you have your students, etc. 

I met him and his wife at graduation. They seemed like kind, genuine people, so any worry I ever had seemed to fade. After all, my daughter and I were always close and I made sure from a young age that she can tell me anything. We all took a picture together and we were on our way, but then he handed me a handful of photos, about 20, of my child. Photos of her working on the yearbook, candids of her with friends, her doing silly things. They were all good photos, but only a very select few of them were in the yearbook. I wondered out loud why he had so many of her, and then she casually said (as if it was nothing) “oh, he’s has hundreds.” I pushed her to tell me more but then she continued to tell me that he must have thousands in total of her and practically every student he every had, that he has a cabinet full of photos of former students, that some date back to the 90s, etc. She said it absolutely wasn’t special and that he just liked taking photos. My daughter doesn’t like when we take photos of her so I found it strange when she appeared to be as happy as she was in the photos he took. Anyway, she graduated, and I thought that would be the last of their relationship. 

No. They remained in touch for two years now. Because he had her phone number, they didn’t email, add each other on Facebook, or anything like that, but he texts her, weekly. He often takes her out to museums, lunch, and community events, and house parties (to which my husband and I are also invited). His wife is included 99% of the time and even has photos of all of them on her social media page. I’ve even heard them say “Love you” to each other when departing. I know there’s nothing romantic or sexual going on because my daughter jokingly but sweetly wished him a happy father’s day which he appreciated very much. She told me when he introduces her to people he refers to her as his “adopted daughter.” At this point this “family” seems inseparable. I love that my daughter gets along with people of all ages, and has found people who share her interests (she loves art and they’re always exchanging books with them), but the age gap weirds me out. She’s an adult so I will never stop her from seeing them, but they seem exceptionally close. 

As a parent, how comfortable would you be with this? I feel hurt that she would rather spend time with them than me (though she does make time for me, I give her credit for that) but I feel as if she’s actually closer to this man than she is to her actual father. He loves her very much and I know it hurts him when he sees that they communicate more than they do. How can I talk to my daughter about this?

TL;DR: Daughter is very close to her former teacher and has been since she was in high school. They love each other like a family but how would you feel about your child having a “second” family? ",26Sep2018,1

328,"Hi guys--the OP is pretty straight-forward. I won't give the context, but for 10 weeks, two days of the week I'll have to bide my time for about 6 hours out of the house and there is a few complications.
Why I need to do this isn't really relevant, but it is important. Also very convoluted though, whatever. 

I know I can have a few ideas....cafe, reading, bringing my laptop along to bide my time, etc., but I also get impatient really quick.

The main issue is that I don't exactly have transportation and I will have to rely on a smartphone that often fails me to find my way form point a to another; basically it makes more sense for me to have a schedule or even stick in one place so I know the bus schedules and can get to the right time. I'd feel too awkward and uncomfortable just wandering around...I was thinking that maybe I can just go to the gym, do something productive, stay out of the sun (100% a requirement) but I have pretty low endurance and am in somewhat poor health due to a disease--there's no risk in it imo, but my asthma on top of it is kinda stressful.

329,"I have a congenital heart defect that requires me to have an artificial heart conduit in place of an aorta, because I wasn't born with one.  Turns out, aortas are important.  Anywhoozle.  I had a routine check up with my cardiologist on Monday.  I went, had an Echocardiogram (the zippy lines you see in movies), and I had a sonogram of my heart.  After spending a couple hours at the doctor's, I'm told everything is fine, and I wont have to split my skin suit and crack open my bones to fix my heart anytime soon, so I made like a bad father and left.

Cut to 8:22 the next morning.  I'm on my way to economics class, and I get a phone call from the doctor and he says ""Hey, we missed something, yesterday, You're aorta's enlarged, come in at 3"", or some such.  Since enlargement of body parts is only good in exactly one context, I figured that this is probably not great, but hey, maybe it's nothing.  So, I skipped my morning classes, went to the appointment, and met with my doctor.

It was not nothing.  My aorta was 5.3 \*centimeters\* wide.  Apparently, my blood pressure has blown up the artificial aorta, and If we don't do anything to fix it, it's going to burst and I'll be RIP in peace.  Basically, my heart is currently the worlds worst water balloon.  

All of this means that A: I'm on blood thinners now, and B: I need open heart surgery for the fourth time before I'm 20

Blood thinners are whatever.  It brings my med count to an even 5, but the heart surgery?  That's an oof from me dog.

Open heart surgery puts you out of the game for \*at least\* a few weeks, probably a month or two.  You can not miss a month's worth of classes, ergo, I'd have to drop all of my classes.  This is problematic, Mostly because I don't know when the surgery will be, but considering the whole heart exploding like an over-stuffed blood sausage possibility, it will probably be sooner than later.  

So, herein lies my predicament:  My surgery will be either this semester or next semester.  

Possibility A:  The surgery happens this semester.  If it happens this semester, I drop all my classes, get some money back, and start again next semester.  This isn't the end of the world.

Possibility 2:  The surgery happens after this semester is done.  If this happens, I can finish this semester, take next semester off, take some spring and summer courses, then start up again next fall.  Also not world ending.

Possibility III:  The surgery happens at the end of this semester, but I'm still recovering during the start of next semester.  If this happens, The whole year is a wash, which isn't the end of the world, I'll just come back next year (but I might have to reapply, which would suck, but, whatever, I guess).

Anyways, My problem is, I have no clue which of these possibilities will happen.  I'm going to learn more from my cardiologist October tenth, but even then, surgeries get delayed a lot if you're not currently dying.  Which I won't be, assuming these blood thinners keep my heart from puffing it's chest out.  So I \*really\* have no idea when this whole meat and greet is going to occur.  If I drop out now, I get more money back, but It's a black stain on my transcript.  I get less money back and a worse stain on my transcript if I have drop out later in the semester.  If the surgery's after this semester, I've got no problems, I just don't do anything next semester.  

Also, I'm dying of stress from this and having 5 classes.

So, gods of reddit, what should I do?",26Sep2018,2
330,"**Some background info.** 

I'm 24, graduated college last year, and started working right after at a very very very reputable soda and beverages company. I make around $55-65k, and am supposed to be getting a promotion within half a year, in that position i'll me making around $65-75k and should be in there for about 18 months. Afterwards I should be due for another promotion where I'd be making around 80-90. I receive insurance and retirement benefits, and it looks good on my resume I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a family where my dad has pretty much single handedly financially raised us, and I'd like to be able to do this for my family one day. So I have a bit of an (unfortunate) bias and pressure from him towards corporate jobs and the stability they come with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not too happy at my current job, I've been looking for options to leave for a few months now. The management team is poor, things aren't planned right and it leads to a awful situations where everyday we spend scrambling to do stuff that should have been calmly done weeks before, instead of working a few weeks ahead as I'd like. I also want to move out of where I currently am, and at this company I've been told I must be in this region for a few years before I'd be considered to relocate, so I'm not happy at all about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of my best friends, who worked at this same beverage company, quit at the beginning of the year to work at this credit repair company. They sell tradelines, credit sweeps, and have pretty good reviews and supposedly do legit work. He wants me to come work with him, as he says they are getting more inquiries than he can reply to, so they need more sales people. He says he's been making around 3k per week (with goals of making 5-6k in a year or so), which is an incredibly significant pay raise to what I am making now.

&amp;#x200B;

**So what's holding me back?**

I'm not 100% certain there is not shady practices there. I have zero proof to back my claim up, I just don't know much about the industry, so I am naturally wary of it. I wouldn't really want my name to be associated with a company that scammed a bunch of people. *NOT* that this would happen, but it's something I consider. 

&amp;#x200B;

The tradeline part they do (adding you to responsible credit card users account to boost your credit score), is not illegal, but it is against banks terms &amp; conditions, and this leads me to ask the question, how long will this practice stay ""legal"". I'm not sure what I'd do if this practice would become illegal at anytime I'm there.

&amp;#x200B;

No company sponsored insurance or benefits (I must find it on my own). Not sure how much more expensive/different it would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

How will this look on my resume in 5-10 years? I have no idea what the earnings potential looks like so far from now. And if this becomes illegal or something, I'm not sure how easy it would be to get a new job with this on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I like about it?**

The pay

&amp;#x200B;

The fact I would be allowed to work remotely after about 8-12 months of working there (HUGE PLUS FOR ME)

&amp;#x200B;

The owner really looks after his employees (there's about 12 of them). He invites them to big sales conference with motivational speakers and shows them a bit on what to invest and how to manage their money, which is kind of nice.

&amp;#x200B;

It'd be more of a job at a startup where I feel I'd have more flexibility (no dress code, super set hours, etc).

331,"I'm currently in university pursuing a career as a musician, but I'm having troubles reconciling my past with who I am today, and who I want to become in the future. Back in early high school, myself and a few friends created a kind of 'band' that was meant to be a parody of a local rap group that was just awful. We were immature and had no idea what we were doing, so the end product was representative of that. The songs have some pretty detestable lyrics, such as several uses of the N word (we're quite white), abundant sexist connotations, and other lyrics that just make you go, 'what in the fuck?' The entire point was to really be as absurd and humorous as possible while offending literally every demographic you can think of, and we definitely achieved success in that endeavor. We were like a much more extreme version of Lonely Island or Weird Al. Pretty much everyone in our high school understood this, as it was obvious none of the lyrics even remotely represented our actual opinions or actions in life. They enjoyed the music, both students and faculty and parents alike, and never really complained that the lyrics had crossed a line. 

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of high school though, I began to realize the potential ramifications of what I've done, and worried that I've crippled my future potential at success, since those songs are on the internet forever. I began to drift away from that group, dropped out of high school, and moved across the country to try and start over. I've now spent the last several years of my life doing my absolute best at being a better human, as to demonstrate that those lyrics don't represent, and never have represented, any of my actual beliefs, but I'm worried it'll all be for naught. I'm currently trying to make a name for myself as a musician, but everyday I'm worried this part of my past will resurface, people will hate me for it, and no amount of evidence that I've apologized and matured since then will change their mind. More than anything, I'm worried that potential backlash will get directed at my family as well, which they definitely do not deserve. Have I done something unforgivable here, or is this something that I'm able to overcome? Do I deserve a second chance?",26Sep2018,1

336,"Hello! I am currently in my fourth year of school. I’m technically only considered a junior credits-wise because I had to take minimal classes for a couple semesters because of health reasons. I am an illustration major and I’m halfway through, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s really the path for me.
I currently work for a very large entertainment company with a lot of opportunity for growth. I originally went into illustration with the idea to continue to work for that company in designing for them later in the future. However illustration is so broad and in order to continue to find work in that field, I may have to leave that company. 

My dilemma is that I DONT want to leave the company. I want to stay with them, even if I’m not doing illustration work for them. Which leads me to believe I should change my major to Communication to better that chance. However my entire life I geared myself to art, and I very much still want to do it. I just feel as if it might be a waste of time &amp; money to finish out my illustration degree when what I really want career-wise is to stay with this company (even if not doing artwork for them). I already have two AAs in art. My current degree is a BFA in Illustration. 

Should I finish out the rest of my illustration BFA? Or should I change it now before I get farther in? I know the longer I wait the more time and money I lose out on if I end up changing my major. My identity is very much defined for myself as an artist, and I love doing art very much. However I’m nervous I’m limiting myself and my future career opportunities with this company.",26Sep2018,1

339,"I feel like my life is changing drastically. 4 years ago, I was the popular kid at the school, having gotten the president-ship at the biggest house in the school, to never having to get bored because I had many friends from school.  3 years ago, my studies were complete and I graduated from school. I still had a connection with my friends and we would organize gatherings every once in a while. I was distant from most of my school friends and had only really kept in touch (on a daily basis) with 2 or 3 of my school friends. My life was okay, I even got a temporary job at a reputable company. And most important to this story, I had absolutely no trouble laughing and associating myself with people, however diverse they maybe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made friends at my temporary job and I made sure everyone at the company knew my name, to the very least. I must admit that most employees there had a big age gap compared to me, I was the little office boy. A work trip came up and I was asked to manage a team which had older employees than me, under my command. My bosses really liked me as I was efficient and computer-savvy. The trip lasted a month, during which, I was bullied and made fun of by the team members. Only a few people out of a group of 10 had actual respect for my authority and did what I asked them to do. I had to report some of the things to my bosses at the time since I could not cope with it. I was labeled the snitch and made fun of thereafter. I think this trip played an important role in the emotional damage and trauma I was subjected to. I had no friends to talk to on my trip, with whom I could share these things with.

&amp;#x200B;

Recap to last year, I had left the temporary job upon expiration of my contract and had joined another company. I started studying my degree at this time as well, part time. I gave a lot of dedication to this company, I would stay and work until I had to leave to college. I had isolated myself from most of my school friends at this point. Throughout last year, I had made 2 close friends and would hang out with them the most. They had become very important to me but I never showed it to them as I felt like they would leave if I got overattached. I used to make fake plans and stay home some nights as opposed to hanging out with them, to give them a false impression of non attachment. Apart from these friends, I did talk to a girl I liked online, to whom I did not confess my feelings then. We rarely met, she had many flings with boys throughout our friendship but I always had an impression that she liked me, mostly due to the way she designed her words when we spoke online. So far as to saying the forbidden 3 words to me. It is also worth mentioning I screwed up and my close 2 friends had cut me out for 3 months, during which, I only had work to occupy my time ( I was on sem break at college).

&amp;#x200B;

This is the second year I have been juggling work, college and my close 2 friends \[we talked and fixed our issues\] (fyi, I had other friends with whom I hung out with rarely, as they had their own squads). The girl I liked, liked me back and everything was going great until I started feeling very disconnected from everything. I cannot socialize with everyone, however diverse they maybe. I cannot laugh properly and I do not find mot things funny (which other people would find funny). Not even memes can make me laugh as I once did, now. I feel very disconnected from the world. I also have noticed that when I try to speak, my words get crumbled and I cannot express what I am trying to say. I have short term memory loss, which I started noticing recently ( I would forget tasks I had planned to do the other day at work ). I do smoke cigarettes every once in a while, but I did smoke heavily during July - August. I have no energy to interact with people, I find hanging out with people other than my close 2 friends, a burden which I do not want to do. I do not pickup the phone when people call me to hang out.

This is all really new to me and I would appreciate any advice on how I can go back to the, sociable, interested and always smiling/laughing me, I miss that guy. also would appreciate how I can deal with my short term memory loss.",26Sep2018,1

347,"Hello Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

 I am desperately seeking some guidance on how to handle this situation. I am a 30-ish old working professional female who does not enjoy waking up to random penis pictures. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Problem:

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, i received a text from a ""young woman"" claiming we had met at a lesbian bar. She immediately followed up with a semi-nude photo and some desperate attention seeking texts seeking my approval. I felt bad for the girl so I responded that she had the wrong number and to have a nice day. She proceeded to texts and I ignored her. Finally I lied and said I was a ""dude"" and not interested in talking to her. Eventually I blocked her number. I google searched the semi nude photos out of curiosity and the person was using screen shots and photo from the cam girl princess dust. I am fairly certain it was not her....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My phone doesn't really block numbers instead it just hides the calls and texts in a blocked folder. In 2 days I received over 500 texts from his number. I had a friend call the number just out of curiosity and the number was a text service. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I changed my number quickly after I realized this person was going to continue messaging me. But even with the new number I am receiving nude photos from unknown numbers, calls at all hours of the night from unknown numbers and the call left blank voice messages. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I use my phone for work purposes and I can not change the number again. I have already confused clients by changing my number originally.  What should I do? Am I know a call list or something? How do I check if I am on a perverted website call list?",26Sep2018,3

349,"Why don’t I trust her? I did claim to not feel jealousy pretty early into our relationship, but I seem to be mistaken. There’s not really any plausible scenario where anything could happen between them, and I wish I could just put my full trust in her that she won’t cheat, but she did almost cheat on her ex for not giving her enough attention. We’re going out tonight and she does seem to be showing affection again, but when I see her give him the look, that one look that she gave me at the beginning of the school year, a fire burns inside me. I believe it’s passion, but deep down I know it’s likely envy. I’m afraid, honestly. Why do I harbor such feelings? Why don’t I have trust in her? I haven’t been broken before, she hasn’t broken me yet, so what's going on? I’m like an architect, sitting, strapped down, watching my greatest work burn to a crisp right in front of me. And the barrier is everything that I identify with. Who I am. There’s nothing that I can do except make her feel loved, set some guidelines and hope that she doesn’t fall in love with another man. I know that she’s into the Romeo and Juliet-esque romance stories. Two people fall in love, they’re a perfect match for each other, but they’re held back from being together by the commitment they’ve made to a relationship with someone who they don’t click with the way they do with each other. So what can I do? The best thing I can do is detach. When boyfriends get caught in the cycle of limiting their significant other’s contact with other men, that’s when you start to harbor resentment. If they do indeed want to be together, I hope they can collect the courage to break off  what we have (us being the rejected duo) before they start doing anything outside the realm of friendship.

But on the flip side, I wonder if I should suck it up and try to find a career that makes a lot of money. Like maybe go into IT. I have little to no interest in that area though. The only thing I'm slightly interested in is building and designing web sites, but I've only done that as a hobby. If I go to school for IT, I would basically be starting from scratch.

354,"Hey r/advice! 

I am currently a sophomore in college, and going through some serious internal debates about where I should go in life. 

Some backstory: 
I've grown up in a single parent environment without much money; getting through high school and going to college is a huge accomplishment in the eyes of my parent because of all the hard work they put in to get me where I am today. 

The past few years, I've been managing a business that is not only successful, but it makes an impact on others around the world and for the cause I fight for. It is what I live and breathe every day. 

Here's where the real questions come in: 
I love the social aspect of college. Getting to meet people, having a purpose, and being held accountable is all great and I do enjoy it, I just cannot stand the academic side of college. I never go to classes, I'm not intending to use my major (I want to continue my business) and the major I'm in doesn't directly tie into what my business is all about. I'm learning everything on my own in my room. I'm really only here because college is ""what you do"" after high school. Not to mention I want to make my parent proud. 

Lately, I've been thinking about how going to college is good for me, but my business is good for the world. And I want to make a difference in the world, not just go through the motions, get a normal job, marry, have kids, and die.
 
All in all, I really just need some advice. School takes so much time away from what I truly want to do. Education is important, and I do intend to keep learning, but on my own schedule. I could grow my passion into something even more impactful if I had the ability to do it full time. I'm financially more than well off (at the moment) that I can work for myself, which makes me question the need for college, since most people are here for a degree, not an education. I want an education, and I don't think I'm getting that in school. 

If anyone has any thoughts or ideas, don't hold back :) Thank you all so much, and hope your days are all going well! ",26Sep2018,3
355,"I’m 20 years old, in college I have about a year left and I hate it so much. I can’t ever focus, I get below average grades, it feels so pointless. I’m only doing it because it’s “free”.  It depresses me and gives me so much anxiety. 

I really want to drop out, move to a different state, and get a job and a place for me and my girlfriend. 

I’ve had two internships so far, about to accept a 3rd one but I’m having a shit ton of anxiety about driving (commute would be around 1hour+, I’m used to it but I hate it still).  I feel like I HAVE to do these internships if I want to be successful in my field. So far I have a pretty decent resume according to recruiters. 

I also got rear ended while driving in my previous internship and was in a lot of pain, I still experience some pain while I drive or do certain things but it’s not as bad as it used to be. 


What I want is: to have my own place, live in a city and get a job that isn’t too far. 
What’s stopping me: The jobs are far from my school, so if I get my own place now id still have a commute if I was in school. 

I apologize if This post is really messy. I’m just having a panic attack and probably need to go back to therapy and maybe even take some medication again.

356,"Yes, I know I’m alive because how would I be typing this right now if I wasn’t, but anyway I would like honest, personal advice of how I can feel alive again. For sometime now, I haven’t felt genuinely happy about anything really nor have I had a genuine laugh when something that was supposed to be ‘funny’ comes up in front of me. Three years ago when I was a Freshman in college, I felt like I was having the time of my life, feeling like I was a master conversationalist and I can make friends with almost anyone, and I was always excited about anything and everything. I remember feeling truly happy at that time. Fast-forward to now, I feel like my life took quite a turn because now I don’t get excited about anything so much, I haven’t talked to the friends I had my freshman year ever since I transferred colleges which was about a year ago, I’ve gained a lot of weight and can’t stop eating no matter how hard I tell myself that if I keep this up I’ll no longer be able to fit into any of the clothes in my closet, and I’ve become extremely lazy as in I don’t want to go out as much as I used to anymore nor do I feel like taking care of my appearance so much as I was extremely anal about before. I really feel like I haven’t been myself lately and I don’t like it, but I don’t know how to go back to the way I used to be.

357,"So I just began in a new job I'm a teacher with other two are girls. I think I was naive into take this job but I needed the money so... It is almost a family company one girl is my bosses relative and the other she knows since she is a child. 
The place has no câmera I get there usually half an hour before to prepare the  classes and one of the girls is already there because she opens the establishiment my boss only arrives 1h after sometimes she doesn't even go

This girl is actually pretty nice the other is the problem. Its been 2 weeks our boss told us to check the inventary of the company like all the books and other material. She said they had a problem in the head office so it was needed a recount. It's a franchise for special kids and children with learning issues. Anyway...

We were just the 3 of us talking and shotting the breezze I made sure to not flirt with any of them the nice girl had told she had a boyfriend and the other one has too but was completely silent about that even when they began to talking about relantionships wich I stear the conversation out of the topic to avoid trouble. I din't take any hint it migh be game there but looking back now I think they was dropping clues and I was a clueless. I wouldn't try anything anyway because I'm very self concious of my self because I gained over 50 pounds since the beggining of the year. Believe me I'm not about flirting at all my self steem is less than 0 right now. Well...

We were there the nice girl had to leave and left me and the unpleasent one alone. I kept by myself she got quiet. I wasn't going to finish it in time and she helped me. As a thank you I offered her an old cd that I have od a band she said she liked. 

I don't know if she got mad that I didn't even made a pass on her or whatever but on the other day she told our boss her boyfriend got jealous of her because we were alone. Totally misleading and pushing it you know. 
My boss had a conversation with me saying that I should take care to avoid problems just be wise and all that. I said to her nothing happened and i wasn't doing anything she said she knew it was just a word of advice. 

Since them the work envirommnet has been vey dark we 3  don't talk anymore and everything I do it's tainted I guess like if I say good morning I migh be a flirtatious movement.

So 2 days ago it got out of control I think. I have 3 girl as students two of them are sisters, 6 and 11, and the other is 13. 
I was teaching them and this 11 years old said something about her ring her sister the 6 years old said it was her boyfriend and the 3 of them began to joking around. I just let them it was kid stuff to me it didn't last more them 5 minutes.

But after they left my boss called a side and said it was inapropriate because I was a men and they were girl. I get thar me as a teacher should have sttoped it, ok but the underlying assumption was that I was out of control or whatever it wasn't just a direction it was almost an accusation. 
So I said to her it wasn't working out I'd rather leave. I told i wans't hitting on anyone specially my students that were children. I couldn't be working with such a suspicious on my back like that
She said it was ok. When did I wanted to leave. I said to her that in order to not let sabotage the whole company I would be as long as she needed but it was to her find a replacement as soon as possible.

When I was going home she told me to think about if i change my mind it would be ok and for me to come earlier. Yesterday when I got there it was just my boos it would be only me and her there for an hour if I hadn't been late for 30 minutes. I was late on pourpous because I was a little suspicious at the begging


That's my history. I am straigh, male, white, a litlle wealthy, conservative the way I see it,  they would made a feast out of me and I feel like I'm walking into a trap. 
I'm afraid one of them might accuse me of rape anytime and then till I prove it my life would be over
I don't want to leave the kids hanging neither bankrupt my bosse's franchise but I don't wanna be destroyed either.

Am I being paranoid? What should I do?

359,"I'm 24 currently living in my parent's home. My last job was about three months ago, but I've been struggling to get a job and/or keep a job long term because of social anxiety. 

For over a year now, my mom who was always emotionally abusive has taken her verbal abuse to another level. She constantly calls me a pathetic loser, says I'm an embarrassment to the family, claims people will do nothing but laugh behind my back or look down on me because I'm unemployed, tells me I'm going to have a terrible future, thinks I'm still going to be leeching off her when I'm 40 years old (she doesn't even work herself), always says it would've been better off if I wasn't born because I'm so useless (even though I'm the most helpful in the family), constantly complains about how being a parent is so stressful when they have kids with issues, accuses me of not wanting to overcome my social anxiety even though I told her time and time again that it isn't that easy, blames me for everything no matter how obvious it is that something isn't my fault, can never take responsibility for her wrongdoings, and overall just keeps insulting me to my face or talking down on me to other people. 

No matter how many times I try explaining social anxiety to her, she just keeps calling me lazy, pathetic, and invalidates it. No matter how many times I call her out on her behavior, she just keeps pointing fingers back at me and/or tells me she's doing it for my own good because she cares about me. 

Just now she got into an argument with me because I was reluctant to schedule an appointment with a therapist (even though I said I was still going to) and told my dad that she no longer wants to go to Asia because there's no good in spending money on ""children like that"". 

What can I do about my mom? There's literally no way to reason with her because she doesn't see anything wrong in what she does and all she knows how to do is play victim.

So, I told her that for my own happiness and peace of mind, I don’t honestly think I could continue living with her if we weren’t romantically involved. She doesn’t really have anywhere else to go though, so I feel like I’m being awful and manipulative and basically trapping her in a relationship she doesn’t want to be in, JUST because she has no other options in terms of housing.
Am I being awful towards her for this? I’ve talked to my family about the situation and they don’t think I am, but I worry that they’re biased. Am I being unreasonable? Is there more I could be doing to help? Please let me know. Thank you in advance!

TL;DR: My girlfriend broke up with me shortly after moving in with me. She wants to renew the lease without the commitment of getting back together, because she has nowhere else to live. Am I a jerk for telling her I can’t continue living with her if we aren’t dating?",26Sep2018,0

370,"Firstly I’d like to touch on whether this post is something deserving of a post on this subreddit. I’d say yes, as it’s usually on my mind in how I can go about doing this.

So, on contrary to what people might expect I donor dislike my life. I’m not here to complain about it being awful and how I’d like to live in some story book world. 

That being said, if I wrote a book about my life I’m not sure anyone would actually find it interesting or even read it. You see my life doesn’t follow basic plot formulas, there will be no plot diagrams found here. If my life followed a narrative, and had story-arcs I’d find it interesting. However I’d like my life to be more akin to a TV show, as I don’t want it to end after the main conflict.

So my question is how can I actually accomplish this? Is there a certain frame of mind that I should be in? Should I get in trouble more often? There’s gotta be something to break my routine of boredom.

As an aside for those of you who are wondering; I’m not here asking for something to happen to  put things into action like to be crowned “chosen one” or something . I’m not wanting what’s in my life to change so much (unless like I said above I’m going about living all wrong if I want to achieve this), but rather how it’s presented - if that makes any sense.",26Sep2018,1

I did an internship as well, but it wasn't IT related like them. I tried applying for internship, but they only want students and unpaid.

I belive he is no longer taking medication but has been on all kinds for the past 5 or so years, he has been great for the last week or so with myself but there is some weird grudge he has for our mother.

he goes out to assist his friend with a shoot, he comes back and bam... full blown depression, myself being a rational person can see that he is too busy compairng himself to other but if I try to tell him that he will take it as an attack and will start going down the road of why he's no good, why we're not helping, saying he want out of this world and so on.

Now he is failing at uni but he belives its because of his lack of space and under par equiptment (in comparison to others). we have offered to give him the dining room to use for his shoots and the living room but he just comes back with an argument as to why its a stupid idea.

Our mother used to work three jobs (I was also working/supporting) and she made the fatal mistake of promising him some form or shed/sumer house for him to use as a office/study she now only works one but he is still expecting this shed/summer house. I have tried to tell him that we cannot afford to buy him what he needs (wants) but again he takes this as an attack says we are not helping and is now saying he wants to quit uni becuase he is a failure.

He tells me Im all about the money but I have been suppoting myself for the past five years (although still at home) but I no longer require my mother to buy me things such as clothing,toiletries and so on.

I have just recently lost my jobs (got another) and my mothers last jobs is also on the ropes as of typing this out but he just does not care and still is after this poxy shed while also claiming he was out of this world.

This has been the visuos cycle we have put up with for the past years. 

He needs to be kicked out but my mum doesn't want to do so as his state of mind is all over the place.

This is slowly killing my mother as she can no longer put up with it.

Tomorrow she has to perform her final presentation in order to finish her master degree, we've been practicing a lot, we studied together, made notes and planned everything, but she still is worried as hell for what might happen and she is extremely worriend she will break down during her presentation. She's being doing that with her trerapist also.

This presentation can't be avoided in any matter.

What should we do in case something like that happens? How could I try to assure her during the presentation? Should we talk with the evaluators about it in advance?

Literally anything you could say (even if those are just reassuring words, I will make her read the answers) will be helpful.

378,"42 F here. Long story short, I grew up in a very messed up home that left me feeling absolutely worthless. It was so very deeply pounded into me that I was not worth anyone's time or attention that it has affected my romantic life adversely all my adult life - the assumption that of course that cute guy won't be interested in me is so deep and so automatic that I don't know what to do about it. It's different now that I've lost a lot of weight and am attracting male attention once again, and I am making every effort to be aware of this tendency and to try to overcome it - at the moment, I'm making a point of trying to respond to eye contact from a cute guy with a smile instead of simply staying frozen on the spot - but I'm frustrated at the moment because I realize I have trouble even having those innocent celebrity crush fantasies everyone has. I am intensely aware that there's no way on earth my singer of choice would have any interest in me. It doesn't matter that I remind myself that this is fantasy, I don't want to even ever meet this guy IRL, and that fantasy never has to be realistic; I just can't get past that flat wall of knowing that there's no way he would be interested in me. How do you get past that? How do you permit yourself to have a fantasy that your celebrity crush is really into you even though you of course would not stand a chance with them in reality?

379,"Sooo, i dont know exactly how long this post is gonna be, I'll just talk about some things about my life that I think kinda suck and (if I'm not being just a lil crybaby) want advice on how to improve in any possible way.

Obs: i'm Brazilian and never properly studied English therefore there will probably be a few problems since I only know English from using the internet, gaming and music.
If there is a better subreddit to post this, please tell me and I'll post it there.
Also, because education systems are a bit different I don't know that much about your years relative to ours, maybe they're the same, maybe not, but because of that I'll just use ages instead of school years.

I was quite the class center of balance when I was about 8yo, I was ""popular"", sociable, loved going to school to interact with everybody...
Then I started using glasses and I had 2 ""physical"" problems which were 
1. My jaw started growing uncontrollably
2. I was diagnosed with a ""kind of"" allergy to the sun light (that just makes my face perma-red and it burns from time to time, but nothing serious)
(Those made me suffer a bit with bullying and that a reoccurring thing in my life to this day, I don't really care anymore but it's still present)
With these 3 thing I kinda just stopped feeling comfortable around others, and I let myself go away from interactions and being friendly in school.
At this age I lived in a building with some ""friends"" (more to neighbors) that were around the age of my sister, that is 4-5 years older than me, so there was 7 12-13 olds and me, of course they didn't want me to play with them and were pretty mean to me, further fucking up with my sociability.

Fast forward few years I'm now 12-14 myself and going to a private school (that my parents can't REALLY afford, but they always did their best for me and that really puts on me some ""pressure"" to do it for them rather than for myself) and in this school I'm not only an introvert but also I feel really out of place with everybody besides me having all the latest and greatest and i have a quite good sense that if I ask something to my parents they'd probably buy it for me even if it fucks up their finances, therefore I won't ask them for anything.

As I went to having 14-15 in school I started working at my dad's Shop (sort of a small hardware store with domestic items, construction stuff...) and started paying for myself with that job and that really helped me with a bit of self steem.

Now, to the real problem:
In that 12-14yo period i wanted to participate in the social part of the class, even though i was pretty socially awkward and because of that i used to lie a lot to give people a better vision of myself than i really had. In the time it actually worked well enough so that I could get into the hard-studying and almost nerdy group of the class, but at least I had a group to be in. Some of those lies white just White lies like: ""Yeah, I also loved playing that game when I was younger"" (I hadn't played it, I just happened to know the game because of how much I use the internet). But some of them weren't that casual, one of them very specifically fucks me over constantly that being: ""I have a girlfriend"" (basically everyone in the school had a bf/gf except me, so I felt bad and created that Camila character in my mind so that I could have details if anyone asked).

Fast forward a few more months my parents (married for 26 years) started fighting and it pretty much ruined my safe place to be that was my home, few weeks later they call me and my sister to ""have a talk"", at the moment we both realized what was going to happen and we were right, they were preparing for a divorce.

In the same fucking day, I was stressed and really feeling down (also pretty salty and giving 0 shits to the world) and a girl in that group of friends came up to me and casually said: ""...I kinda like you a lot, would you date me?"" (She knew that I ""have a (non-existent) gf"" atm) she chose just the worse timing possible and I know it's not her fault but fuuuckk.
My pissed off reaction for some reason was a dry: ""fuck you, why'd you say that for me right now?"" the intention wasn't to hurt her or anything but of course that with this kind of response to a confession there isn't much else to it.

This affected deeply our daily group as we were pretty much the 2 that always started talking with the other, as we were uncomfortable we kinda just let the group dad's away, everybody was still friends, we just didn't talk half as much as before. I (of course) started blaming that on me and once again started closing myself to the world and becoming the extreme introvert I was few years before. Few more weeks later, she quits the school and I pretty much just enter depression.

Fast forward 2 more years, I'm the only one of that group that stayed from middle school to high school in the same place. I now have a group of friends that are into some of the same stuff I am, that being anime, games and international music (most of you may don't know but in Brazil there is this music genre called Funk Carioca that usually have lyrics related to sex, drugs, life on the favelas and so on. That's by far the most popular national genre amongst the people of my age and I really can't accept that being even called music at all).

In that group I felt actually pretty good, I now had my money to go out and have fun (which I didn't) and I have people that actually have interests in common with me to talk about. And then the girl who had quit the school because of me came back and it's in my class once again. I make 0 effort to talk to her since it's still pretty bad for me what I did to her.

She keeps talking that it doesn't matter, we can just be friends (but at this point we kinda have no common interests). She goes to the ""party people"" group and I stay with the gaming/internet group. We don't talk too much but it still haunts me that I made her cry (I also used to like her so I hated myself for turning down on her) and for screwing up my first opportunity to have a existing gf and once more i closed myself (a little).

That's pretty much present at this time (I'm now 17 almost 18), but now, the ""never having a gf"" bothers me the most, because now instead of everyone having a gf besides me, everyone has sex and talk about how great it is and that pisses me off because I know it's all my fault and that i could have a social life that was a lot better, the bullying doesn't help either but as I said, I don't really care anymore)

With all of that said:

1. Yeah, fuck me

2. Any advices with how to become less socially awkward and if possible a way to improve my self-esteem

3. I really can't tell if i ""need"" a girlfriend or if that's just my subsconcious telling me to be more alike everybody else is.

4. I'm not the choosing beggars type but avoid the usual stuff since i probably already tried it.

Tl;Dr: I'm kinda shit and really socially awkward, hot to become better?

380,"Hi, my girlfriend flooded the bathroom of the new apartment we moved into. She has a medical condition and can be forgetful, and left the sink on.

Management knew about the broken sink along with a few other issues, which they told us they would be fixed by move-in.

Landlord claims it's 100% our fault because she left it on. They gave us an invoice, but the purchase of the repair items (paint, light fixtures, etc) were dated a month prior to our move-in.

Recently I started a job at a Crown Corporation and felt that everything was going smoothly until a few days ago.

I take medications to help and do my best to lessen my odour which hasn’t been an issue until now.

Now I wish I did disclose my issues as I feel wronged and discriminated against. 

I’ve been gaslighted, yelled at, and ignored by all but my supervisor. I work on a small team which comes with a heavy workload. Every day at this job feels like a living hell and my contract is far from over.

Today I was beckoned from the office by a mid-level coworker “to chat”.

For instance, he went to a barber last week who didn’t satisfy my brother, and my brother got out of the seat, stormed out of the barber shop, and cursed in that man’s face and didn’t pay him anything. He then called the barber threateningly on the phone saying how he gave him horrible reviews, calling him name like “piece of shit” and “lowlife” and “horrible at his job”, and the “worst person in the planet with no taste.” 

He also calls my mom a fat cow, tells her to go die, consistently mocks her being overweight and sleeping all day. Comparing her to animals like buffalos and cows and yaks. 

Earlier today I was conversations with my mom how I failed on an exam in college during my past, and how the professor passed me and how it was a miracle. Also minor stuff like how I sometimes sneaked answers during exams. It was none of my brother’s business, but he butt his head in the convo and called me a “fucking cunt” and how “I’m a failure” and how “I’m a stupid bitch who’s not good at anything” 

A month ago he cursed at an old lady in our neighborhood for asking him why he was being noisy in our backyard, and told her “none of your business you bitch” and came back home to us and gloated about how he told her off. 

The other day I was also talking to my mom about sex (woman to woman talk) and my brother barged into the room we were in and started shaking me violently and I was pretty scared for my life. He was like raising his fist and calling me a whore and “what did you fucking say?” I was so scared i started screaming and crying, but I was more scared about my eyes because he was in my face and his fist was raised close to my head...

Today he asked me to come smell the chicken seasoning he was cooking to see if it seemed tasty, and I was applying to jobs on my phone in the living room and told him “I could smell it from over here” and he walked into the room calling me a “fucking bitch” and “I hope you die” and I said ...”Excuse me?” And he said “you lied, you fucking bitch. You can’t smell it from there.”

383,"I am in my forth year of college. Throughout the past 4 years, I've changed my major at least 5 times. Last year, I narrowed it down to Biology. Now this year, I've narrowed it down to microbiology. I love it and I am really enjoying connecting all the dots with life and its biotic processes. Since it has taken me FOREVER to figure out what I want to do, I am pretty behind on all my major classes. Achieving my bachelor isn't directly my issue -- I'll be able to graduate a few semesters late. My issue is that my degree needs something beyond a bachelors in order to be somewhat practical.

Two options stick out to me the most: doing further research while being a professor, or being a pharmacologist. Both of these require school past my bachelors. This is what stresses me out. I am 21 years old and don't have enough credentials to land any sort of entry job in my field of study, so I'm stuck with an unskilled minimum wage job. I already have debt from student loans, and further education will stack that debt. Also, I JUST found out I want to pursue this path while others have had this figured out form their freshman year. They've already completed a bunch of side-steps to help them with their future postgraduate education. I haven't.

I feel like something as serious as becoming a professor or a pharmacologist requires years of preparation. Preparation I don't have at the moment. Is it too late?

I am a parent of two boys (not biologically related to him but he treated them as his). I was pregnant with him and at 15 weeks along and that is why I secretly saw him still. I was scared and wanted him involved with his baby. I even sent the judge a letter begging for “peaceful contact” which was denied (rightfully so in the end). 

In the end, he hurt me worse. 4 months later. I was naive and stupid. He never hurt my children during the two incidents. After the second assault I lost my baby and have gone no contact entirely.

I think he served about a month in jail and got out on probation. I signed up for vine to receive important information.

However, CPS got involved and I am still in court with them 6 months later. They want to take my children (thankfully they keep losing in court- for now). I work full time, my boys are in school, I go to therapy for ptsd, I have no contact with my abusive ex. And I am consistent with all of that. 

I went to court today for a hearing about setting a trial date. I was told over and over again by my family, my attorney, the caseworkers- I am not a good mom nor a good person because I am unstable and allowed all of this to happen.

I can look for work, but I come from a low-income family so I’ve never really had money.

I didn’t recognize them initially but when I did I was so angry I was shaking.  They kept asking for me to “please listen and to calm down” but I just lost it.   I grabbed them by the neck and I hit them.  I busted their lip but I swear it wasn’t my intention.   I felt bad immediately after.  I was just so angry.

399,"Hi

I broke up with my ex around a month ago we dated for 4 years She was my first girlfriend and the only girl I'd had sex with. She ended up cheating on me twice within a week and is now with the second person she cheated on me with. First off I'll start by saying I'm not at all regretful that we broke up I don't want her back and I am happier in many many ways without her. she didn't ever really respect me and never really invested time or emotion in me or the relationship and we were largely incompatible and she wasn't the best person to me, I am however feeling some things which I don't really know how to overcome.

Namely I keep associating sex and women in general with her, its hard to remove myself from this as Im not too sure Im in a position to have sex with anyone in the near future. I keep visualising her cheating and I feel like I may not find anyone else in life I can trust and love I realise this may be normal but I guess I'm looking for advice on how best to cope and replace these thoughts with more positive ones.

401,"Well, you read the title, My grandpa insists on inviting his friend to my destination wedding. It's a very intimate wedding, only family and our two closest friends (as best man and maid of honour). We are only inviting 20 people, my mother and brother, my only two grandparents (of which we are speaking), my uncles family, my fiance's grandma, my moh and her fiance (like my brother and sister) and his best man and his wife (like his brother and sister). Plus our videographer and MUA are our friends so we just invited them to stay and use it as a vacation as well (All things they were aware of from day 1) and my best friend growing up who is essentially another member of the family... and it's so intimate that i even considered not inviting him, not that i don't love him, but i wanted to keep it very small. 

So you get my point... well at one point I get taken to lunch by my grandma saying my grandpa wants his friend... we'll call her ""Mary"" to go to the wedding. He wants Mary and her husband and her two kids ""James"" and ""Danielle"" to be there. And I strongly protested it, my ceremony venue only allows 20 and with my camera team I'm already pushing 20! I could lose my permit to get married there if anyone else were to be there.They kept telling me Mary's done so much for you, OP! You *HAVE* to have her there because of everything she's ever done for you. The problem is, I don't know what she's supposedly done for me. I don't even know Mary's last name, or what she does for work, I've never even been to her house... I mean, if Mary was dating my grandpa I would understand, okay, you're family, you guys have history yadda yadda but that's not the case. 

So when we went out to Colorado to check out the ceremony and reception venues, my grandma was asking the people ""if someone just showed up during the ceremony we can't ask them to leave can we?"" like she was implying they would just let them show up invited or not! I eventually was able to tell them the kids (who are in their 30s, and I've never even met them!) are not allowed to go. I keep telling them I'm not inviting Mary and her husband either, but it came down to the ultimatum ""You either invite Mary to the wedding or I'm not going and i won't be there to walk you down the aisle"" from my grandpa.... So I'm fucking stuck now in this situation of either don't have my grandpa who raised me at my wedding or invite this lady that I don't know....

I eventually caved and said fine I will invite *ONLY* Mary and no one else, not the kids, not the husband JUST Mary. And they agreed to this, I mean when we booked the reception space I fell in love with it because it had this massively long 20 person table, just the right size. and since there's only 19 (my videographer won't be dining with us at the table--yes i am providing him a meal-- but i don't personally know him) there's room for her to sit at the table. But in the last couple weeks I received a phone call saying her husband ""David"" is also going to be there because he's of ill health and she doesn't like leaving him by himself, and since the kids will not be at their personal cabin (i lucked out on this, they're not staying in our family cabin) to keep an eye out for him and he just *hates* being alone. Like dude, no! I've already been strong armed into inviting you against my will to my own freaking wedding and now you want to bring another person that there's no room for?! And then my grandpa's like, ""oh it'll be fine, we'll pull up a folding chair or something and I'll just sit in that!"" **-groan-** No, you can't do that because it'll look terrible in photos. I only bought 20 plates. I only bought 20 of freaking everything you don't understand I can't afford to support your two friends coming to my wedding that I am paying for.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, seriously, I put the 15k up for this wedding, and he wants to front that he put the down payment on the cabin, okay, sure, yes, but I'm paying him back for that so honestly he's not actually paying for that and it's not fair of him to do this. To make things worse they only bring it up when my fiance is not around, and my fiance is literally furious to such a point that he doesn't really even want to go to our own wedding because of this and I don't know where to go from here. I feel like I'm being treated like a chi- actually no I am being treated like a child, every time i spend any money on myself that isn't towards the wedding (consider i make 800 a month, 250 goes towards bills and the other 500 or so to the wedding) I'm told I'm being irresponsible and not using my money wisely. 

&amp;#x200B;

And, before anyone says ""just don't invite him"" ""pick another person to walk you"" etc (i've struggled with this for a bit and talked to a few people but im still at a loss) I literally can't. The only reason we're getting married in 2019 and not 2024 on our 6 year anniversary like we planned is because my grandpa is experiencing end stage renal failure and I have always wanted him to walk me down the aisle so time is not really on my side here because he's dying. We moved the whole thing up closer just for him and I feel he's just taking advantage of me.

403,"The short of it. I've been renting a room in a house with three other grad students. We all moved in around the same time about a year ago. We've had zero issues and we are all rather ""low-key"". One of them moved out a while back and the landlord just brought in a new roommate about a month ago. 

He has a trashy personality, is a heavy smoker, and closet drug user. He doesn't even go to school like the rest of us (he's a used car salesman lol). The house smells like cigarettes now, he smokes inside at night and I've found him acting erratically at odd hours, clearly high as fuck on something. But he keeps to himself at least.

I've told the landlord my grievances but nothing has changed. The landlord and I have a good relationship and he does seem concerned. We are tenants at will (no lease). The house is in a good location and at a fair price so I'm not leaving but my quality-of-life has definitely gone down. My other roommates expressed similar concerns but the new guy and I share the 2nd floor, they do not. 

How do I go about telling the landlord to either reduce my rent or give this guy 30-days notice? Any other suggestions?

404,"Basically I need to know if i'm in the right or the wrong...

A bit of context:  
I'm a 17 year old boy and I go to my dads every weekend, and I have been doing since I was 10ish due to some family related issues. Every time I go to my dads I spent all day every day of the weekend inside because I didn't really have a social life and I never made friends where he lived, I was quite happy staying inside minding my own business playing games and doing coursework etc... very recently I got a boyfriend which obviously I want to see, but every time I ask my dad if I can go out (not because I want permission but more because I'm trying to be polite) he says yes, but he also tries to guilt trip me by saying ""Yes you can go but I wont be seeing you much anymore, maybe you can try and sort something out in the week instead"" (because I'm at my mums in the week so its not in his ""time"" with me), even though in the week I have college which I'm out the door at 7am and only get home for 5:30pm with work/coursework on top of that, which I have told him, so I can't really sort anything out in the week.

On top of this he doesn't say out loud but I know he's thinking that he doesn't like me going out on the Saturdays to see him, because he said specifically ""I haven't seen you in 21 days and it upsets me"" even though he sees me from 5pm on Fridays, morning and lunch of Saturday and all day Sunday, but somehow he doesn't count this as me being with him.

He also said ""I wouldn't mind if you went out every couple of weeks instead of every week"", but even then my last ex I only saw once every month because of distance and he was still being rude over it...

I don't know what to do because he always has said I need to go out and get a social life, he even tried to get me to join clubs to try and get me out there a while back before he gave up because I wasn't having any of it, and now I am going out he says he's upset because he doesn't see me anymore.

Am I being rude? Am I in the wrong? I just want general advice because people are saying that he needs to let me grow up.

415,"**TL;DR at the bottom. I'm desperate. I appreciate any help I can get.**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm from Eastern Europe. My parents fought a lot, and they still fight every now and then. It was so bad that the first time I told my mother to divorce, I was 11. I had no neighbors, so until I read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" in the 10th grade, I never really had any friends, except for my brother, who is 3 years older. I needed a freaking book to teach me how to be a functional human being. Needless to say, I've never got much validation or encouragement, for anything I did. My parents were too busy fighting, and I had 0 friends to rely on.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't have **BIG** dreams when I was young. I didn't want to be a president or a medic, or a lawyer. I just wanted to be a writer and make video games. Even though I wasn't reading any books, I was playing video games. And I didn't posses the technical know-how to make fully fleshed video games, so I just wrote stories inspired by them or inspired by the cartoons I was watching. But I was not encouraged to do either of these. Instead, I could be a lawyer, or a medic. Only after someone told my parents just how well a programmer is paid did they agree with such a dream.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I was raised with a mindset that ""I can't doesn't exist. You can say you don't want to, but not that you can't."" I was also a bright child, mostly because I didn't have much of a childhood - I was just sitting at the PC and reading articles on the internet all day, when I wasn't trying to get my parents to stop fighting. And because I was a bright child in grades 1-4, my mother and most of everyone around me treated me as if I was some sort of genius. I am not.

&amp;#x200B;

I was always the best in class, I didn't want to disappoint the people around me. Especially, I didn't want to disappoint my mother. I didn't want to become a problem for her, she had quite a few depressive episodes because of her failing relationship. I had a great deal of hobbies over the years, but I couldn't truly stick to any hobby, because I felt this immense pressure to get straight 10 (A) in every class, so I worked a ton on school.

&amp;#x200B;

I got in an ""elite"" high-school studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Though, in all actuality, we had 18 to 20 different classes each year, from Literature to Biology to Computer Science. It was awful. I've always had a bad opinion about the educational system because of all the bull I went through, but 11th grade was my boiling point. In the second semester, there were two times when all I did for 2 weeks was to eat, sleep (6 hours at most, usually 4-5 hours per night), and study. I've had my fair share of mental breakdowns because of the workload, but never this big.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since I was young, I started to swallow all the ""guru"" bull you see on the Internet. Stuff such as ""Find your dream and only work towards it,"" or ""Follow your passion,"" but I have about a dozen different passions, or ""Find a job where you have meaning."" Because of that hard mental breakdown and of the ""Decide on what you want to do with your life, **NOW**"" bull, I had a revelation in the 11th grade: my role was to change the educational system. I was already thinking of how I would make the lives of everyone around me so much better. I think I was just seeking the validation of someone, anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I've cycled through a lot of different career choices, from writer to actor to programmer. But in high-school I was set on becoming a programmer, until I wasn't anymore. In the last part of the 11th grade and in the whole 12th grade, I didn't really care for school. I started my dream of changing the educational system by making a YouTube channel where i gave all the advice I would've wanted to receive. My teachers found that channel and in January of this year, after a mental breakdown because of a ""talk"" from my main teacher, where she basically criticized the hell out of me and everything I did, I put everything on private. What followed were a ton of depressive episodes and questions such as ""What the hell do I do with my life?""

&amp;#x200B;

I did finish high-school with a respectable 9,64 out of 10, and I got an average of 8,52 / 10 on the national final exam which everyone takes after they finish high-school. The problem was Computer Science, where I got a 6,85 / 10, because I didn't really revise anything, and the 12th grade of CS isn't part of the national final exam, so I didn't know much of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

After taking that exam, I was finally sort of relieved of stress, but now another problem arose: where should I go to college? I had one month to decide what college to choose. We don't have majors, the curriculum is predefined. Also, we get to go to college for free if we pass the qualifications required by the college. So it's obvious that such a ""wonder child"" as how everyone sees myself must go to college and must go **NOW**. I've thought about skipping the year so I could focus on studying Computer Science, so I could pass the college entrance exams in 2019. But this was out of the question. I needed to go to college **NOW.**

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really care much for the educational system anymore. It's bad, yeah, but it's not for me to change it. I can hardly talk to people - I don't know how to socialize or explain technical stuff to people who don't know tech. My brother can do this, I cannot. Since I didn't really talk with anyone until the 10th grade, I don't know how to ""simplify"" my vocabulary. Also, because I've only saw how people talk in books and video-games, my talk is filled with ""big"" words, just because that's how I thought people talk, and now it's become ingrained in my personality.

&amp;#x200B;

It also isn't helpful that I know more English than I do my native tongue. This is because I've filled my time with YouTube videos and video-games, and they were all in English, so ever since 6th grade I got to a point where I even think in English, and my native tongue became sort of a second language for me. So I'm not really the best at talking with about 80% of the the people around here, because they think I'm just trying to show off and show them how more intelligent I am. This has always been a curse for me: I just wanted to make friends, and everyone thought I was being arrogant because of my clumsiness when it comes to talking.

&amp;#x200B;

But I was incredibly interested in Machine Learning and AI. And I still am interested in the subject. But 8,52 wasn't enough to get me into an Economic Computer Science college, and for the other CS colleges I needed to take exams that I was 100% sure I'd fail because of being unprepared. So I swallowed the hard pill, went to study the Science of Education / Pedagogy. On Monday I'll start, but I am already feeling like I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not really interested in how to better the educational system. I haven't read a single book on the subject, and I don't follow any such YouTube channels. But I find Machine Learning and AI interesting, and I'd love to make video games (I've dabbled with game engines in the past). But I cannot drop out and just do nothing for a whole year. The only one in my family who would understand my reasons is my brother. Everyone wants me in college. But I feel that the only reason I will start Pedagogy was because I sought validation for the fact that I had a higher purpose, like changing the education system. I was, and I think I still am, so desperate for validation and so fed up with school, that I ended up in a college I think will be utterly useless to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about going to my high school mate's Computer Science college instead and follow the courses with him, instead of going to the Pedagogy courses. You can attend the lectures even though you aren't part of that program. And I've thought about studying Computer Science for a full year most of the day. This way I could pass the exam and go to the CS college. But then what am I going to do with Pedagogy? I've always been the ""Wonder Boy"" for everyone around, and I don't know how to lie, to tell them I'm ok in college and I'm passing all of my exams. I could get by without my parents knowing I don't actually go to my college, but I'm also thinking that my mother would overreact, telling me I don't trust her and that I should've told her and she would've understood. But she never even entertained the thought of me staying at home for one year.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I navigate this problem? And how do I keep myself from always thinking that I've made the wrong choice, no matter what I do? Maybe this is also just a whim and I really don't know how to do anything well. I've had way too many passions: writing, 3D modelling, special effects, video editing, programming, drawing, sculpting in clay. Yet, I've never settled for one. I just cannot settle. I feel like I'm too much of a generalist.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also the problem that we don't really have money, so I feel like a parasite for staying at home one year and doing nothing. I do freelance, but I don't make much. It's so hard for me to decide what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

This was long and stupidly drawn out, and I don't think anyone's going to actually read this. If you do read this, I have no words to tell you how much I appreciate it. I don't think I'll get any replies, mostly because of the sheer length of this, but it's always great to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even sure what question to ask. What is your opinion on this? What would you do if you were me? How do I know this isn't just another whim? I think I need a therapist more than I need to know what college to go to.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel there's so much stuff that I should have also said. There are so many variables. This already is the abridged version of my story. I am sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;DR: Studied Computer Science in high school. Had a mental breakdown because of school workload - 20 different classes, I felt pressured to get straights As - during the 11th grade. I swallowed the ""guru"" bull that ""You need to find your dream and go all in"" and I've decided my dream is to change the educational system. I stopped studying for school and instead focused on my ""dream."" When I finished the 12th grade, my ""dream"" was lukewarm, but I still wanted to play video games, make video games, and develop Machine Learning and true AI. But because I didn't care much for school, I was unprepared for the Computer Science entrance exams. I was pressured by my family and everyone around me to go to a college** ***NOW*****, so I chose Science of Education / Pedagogy. I was ok with this for a month and a half, but now I am having my (I don't even know the number anymore) mental breakdown, because I'd much rather just develop AI and not have to deal with so many people - I'm introverted. I could go to the Computer Science lectures with a high school friend and study CS in my free time as well to pass the exams next year, but I also feel immense pressure to go to Pedagogy and study and attend the lectures and get good grades. I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid that if I leave Pedagogy I'll regret this as well. Either because I'll feel that it really was my dream to change the educational system or because everyone will hate me for dropping that college. I really don't know what to do.**",26Sep2018,1

418,"I've been with my girlfriend since late March and she has been a driving force for me. Encouraging me to return to college, sending me a dozen job postings on Craigslist for quick work, talking to me for hours some days just because she loves me. I've never been more appreciative to have met someone. We established we wanted a transpararnt relationship early on and kept our word. We bonded quickly over stories of depression, bullying, insecurities that define us. One day she tells me about her poetry, and naturally I'm very excited to hear about her creative outlet. I ask to read some of her work, and she agrees. I'm handed her phone with a typed note, ad I don't have a copy now I can't repost it but at the end it says, ""And mommy doesn't know that daddy touched me"". I wept. I was devastated knowing such a positive, strong individual was raped by her father. She began to explain in greater detail what that meant. Since the age of 5, her biological father was forcing her to perform oral sex, as well as intercourse. He touched her at night while she slept as well, which is why she jolts awake sometimes If I touch her or roll over on to her. Yesterday, my girlfriend told me she feels like she's shutting down emotionally. She told me it happens around this time of year every year. Honestly, I don't know everything her father did but I know he's why she hates holidays. The actions of her biological father have caused and will cause her a lifetime of grief, trauma, PTSD episodes and many other struggles. She brought up what he did to her online in conversation and he denied anything ever happened. Her mother stills talks about her biological father, one of her brothers still talks directly to him and also denies that her biological father did what she said he did. Just today I searched for him online, and found him easily. I know his name, I know his face, and some other relevant information. Her biological father was never reprimanded, punished, scorned for what he did and is indirectly continuing to do. I don't know what I want to do, but he damn well doesn't deserve any more time not being recognized as an incestuous pedophile and a rapist. I want nothing more than what's right. I want my girlfriend to be relieved of the symptoms caused by her biological father. We're together and she has my whole heart, I'm simply stressed I can't do more to help her.

425,"My wife has consistently been against letting me go to my best friends wedding (in 10 days) ever since she found out she was pregnant and due close to the wedding date. 

Now that the baby is born, I brought the topic up again and she started crying saying things like, “I wouldn’t be able to live if anything happened to you”,  “how can you choose your friend over the baby?”, “I will be worried sick the whole time you are there.” 

Her biggest fear, albeit irrational, is of me taking a plane. 

She kind of has a point. We live a four hour flight away. She would be all alone with the baby in our city. Her family is all overseas. My family is in another part of the country. She is a stay at home mom. 

But still, it’s hard to say no to my friend. He keeps asking me “so are you going to make it to the wedding?” and each time my response is, “I’m still working on it.”  

But alas, the wife won’t budge. 

So, I’m getting pressure from both sides. I’m afraid if I go to the wedding, the wife will never forgive me. If I don’t go, I’ll lose one of my best, if not best friend.

I think they don’t believe in me so it’s like they look at me as a loser and don’t support me. I’m not into drugs and I really don’t do a bunch of bad stuff. I’ve tried really hard to be moral and upstanding but where I fail is in school. I have struggled with depression because I have never fit in and I am a loner. I feel like I have a veil between me and others where I know they won’t get me so I like to keep to myself and just think about stuff all the time. I don’t fit in with people my age and I get along pretty well with people older than me. I have a difficult time focusing in school and although I understand concepts and engage with my teachers more, I don’t do as well grade wise. I take information in slowly and in great detail. I want to actually take a while to understand and think about stuff but in school my style of thinking makes me underperform. Right now I work in a cafe and I don’t make enough to move out because I live in an expensive area. I am so depressed that I don’t have energy to do a whole lot about it. My family really values school so I look worthless and like a failure to them because I never got a degree. It sucks because so many people I know tell me I’m very intelligent and they are surprised I don’t do well in school. My parents have a total of 3 divorces that I lived through so I’m scared of relationships and I got bullied a lot in school when I was younger so I learned to keep to myself even more. Right now I am doing an online school for software development just to scrape a living but I feel I’m dying inside. I always loved creating things and I thought I would do more with my life than live in an office. I’m thinking of going back to school but I literately get depressed and fail at it. My parents basically told me to stop trying and that they will only help me if I get into a trade job. But I want to create art and do something creative. I tried to do construction but I’m so cerebral and in my head all the time that I tend too be unaware of my surroundings and I make big mistakes. That’s not because I don’t work hard, my employers have always told me I am one of the hardest workers they’ve ever had. I don’t talk a whole lot but when I get an opportunity to, people usually tell me that I have really well thought out ideas and that I have amazing insight. I think that is my strength in life. I usually overthink and analyze things from multiple sides which helps me to understand and relate to most people. It sucks though because it’s not valuable in the concrete world. I feel like my greatest strengths are things that don’t get valued and my greatest weaknesses are things people expect from each other. I am entirely cognizant of it but I’ll never be as naturally good at being normal as others are. I don’t know what to do with myself. Honestly I want to get a degree and succeed so much. I am really really hard on myself and I don’t want to settle but at this point I am about to cast away my dreams to survive.

432,"I'm 24 years old. Ever since I was 17 I have worked at a local funeral home owned by my step grandmother. She's in her 80's. I'm her assistant as well as having some other roles. We have never had much of a family relationship but our business relationship is mostly good. She has always paid me decently and although she is not the easiest person to work with I have always made it work. Make about 28k per year including good health insurance.

I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology but I had a change of heart and I'm now in school for engineering. Because of this, I have a lot of experience in math and I was recently offered a job to be a math teacher for my local high school. I would teach Algebra 2, geometry, and math for college readiness. They would start me out at $35.5k per year with decent health insurance.

I decided to take the job and my boss accepted it at first but she has since told me that she really needs me to stay and she's willing to match their salary. I had already verbally agreed to take the teaching job. Both decisions would have their pros and cons.

My current job is pretty easy. It's 9-5 and I usually have enough time to study so that I don't have to do any school work at home. But it's not very fulfilling. It's the safe option.

If I took the new job, it would be a new experience and I'm sure that I would enjoy it, I love teaching people things and I really like math as well. But my ultimate focus is my school and if I take this job I obviously won't be able to do homework while I'm teaching so I'm afraid that it might be a little bit too much on my plate. I'm really not sure how intensive a high school math teaching job will be. They basically have lesson plans for me for the whole year already but I'm not sure what else goes into it.

My current boss is emphasizing how much of a help I am and how much she needs me but over the years she has not shown her appreciation so clearly. She can be very cold and downright mean sometimes, but I suppose every boss gets like that from time to time, especially since she's in her 80's.

I really just don't know what to do. I do have loyalty to my current boss but I have already basically agreed to take the new job so no matter what I do I'm going to disappoint someone. I should mention that I will only be in the area for another year and a half or so and then I will be moving to another town in my state to attend a university there for engineering. I'm taking care of my prerequisites right now so this job is only going to be a part of my life until then. Even so, it feels like a very big decision and I feel like I've thought about it as much as I can think about it and that decision has not become any easier.

However, since I do not use any social media, someone I know notified me that my friend’s sister (age 17) posted on Snapchat and Instagram about how much of a crappy present it was and how the person who gifted it was a real peasant/low class scum, even using some stupid hashtag like Peasant Present.

442,"My husband (25) has a 4 year old daughter on the other side of the country. Joint legal custody. 
It has been only 2 years and we are going back to court for the 2nd time. His parents pay the legal fees and the travel fees (3k every time we get to see her) because we can’t afford it. They are about to get another 20k in debt (on top of the first 20k). 
His daughter is 4 and is so manipulated by the mother that she calls my husband by his name instead of “dad”. She gets on the phone and screams she hates him and he’s not her family. This happens every day. And we can’t do anything about it. 

It’s likely his child support is going to be raised to half of his take home pay. Even if we sell our car that we make payments on, we will still end with a negative account balance every month. We make good money but his ex doesn’t work, so child support is sky high. We get to see his daughter once a year, and that’s only because of my husbands parents. 

The courts continue to be against us. The mother left the child in the car for 2 hours and was arrested for it. Then was arrested for forgery. She still got primary custody, to everyone’s shock. After 2 years she is attacking us again for more money, and we have none to give. She is living the high life and is about to marry someone who pays for everything. She teaches the child that this new man is her dad and my husband is nothing. She is on food stamps illegally, which we have reported her for. Still nothing. Yet we struggle to pay our bills, and this is BEFORE his child support is raised and more court fees.

So last winter I swear I just... hit a new low. I didn’t know at the time but I was super depressed, super anxious and very manipulative to my online friends (Discord). I was only online schooled so I only had online friends. 

This led to them all leaving me at once and telling others how awful I was. This lead to me deleting all social media and going off grid for months. 

It didn’t hit me until just a few days ago how awful I was to them. i feel ashamed it took me so long, and I’ve reached out to them all and apologized. Some even wanted to keep in touch with me and we’ve been chatting over discord. 

I’m now hitting a new low where It’s hitting me so hard how bad I treated them. I snuck back into the old discord server we had and saw them talking terribly about me a few months ago. I know they have every right to be angry but it still stings, ya know?

I’m so angry at myself and ashamed. I feel myself sinking into this deep depression again. I just deleted discord and plan to stay off it for a while. I’m pretty confident I’ve rooted out my old manipulative tendencies, so I know I’ve gotten better. My old friends said I have too.

The second job (Electrician down on Freemont Street) however, is way better in pay, 20 bucks just starting, which in my opinion is a decent wage. However, the benefits aren’t as nice as the first company but the money is good. From what I’ve read, there’s not growth or company advancement.

I'm a freshman in high and we're only 3-4 weeks into school, so a transition at this point wouldn't be too hard, however the real engineering stuff doesn't start until junior year and I can drop out at that point too. This program comes with a project called the Capstone which is essentially a two year long project (junior and senior year) that is centered around engineering and creating something. Every time I imagine this project I am reminded of how much I don't belong in engineering. My original decision to take the course was because of the benefits, but now I'm starting to second guess myself. 

As I see it, I have three main options:

1. Drop out now and take less APs and get less benefits, but be able to take courses that are related to finance rather than engineering. (Freshman year the only difference would be Honors Biology instead of AP Biology and a business/econ class instead of engineering)
2. Drop out after sophomore year and then continue with regular high school, but wasting two electives on engineering. (Plus side: I will have taken AP Bio and AP Chem, whereas the prior option has me taking the honors version of the courses.)
3. Hold out all four years and for the Capstone project try to think of a way to relate an invention to finance/economics. (Much easier said than done. I have spent weeks trying to think of something that would satisfy this, but none of it works.)

Almost every option has a tradeoff and I have no idea which one is the one for me. Please Reddit, help me.",26Sep2018,2
457,She always complains to me about how her boyfriend is really overprotective and super controlling and has trust issues with her. Should i convince her to break up with her boyfriend or do nothing at all?,26Sep2018,2
458,"Hi, I am a highschool student who is having some trouble. I have identified my goals in life, and that is to be a sucessful entrepreneur and I have been working really hard to get the best grades I can, and do the best in school as possible. While I am working my ass off my friends are all about having fun and partying. I am starting to think that I need to find some friends more like me, who will stop at nothing to reach their goals. I am not sure what to do to be honest. Any advice would be nice. Thanks!",26Sep2018,2
459,"I guess before we met, this guy wanted to be with her but she turned him down. The guy then proceeded to stalk and harass her for months. It got so bad that She had to move to a different part of the city. She barely told me today. She's tried to get a restraining order but the cops denied it. I don't know what to do. I want to confront this dude but I don't know if that's the right move (plus I don't know who the guy is)  ",26Sep2018,0
460,"I’m beyond 100% positive that my boyfriend has never done anything with her and is not attracted to her. He has expressed that his roommate could do a lot better and that she’s unattractive.
His roommate is also his childhood best friend and I cannot see him betraying his best friend. So there’s nothing to be worried about but I still don’t like it. She does make me feel threatened because she’s attempting to do nice things for my boyfriend that I should be doing. My boyfriend does reject a lot of her offers though. 

First things first, she had told me that she found my boyfriend really attractive. She did this in front of her boyfriend and to me. I found this really strange. She also informed me that she has asked him to join in on a threesome and he rejected. So I know that she’s sexually attracted to him.
She offers to bring him his lunch to work on her day off. She doesn’t even do this for her bf. I don’t even do this for my bf either. My bf is capable of packing and bringing his own lunch. My bf obviously declines.
She purchases groceries for him and under guise of them being for her boyfriend. But it’s definitely not. Her boyfriend is a vegan. She purchases meat and clearly non vegan things and goes “oh well, op’s bf can eat them!” 
Her and my bf have semi similar work schedules and she likes to hangout at the apartment when her bf is at work and when my bf is at home. I just find this weird as I hated being alone with her bf in the apartment. 
She has cheated on her ex bf with her current bf so she’s probably more open to cheating.
She tries to walk in on us. She has tried to open our door when it’s closed.

462,"Throwaway!!
Listen, I’m going to preface this with a few things.

1. I know drinking is illegal. I know it’s wrong. I know it’s dangerous. I’m on here asking for help with my situation, not to be told not to drink because tbh, it’s not gonna change my mind.

2. Spring break is still pretty far out, so I gotta lot of time to figure this out.


Basically, I’m going on a spring break trip for my senior year. Many seniors in my class are coming with parents, along with me. At the time of the break I’ll be eighteen, so it will be illegal for me to buy or drink. My parents won’t get alcohol for me either. I have ways to get it in my hometown, but since we’re flying, I’m thinking I won’t be able to buy it at home and bring it with me (unless I actually could? Idk.) Anyways, how do y’all recommend my friends and I get alcohol on our spring break? I don’t want to get in legal trouble.",26Sep2018,1
463,"So me and my boyfriend of 2 years came to our home town/state to visit our families. My boyfriend is 25 and his mom is 49. We are staying with my parents due to them letting us use there car and them having a spare bed etc. My boyfriends mom literally resents me even being up here and being around my boyfriend even though she knew we were coming up together. She and I have never had any problems,  until a few months ago when she told him to leave me etc. Now she literally is making me out to be the worst person even when I'm not doing anything wrong. I had to cancel my birthday party I had planned and everything for my boyfriend in which he knew about because she was unhappy. I'm so lost and its bothering me so much. I just need some advice or tips to deal with all of this. I'm struggling so hard. ",26Sep2018,1
465,"There's a new Kroger in my area that opened about 3 months ago. I got a job there in early August. I was actually thinking about sticking around for a little while, but now I don't think it's worth it.

I'm frustrated at the management. I only get 16-22 hrs a week on average, and it's $8.50/hr. Maybe I shouldn't complain, but I really need all the money I could get. I'm a courtesy clerk (mainly bagging &amp; retrieving carts). It gets so busy and hectic. The management aren't scheduling enough people yet they're hiring more and more people. Sometimes it's only two of us, so while the other person is retrieving the carts, I have to jump between 3 different check out lanes for an hour. Even the cashiers are saying that there needs to be more of us.

I thought maybe I could get another part time job so I asked for change of availability. From 7 AM to 4 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. I'm still available for 36 hours. It was denied...

I know that more businesses will be hiring for the holidays, but those are seasonal. I'm even thinking about working at Target again for the season since they give plenty of hours and pay $12/hr, but it ends around Christmas, so I'd have to be job hunting again.

Trying to decide how to approach my manager about getting more hour or at least changing my availability so I can get a second job. Or that I'd have to quit for another job (of course I'll give at least two weeks of notice). Any tips on approaching my manager?",26Sep2018,1
