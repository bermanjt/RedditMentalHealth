1,"TLDR: A friend from my school is rapidly showing concerning behaviour (lying, guilt tripping, manipulating, etc.) and neither my other friends or me know what to do about it. I’m sorry this post is so long.


There is a girl(26F) in my(20F if it matters) class, I’m going to call her “B” who is the definition of a fucking mess. I started this makeup/special effects program at the beginning of 2018 and this is where I met B. At first she was really chill and we became relatively close. We hung out a few times outside of school/shared memes/the usual stuff, however in the past few months she has really started to show who she really is and it’s actually kind of scary. As time goes on everything B does just escalates and get worse and worse and she shows more toxic behaviour. I will list off some of the things she has done because I don’t know how else to start or how to even get into it:

B lies and manipulates a lot. I did not know this when I first met her obviously. She will lie about anything and everything from the smallest little white lie, for example what she did that day or saying a memory that happened that obviously didn’t, I’m assuming just to impress people or get arise out of us. She will also lie about very extreme things, especially when it comes to guilting us into getting what she wants. She lies the most about her past, the first thing she told me about herself was that she is a recovering addict and alcoholic, she just got out of rehab before school started. As days go on though, she will add on to it and make it bigger constantly, especially as she learns more about whoever she is talking to. This really bothers me because I am actually a recovering addict. An example, she over heard me talking to a close friend of mine once about how I have been struggling to repair my own mental health and how earlier in the year I had attempted suicide, B interrupted our conversation to say she has attempted suicide 3 times and it’s so much harder for her, but she previously in the year she has stated to multiple people, she has never has attempted as well as she has once attempted. Which we know none of it is true after having talked to her friends and wife. She has also told us she is bipolar and she keeps making up medication for it but we can’t ever find proof of her taking the medication or that it even is a real type of medicine at all. That is just the beginning of how she lies and how it escalates. 

Along with the lies she will try to manipulate us and make the 3 of us other girls in the class who are friends split up. At first when I started to notice this stuff I just brushed it off as me being dramatic but it’s gotten to the point she will lie to one of us and say the other is mad and create a whole fake issue to make us stop talking to each other. This has happened on numerous occasions, again I never really payed much attention to it because it was never a huge deal until now, we are finding out what she says to each of use individually when her attempts to make us mad at each other are successful. B will say things like “well she is such a bitch but I’m not so it’s ok” “she is so much drama at least we are ok though” “we don’t need to talk to her anyway” “well who cares about her you have me” etc. and she has said the exact same things to every one of us, which is concerning I think. When we don’t do what she wants she will try and use her “past” or anything wrong with her life in the moment to guilt us into doing what she wants. I watched her across the room last week in class be told “no” to something she wanted and she immediately started crying about something someone supposedly said to her that morning which was completely unrelated to what she wanted. When the person turned and walked away, it looked like B was never crying in the first place, she was completely fine not a tear to be seen on her face when she knew her strategy didn’t work. 

After a few months of moving here, B started to get tinder and talk to a bunch of guys which confused me in the first place because she prides herself on being “a big fat lesbian” (B herself‘s words) and she also has a wife. I don’t care who she is sleeping with at all, the reason this is a problem is because of what it has become. Through tinder she has been with a lot of guys since she started this, everyday she is telling us some new name/some guy who is her new most favourite thing that day, but she is cheating on her wife. It’s as plain as that. B told me that her wife is extremely monogamous and would be hurt knowing what she is doing. She has even messaged me and in the same message said she never wants to hurt her wife, then said she can’t tell her what she is doing because it will hurt her. Despite telling us this she continues to float around tinder and be with whoever, In the last 7 months she has even caught an std from doing this. She expects us to praise her for what she is doing, which is why it’s relevant to what I am saying. She will talk about it and expect us to support what she does and when we don’t, alter the story until we have to say something just to make her stop. All summer long she kept calling it “her last slutty summer”. Along with this she also won’t listen to anyone else, people have told her that what she is doing is kinda fucked up and she is putting a lot at risk by doing this but she will not listen, she just starts a pity party for herself and acts like she is a victim with the whole world against her. No one can get through to her, she only wants to hear and see what she wants, not reality. 

The biggest issue we have with her right now, which is the reason why I am asking for advice here on what to do with this situation, is how she acts like we owe her for everything and holds everything she does for us over our heads. In the first months of school she would surprise us with lunch and dinner and show up to class or when we were hanging out with food and drinks, it was always really nice everyone always appreciated it. She even started to buy extra products for class and share them/give them to everyone and never said she wanted to be paid back or anything she just did it “to be nice”. No one ever asked for any of that stuff, she just did it on her own and surprised everyone and wouldn’t let anyone say no to taking anything. Well now she is using that as leeway to try guilt us when she needs money or anything along those lines. Recently she has quit 2 of the jobs she had and got a new “job” at a restaurant from an old guy she was fucking from tinder, (I’m not even going to get into the story about the old guy because it a whole other, very dramatic and stupid situation) who isn’t even paying her. Due to her quitting jobs, last month she was low on money and I guess she turned to a seeking arrangements/sugar daddy kind of website expecting an easy sort of income. I don’t know the behind the details of that very much she kept telling us different, obviously fake information about it, but what we do know for sure is she gave someone on the website her bank information and he stole all of her money. She came to school panicking about that because she couldn’t pay her rent and she went around to all of us, asking for 700$ on the spot so she could pay her rent. Obviously no one can just pull that amount of money out of their ass like that, and the fact we, especially me, didn’t give her money made her very mad. She went to someone else in the class and said how she knew I had the money I was just “hiding” it from her, and she has always put her life and soul into our friendship, always buying me stuff but I couldn’t even help her once. B also said that I just wanted to see her homeless and that’s why I didn’t give it to her. She continues to hold it over our heads and try and force us to buy her food and drinks all the time as if we owed her money for what she did? I don’t know where she got the idea that she is entitled to my/anyone else’s money to fix her mistakes, but we don’t really know what to do now. 

There is so much more I could say about what B has done but this is already a very long post and going into it all would be a lot, I have only scratched the surface of it here. We just aren’t really sure how to proceed now or how to treat her or what to say. The more I think about it, it makes me more and more confused and unsure.  ",03Nov2018,1

3,I went to an interview today for a retail position and the manager told me to go buy her a drink so I went because I’m bad at saying no. Ended up paying for it because she didn’t give me enough money. Then I didn’t tell her about it. Eventually she said that I could come in for training tomorrow but to stop by a store to buy some stuff for her and that she would pay me back? I’m not even hired yet and I’m pretty sure this isn’t part of my position. So tomorrow I have a training but I’m planning to not go because I feel like I’ll be made to do things that aren’t part of my job. Should I tell her I won’t be going or should I just not show up? Also how do I become more assertive to not get into these situations in the first place? ,03Nov2018,1
4,"Okay so, friend A invited us over for breakfast/lunch and told us to choose any time between 10am-4pm.

Friends B and C both want 10am. This is hard for me because I've been sleeping at 4am since summer ended. I can't just sleep at 12am all of a sudden, even if I take a sleeping pill. If I'm lucky maybe the sleeping pill can get me to sleep at 2. And I can't just sleep at 4 like usual and nap when I get back, because I'm going to be sleepy and tired the whole time I'm at her house (5 hours of sleep).

 I asked if we can go at 3pm instead and they both said no because they have things to do. I asked for 11am at least. Nope. They want 10am, because they have things to do. I told them it's just one hour for them but for me even 11am is a lot. They told me to just ""sleep early"" as if it's that fucking simple. They proceeded to say ""10am is probably easier for her anyway"" and when I called them out for saying it's easier for her just because it's easier for them (who tf are they to say which time suits her best?) they just said that yeah basically.

I cannot understand how they can be this selfish and it's really upsetting me.

I don't even want to go anymore with them because I feel like they got the ""upper hand"" and it's humiliating to just give in, as if i don't have a voice in this whole thing. I'm about to just text my friend and tell her I'm coming alone at my own time.",03Nov2018,1

6,"Hi, I've been struggling with work stress recently. I have a work assignment due, work late into the night, can't fall asleep because I'm anxious, and then start that whole trend over again. It's miserable. It's especially hard for me right now being a self-employed freelancer, the lack of structure is very difficult. 

I realized now that I need some kind of time management or procrastination or work stress training or support. In my high school, they had a class that I wish I had taken. It was called: **study skills**. It helped students cope and find strategies to deal with their homework load. I never learned the right study skills. Now as an adult I'm struggling mightily. 

So my question now is, is there a program for adults that helps them with work stress, time management or the like? I just want something reliable, with tried and true techniques, rather than diving off into some self help that's more of a distraction. Know where I can find something like this?

7,So I just spent the day with my dads because they “needed to talk”. We saw a movie and had dinner. They dropped this bombshell on me and I’m not quite sure how to take it. They also said it’s been going on for three months and they gave him a promise ring. I don’t mind them trying to spice up their relationship but I think it’s the fact that the third party is 6 years younger than me is what fucks with my mind. What do I say? How do I cope? I think I’m in shock... my brother is worried he could be after our family will? They can’t all three get married so is that still a possibility? What can I do to help smooth out this transition? Last note: this is his only second gay relationship and the kids parents don’t support the idea. I’m just worried about my parents well being. Help. ,03Nov2018,1

11,"So I've been dating this girl for the past few weeks. Now I haven't been in a real relationship for over 3 years so as soon as a girl was kinda interested in me I went for it. Started off fine, she seemed like the kinda girl that I could just relax and be myself around without to much worrie, a dream if you will. I could tell from beginning that her past relationships were not so pleasant but ""surely it can't be to bad right?"" Oh how little I understood.

 Her mental stability is zero, she has night terrors from her Ex's and constantly thinks that talking to other people about it isn't the right thing, so what she has going on now is stuff will never change because she's to scared to do anything about it. Her physical health also isn't to good, she blacks out randomly when she's tried or first thing in the morning but again it's a fear of going to see someone that stops her from getting any better. To top things off after like I said, we've been together for a very few weeks and she's already telling me that she ""loves me"" which for someone in my shoes just adds so much extra pressure to a relationship that I was never fully ready for, I'm in the testing phase still trying to feel out if I really like her, she's way past that.

 I'm not used to this sort of thing, I'm the kinda of person that loves to care for other I find joy in it so taking care of her at first was fun when I didn't know what really lied beneath it all, I'm so stressed out and overwhelmed about everything. I really think that for me to be happy I can't keep dating her as I've asked if she'd ever be willing to talk to someone and try to get help because I am not that helpful for this kinda thing but she will flat out say ""no I'm fine why would I go see a doctor."" But I know that one of her past relationships broke up with her over something very similar to this and it really hurt her, but I don't want to have to live my life worrying every second over something that I can't ever help no matter how much I try. So how can I broke things off with her so that I don't hurt her?

TLDR: my new girlfriend only makes me worry about her and I can't spend my life like that, how can I brake up with her without hurting her?",03Nov2018,1

We live a townhouse complex and we have a neighbor right in front of us that most of the time has the radio or tv turn up. Sometimes they even have their windows open. Even when windows are closed, we could hear the sounds coming from their house. The walls are not sound proof and isn't this disturbing the peace when you can hear the neighbors noise inside your own house?

Also, this neighbor is not the type to confront in person so I am kind of iffy on that one, but i really dont want to call the cops on them either (although that's my last resort.) 
If I call the cops, would they be able to help me?

17,"Hey folks,  
So here's the story.  


I moved to Portland, Oregon in July, and since then-- I've been unemployed.  
Of the 62 positions I've applied to, I've passed the initial screening for 12 positions. And of those 12 positions, I've made it to 5 in-person interviews. But I haven't received a single offer.  And let me be clear... I'm targeting roles for which I have relevant experience or education. It's not like I'm applying to senior-level positions or positions that start at or near six figures.  


I come from a family of generational poverty. I'm a first-generation college graduate. And I've always held a job, even throughout school. I've climbed the ladder from making $7.50 and hour to making $51k/ year. Which brings us to today.  
It's November, and that means I've been out of a job for nearly 4 months. A quarter of a year.   
Whichever way you spin it, it's abysmal.   


**Here's what I've done so far to help increase my chances of finding a career**...  
1. Updated my resume.   
2. Re-updated resume with quantitative data to reflect success.   
3. Had a career coach review my resume and made more revisions accordingly.   
4. Changed the format of my resume from PDF to DOCX to make it easier for screening software to understand the content.  
5. Updated my professional summary to custom fit each job posting. i.e. It contains those ever-important buzz words found in the job description.   
6. Personalized each cover letter. More recently I've abandoned the ""I'm happy to be applying for the X position at X company"" model in favor of a personal narrative approach.   
7. Created a comprehensive spreadsheet to indicate the likelihood of a call-back based on sector, job title, and salary. This is also a tool I'm using to help better understand and navigate the hiring culture here in Portland.  
*Side note: about 82% of recruiters respond on Wednesdays between 11am and 1pm in Portland*  
8. Gained a CPR Certification, Fundamentals of Project Management Certification, and a Fundamentals of Online Marketing Certification from Google Garage. (My career search has been vast.)   
9. My in-person interviews have gone very well. I'm honest, folks in the room are engaged and seem to enjoy what I'm saying (back-channeling, smiles, laughs, even a few wows), and I always leave the meeting feeling like I put my best foot forward.  
10. Applied to entry-level jobs \*with around 6 years of work experience under my belt, including AmeriCorps VISTA and Teach for America\* and mid-level jobs.  
11. In situations where I felt very confident I might receive an offer, I sent handwritten thank-you cards to my interviewers.  
12. And updated the **crap** out of my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ChalmusDavenport/) page.  


At this point, I'm at a total loss. If anyone has insights, I'd love to learn more.

Now, my boyfriend goes away for a long portion of the summer every other year to japan (I’m in the US btw) and this is the first one he’s had to go to that we’re together. I really wish I could go, but it’d be financially impossible. I’m usually such a lonely person over the summer and really hate it, but last summer was amazing with him. I’m scared to go back to the way it was. He says we’ll have stories to tell each other, but realistically I won’t do much and he’ll tell me how great everything was that I couldn’t experience with him.

19,"So I've worn a purity ring for 5 years now ever since I was in middle school. It's extremely sentimental to me because of what the ring represents. I wear it ever single day and I even sleep in it. I've been dating my boyfriend for 5 months now and he has to go on a business trip soon. So last night we were sleeping and I, as usual, fell asleep with my ring on and I woke up, walked him out since he was leaving, and then after he left I realized it was gone and called him (we always call at night) and he claimed he didn't have it. I tore up my room looking for it, woke up my mother at 3 am to help, and even cried and he didn't still budge. Then, he breaks up with me claiming he's not ready for a relationship (maybe he was drunk? that's what he said) The next day he ended up coming to my house, apologizing and gave me my ring back. Turns out he took it off my finger while I was sleeping because he wanted to have something to remember me while he's on his 2-month-long business trip. Opinions on this???",03Nov2018,1

21,"Wall of text, beware.

26 days ago I broke up with my SO. We’re both in high school, however we go to different schools but live about 30 minutes on public transit from each other. My SO used to go to my school, however switched out after they were raped in a school bathroom several years ago. My SO said that they still weren’t ready to be so closely connected to my school due to their past at my school, and since I too carry a lot of trauma I can understand how that might be troublesome. 

However, beyond that they’re very emotionally irresponsible and immature. They are clearly insecure about being single, in fact they ended up entering into a different relationship only a day after leaving me (who was actually a previous ex of theirs and isn’t very emotionally stable). This has led me to theorize that in order to remain in a constant state of being in a relationship, my ex convinces themself that their ex’s were horrible people and never loved them and thus cheating the process of naturally getting over someone. (I saw screenshots of them saying that I never cared about them, despite earlier saying that I would be hurt by the break up, implying that I did/do in fact care about them and our relationship) Meanwhile, my ex is very depressed and lacks the self-respect to change. For example, whenever someone insults them, they agree and as a result are able to dismiss the fact that my ex has a lot of issues that they need to confront. 

Considering my ex’s emotional immaturities and seemingly lack of a mourning period, this past month has been more so spent with me being deeply concerned for my ex’s mental stability and wellbeing. I doubt their current relationship will last very long, and there’s a possibility that my ex might try to reopen communication with me (I even said that I did not want this to be it, and we both agreed to begin talking at some point) 

Do you guys have any ideas on what I can possibly do to help them? Is it even worth it? Should I pursue no contact as I have so far?

Thank you!",03Nov2018,1

23,"Okay so this may be a little long but it would be extremely appreciative if people would help me out here. I’m just so lost...

So, i’m (20f), and i’m in love with one of my best friends B (20m). Last year (on Halloween) was the first time B and i got together. We were drunk but we made out and that was kind of it. We really didn’t talk after that. Then like 3 weeks later we got together again, except this time we ended up having sex. This started a “thing” between us, we were together for roughly a month but we never ended up dating. 

This was because i hooked up with someone else. Please, PLEASE do not hate on me for this. It still haunts me to this day and to be honest i can’t bring myself to forgive myself for it even though he has. Anyways, this clearly ended our “relationship”. This happened right before our winter break, so i didn’t go out at all the entire 2nd semester. This was because i just wanted him to have a good time when he finished college and to finish off on a happy note, which he did. We really didn’t talk or see each other at all that entire 2nd semester. 

So, B ironically lives with my 3 best friends from high school, P, J, and S. I’m constantly over there because they’re my best friends and sometimes i need time with the boys to take a break from my girl roommates (love them though). B forgave me awhile ago, and he and i established a friendship that wasn’t forced. It formed over time. 

Well, 2 weeks into school, i cried over him while i was drunk to my friend G. G ended up telling B about it, and B texted me saying that if i ever wanted to talk to him about what happened (me cheating), we could talk about it. I agreed, but it didn’t happen for a while, i’ll get to that.

Then the next week, same thing happened, i cried over him while drunk (i promise i never do this, lol it’s just been extremely hard seeing him so much and i’m finally facing him and missing him a lot). This time he told P (my closest friend out of the 4 of them) that he wasn’t going to ever go down that road again, and we won’t be together again. This hurt a lot but it was good to know. I put myself in a mindset that we will strictly JUST be friends and honestly, i was fine with that.

Fast forward 1 weekend after that, we hooked up. He kissed me at a party we were at and we left after that to go back to his apartment. That was when we had sex. 

It was pretty awkward after that because we were both extremely confused. We had a long talk after that that consisted of him telling me he doesn’t regret what happened because everything happens for a reason, however we shouldn’t do it again for the sake of our friendship. I couldn’t have agreed more. 

That was set in stone for awhile. Over the span of 3 weeks we formed an amazing bond. Tbh we became best friends and i was happy with everything. We were normal and laughed a ton together, we flirted here and there but it was harmless. 

So then... last week. We were at a party together and we were just talking, and idk what led to this but somehow we began talking about what happened the night i cheated. I told my entire side of the story about it which took forever. We ended up going back to his apartment to talk in private because the conversation got really serious. We were not planning on hooking up whatsoever, i strictly came back just to talk and go back to my place, and at this point neither of us were drunk anymore. Having this conversation helped a lot because now there was closure between us and everything was off our chests. I remember he was “kicking me out”, and i was putting my shoes back on but i kept talking to him. Before i left i wanted to make sure i left him with something, so i told him “i say this wholeheartedly, you deserve nothing but the best. I hope you’re happy at the end of it all. I’m so serious, B.” Then he told me to “come here” and he kissed me. One thing led to another, and we had sex. 

After having sex, P came in to talk to me privately. He told me that B and i seriously need to get back together because he was tired of us not doing anything about the feelings he can obviously see between us. He explained to me how good we are for each other, and how we fill in the parts the other one lacks. We are opposites but it’s compatible. And i agreed with him 100% on this. I kept it to myself, but P told B this Sunday. 

I remember before going to bed he told me he was always going to have feelings for me, but now isn’t the time. He wants to “explore” which i completely understand, and on Wednesday he was explaining to me how he needs to figure some shit out. 

This really sucked to hear but it’s how he feels and i cannot do anything about that. I have been with him since Monday, just hanging out at their apartment. Wednesday we were the only two from our group to go out, so we hung out the entire time then eventually went back to his apartment to eat and sleep (i got locked out of my apartment). We ate pizza and shrimp, watched Big Mouth, i fell asleep on the futon and he covered me with a blanket, then he went into his room. We have been extremely close since we had sex last, but it’s not even like just friends close. Yes we are like best friends, but the intimacy between us is getting stronger every single time i’m with him... it’s crazy. We flirt a lot and we act like we’re a couple sometimes without the PDA. Just the way we interact with one another. And i’ve slowly, but all at once, fell in love with him. It’s not obsessive or obvious, but i feel it. I love him so much. 

I guess i’m just asking, what do i even do about any of this? He’s the type of guy where we’re all on B’s time, and he just goes with life and doesn’t rush anything, so part of me seriously feels like we will never be together. Idk, maybe i’m reading the entire thing wrong. Anybody, please just give me SOME type of advice or insight. I seriously need it. ",03Nov2018,1
24,"I recently moved out of a buddy's place and into a two bedroom apartment with another buddy of mine. It was honestly a bad decision from the get go, because I wanted to move into my own abode and finally free myself from roommates. But, the guy I'm with now really needed the help with rent, I'm a huge softy and easy to guilt into things, and it would've costed more to live alone anyway, so I decided to take him up on the offer. However, since I've moved in, there have been a ton of problems.

Just to list a few:
* Since I've moved in, he hasn't cleaned the apartment except one time, and that was when I was planning on moving out originally. I think he knew, cleaned the apartment, and then promised he'd try to clean more often. I took the promise and decided to stay for a while longer.
* When I first moved in, the apartment was so disgusting, my mother, father, and I had to deep clean it. It took all three of us an entire day to clean the whole thing up while he was at work. I then later had to do it again, alone, when he made the place disgusting again and we almost got kicked out by the apartment management.
* It wasn't until recently that I started forcing him to spend more money on groceries. He is morbidly obese, but can still move around and work. He eats so much that when I buy groceries, he has them devoured in less than a day, then proceeds to spend all of his extra money on fast food. Up until about two months ago, I was buying all the groceries. Now I'm terrified to even bring more food into the house.
* He's constantly treating me more like a slave or indentured servant than a friend or roommate. There's been several times where he's used the term ""my apartment"" when referring to the place, instead of ""our apartment"". I've confronted him about it in jest, and he said that because his name was on the lease, the apartment was his and not mine. I don't necessarily disagree, but you'd think the guy who pays for half of the apartment is entitled to some sense of ownership, too.

So, you can see there's plenty of issues with him. I've been in this apartment since May, and honestly, I think I've been really patient with him. Maybe overly patient. I've survived up until now, but work is becoming more stressful, I'm starting college again in January, and he expects me to keep a two person apartment clean on top of all of that.

I was recently very sick this week(suffered from an awful head cold), and I had asked him to clean up the apartment, since I couldn't cook or recover in a gross apartment. He said he would, never did, then I had to do it WHILE sick. That was really the straw that broke the camel's back.

So, I need some advice. I'm super bad with confrontation, even though I'm not worried about hurting his feelings or ruining my relationship with him. What's the best way of going about this without being a dick?",03Nov2018,1
25,"So lately I’ve been crying everyday because I’m constantly thinking that he’ll ( My partner) leave me. 

Another thing that’s recent is that my partner has been caring less and less about me. I think about on Wednesday day he told me “I rarely even care about you” 

You probably be wondering why is this have to do with the title. But hear me out. 

My partner keeps on saying the phrase; “I got raped” 
He didn’t really get raped. He’s just being sexual Harassed by his friends. 

FYI he’s still a virgin 

I get really worried whenever he says things like that because I want to be only one who takes his virginity. 
I told him to stop joking about that, but he didn’t stop. 

Everyday at school we would always sit at this area to hangout during lunch. Whenever we would hangout at that spot either my friends or his friends come over. When MY friends come over I would always and ALWAYS push them away because I wanted to spend time with my partner more. Whenever his friends come over they would like stay there. My partner never does anything. He just talks/play with them for the entire lunch break. I mostly never get time with him.  Today he got “Raped” by one of his friends. Let’s call him Reese. 
Since we don’t have a name for my partner let’s call him “Mark” 
So Reese got on top of Mark. I didn’t do anything. I just... stood there. It may look like I don’t care but I honestly do! Like a lot. Mark told me not to touch any males. So I did that. I didn’t. While Reese got on top of Mark I gave Reese the death stare. When Reese left. I couldn’t say anything to Mark. All that could come out of my mouth was...
“Are you ok?!”
Clearly he wasn’t. I wanted to help. Really I do! But... Mark would let me touch any males besides him. If he would let me I think could’ve separate both of them and then everything would be fine. I was a coward yes. 
I didn’t know what to do at that time!!
Sorry if my grammar is a bit off. 

Here’s another story that you should debate if I’m a bad person. 

5 month ago I Revealed Mark’s secret out to the public on my Instagram. Reasons for me to do that...? I just wanted to help him... he’s been through a lot. Well not that much.  Let’s say I was trying to find advice. I haven’t discovered reddit yet so I couldn’t use that.  The day after I post it he found out that I posted it and he got extremely pissed at me. He wouldn’t talk to me for the whole day that day. I told him that I’ll do anything for him to forgive me. What he told me was to...... I shouldn’t say. But I’ll give you hint I guess. The request was sexual. I would say it’s a good deal. I told him I would send it to him on Christmas. He said OK. 

I don’t know what else to rant about. So....... here’s some back ground knowledge of me. 

I would describe myself as worthless, useless., untrustworthy, and a liar. Because that what Mark always says about me 

I am 12 years old Attending Middle school. Yes I am very young. 

I enjoy drawing and playing instruments. 

That’s it

26,"We’re both 20 year old college students. 

I live in a town home type of apartment, meaning that there’s two people downstairs (me and my old roommate from last year — we’ll call her Nia) and two 4th year girls upstairs. The kitchen is on the main floor, and there’s a little living room area upstairs, meaning that there’s also a separate thermostat. The general rule is that, if your bedroom isn’t on that floor, don’t touch the thermostat. That being said, if someone touches the thermostat, it’s pretty easy to figure out who the culprit is.

It’s starting to get cold. During the day, it’s pretty warm, but at night, it drops to the 40s or 50s. Of course, that means it’s time to turn on the heat. Over the past few weeks, for some god forsaken reason, Nia has been turning off the heat and turning it to cool + turning on the fans. She’ll do it behind my back, claiming that her room is always hot “for some reason” (she never opens her door and dresses like it’s -3 degrees out) and that she’ll turn it back on. She never does. I had the last straw last week and sent everyone a message explaining why I would like the heat turned on. Of course, the two girls upstairs say they have no reason to touch the thermostat. I know that. We all know who’s been turning off the heat because someone’s been passive aggressively complaining about how hot she’s been even though it’s fucking cold outside.

I’m anemic, so I’m generally always cold and my cat was literally shivering because it was so cold in my apartment. You’d think that after explaining why I’d like the heat on, she would stop turning off the heat, but she hasn’t. Confronting her and explaining my reasons clearly hasn’t worked and I’m so annoyed at this point; we literally have ceiling fans in each of our rooms and her bedroom has TWO windows that she can open and close.",03Nov2018,1

I have no trouble talking to women it's just none of them see me as a romantic option I become the ""super nice friend"" and then they get a boyfriend and push me away.

28," 

I'm obviously trying to tell her that cats can't feel spite, but it's clearly obvious my mother doesn't give a single shit, and it's really pissing me off, because I want the problems to stop, and she is directly getting in my way, because she has no empathy for animals and keeps on punishing her and stressing my cat out.

I don't know what to do. I'm worried my cat is either very stressed out; or worse, she has some kind of medical condition is bothering her. I'd want to take her to the vet, and of course my mom replies with ""she better not, because I'll put her down"".

I hate her. She is completely ignorant about pets in general even though she acts like she does; when she obviously doesn't. It's directly effecting me because I want the best for my cat, but my mom thinks she is being ""spiteful"" and punishing her unfairly when she probably doesn't know what she did in the first place. I want her to stop but I know she is too ignorant to listen or believe me, and I can't do anything about it. What do I do?

BTW, her litterbox was completely clean this morning, and it was clean before she came back in when she goes outside at night. ",03Nov2018,1

30,"Here's the scoop. I'll preface by saying I'm a 35 year old single male. I have one sibling, an older sister who lives nearby with her husband and four kids. I'm the ""cool uncle"" and treat her kids as my own.

I recently found out some disturbing news from my mom. My three nieces and one nephew are all Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioners. My father, their grandfather, takes them multiple times per week to class and any tournaments. They're all extremely good at it.

My oldest niece is 14 years old, a high school freshman and very pretty. She's also the first to get into martial arts and the most talented.

My mom told me that last week a jiu jitsu classmate in his 20s was suspended from attending for one month because he continued to leer at my 14 year old niece and continually ask to roll (grapple) with her. Apparently this has been going on for weeks but the first I heard anything about it.

My niece was the first to bring it to anyone's attention. My mom, her grandma. She said he was making her uncomfortable. The class leaders were made aware and the guy was told to stop. He clearly didn't and even asked her to grapple right infront of my dad (knowing he knew the situation). Another time my niece apparently looked uncomfortable and another teacher who knew the situation said, ""Hey, come on, come grapple with me"" to ""save"" her from the creep.

Since it hasn't stopped the guy was suspended for a month. If the creepy behavior continues when he returns he'll be kicked out for good.

I told my parents I'd like to know if and when he returns to class. I then told a few buddies of mine about the situation and asked if they'd come to class with me at least once if creeper returns. They all unconditionally agreed.

I don't plan to confront the guy. And my niece will be mortified if she knew why we were there. But I want this guy to know my niece has support. My dad sitting there during each class apparently isn't enough. And if I witness him asking her to grapple while I'm there, he and I will need to have a talk.

Am I being ridiculous with my ""adult posse"" idea? I just want her to feel safe and for him to know there are extra eyes.

Any criticism, advice or questions?

Thanks!

She showed me how to finish my project, had put together a really nice snack and drinks for us and generally made me feel very welcome. I really appreciated it. Thing is, I live in a really tiny apartment and can't reciprocate with the same kind of invitation. And I am not skilled at anything she is trying to learn, haha.

32,"I have no idea where to start when it comes to improving myself. I have social anxiety so bad to the point I just stare and smile instead of talking. I can't leave the house on my own without someone I feel safe with by my side. It's so bad I can't even go into a store and buy my own items. I always need my brother or whoever is with me to do it.

My next issue is my constant worrying and self-consciousness. I'm always worried about my looks to the point I feel narcissistic. I wish to gain weight and be curvy like the women in my family and the women on TV. But I'm stuck looking like a twig :(. I cover up my entire body because I'm so ashamed of being skinny. I worry about the way I talk too. I feel like my voice is too deep and raspy. So I try to speak with a light voice and tone. Which nobody seems to mind but I'm very annoyed with myself when I speak that way.

Which leads me to my next point. I just feel like I'm completely repressing myself out of fear of being judged and getting things wrong. I feel trapped, I have no friends and haven't had any for the last 3 years due to moving so much and ultimately ending up in homeschool.


I just don't know what to do. I can't seem to keep any good habits either. I randomly have emotional break downs and moods wings that set the vibe for how I'm going to feel for that week. I constantly switch between feeling useless and feeling empowered. But feeling empowered doesn't normally last too long and any positive habits I tried picking up goes down the drain. I'd like to workout and eat more but I'm having a hard time keeping on my weight. I'm always tired fatigued which makes it hard to even want to get up in the morning. I don't sleep right either. I have insomnia and I can never keep a stable sleep schedule

I keep falling behind in school (which is sad considering I'm homeschooled. I have a larger advantage over kids in public school because I can go back and watch recordings of my classes) and I don't have the motivation to go on. So how can I go about this? I'm honestly getting tired of myself. I just want to gain weight, develop healthier habits, do good in school, and just be myself. But I just can't keep motivated long enough to do any of those things. At least without weed that I usually run out of every 2-3 weeks and I end up back at square one each time (I smoke to help the pains and flare ups I have from ibs and to help me eat more. Not really for recreational purposes).

33,"Hi everyone. My school’s hockey team lost a game tonight and I found myself thinking some negative thoughts that made me have a bad time while we were losing.

There were a lot of fans for the other team so when their team kept scoring or did something good the cheering was so loud. There was one of their fans sitting near where I was and whenever he opened his mouth I just felt so sour. He would laugh when our team made mistakes, snark back loudly to cheers we did, cheer excessively when they scored, etc.

When he and other fans of the away team did these things, I felt very annoyed at this. Thought they were being obnoxious, thought they should just shut up, etc.

The other schools band was there as well. They copied our cheers (but for their team obviously), played loudly, did little dances that I found to be super annoying and unneeded.... you all get the point.

I realize how extremely hypocritical this is. If I was at an away game, I would want to cheer for my team loudly and have fun, etc. I just get very internally frustrated and angry when the other teams are winning and/or beat us and the other fans seem to be gloating about it. And it’s not just, “oh the other team sucks grrrr sports,” it becomes a “can these people just shut up already, they’re being fucking annoying, and rude.”

I'm 21 and i used to work with my sister at a surveyor office, she taught me how things work and some other things to get started with for a couple of years, but after she earned some titles and attended differents specializing courses, our Boss denied a raise to her upon asking and so they argued really bad. They had a long friendship of 7 years and it's completely gone for good. She had no other option to leave and start a career on her own. Of course, i couldn't follow my sister and o had to keep on working for my boss, till it lasted. I have been working without her for about 7-9 months and every once and a while, she asked me if i could send to her some basic files and documents so that she could complete  her works faster. I have always been like ""eh my boss will never know and i can't let down my sister"" but looks like i fucked up something here. Yesterday i find my boss and my sister at home because he managed to check every file i used on the workstation, every time i copied and pasted file in usb drives and he managed to control somehow all my conversation with my sister during these 7-9months, including personal information. my boss told me that he always trusted me, he felt backstabbed and he doesn't want to see me in office ever again.

So this is it, what would have you done if you were me? I know and i can't deny that i shouldn't have given file and docs to external people without permission, but how could i let down my sister? And more, if he said he was always trusting me, why would he control me? Isn't checking other's personal conversations a violation of privacy?

So my boyfriend and I went to visit our friend one weekend and we stayed at her apartment. I shared a bed with her and he slept on the couch. We went out for drinks at a popular bar and I ended up running into a ton of my friends from back home. Throughout the night I felt that  our friend was trying to keep me from my boyfriend but I trusted her so I brushed it off. Later, I got separated from my boyfriend and my friend. She ended up walking back to her place while my boyfriend waited for me. I never found him so he walked back and then I walked back. When I got back (last) everything was super weird and my friend seemed like she was pissed at me so I apologized a lot thinking it was because we all got too drunk and separated. Then we all went to bed pretty much right away.
The next morning was super awkward and our friend pretty much asked us to leave as soon as we could which is SO unlike her. So we left.

Late that night my boyfriend explained to me why it was so awkward. My friend had pretty much confessed her love for my boyfriend when I got separated from them and complained to him that no guy likes her or wants to date her. My boyfriend, who is the nicest person ever, told her that she’s a great person and the right guy is out there for her. She kept telling him that if I wasn’t around she would want to be with him and she’s loved him for so long and he kept telling her that he’s with me and loves me. Then she grabbed him and kissed him and tried to hold him there while he pushed her away. And then she got pissed at him when he didn’t reciprocate.

I 100% trust my boyfriend especially since he told me so quickly and we have an amazing relationship. I’m just struggling with how to confront my friend. I’m totally ok with cutting her off as a friend but the issue is that we have so many mutual friends (she’s also best friends with my boyfriends twin brothers girlfriend -confusing, sorry) so she’s not going anywhere. 

I don’t know how to go about confronting her. It would have to be a phone call because of distance. My boyfriend and I are just so shocked and feeling betrayed and I want to set guidelines since I know I’ll see her a lot.

I recently ran into a problem with my fellow e-board members on the management of our club. We recently had a club event where we were hosting a movie and some fun games. We provided the people that attended the event with food and drinks and to my knowledge did not plan for anything else. During the metting the person comes in very upset and starts putting up decorations. I try to approach them to see if something is wrong or if they need help with anything  but they ignore me and continue to decorate. Not sure on what to do i just try to  help whenever im needed and make sure that everyone is enjoying the event. Once that is done i just try to catch up on homework. So the event ends and all the members are happy and all is well in the world. The following week we have our weekly e-board meeting and the person explodes and is very upset at me and another member. She said that she felt like she was doing everything and that we were not doing our jobs as members. I reply saying that i had no idea on what she was doing and didn’t know that she was in need of help. Again i tried to approach her during the event to see if she needed anything  but she ignored me. She claims that as e-board we should have been helping her regardless because it’s our job. For me my responsibility was to make sure that snacks and pizza were ordered and make sure that everything was in place and i did just that. At this point I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong or if she’s just crazy. I’m sorry for the long post i know this is a lot. 😂

My mom(51F) is the more religious one, praying 5 times a day, this and that, and my dad(its sad when your son doesn't know your dads ageM)  just works most of the time. Usually never see him. We went overseas to Palestine or whatever you want to call it I think 2 summers ago. My sister was like 18/19 and my family had set her up with our cousin (ugh) and she absolutely HATED it. My parents, surprisingly enough, hated him too, and wanted out. The scar would live forever though. MANY fake photos were made.

Okay so about a year ago, my sister ran away for the first time out of 2. I've never cried before, well, not about anything that wasn't an injury. We were all in tears, begging her to come back. All she left was a note on the chicken counter saying ""Goodbye."" -Her name. We literally traveled to another state because we had a lead on where she was. Turns out it was fake. She called in a bit after that, saying she was fine and was with a Chinese family in a certain state. She got scared and wanted to come back, though, so eventually, she did. Came back and swore to never do it again on the Quran. 

&amp;#x200B;

Several months passed, not much changed. But than my parents found out that my sister was calling/texting this guy that convinced her to come to the state she was in before. No idea what they were talking about, probably flirting idfk. They scolded her to NO end, and she constantly did it, too. Eventually, though, the happiness ran dry. She was gone just as she came back. This time though, she wouldn't return (could change but I think not). 

&amp;#x200B;

This time I knew better than to shed a single tear for the person who was making my mother cry. My mother is my idol, she works so hard and is so amazing. I thought that was the way to think, how I had to think, for my moms sake. Anyway, a couple months passed with literally NO word from her. Her college was starting up again too so that was a mess. We all just eventually forgot about her. Until last week. 

&amp;#x200B;

We got a call from her and my mom was ECSTATIC. Never seen her this happy. I didn't get to hear much, but she had a job and what not and was making it from what I've heard. Tbh I didn't expect it cuz my sister had legit never left the house (like me and my bro(18M) so I was shocked to hear she was out and kicking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, now I'm here. Now, I've never told my parents that I have problems at school and shit like that. They would legit pass out if I told them lol. School is torture for me; certain classes my brain just doesn't want to do work in even though I'm pretty smart I'd say and COULD get straight A's if I gave a single fuck. but I don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Too this day, I'll never truly know why she left (she gives vague and bs excuses that I forget) but I think It's because of our religion. Tbh she never wanted to be the person who did all the shit around the house while our lazy dad just sat there being a fart (sorry not sorry). And I'm 100% sure she wouldn't want to wear a hijab (she never did and parents constantly gave her death stares because of it). And i'm sure the idea of forced marriage with some lazy ass who could beat her freely for not obeying to him didn't sound the best to her. Thinking about this more deeply; I'm starting to agree. I've been asking lots more questions about Islam and reading up on subs about Islam to see how I'm ""supposed"" to be acting. I really don't think this is for me. I've NEVER said this before and I'm scared just typing this because I don't want to be punished. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really scared. I was born and raised in America and am pretty much more american than anything else and agree with most ideologies here. I wish my mom was something, anything, else because she is tiring herself out and is slowly withering. She is too amazing for this world and she is legit the reason I don't just end it. My brother is also super awesome. Should I just wait it out and quietly say ""fuck this shit?"". Should I just leave? (I'd be way too scared to do that I think). And did my sister leave because of this as well? I'm stuck and want some advice from the best place I thought I could get it from. Thanks for reading the mess :D",03Nov2018,1
49,"I’m a 9th grader in high school, around 14 years old. I’ve had social anxiety for about as long as I can remember, and it’s always been a huge problem.

Today in math, we were doing a worksheet, and the teacher told us to do it in groups of max 3. I only have one friend in that class, and other people seemed to be working alone, so I decided to as well. She then came up to me and asked me why I wasn’t working with others. I told her that I worked better alone, and she told me to go find a group anyway. I felt so awkward, and the only people I knew in the class were already working in groups of 3. I tried working up the courage to ask someone else, but then panicked and ended up not doing it. She gave me a huge lecture in front of the class about how I have to be more willing to collaborate with others and the entire class looked at me, while I started half-crying. I sat with my friend for the rest of the period but I think I embarrassed her because no one wants to be forced to work with the awkward, shy girl.

My teacher pulled me outside after class and tried to give me a therapy session. She was really nice about it, but I ended up crying in front of her anyway while her daughter (who gossips a lot) watched in the background. I just feel so embarrassed. I know it’s my fault for not socializing, but I don’t want to ever go back to that class. What do I do?",03Nov2018,1
50,"We have been best friends since middle school (2008). She's getting married next May and asked me to be a bridesmaid last week, I accepted. Earlier this morning her fiancee got some anonymous text messages from a fake phone number calling them out for asking too much of their bridal party (having to pay for expensive dresses and flight to New Orleans for bachelorette party). They were unhappy with these texts and claims it had to of been sent from someone in our bridal party group chat since these plans were only discussed in that text thread and nobody else would know about them, perhaps except for a husband or friend of someone in our group chat.

After nobody is confessing of who sent the texts, my friend and her fiancee have now agreed to only have maid of honor and best man stand with them. My friend texted the group chat telling everybody the news but so far only one person responded. I was going to wait for everybody to chime in and state their opinion, but I don't think anybody will respond since they are quite inactive on the chat.

I feel as if I shouldn't have to buy my brides maids dress ($200) anymore if I'm not wanted to stand with them at their ceremony. I am not sure how to go about telling my friend that I don't think I should have to buy the dress anymore or if I want to partake in the bridal party but would still like to attend the wedding.

I think if I said something, there would be harsh feelings and ruin a 10-year friendship. How should I go about this?",03Nov2018,1

I washed all my sheets and got rid of my rugs that he dried himself on after his bath prior to me finding them. I still don’t feel as if it’s fine. Everything is clean but I still feel incredibly uncomfortable. What can I do to get rid of them and prevent them from coming back aside from the treatment I give my dog? ",03Nov2018,1
54,"I have to list my main questions:

1. **Should we talk about what we want our relationship to be?**
2. **Is it too early for this and if so, how long should I wait?**
3. **What are some of the things I should do to ease the pain and clear my head since it’s been killing me inside?**

Here’s the story:

I met a guy online. I’m a guy as well. Started out as friends. He came out to me as bisexual. After years of lying to myself, I came to terms with my bisexuality because of him. Came out to him as well. Turns out he liked me a lot, which I knew because of the flirting involved beforehand. I liked him a lot as well. I really feel like we were meant for each other, and I’m not saying this just for the sake of saying it. He’s the nicest and smartest and coolest human being I’ve met. We both have never connected to another person in the way we connected with each other. We met in real life two weeks after talking online. Decided we were going to be together and everything was great. Then a few days the yearly plan for his university came out (I’m a freshman, he’s a sophmore, different universities) and turns out there isn’t really a chance of us seeing more than once a month or talking that much because of the amount of things we have to study and we can’t really see each other and act like straight couples in public since we’re pretty much in the closet. We could have been together, but it would just be on paper, not a true relationship. And we both decided that it would cause us more harm than happiness if it continued. Decided to both stay friends, which really meant a lot to me since I want him in my life.

Now this is where it kind of gets confusing for me. We talked only four or five times after that in the span of two weeks, whereas we used to talk everyday before realizing we couldn’t be together. I get that he’s busy and that it’s not the same situation anymore, but our conversations are really really short and I get the feeling he doesn’t want to talk as much. It kind of hurts when I talk to him as well, but I try to keep it positive since I really want to continue that friendship with him and stay in touch.

I don’t know if he’s hurting or if he’s moved on or if he’s just focusing on his studies. Or if he’s just taking some time to cool off and not be influenced by emotions or whatever. Would that make sense? I’m really confused and broken inside, to be honest. I don’t even know if he wants to stay friends, even though he’s been 100% honest with everything and said that we could continue talking normally. Should I talk to him about it as soon as possible - and by it I mean if he truly wants to stay friends and if I should just stop trying because it feels like he doesn’t want to anymore and that I’m just being a burden (*I’d be completely understanding of him being tired from studying and everything of course*)?. Should I wait a bit (*again, it’s been a bit over two weeks*)? Should I just try and keep it natural, call him to meet up in a week or so and just chat? And also, what should I do to sort of take my mind off of him (*besides studying*)? How can I heal?

I just really don’t want to lose that connection we have. I really don’t.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart if you made it all the way down here. Anything would be extremely helpful.",03Nov2018,1
56,"So I'm 20F and my 45F supervisor at work always calls me ""my child"" or ""my other daughter"" or a pet name like ""sweetie"" or ""baby girl"". We both started working around the same time (a few months ago) and she is our only supervisor. The problem is, nobody likes her, including me. She is very opinionated, narcissistic (to others), and self-absorbed, but she is nice to me. It all started when she was giving another coworker (person A) a ride home and she saw me and this other coworker (person B) waiting for the bus. She offered me a ride home the next day, and from then on, she started to give me a ride home every night we work together. After the other coworker (person B) found out, she was mad that my supervisor didn't offer her a ride, and complained to management that she was showing favoritism. People at work soon picked up on her calling me her daughter, and some of my coworkers complained that she was favoring me and that it was unfair that she invited me to her house when she didn't invite the others and the manager actually had a talk with her. She doesn't care at all, and takes me to meet her family and picks me up from home to hang out.

Flash forward a few months, she insists on helping me move into my new apartment. When my birthday comes up, she invites some coworkers over to her house and throws me a birthday party. She plans on taking me out to celebrate my 21st birthday by taking me out-of-state on a trip. She's been revealing a lot of personal information to me about her life.

The problem is, she never asks me what I want to do. She just says ""I'm picking you up Tuesday night so we can have a girl's night. Be ready at 8."" She doesn't have any friends her own age, other than one coworker from work (person A). She talks shit behind people's back at work and people don't like her, and sometimes they don't like me because they see that she favors me. She is very opinionated (about marriage, prison reform, LGBT issues, etc.) and some coworkers are offended by her viewpoints, and I disagree with her views. She is always trying to one-up you, and will always relate some story back to her. She is not very compassionate and will disregard other people's feelings. She is considered ""problematic"" and can be very unprofessional, and will argue with everyone (except me).

I think the reason why she likes me is because I'm the only one who listens - she talks A LOT. She once told me I reminded her of her husband, who is very quiet. Other coworkers will just walk away or ignore her. She also has a soft spot for me because we both come from broken homes. While my biological mother is still alive, she no longer has any contact with me, so my supervisor has ""stepped in"" and become my ""new mom"". One time, we were at a liquor store, and the cashier asked for my ID and she said ""Oh, that my daughter. She's adopted."" We are of two different races. While I don't want to seem ungrateful for giving me rides home, I think this relationship has crossed the line. She is creating tension between me and the other coworkers who see that she favors me, and she often talks about personal issues that are considered inappropriate (like her sex life), and we are just different kinds of people with different views. I'm looking for a new job, but she seems like she has established herself in my life. She even told me she prefers me to her biological daughter. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated.",03Nov2018,1

58,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this. But I have been contemplating this for about a day and literally have no idea what to do.

A few months a friend of mine was assaulted sexually. She told me a few days after it happened. As far as I know I am the only person who knows about it. She told me she would never tell her family, which may have been a good choice since I really do think they would blame her.

I've contacted some of her very close friends. It seems as though none of them know anything. 

We both go to school in different places also.

Thing is, she has not been responding to any texts, or answering any calls I've made to check up on her. I got in touch with some of her friends and they were saying they were worried about her and think something may be going on. Of course, they don't know what happened.

I am so terrified that this girl is gonna fail out of school due to depression or harm herself in some way. I feel a really strong moral weight in all of this, and if something happens to her I'm gonna feel guilty as fuck since I think I might be the only person who's aware of what's going on.

Seriously, I have no idea what to do. Should I spam her phone. Should I just completely forget about it and mind my own business. I get that this isn't exactly my issue, but idk I feel really shitty just doing nothing and plus I'm so worried.

62,"Ever since the third grade, my grades have had a steady--- or not so steady decline.  
I used to be a straight A student, and now I'm in high school and not even passing a single class. My teachers have always been concerned for my mental health, telling my parents I seem cold, unengaged from everyone else, and have no real will to learn despite my \*high testing scores\*.  


It started off slow, missing a few assignments, forgetting to study, to the point where going to school is completely meaningless to me. No matter how hard I try to pay attention I give up. It's too difficult for me. ""Just do the work and pay attention"" is something that just doesn't apply to my situation no matter how easy it seems.  


Last year the guidance counselor almost called CPS when I had a mood swing and dropped my passion for writing, friends, and everything inbetween because she thought I was going to kill myself.

I wasn't.  


 I'm extremely unhappy with my life and was just diagnosed a few days ago with psychosis, bipolar disorder, and major depression by a physiologist.  I don't want pity, I just want treatment. I want to become a functioning member of society and have to stop worrying about getting my phone taken away because I can't pick up my grades. But my parents are stubborn and don't believe its the ""root of the problem"".
It is.  


My parents have repeatedly tried to work with me on my grades. It works for a week, then I slip back into my habits 2x worse. They won't allow me to take medication until they see improvement and that if my grades become worse I will have my bed and and door away. (????? How this makes sense is beyond me.) If you think this is a cruel joke, they did it to me back in 2016 and forced me to wear the same clothes until I at least had a D in every class. The school had to step in and put me into a special program. Funnily enough, the program helped me excel by taking my mental health into consideration but my parents did not like it and will only allow me to take public school. Now the school emails and calls twice a week saying I'm failing. Which only makes things more tense at home, and does more harm than good. My current guidance counselor thinks its my fault that I developed these habits, even though I've tried time and time again to break them. She won't even listen to me.

Right now I'm grounded from my phone but I'm allowed to use the computer on the weekend. I'm desperate for any form of advice, legal or otherwise. ""Push through it,"" really won't help me considering I'm at my breaking point and some of my friends say this is borderline child abuse.",03Nov2018,1

I’ve officially been going by the new name for about two years now, but I still legally had to write my old name on all official documents, payments, etc. 

Two years ago when I was first considering legally changing my name, I had lunch with my mother and told her about it. She literally broke down into tears and said I couldn’t change my name and that she gave me my name and how dare I, etc etc etc. She was NOT happy. At all. 

The trouble is I eventually have to break it to them so that I can straighten out official paperwork (insurance, etc), and they will find out that way if I don’t find another way to tell them.

68,"It's been 6 years since I've graduated high school (and college), but I still have days where I think about this guy. I feel like I need some closure but also do not know how to go about it as we live in separate countries and very rarely catch up, as there isn't any reason for us to. But here's what happened from HS.

&amp;#x200B;

We were neighbors back then and we were best friends. We had school friends to hangout with but aside from school it was him who I shared my lowest points with and vice versa. I had a bit of a crush on him but kept it under control since he didn't feel the same way. Though he knew that and we sort of just accepted that and went on fine. In senior year he went on to get a girlfriend so I kept a respectful distance. But since my family was going through tough times he was voluntarily there for me through some rough patches. Time went on and obviously since I had no game with him, I moved on and started dating another guy.

&amp;#x200B;

But soon after he stopped talking to me completely. Now we went to a very small school of 70, and given that he was my neighbor I saw him a lot but he just straight up cut me out of his life one day. I was pretty much broken because despite having a crush on him before, he was also my best friend. I tried confronting him about it but he would not give me a reason. Just like that, HS ended on an incredible low for me. Truth be told, it was heartbreaking and I still feel incredibly sad about it every once in a while when I think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this year, we caught up briefly very recently over text and he actually apologized to me for acting like a jerk. But since it was text I didn't dig deeper into the situation but guys I am still dying to know what exactly happened and why he decided to act that way. Is this something I should pursue and figure out? I figured that since we are now adults we can talk about it maturely, or is this just something I should try to forget?

If they see me on my phone they complain that it’s a distraction and I need to put it away but the other new girl has her ringer on full blast and takes personal calls at her desk. When I ask why it’s okay for her I am told it’s because her daughter is disabled so it’s okay. 

I feel like a third wheel at work. I honestly don’t know why they offered me the job if they didn’t know what they wanted me to do. And I’m angry that I am not being treated with the respect and professionalism that I treat everyone else with. 

I’m starting to get depressed. I am always stressed. And sometimes I just get up and go cry in the bathroom at work because I am just so miserable. I can’t quit because the health insurance covers my sons therapy (he’s autistic and has anxiety disorder) and my husbands does not. We can’t afford it otherwise. 

I need help and I don’t know what to do. Do you have any advice for me?

75,"I want to say that it was a very intense argument that I absolutely think would have resulted in blood had they not noticed I was filming. I tried to call for my managers in the store to alert them that we might have an incident but no luck. I was the only employee out in the parking lot. So of course I began to film because I think it was very possible I needed to call the police. 

It is not illegal to film in public without consent here. But I was told it is against store policy for the employees to film customers. They came in and made a complaint about me (of course). Said I was Facebook live- I was not. I deleted the videos in front of her. My bosses did not get a chance to see how they were behaving and I don’t think here are parking lot cameras. 

Once they noticed I was filming they did make threats to my safety, but I was not following them or anything and I figure well if they assault me it’s on camera now. 

If I get told I’m being let go over this, is there any way to fight it? 

I’ve never been written up or fired before. 

Also, I wasn’t out of line, right? I told my bosses exactly why I did what I did. I showed them the phone logs in which I tried contacting the store. Sure, I made them uncomfortable but if there was blood then I have (had) proof of the assaults.

76,"There’s someone that I’ve been friends with for a while. We used to make kinda edgy jokes, but one time it went too far. I made a bad joke, I don’t remember what it was about, but I know it was bad. He got really mad at me and I panicked. I stopped talking to him for a long time because I thought he hated me and I didn’t wanna bother him. Looking back it seemed like he forgave me pretty quickly, but at the time I didn’t know. I’m pretty sure he took my avoiding him out of shame as me hating him, and he stopped talking to me. It’s been two years now (I know that this has been going on for too long but it’s hard for me to forgive myself) and we avoid eachother whenever we can. Whenever we’re forced to be in the same place the only comments he makes to me are passive aggressive ones. It feels weird to apologize now since it’s been so long, and it would kinda just seem obsessive and weird. Our friendship was also more of a joking one, so being this vulnerable would just feel uncomfortable and out of place. I’m even fine if we won’t be friends again, I just want him to know that I don’t hate him and that I’m sorry.",03Nov2018,1

78,"I'm a freshman and I've met a lot of people. My hall is really close, closer than most other halls. We eat meals together, go out together, and generally hang out every day. The only problem is that the group that likes going out, is kind of splintering off and it seems like I'm not apart of that.

They're not being jerks and are still nice to everyone, but they made they're own group chat and generally its on me to go out with them, versus they will reach out to others and ask them what they're doing.

I'm not hurt by this. I can't force them to be great friends with me and everyone has they're reasons, but I'm in an awkward place. My hall's closeness kinda stopped me from actively reaching out to other people, I just kinda became lazy about it.

So little intro I’m 19 years right now and I don’t work I just stay at home and do nothing but drink alone. Little sad but that’s my life right now. 

my best friend and i met in high school about 6/7 years ago (high school starts when you’re 12 in my country) we weren’t really friends in the beginning but after 2 years we started to be really good friends. We went on vacation together  and spend all weekend watching bad horror movies. In 2016 we  both graduated high school and I was second best of the class and I’m pretty proud of that ( i just had to mention it )


So in 2017 i didn’t do anything no job no friends I did went to school for 6 months and hated it so I quit. But in January 2018 I started a job but i wasn’t really ready for it so I quit end of February not proud of that but it is what it is. 
so from February too july my best friend and I spend almost every day together working out, watching movies, drinking wine (i was 18 and that’s the legal drinking age here)we had a lot of fun. 

Then we booked a vacation with my sister and her boyfriend and all was good until one week before the vacation she texted me that I was canceling too much on plans like going to the gym and going tanning stuff like that ( even though she would cancel on  stuff like I housesitting my sisters house when I bought dinner for 3 nights and she would cancel last minute ) 
she knows that I don’t always have the energy to go out(I have a illness that’s gives me pain every day and makes me tired a lot And there is no medication for it) 

but i tried telling her that if I talked about it she would talk about how she had pain in her back and a shitty home situation. But I always listened to her and gave her advice but she didn’t follow it. We talked it out but I was still irritated that she never listen too me and that she had to say  that what happens to her was always 10 times worse than what was going on with me. So we went on vacation all was fine but she would make annoying comments to me and she would ignore me when I would say something to her. She was picked up at the airport by her boyfriend. my sister her boyfriend and I where picked up by my dad and after that I haven’t seen her anymore. Two days after we went on vacation it was my birthday she texted me one day before my birthday that she couldn’t make it because her grandpa was sick (her grandmothers boyfriend). So my birthday comes and I spend the day preparing snacks and drinks. I get a Snapchat from her with a full face off make up and cute clothes with the text OMW. she normally doesn’t wear allot off makeup or dresses up only when she is going out so I was pretty annoyed that she lied to me that she couldn’t come and after that day I didn’t get a text or call even though we would normally text everyday. So I don’t get it I don’t know what I did wrong of course I do things wrong but I was always there for her when she wasn’t feeling good or if she didn’t have any money I would pay for stuff or if she couldn’t sleep at home she could stay with me. I just feel sad because i don’t want to lose her as a friend because I already don’t have many friends and spend my time mostly alone. So I don’t know what too do.",03Nov2018,1
80,"I’ve been planning on moving out with a friend A for a while, we’ve known each other since preschool. She’s ready and I’m not and I think she’s getting impatient. She invited her friend B (I know her from high school) to move out with her and I and B is ready too.

I told them they could move out without me and I would move in later because I’m not ready and they’re both working full time so they could afford to swing 50/50 rent until I move in and make it 1/3 each. They didn’t seem to go for this idea but I don’t know why. It doesn’t seem like they’re trying to kick me out of the plan either so I’m confused.

Regardless, I don’t want to live with B. She’s dumb and I don’t really like her. She said that she’s “really good at driving drunk.” I don’t even know where to start on that. And everything she says sounds straight off of /r/ThatHappened. And I turn 21 in January and she expects me to buy her alcohol which is never going to happen.

Idk should I cut my losses and let them do their own thing? I’m not that close with A and I don’t want to live with B. They’re both ready and it would be selfish of me to keep them from moving out. I feel like I could possibly find a better arrangement for cheaper on Craigslist or something anyway when I’m actually ready. Is this all petty? Should I just let it go and deal with B?",03Nov2018,1

However, I don’t know why I’m so nervous. It mostly stems from the fact that she’s hooked up with many guys, so being with me would be terrible.

82,"Here's the deal....I'm in professional school (I can't disclose which profession I'm in). I don't have a degree, yet (relevant for the future). I went to undergrad for 4 years without graduating and was accepted into this school's professional program (which I am extremely thankful for because I truly don't deserve it).

Here's the deal.

My grandmother ""paid"" for my tuition when I was born through a state program. I also was on scholarship throughout undergrad, but still had to borrow money to pay for rent even though my parents make an extremely good income (in my opinion). My father refused to pay my rent and living costs. I understand this is completely normal and I am extremely thankful for the opportunities I've been given. I have held jobs since I was 16 and understand what it's like to be on the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, even with my tuition ""paid for"" and being on scholarship, I already have accrued student loans exceeding $60,000. If I decide to graduate from this professional school, I will have over $100k in student loans. Even though I will make minimum $90k/yr with the prospective profession that I'm entering, I have never hated anything more in my life. 

I go to class on a daily basis and want to kill myself. It's the worst thing I have ever experienced. There is no opportunity for personal expression and you give up your soul just to make $$$ from corporate bureaucrats that will work you to the bone just so they can continue to make millions every year.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to drop out and get an undergrad degree and do whatever I feel like doing at this point. I have never felt more strongly about anything in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The only opposition I have is my family. If I ""obey"" my family and do as I'm told, I will surely inherit some money in the future and will easily be able to live. But, if I disobey, then I will surely be cut out of the will and my entire paternal side of the family will never speak to me again. That is the last thing I want. I love my father. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I only get one go around on this planet and being so young, I have no other wish than to follow my dreams. Even if that means not making very much money. I just want to live my life as I see fit, regardless of income. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, Reddit, what should I do?

P.S. My favorite song is ""My Way"" by Frank Sinatra or Elvis, for context.

Talks too loud, too much, and keeps repeating things and asking qyestions Ive already answered. Just assumes I like something just because he does. Is insisting I listen to his favorite songs even though I dont listen to that type of nusic and its only our second date. The music he listens to is what i listened to in highschool and I cant seem to get him to understand that I no longer care about Sleeping With Sirens or Pierce The Veil and all that. Sure, as an emo teenager the fact that I listened to them was a huge part of my identity. But now the music I listen to has nothing to do with my identity and who I am, and I cant get him to understand that. And its okay that he likes South Park and anime and stuff, but I dont care for it and yet its still all he wants to talk about with me. Like awesome, lots of my friends watch Rick and Morty but no I dont want to watch it with you. And when he tries to relate to me on my interests he just sounds like a child who doesnt know what theyre talking about. 
And he cant just ask me a question. He asks me, I answer and then he keeps saying 'are you sure' like six gotdamned times as if I dont know what Im talking about. 
And he seems to think I give a flying fuck about party drugs. I dont. I couldnt care less about fucking acid and no Im not going to a rave. Maybe when I was a teenager but at this point in my life that shit doesnt interest me. And its ojay that thats what he likes. But he keeps fucking pushing it on me. And we went on two dates.
And he cant answer any of my questions. Its all a fucking joke. ""Do you want me to wait for you outside?"" ""Do you think you should"" ""idk youre driving and Im asking you"" ""lol"" 
Im five years younger than he is and I feel like Im babysitting him. Hes not a fucking adult and he is so fucking annoying and whiny and fragile and every time I make a fucking comment he asks me ""did I do something wrong"" like no not really Im just telling you I dont want to meet your friends because I dont even fucking know you.

Maybe Im ranting a bit.

I want to move out of the town we live in now, because it's boring. Everyone is either retired or middle-aged with kids, I have no peer-friends and even co-workers are ten years older or more (people my age are here temporarily and are bartenders or wait staff for the summer). She wants to stay here because her parents live here, and she 100% doesn't want to move. (She cries after leaving her parents house across town because she misses them, meanwhile my family lives across the country and I'm fine). Since the people she knows are all married, engaged, having kids and getting dogs, that's what she wants. She literally cannot wait for me to get a high-paying job so that we can do things like ""get a house, get a dog, get married"" and has mentioned wanting to be a stay at home mom. Meanwhile, I want to hunker down and be frugal to pay off my student loan debt for a few years. I also feel like my health has been deteriorating as she is vegan and the only food we keep tends to be vegan, even though my usual diet included milk, eggs, and meat, those things just aren't around as much, as I am pressured to conform what I eat and what we cook together to be vegan, because meat is gross and can't touch other cooking utensils, and I technically can eat vegan whereas she won't eat what I want to eat.

I love her, but we definitely have our differences. I have never liked to stay in one place for long, and never considered this town to be my end-game. She has never been too far from home. I would describe her as extremely sheltered even though she catches on to new things quickly and is intelligent. She is materialistic, knows all the designer brands, etc. and I can't remember the last time I bought new clothes. She is very organized and has strict routines, I am creative and go with the flow. She is extremely emotional and scared of everything, overly sensitive to stuff, so I find myself taking care of her a lot.

I'm poised right now to where I could easily transition into being here forever and settling down, I know her family and we all like each other a lot. I'm comfortable with our differences despite the occasional disagreement, but I can't shake the feeling that maybe I should go out and have new experiences before I make the decision to settle down. I feel like I'm losing parts of myself being tied down, but if I leave I know it will devastate her and her family fully expects me to be ""the one."" 

Does anyone have experience with this kind of thing or can offer insight?

I thank them for letting me know and inform them that after I leave the school, that I will be heading to her pediatrician's office to get her checked out. They take a urine sample and it comes back negative for a UTI and they tell me that she has a yeast infection, prescribe her an ointment, and send us one our way. Fast forward to the present day November 2nd. I am at home, trying to enjoy a quiet day with my family when there's a knock at the door. It's CPS with another sexual assault allegation about my daughter. They ask to look in my refrigerator and see my girls' room. I comply and answer their questions. They seem satisfied and leave, stating that they will be in touch. As of this point in time, I do not know exactly who called them but I know that it is someone at the school. This is harassment and I don't know what I can do about it. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. ",03Nov2018,1
104,"Background: my dad is 68 years old and haven’t retired yet because our family is poor, and he wanted to work to get me and my brother out of college before he can quit his job. 

This is his typical day. Work up at 5:00 AM, pray for an hour. Clean the house, till 7:00 and go to work. He comes home from work at 6:00 PM, sleep for 3 hours. Then wake up at 9:00, have dinner for an hour, then clean the kitchen, the restroom, clean our ancestor altar until 2:00 AM in the morning and sleep till 5:00 and repeat his day. Now as you can see, the man only has at best 6 hours of sleep for his age and they are not even consecutive sleep.

Now his health is deteriorating, i can hear it im his voice. Everything he does is slower now, he constantly has dark spot around his eyes and he  can barely stay awake during the week days. His employer had to forced him to take 2 days off because they noticed that he could barely stand at works. 

This man in his entire life, has managed to quit alcohol and smoking addictions at 20 and become a successful engineer so he can marry my mom. Even after he got fired from his engineer job, he was willing to work labor jobs so he can put me and brother through college. Its honestly stressing me out to see him like this. I have tried to tel him to go to sleep early or let me and my brother do the chore around the house but he won’t let us do it. He said he would rather do it himself because “its better that way.” I don’t know how to get through to him, i had a long talk with him but he just won’t listen to logic anymore and it’s stressing me out so much. A man like him shouldn’t have to suffered like this and I want to cry thinking about the fact that he could potentially died before i could fully repaid him. I just don’t know what to do and it makes me feel so helpless and useless.

111,"Hey r/Advice I'm back again for more advice. 

I realized something recently that might become a bigger problem down the road. So I'll summarize the memories that are leading to what might become a serious problem...

 I was molested when I was 5 by a family friend's 15 yr old son and it's really stuck with me even though I remember very little of it. I know it wasn't as bad as other cases and it stopped after the first time it happened but it shook me later when I started going through puberty. In around high school (I'd say freshman year) I was molested again by a class mate in class. A boy I had a crush on sat by me in science class and took advantage of my sheepish nature. It felt wrong but I wanted him to like me and it kind of felt good so it didn't seem so bad... So I let him do it to me. After that  I still sat by him and tried to keep it strictly friendly but, he'd beg me and try to push me into it everyday but I couldn't handle to feeling of disgust afterwards. Eventually I just moved seats away from him and completely ignored him and he went away eventually. 

These memories haven't crept up much in the past but now I notice them popping up more often in dreams and fantasies. Once it pops into my thoughts I have trouble pushing it out of my mind and I feel terrified. Sometimes when it gets really bad, it's like I'm being molested all over again. I feel as helpless as when I was five and I can feel it as if it's happening all over again. It was even the reason why I ended a relationship in high school, all he did was brush up against me while we were cuddling watching a movie. I had a panic attack and ended up leaving his house a while afterward. He did nothing to me, and I flipped out over, what I feel like, was over nothing. Sometimes I'm scared to feel aroused because if I do something remotely close to what they did I start to feel anxiety and terror as if it was going to happen again... What do I do? ",03Nov2018,1

113,"It's only the second day of no nut November, but even now it is plain to see how devoid my life is without masturbation. I have no hobby's or friends who I hang out with on a regular basis. In my 18 years of existence I have contributed nothing to society, I have changed nothing and have helped no one, I don't even have a job. I see myself as a leech on society.

I have spent, I would say at least 1/3 of my life sitting on my bed watching YouTube and browsing the internet. I feel as though I have wasted my teen years doing nothing. I have no skills or interests and see myself as lesser than my peers. In fact when I'm in school I feel as though I am not even human. I often times compare my life to that of my peers and enter a state of self loathing, because I don't have a life and they do. I'm very childish and am unprepared for the real world once I get out of high school. I see my self as an autistic man child. I had a test done to see if I had autism, it said no, but it doesn't matter because even if I don't I am too shy to talk to people I don't know and when I do talk to people I am loud, brash, and don't understand social cues. 

I still don't believe the test, because when I was in my old school I use to do stupid autistic shit all the time and have learned recently some people from thought I was stupid and autistic. I can't blame them for thinking that way and based on my actions while at that school I agree. I thought they were my friends and laughing with me but in reality they were probably laughing at me and I was to dumb to see it. That being said that school and situation were better then the one I find my self I find myself in right now, because at least I felt at home there.

I got away with a lot of shit at my old school, but like Icarus I flew to close to the sun. On a Wednesday in January of this year, I got expelled  because a guy threw a shoe In my face for spilling  his coffee, I was angry, but he was bigger than me so I decided to punch my best friend in the face instead because  he was smaller and weaker than me. Did I fail mention  how besides being a lowly leech I'm also a total piece of shit, undeserving of friendship. I hit my best friend in the face because I was angry at another person. I am an asshole undeserving of life. Still further like Icarus I flew farther towards the sun, my friend after being punched said ""I'm going to tell on you"", and like an ass I replied ""I dare you to."" And like that my wax wings melted and I came plummeting towards earth.

I was called the principals office, he told me I was going to be expelled. I broke down and cried  like a bitch. I had a knife in my pocket that day I considered citing open my wrists right there in his office, I regret not doing it. 

I am to afraid to talk to anyone in this school, and I know no one. The private school I used to go to was my home, I knew every one there, every student, every teacher, every staff member. I now know what exile feels like. I am like Napoleon and the public school is my Elba. I am certain I will die alone.

Being expelled isn't the source of my suicidal thoughts.   Because even while I was at my old school I thought about suicide often. It always seemed like such an inevitability. I have always been suicidal. I may not know the time of my death but I know it will come by my own hand. If it is inevitable I was thinking why not now? I have nothing to live for. there really isn't any point in going to college if I know I'm just going to commit suicide. Plus I'm not prepared to live a life as an adult alone in the world. So why not now?

114,"So we broke up around a year ago. I have talked to her exactly once since. Its not like we had a BAD breakup or anything. I actually still have some of the pictures we have together as a memory of sorts reminding me of my first love and my senior year in highschool. Point is, there's no bad blood. At least not on my end.

The reason for me not talking to her since is that I purposely cut her off. I've had this strict policy my whole life that I'll never be friends with an ex. That said, I've kinda gone back on my strict policy in the last year.
I kinda want to talk to her. I don't really think I would want to pursue a romantic relationship again(probably), but I DO want to catch up and maybe be friends. I've changed alot since we broke up, and I'd imagine she has too.
She was a cool chick and we shared quite a few interests. We wouldn't have dated otherwise.
Also just because I miss her a bit. Again, not romantically, but platonically. I want to talk again is my point. 

Problem is, it feels like it's too late now. She knows full well how my policy on exes was, and I blocked her on practically all social media. Plus, again, I don't know if she hates me or anything. Contacting her wouldn't be risk free. We live in a small town together. If anything went wrong, and if she decided to call me a creep or something, news would spread very quickly.

116,"I spent the last 5 minutes looking for a good subreddit to post this on, because I really need help/answers with this situation. 

Over the past few weeks/months, some amount of cash has been missing from my dad's wallet. He generally takes some money out of the bank every week, and he is good with math and has a good memory, so the suspicion has been falling more and more on me and my younger brother as of late. 

The first time this happened, $10 were taken, and he assumed he misplaced them somewhere. The second time, $10 were also taken, but there were more singles in the wallet, which he found as very odd. The third time, $20 were taken (leaving one 5-dollar bill and a few singles) and my mom's purse was also opened. When this event happened, my parents sat my brother and me down and gave us a half-hour lecture on honesty. I know I didn't do it, and I'm reasonably sure my brother didn't either (he's 13), so I was very confused/scared for that half-hour. 

Finally, today. Actually, 10 minutes ago. I'm working on schoolwork in my living room, and my mom walks down in a huff, and tells me that more money has been stolen than before. Again, just from my dad's wallet, and this time, it's enough that it has become a growing concern. 

I *know* I didn't steal money, but my parents have caught me lying about things in the past (generally not as severe as grand larceny), so they don't trust me as much. I am also fairly certain my brother didn't steal the money. I don't know how to convince my parents that I didn't steal anything, and by proxy, neither did my brother, and I don't know how to stop this random acts of theft. Any suggestions/thoughts/advice?

*By the way, everything I've said here is 100% true, give or take a few numerical values of money and such. Please don't speculate on the veracity of the claims, because I'd rather not focus on the improbability and more so on how this can be fixed ASAP. This note might make you more likely to think the story isn't true, and I understand that. But I wanted to write this here just to tell everyone that yes, it's true, and I really want this solved bad.* ",03Nov2018,1

118,"A bit of a backstory. Three months ago I (30m) have made the brave decision to move to Melbourne in an attempt to improve my work-life balance. Despite not having any contacts in this city,  after five years of working as a dentist in a small town, life got very boring. My partner of three years was to follow, but this would take time as he was still at university and he would need to find a college to accept some of his credits. 

Fast forward three months and I could never have predicted the sequence of events. My partner and I split up and he moved on quickly with someone new. This has affected me deeply, far more than I had thought. 

My family have never been helpful in such situations and are heavily financially dependent on me. To cut a long story short; my mother is in a legal battle with my father and she expects me to give up most of my life savings to help her win over some assets. At first, I was willing to do this, but as life had become harder, the fear of losing all that I have saved is beginning to affect me. 

My best friend who has always been a great support to me has become really ill. I have not been able to contact her or communicate with her for the past year. All other friends I have had were mostly from my previous job. 

I have become very lonely here in this big city. Each day is becoming harder and I am not sure what to do. I am becoming crippled with anxiety and have not slept in weeks, which is contributing to this self destructive cycle. I am trying to  be social and force myself to do things, but I feel I have lost the capacity to connect to people. I feel I have lost hope in connection and trying. 

A month ago, I felt I was near breaking point and took a holiday back home to be around my family. I have never really exposed my feelings to them, but this time I did. It was a cry for help. However, as I was always the strong one in the family, they did not know how to respond and unfortunately, their concerns were still always financially focused. 

Now I am here wondering what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

120,"Over the past year I've been wanting to start working out, just because I was tired of being skinny and wanted to feel more confident in myself. I started in the summer and it went on for about a month with no results. I know a single month is not a lot of time, but I still think I should have seen at least SOME improvements. After grade 9 started I gave up on it because I didn't get any results, and that school was overwhelming me. It took me a while to realize that I did a lot of things wrong then, like choosing the wrong exercises, spending to little time working out, etc. But recently over the past month (now October) I've started working out again for a full month now. This time, I worked out for about 40 minutes (30 minutes longer than in the summer), and I tried much harder. It's the start of November now, and I still have no results. I don't even notice any tiny changes. I still can't do more than 5 push ups without my arms failing me. The reason I'm writing this is because recently, I feel like i'm getting weaker. Not physically, but mentally I am not motivated in the slightest simply because I feel like I'm getting nowhere. When I started working out again I was super motivated, so I could push myself much harder than I can now. I was supposed to work out today, but chose not to so I could write this and over the weekend decide if I should give it up or not.

My girlfriend (F43) and I (19M) have been dating for just a month and it already got bad. Our huge age difference is relevant here cause so many people have told me already to leave the relationship when I could due to our age difference and it’ll turn into a train wreck... I should’ve listened 

It’s gotten so bad that I’ve instead found comfort with her friend/co worker (50F). We were capable of spending a lot of time with each other because there were times where my girlfriend wanted time to herself or she was at work. When her friend went off to lunch break she was actually meeting up with me to have a quickie in her car or (sometimes) at her apartment.  I even went as far as telling her that she’s so much better in bed than my gf which is true...

Just the other night I felt so guilty about the whole affair that I decided to call my gfs friend and tell her that we have to end it. She agreed and told me that she loved being around me and is still open to hanging out with me without sexual interaction. My gf has told me before that she’ll kick my ass if I ever cheat on her but I think she deserves to know without me not beating around the bush. I realized that this was wrong ! 

I’ve been spending a lot more time with my girlfriend than usual and we had sex again last night but it don’t last long. I had to end it fast cause she told me to (saying this as PG13 as possible) ejaculate in her. She even asked me when I’m gonna marry her. I’m not ready for this shit I’m too young.

However, in certain situations, mainly when placed on the spot or put under some types of perceived pressure, my mind goes completely blank. I'm pursuing a career in law enforcement, and in order to get hired, I will need to pass an oral board interview. Such interviews are going to keep me from employment if I don't improve my speaking (and listening) ability under perceived pressure.

For example, in interview settings (we're practicing interviews in Academy), I can't help but get a strong adrenaline rush. It's often strong enough that I can feel my heart pounding in my chest and feel the throbbing up to my face as it gets flushed, and I can feel my muscles start to get that 'sore' feeling that often comes with an adrenaline rush. A lot of the time, I'll get visibly shaky and all but lost my fine motor control. I'll start sweating profusely too, if I'm under this pressure for more than a minute or two. I can't focus on the question being asked for the life of me, or if I manage to do so, I forget it the second it is finished. Sometimes if I'm lucky, I'll retain the question, but I won't be able to formulate an adequate response, or any response. My mind will race, but also go completely blank, if that makes any sense. This is incredibly frustrating because when other classmates go up for a mock interview, and I'm not on the spot, I can mentally articulate what I believe to be a 5/5 response and have done so for every question I've heard thus far.

I know what I can do to prepare for the oral board questions specifically, but none of that preparation will have any benefit if I suddenly develop retrograde amnesia when asked a question.

I love my hair and my boyfriend! Zomg!” That sort of thing. And there are several accounts with bios like this and pictures of me as a 13-15 year old. I can see all of this easily by googling my first and last name on the first page of the results. Of course, I don’t remember the usernames or passwords of these accounts so I can’t delete them. It’s very unsettling and I’m not sure if I can do anything about this. Any future employers can see all of this stuff. Although none of it is bad, it is extremely embarrassing.

My best friend (male) was talking about how he was very upset and I (female) being stupid decided that I could go to his house to just provide support and be a good friend to someone I have been friends with for 12 years. When I got there, we talked for a long time. He all of a sudden starting touching me. I told him that I was not interested at all and that having sex with him or anything of the sort was not my intention at all. He continued to pressure me into doing stuff and I continued to respond with a very firm and clear no. He dropped it and carried on with conversation. Then after about 30 minutes had passed, with no warning or consent, he put his hand down my pants. I said no very clearly again, but then I was frozen and shocked and scared. I told him to stop again and he didn’t. I started crying and I shoved him off and I went home. I’m still in high school and I have no idea how to address it. This happened a few weeks ago and I just see him every single day and pretend that it didn’t happen. I have no idea how to handle this situation, I’m just scared. Any advice?",03Nov2018,1

134,"So I was recently hired by a new company. I’m a nurse and this will be my first salaried 8am-5pm type position. I’m currently needing to visit my doctor and have labs drawn every month, and of course my physician’s office is essentially only open when I will be scheduled to work! This is temporary and should only be until next summer.

I’m wondering when it would be best for me to bring this to the attention of my manager. Since it is both an appointment and lab work it can take 90-120 minutes to complete, so I do not think it is something I can work into a normal length lunch break. My first day doing corporate orientation is November 5th and my first day working at my location will be November 12th. My next appointment is November 21st in the afternoon (day before Thanksgiving). 

Is it sketchy for me to email this info to my manager now? Is it not enough notice for me to tell her in person on the 12th? I hesitated to bring this up earlier in the process as I did not want it to hurt my chances of getting the job. The PTO package is generous so I should have the option of getting paid, I am more concerned with looking like a jerk for taking time off work on my third week.

135,"I live in Minnesota, USA and I'm looking to purchase a mobile home.  It gets very cold here in the winter, with temperatures dipping nearly -20 F/-28C in the winter.  I'm not too concerned about keeping myself cool in the summer, since all I'd have to do is dip in one of the lakes around here and cool off, and it's uncommon for temperatures to get above 90 degrees F/32 degrees C.   

I need to know how to heat the HOME and not myself.  When it gets to be this cold, you run the risks of your pipes freezing.  I do not want to use an electric space heater because it can get pretty expensive.  I'm thinking of getting a central heating unit, but most of them use electricity.  Nor do I want to get an open flame, because of the risk of fire.   


Please do not give me advice on how to heat a mobile home if you've never lived in a climate where it dips below 15F on a regular basis, or if you don't know the difference between an RV and a mobile home.

136,"I'm in college, hence the reason why I'm mainly working retail at the moment.

Our orientation was cut off short, so I wasn't shown where everything was. I never knew there was a chart for when I'm supposed to do what . So I pretty much had to be told by supervisors. They just threw me out there on my first day too. Two weeks in, I missed my turn to get the carts because I didn't know so I got into trouble for it. I felt a bit down but I just learned to move on from it.

Then they called me over and told me that the big boss wanted the dairy windows cleaned. It wasn't part of my normal job but I sucked it up and did it. It took me an hour... I mentioned it to my coworker during my break, and I was told that there were usually people who cleaned it and it was weird that I had to. A week later, they told me to do it again... I was frustrated to say the least, on top of other things going on.

Then two weeks later, I came into work, expecting the same routine. I checked the chart. I wasn't on there, which I found weird. I asked my supervisor. She didn't know. I asked her if I should do something else. She said yes. Two hours later, they told me that I was a janitor for that shift.. A position that requires two days of training. They had someone explain to me in 10 minutes. 2 days worth of training in *10 minutes*. I started having a meltdown in the restroom that I was supposed to clean because of all the work environment and all the stress I've been dealing with lately.

Plus the fact that managers and supervisors talk shit about employees where other people can easily overhear didn't help.

I ended up clocking out and going home after I told 2 of my friends/coworkers that I'm quitting. My supervisor saw me walk out but didn't stop me, call me that day, etc. I didn't come in for my next shift. Other supervisor called me and left a voicemail, asking me what's going on. They asked my friend about the day I walked out. I didn't go in for my next shift either. The supervisor who saw me walk out called me. Left a voicemail too. Then I got a text from my manager, asking me if I was coming in. I didn't answer.

To get a closure, I texted my manager this: ""I'm so sorry that I quit the way I did. I was actually planning on sticking around for a while then turn in my 2 week notice. It sounds like an excuse but I have too many things going on and I just snapped last Monday."" It wasn't a lie when I said this.

I got a reply from her... ""No worried... I understand... I just had no clue. I hope the best for you.""

Then I replied ""I know I've said this already but I'm genuinely sorry. Thank you for understanding. I hope the best for you too. Would you consider taking me back in couple of months, after I have my stuff sorted out?""

She replied ""Yes!! Absolutely.""

I don't know if I'll ever go back, but I know that they're always desperate. Do you think she really meant it when she said yes? Do you think I was justified walking out?",03Nov2018,1

I went through the dorm process when I transferred to college, although I only lived with my roommate for a semester. I really didn't like the guy, but whatever. This year I have a different option. A large group of my fraternity friends are living in a luxury apartment complex. It would be 4 rooms of 4 in each room people all next to each other. The apartment is like a resort, and it's not too expensive either, but that's because it's far from campus. Probably between 15-20 minutes. I'm also a little bit concerned at how much weed they might smoke. While there is a porch, I see them smoke weed inside (in the living room) all the time at their house. I really don't like the smell of weed, this could be a problem, but I could also complain enough and maybe they'll smoke outside.I love walking, but my concern is that I might feel isolated from campus. The bars are so far away. The area I am in is more popular with graduate students. 

Now here's the good part: This would be a lot like living in the fraternity house (which I never did). There would always be something going on with 16 people living next to each other. The apartment complex is super nice, there's a heated pool and a jumbo tron, and it's honestly not much more than normal rent in the city. I am on the boxing team at my school, we practice 3 times a week. This apartment complex is literally right next to where I practice. The last thing is that this area is in more of the city part than the student part, and I do like seeing the city.

150," I'm a 21 year old University student from a very strict and religious family. I don't consider myself a part of that religion due to the fact that I stopped praying and slowly stopped believing in god due to the many flaws and inconsistencies I've noticed in the religion. Another reason why I stopped believing is due to my parent's flawed way of thinking that led them  to making a few mistakes. One mistake led to the passing of my dad.  


When my dad passed, our family's life turned upside down. My mom had to fill the role of two individuals in the house, even though he basically forbid her from learning anything about surviving, which made her start from nothing. She had to learn about how to pay a mortgage, learn how to manage money, pay bills, create a source of income, etc.  


Over the past 3 months, my mom began suspecting my lack of praying, so she kept asking me about it and I kept lying to her and telling her that I do pray. As much as I don't hate lying, I've been lying to my parents about me praying and being religious since I was 12 basically. Mainly due to the fact that they don't negotiate such things. My dad goes straight into unbearable yelling, and my mom treats it as if I've killed a whole family and she was the first to find out.  


I know lies don't last for too long, so I've been expecting her to know one day or another. She recently asked me if I pray or not for the 10th time this month and she kept insisting that I don't, so I agreed and said that I've been SLOWING down my prayers, keeping the lie of me not praying since the age of 12 hidden.   


Once she found out, she said how she won't feed me, kick me out of the house, how she didn't expect me to be such a low life like that, and everything else that comes with the ""I'm right, you're wrong, my religion is the right way, and my mind can't be changed"" speech package. (Note that I only said ""I haven't been praying much over the past year or so"" rather than ""I'm not religious, and I haven't prayed since the age of 12"" so it's not even that bad).   


One solution that I considered is to pray just to keep her sanity because I don't want her to go crazy and I've got a lot of work planned so I wouldn't want this disrupting it.  


TLDR: My mom just found out that ""I don't pray much."" When in reality I haven't prayed since I was 12 as I stopped believing in religion.

I wanna keep this short so. I havent been in a relationship in years not because i cant or anything or that im insecure about how i look but because i dont make the effort to put myself out there or display my interest in a female. However, things changed when I was approached by someone and she asked for my number, it didnt happen like that but basically her family member came over to me and said that the female in question(we'll call her pinky) took an interest in me and wanted my phone number. Pinky had walked by moments before into an aisle to reach her other family members or something like that. While doing so, she gave me a look and before this(while i helped other people at my job) Pinky was looking at me every time i steered my eyes in her direction(she was beautiful)

&amp;#x200B;

 Half an hour passed by and Pinkys family member had taken down my number(i dont know if it ever reached her) I regret not going and giving my number personally but her family member did say something about not being too obvious about it because of pinkys father......anyway then came my lunch, i spent it outside for hopes of being approached by pinky and her family member again as things left off pretty weirdly. During the middle of my lunch they came outside, loaded up their car and was getting ready to drive off. Now keep in mind that its dark outside and not much visibility as the lights in the parking lot were very dim. Just before they were about to pull off, they honked at me, the car was about 30-40 meters away and i saw what was a hand from the passenger window swaying back and forth. I could not tell whether it was a gesture saying goodbye or telling me to go to them. I took it as a goodbye...the sad part is that I havent been contacted(its been 24 hours).

This is important because this one friend in particular has always given me confusing feelings.

Ever since i first met her years and years ago, i thought that she was a bright, beautiful funny person. My friends and i joked that she had all the makings for a perfect gf but I’ve always treated her like a friend. Even then, she always seems to linger in my head more so than any of my other close friends, male or female. Thing is, i have no idea whether or not it is an love, a general acknowledgement that my friend is attractive, or just me missing my friend

Now tbh, i’ve done some dick things in effort to stop having confusing feelings for her. I’ve lowered my direct interaction with her, not shown up to get togethers because she was there, even run through my head what could be wrong with her to make her less attractive to me. But she always ends up in the back of my mind. 

Now i’m not in the best place in my life. I don’t have it figured out at the moment so i don’t think a relationship is important rn. But lately, i’ve felt like if i don’t make a move anytime soon, we might drift apart.

I want to cut my extra costs, save up and just book a flight out of here and travel the world. See everything. I mean EVERYTHING, Work side jobs to make money while I’m traveling, I dont care. Just GO.

How do i drop everything (friends and family) and save enough to just go?",03Nov2018,1

For example, I love the Nightmare Before Christmas, and I occasionally have tea, so she got me a mug, which I do use on occasion but shes often got a sad look when I don’t use something shes gotten for me, especially clothes. I stumbled across the gift she had for me this year on accident, I saw her wrapping when I was not supposed to(p.s she buys christmas gifts in advance) but its another mug, and its not a matter of “she does not know what I like or don’t like.” Because she does very well, I think shes just overestimated how much I like certain things. I appreciate her and care for her so much, and I appreciate her gifts no matter what.

181,"I've been in a chatting app group for 4 years now with a bunch of people I met on Twitter. We met IRL a few times and I love being friends with them. The thing is, I haven't been doing well lately, mentally. I am unemployed and sometimes when I check the group they are busy talking about their progress in life and it is making me quite bitter. (I haven't logged on to FB in a while now for the same reason) Also, they don't respond to me as much anymore lately and that made me feel so worthless. For the record, I am not venting my problems in the group. I only responded with some petty chats/stupid joke. Sometimes, they ignore my genuine question. 

(You know how it is like when people are actively chatting and you only come up with a short text/question that later get buried?)

The answer might be obvious - leave. However, I feel like I'd be overreacting by doing that. So, I muted and tried not to butt in any conversation they are having unless I have a genuine question (which is not getting much response)

183,"Hi, i just want to apologize in advance that this may be all over the place as i am not a professional writer. im a 23 year old female, i work 3rd shift alone, at a dementia care home with 6 residents. 

 I recently moved to a city close to the one i lived in before, i had/ have a roomate.  About 3 weeks before i moved the incidents started. They always happen when im alone and at night. The first incident i can remember, i was outside walking my husky at night before work and we had a small patch of woods next to the side of the house just outside the fence. Have you ever had a feeling of someone watching you? I had that feeling. I looked over and as soon as i did someone in the dark was looking in my direction and walked behind a tree. I thought it was weird but i didnt know what to think so i brushed it off. 

The second incident, i was again walking my dog at night before work in the front of the house and someone was walking by in a black hoodie, i turned away from the street and i looked back at the guy who i caught standing my way staring and then quickly turned away and kept walking slowly. I blew it off, again, and went inside to do my hair in the bathroom. When i went back to my room to grab my things, i looked towards the only open window in my room, which faces the backyard and it had a sheer black curtain. I saw someones hand coming through the window behind the curtain and when i looked whoever it was slowly pulled their hand out. I called the police and they didnt find anything. 

Fast forward from 4 weeks ago to now. Tonight i was talking to my dad who was there to bring me to work because my car had died earlier that day and had to go get fixed. We were in the kitchen, again at night. Let me say that my dads truck was in the drive and the lights were all on. I moved to a neighborhood with only elderly people and a new roommate (who was gone). When i recieved a knock at the door for about 5 seconds and then the doorbell rang. I was only 20 feet from the front door and my dad and i both got up fast and walked to the door. I had a bad feeling and so did my dad. He told me not to open the door until he looked out the window at the top of the door. I opened the door and there was no one there. My dad is 6 foot and a big guy, plus my front yard is big and no cars were outside the house besides my dads. My dad told me to close the door and lock it and he told me he didnt have a good feeling about it. 

Fast forward to my work. Again i work alone at night 3rd shift. I work sort of in the country and theres woods all around. I have lately been feeling like someone is watching me and sometimes always in the middle of the night  my work phone will ring twice and i answer the phone and no ones answers they just hang up. 

Help, i need advice and suggestions on what could be going on. Im freaked out

184,"*Tldr if you don't want to take an hour of your day to read my cringey story:
There's this girl who I first met in my class 1 and a half year ago, she's really shy and doesn't talk to any boys in our class neither that much to girls, and I like her but don't know how to approach. She did ask me something a few times last year but I gave up on her. Now she's in my class again this year and I feel like she does look at me sometimes and she asked me something again a few days ago. So what should I do?*

So this story is really weird and probably won't make sense to a lot of people, but let's do it anyway.

About 1 and a half years ago I went to a different school and got into a new class. And idk about other countries, but in the Netherlands Instagram is basically the big thing. And because of that, following someone on IG is like being friends IRL. So when the new school year starts, you basically look at every student in your class and look them up on IG and follow them, and they follow you back (almost all accounts are private btw). Me, being the semi-shy guy I am, I always look if some of my other classmates or friends is following that person and then request to follow them too. 

*Is it getting weird yet or is this basically the standard in like USA too?*

So there it all begins. There was a girl in my class who I really liked. She's not the type of girl who everyone has a crush on, but she looks really pretty imo. But she is so shy that she doesn't talk any boy in general, literally a few times that I've witnessed it last year, of which some were with me. And she didn't talk all that much with girls either. So obviously, I looked her up on IG and found her, and nobody from my class followed her yet. I just decided to go for it anyways, but she declined it. And again, being the weird guy I am, I still to this day sometimes think about whether she didn't even know who it was since it wasn't even a week into the school year or if she doesn't want me to follow her, since she is followed by some people from my old class now.

So her being shy make me sort of shy around her and I didn't talk to her that year (sort of like any dude in my class) except for two times when she did actually start the convo. Tho it wasn't really a convo, just a question about for instance how to do a certain assignment. Still tho, how sad it may sound, I was happy for the rest of the day if she did ask me something. But during the rest of the year nothing really happened and I decided to 'give up' on here. 

But the new school year started about 2 months ago and I'm in the same class as her again. I feel like she does sometimes look at me during class and I look at her too, but I might just be delusional haha. Anyway, now comes the part why I basically began really thinking about her again. At the start of a lesson, she asked me: Hey Danny, did you do your homework?' It's extremely silly, I know. I just respond I didn't, she said she didn't either and I said that she probably won't check it anyways and the lesson begun. It's some extreme stuff, I know people.

For real tho, I'm just wondering whether I'm being crazy or she might actually be interested in me. I know that 99% of the time when a girl would just ask something like that it doesn't mean anything, but she has literally never asked a guy anything this year that I know of. And if you would say she might be interested in me, what should I do to talk to her? Just ask here something school related to start? I'm 17yo btw, might help.

Thanks for reading this extremely weird and sad story, any advice would be highly appreciated ",03Nov2018,1
185,"Hi people, I really need genuine advice on a problem I'm facing...

Yesterday, I found my first job as a fresh graduate out of university. Everyone was happy for me, as my field was pretty much limited in terms of job availability. 
The problem comes when my mother asked me how much allowance I planned to give her on my first pay day. I didnt give her an answer on the spot, as I wanted to discuss monetary issues with my boyfriend. She was okay about it. 

Some background info: My boyfriend and I already have plans to buy a flat and we're trying to save to be able to afford one in the next 2-3 years. Adding on to the financial problem, both of us are in debt with our study loans. We're both in our early 20s and wants to settle down asap. Currently, only I have a stable job.

In short, my bf and I came to the conclusion that we would like to wait out a couple of months to stabilize our finances, while we plan how much we needed to save for our flat / renovation / study loans, and how much for survival, then can we decide how much we can set aside to give my parents. We prefer to have proper plans rather than regretting in the future. I broke the news to my mother, and she completely lost it. She cried, screamed and shouted. She called me an unfillial daughter, said all sorts of ugly things and pinned this entirely on my boyfriend. She claims that my boyfriend wants my money all to himself, and doesn't want to provide for her.....

Now I honestly don't know what to do. On one hand, I feel it is better for me to be stable first before providing for my parents. On the other hand, I do feel quite guilty that she has to wait a while before I hand her some money. Being asian, there is this 'rule' that the children have to start giving their parents money from the moment they started working.

I'm truly lost and need some advice. If you guys think what I'm doing is wrong, kindly explain to me too. I appreciate it. Thanks guys. ",03Nov2018,1
186,"So I started training at a new job on Tuesday. I was the first person to enter the room, I sat at a table, they all say at another table (4 other trainees). Leaving me sitting there by myself but tables only seat 4. So perhaps not a big deal? Eventually one girl invites me over and they Make space for me. Very awkward feeling. 

We are left alone to do training videos for three days. They talk and chat but I prefer to remain atleast 85% focused on the videos. So I take them seriously as  I am changing careers. 

I love to learn and answer questions. I consider myself a student and a learner. No one takes initiative and there is extreme awkwardness and hesitance amongst the trainees in the room so I start taking initiative and start engaging. 

They end up finding out I am type one diabetic. So they make comments about why I decide to eat a cupcake or cookie on various days. Today I finally snapped on one newer trainee and said ""what are you? my mother?"" I shouldn't have said that but I hate comments like that regarding my disease. I'm an adult and I know how to take care of myself. 

We finally hit the floors and start doing training there. I'm excited. I'm excited for this new line of work. I tell one co-trainee that I will meet him on the floor after lunch. He never comes. Maybe I missed a direction. 

I come across him and two other trainees while going through the facility. One 18 year old girl trainee who is obviously flirting with the other older Male continuously looks at me while about to say something then walks over to the other Male to whisper something out of ears reach and I hear him say back ""I'm gonna punch a n***a out."" I dont understand what the drama is about but I'm trying to pretend it isnt me. But it might be me. But I may just be nervous because it is a new job. But she could just be whispering be because she thinks I am a square which might make me a snitch. I dont know....otherwise...that sort of thing seems unprofessional and childish anyways.

I'm not exactly stranger to relationship problems at work which is why I'm trying to start off on the right foot. I take work seriously, I love to work, and I love to do a good job so this time I'm just trying to get by without bumping any heads intentionally. But I think in have already killed my chances. This time not on purpose. 

Now I just need to maintain a good relationship with the two other trainees and build good relationships with my new supervisor and new coworkers in my department. 

But I'm slightly stressed out, paranoid, and nervous. I need some advice and insight. I dont want to mess up this opportunity as I have finally made it out of the construction industry and found a job that will work with my school schedule and career goals. But I hate work related conflicts. I'm not good with them at all. I end up just finding a new job but I need to commit to a place for a long time, I've had too many jobs in the last 2 years.

191,"This is a very long, convoluted situation, but I'll try my best to explain.
Some background:
My dad recently got engaged to a woman who has lived with us for the past 4 years. Her and I butt heads a LOT. She has a very different way of dealing with things and is VERY uptight about every little thing (she might have some sort of OCD, I'm not sure). She has what I would call an ""aggressive"" personality and we don't see eye to eye on many many things. This is in sharp contrast to the rest of my family, as my brother, father and I are all very laid back, calm people. 

More relevant to this specific situation:
A few months ago my stepmom flipped shit on my for going into my father/her's room to borrow a charger while they weren't home, insisting that I never step foot in their room again as they have a right to privacy. Sure. I can respect, won't happen again. 

Months later, my dad found some vape/marijuana related products in my coat pocket and was very cool about it. He never knew I vaped or used marijuana but told me he respects my decision as an 18 year old to make the right choices and be responsible. He didn't encourage it or anything and said he'd prefer I didn't do it, but simply said to be smart about it and use with caution. He even said he's smoked weed before in the past and isn't entirely against it. He handed me my stuff back and we both went on with our days as normal, my stepmom was never involved.

A couple days ago I've noticed things missing in my room. Somebody has gone through my drawers and taken my vape charger. I assumed I lost it or something so I bought another one. I hid it in  different spot and yet again, it disappears shortly after. Third charger, and it DISAPPEARS again. I now know someone has been going through my room, and it certainly is not my dad as he is NOT one to ever do that. Finally, today my marijuana products were taken out of my hiding spot and disappeared completely. I know 100% it's my stepmom who has taken all of this. She hasn't said a single word to me or my dad though and this has been going on for weeks. 

Especially considering the huge debacle she raised about me going into their room without their permission months ago, how do I go about ending this? I'm conflicted as I want to ask for my stuff back (over 60 dollars worth), but they also are illegal products. I'm not sure how the situation will unfold if I bring up in front of my dad that she's been taking my marijuana products. 

Any advice on how to go about this? Sorry if there's any confusion! There's obviously a lot more that goes on behind the scenes then I can all type out!",03Nov2018,1

Long story short he’s been seein a chick, right? 

Well he ended up getting shit faced and basically told her to take a hike 

Now in the 4? months they’ve been seeing each other he’s expressed to me he has no interest in pursuing this relationship

So I told him to break it off

So he gets drunk, tells her that I told him a story that she’d told me, and that he thinks she’s a pos. Now she’s peeved i told him that story, cause I’m the moron who told her to keep it to herself as to avoid this, because she thinks that’s why he ended it. 

According to him and the last 4 months, it’s because she has a history of being an ass. I only mentioned the story BECAUSE he was complaining about how he wanted to end it. That’s why. To be like “yea man she’s not all that”

Now he’s upset bc she’s  a swell lass all of a sudden and didn’t deserve it

And I’m at my wits end.

I really wanna be like “block her or tell her you temporally went insane and didn’t mean it because this is stupid”. Like he told her she’s a nice girl or whatever and all that nonsense and it’s like she literally isn’t that’s why you ended it what in the holy hell is the matter with you.

What am I supposed to say at this point? This girl thinks it’s my fault he broke up with her. And also I just can’t listen to this wishy washy nonsense! I can’t! You have expressed multiple times you hate*loathe*extremely dislike this person to me. But to them they are an amazing person and you never doubted it. You’re being an asshole! 

What am I supposed to say man? How do I tell my friend this is a ridiculous situation? Is it even a ridiculous situation or am I being an asshole?

199,"Me and this girl hit it off perfectly everything going good . We vibe , we went on dates and we were perfect( in my eyes) sex is amazing , cuddling perfect . she would tell me that she wanted to be single and not like anyone but I was making it tough on her . She then told me she likes me and would tease me and her together . But we both know we weren’t ready ( more on her side like 99% her to my 1%) . Out of nowhere she then tell me she wants to end what we have . I’m shocked cause I thought it was good. She said she promised herself that she would be single for 3 years and work on herself . I told I’m not trying to jump in a relationship either but she tells me that she doesn’t want anything serious . Cause she know it’s turning it to it . And I explain to her that not the case. I told her I’m gonna be seeing just her and if wants to go out and stuff she can but she has to tell me . She agreed and I did also but like I said my eyes are only on her. 

Now I’m just completely heartbroken lol like I really was feeling her , and she just came out of nowhere with that . My brain is telling me to  forget this girl, she ain’t shit  but my heart is telling to me keep fighting for her.  Another added info is that she was telling I did more then any of her boyfriend have done . And I’m not a boyfriend.  I treated her like everything I ever wanted to treat my girl. And it sucks that she had a change of heart , I talked to her on the phone and she sounded on the fence about it but still Kills me .  And what sucks ever more is that this happen to me more than once when the girl leave and realize I give a fuck about them and actually like them and they come back and I lose totally interest in them . I don’t want this to happen to her. 

My question is what do I do? Do I move on and wait till she decides she made a mistake but risk my feelings empty for her or fight to show her I’m all about her?. I’m just confused . I texted her saying that I respect her decision but we should thing about it before we decided to end so Monday we gonna see each other Monday hopefully .

200,"My school didn't give me a bursary and I'm kind of upset about it. I felt like my odds were good for receiving one, but I guess I just got my hopes up. Neither of my parents attended college and I'm supported by a single parent that's on disability, who receives minimal financial support from the government to help support me while I am in school. And I'm Metis, which there are bursaries for.

I'm living in Quebec, but studying in Ontario and what sucks is that I'm not eligible for OSAP, which would have paid for my college tuition since my family income is less than $16,000 per year. Fortunately, I got a $9,500 dollar student line of credit with RBC, but I've already used about $6,400 paying for my first semester and essentials. I'm going to apply for bursaries/loans through the Quebec government, but if I don't get that also, I'll have to come up with nearly $3,000 by the 3rd semester and that scares me because I don't know where that money will come from. I already sold a bunch of my things at the beginning of the school year to pay for my safety gear and tuition deposit.

205,"Hi

Until recently I've never really had any female friends. I've had problems in the past with putting women on a pedestal (I'm pretty much over this I think) and I'm also just not great at meeting new people in general, be they men or women. Until recently I've not had many friends, but my friends that I do have are very good friends.

Recently, however, I've been making an effort to get out a lot more, socialize, and just generally improve myself. I'm exercising more, I picked up meditation, I stopped watching porn, I'm reading more, I've joined some clubs at university and have made some new friends through that.

One of those friends in particular has become a very good friend, and it's only been a couple months. That's pretty fast for me to become ""close"" friends with someone. We see eachother weekly at the university club where we met (among other friends we've made there) and she's also started joining me at the yoga classes I picked up recently. We also message eachother quite often.

I wasn't really attracted to her at first, be that physically or just as a person. It's not that she isn't pretty but she just wasn't really my type physically (but now I feel quite attracted to her physically) and since we've become better friends I really like her as a person too. So it's not like I became friends with her with the intention of turning it into more.

The problem is that I don't really know if I'm actually attracted to her, or if I'm just latching onto the idea of being together because she's my first real female friend. I'd hate to ruin our friendship by trying to turn it into more, only to find out that she wasn't into me (or that I wasn't really into her...) I really value her friendship both because she's a good friend and (perhaps a more selfish/superficial reason) because she's my first and only close woman friend.

I kind of think she might be into me though? The problem here is that I'm totally useless and inexperienced and have no idea what to look for. But we get on really well and text eachother relatively often. She was hosting a small party the other night to which myself and a few other friends were invited. She doesn't host often and was really anxious about it and so was messaging me beforehand. (I think I helped her feel a lot better about it.) It made me super happy that she felt comfortable enough with me to open up about her anxiety like that. The only other people in my life who have opened up to me like that (or vice versa) are my brother, my mum and my best friend of 15 years.

Shit I have no idea what to do or what my feelings are. For the first few weeks of our friendship I wasn't attracted to her and I was super happy that I wasn't attracted to her because it meant we could *just be friends*. Now I can't tell if I've grown feelings for her or if I'm just lonely and ""attracted to her attention"" in a sense. I've never had a relationship before, so I think that might be a factor. I sort-of-but-not-really dated a friend of a friend a few years back, but it was very awkward and didn't last very long and I doubt either of us would actually consider it ""dating"" in hindsight. Other than that I've had one Tinder date where we both agreed that it wasn't really going anywhere. I've since decided that I really really don't like online dating. That's the full extent of my love life.

If anybody has any advice or has been through similar experiences (I'm sure stories like this are a dime a dozen) then I'd love to hear from you.

209,"So long story short I was with this girl for about 3 years and by the end of the relationship she started becoming extremely emotionally and physically abusive and had admitted to cheating on me multiple times so I wasn’t putting up with her bullshit any more and broke up with her. She still lives with me as her parents were abusive to her and I don’t really want to send her back to that.

Recently I’ve found a girl I really like and I started a relationship with her and not even a single day into the relationship my ex had started giving her shit and abuse online which just angered me even more.

The biggest issue is yesterday she showed me 2 pregnancy tests in person both positive... Just for reference we are 18 and I’m still at college. The last time we had sex was around August however she has shown no symptoms.

Previously doctors had said she was barren and she has had unprotected sex with many men and not once has gotten pregnant. So is there any reason it would be possible now?

I cannot stand this girl and would do anything to not be with her but she is wanting to keep the baby and using it as blackmail so I can’t just remove her from my life. Due to this my new girlfriend has broken up with me which I am destroyed by and my ex is currently staying at her new boyfriends hotel.

210,"So I've known this guy for months and overall he is a nice guy. Unfortunately he can be desperate to get girls and he did say he wanted to get with me too. I explained to him how I do not see him that way and he accepted it.

He started chasing some other girls who ended up rejecting him and he is back to me saying flirty things, like calling me a goddess or asking to see new pictures of me and such. Now, I just ignore those comments and I do not wish to be mean. So I tell him about guys I like and he is always negative.

Like I was getting close to a guy and I told him since he is my friend and first thing to say was that he was def evil, etc. At first I thought it was merely care but it seems it is not.

Recent example is of this one guy I currently like, I know very little of him but I feel attracted. My friend again is negative, said he is def a bad person too and tried to compare himself to him.

211,"Note: GF wrote this on a notepad and I'm posting it on my account. All replies will be read by both of us.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bf (27m) and I (29f) rent out rooms in our house and 2 months ago, we took a chance and had Amber stay at the house with her dog (despite the landlord not being terribly keen on having dogs in the house). We had a dog of our own and know how difficult it is to find places in our area, so I told her she could stay on the condition that her dog socialize with ours and not be in a room/cage all day. We even waived the pet deposit to try to work with her. She had no problem with that but warned me that her dog was shy/minorly aggressive so would take some time to acclimate and made a few suggestions as to how we could do that (ie, setting treats out, meeting her outside in the open, etc). No problem, both bf and I are dog people.

&amp;#x200B;

She was here for a few weeks and we still hadn't seen her dog. She would be gone for 24 hours or longer at least once a week, maybe more on the weekend, and walk her doggo for 5-7 minutes max, once before leaving and once when she got back. When she was gone, her dog would howl/whimper/whine/sniff the door and be alone in the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to invade her space, but after three weeks, Amber and I talked and I told her that I was uncomfortable having her dog cooped up in the room, especially while our dog had free roam and would occasionally sniff at her dog through the bottom of the door. It took about a week, but we all finally had a good system. Bf and I would take her dog when I got back from work and Amber was out and walk/play/feed her. We would have her for maybe a good 6 hours then put her back in Amber's room when I was going to sleep or when Amber came back to the house.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a couple personality clashes between our dog and hers, but nothing close to dangerous or worrisome. We've definitely seen a bond grow between her and my bf (she sees him as the alpha and basically begs for his attention). I was hesitant at first with how close the dog was getting to us, but that's where we're at.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a few days ago, Amber told me she had been looking for a place for at least a month and just put a deposit on an apartment with her cousins. There was an argument she had with someone else in the house and felt uncomfortable staying. She said she was moving out within the next week and would pay for half her rent (kinda making it seem like she was doing me a favor by paying for that extra time). This completely blindsided me as 1) she violated the agreement that she signed prior to moving in which stated she needed to give 30 days notice, 2) she had been looking for rooms without saying something, and 3) the reason why she was leaving was TOTALLY fixable. I'll leave out the details about her leaving as I want advice/input about her dog. Suffice it to say she was 100% wrong in how she handled moving out and gave bf and me very little time to react. Of course, I'm not going to force someone to stay, but I did expect some courtesy from her, especially given how much we worked with her and her situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very pissed off, but held her to her part of the agreement, given the facts of the situation and how avoidable the whole thing is. I think things are still amicable between us, but I am worried about her dog (my bf is 10x more upset). I told Amber that I didn't want to end things on a bad note, as I genuinely liked having her as a housemate (no drama, paid on time, easy to communicate with) and we were especially sad to see her dog go. I offered our place as a place where she could have us watch her dog short term or long term, and to let us know if there was anything we could do to help her out. She said that her cousins got along well with her dog and would help her. She said the reason why she wasn't at the house was because of how uncomfortable she felt with the person she had a falling out with. I don't really buy it because it shouldnt matter if you are uncomfortable--you don't leave your dog for 36+ hours in a room without food, water, even a pee pad. She also is the type of person to tell people what they want to hear in order to avoid a problem. Very passive aggressive. My bf is adament about wanting to keep the dog to the point of forcing the dog to stay. Extreme, but he feels very strongly that Amber would just as soon put her dog in a shelter if she can't manage her as to leave her with strangers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite knowing I can work with two dogs and a huge life change coming in a couple months, I don't know how to approach this with Amber. I know bf will always wonder how the dog is, blame me in the back of his mind for anything that might happen to her for not being more aggressive, and regret not forcing the dog to stay. As for myself, I feel like since I'm the one trying to reconcile the situation and deal with the stresses I had previous to this, I am just repressing the emotional side and will be tremendously sad when she goes, especially since my initial worries about transitioning with everything had been lessened considerably.

&amp;#x200B;

Logically, I know I can't operate off of hypotheticals and it's not like a custody battle where the stronger argument wins. I'm just struggling with knowing what I can do to make this situation better. Whereas my bf would probably like to explore the possibility of just keeping the dog.",03Nov2018,1
212,"Buckle up folks, this is a long post. But I very much thankful in advance anyone who read it all and gave advice ;)

So it all started over a year ago. I met this girl, who we will call ""Rose"". She was actually the prettiest girl I'd ever met. Now, I have never been in a relationship before. I'd never had an intimate moment in my life even. And before I met her... I never really cared. I swear to god it was love at first sight. I'd had a lot of crushes in the past, but never bothered following up on any of them (or was too nervous). I could NOT let this one get away though. I knew she'd never notice me though.

....through some MIRACLE, we actually became friends. Two months of torture went by as I tried to analyze her every move and every word to see if she liked me back. Everything she did, I tried to use as evidence for either her liking me back, or her thinking of me only as a friend. I was wrapped round her little finger. I did everything she wanted when she wanted. I was totally under her spell.

This went on for two months, and I never had the guts to tell her how I felt. I didn't need to in the end though. A HORRIFIC night out (for so many reasons) let me know that she only thought of me as a friend. Of course. That's how it's always been.

And then I met this guy, who we'll call ""Joe"". I happen to be bisexual. He was extremely muscular and had a very nice face, as well as a very nice personality. I was into him the first time we met. Not on the same level as I had been into Rose, but still into him nonetheless. But here's the thing. He was a strict Christian, homophobic, and was avoiding all kinds of intimacy. So naturally I never even tried to make a move.

Many months later, word reached him that I was into him, and he was utterly repulsed. I know, this is a normal reaction to people finding out I'm into them &gt;.&lt;

And now we reach two months ago. Rose (who had a boyfriend at the time) kept telling me about how much she suddenly fancied Joe. Even though the two of them are completely incompatible. Rose is an angry atheist. Rose smokes like a chimney and does drugs. Joe is a strict Christian, against all drugs, hates smoke, and is not only saving himself till marriage, but avoiding relationships altogether. I knew it would never work.

......folks..... Somehow they got together. Almost a month ago.

Bearing in mind, I've still never had an intimate moment in my life, and this fact is starting to wear thin on me, since I'm a college graduate so I'm not exactly a teenager anymore.

See, the thing is, I used to have a crush on both of them. They both know this. They both know that in Joe's case, aside from his personality, I was particularly attracted to his muscles.

Whenever I've seen them in the last month, they have been CONSTANTLY feeling each other up. CONSTANTLY. Constantly making out. And the killer is that Rose keeps almost making a point to feel up Joe's muscles. Right in front of me. Non-stop. Making out. Feeling each other.

I strongly hate all forms of PDA, but this is just intolerable. Given that I used to fancy the both of them and they both rejected me hardcore. They also both know I strongly hate PDA, yet they continue to do it constantly right in front of me.

I let them know that their constant feeling up and kissing was bothering me. I told them to at least please not do it in my bedroom on my bed. We had a social gathering in my bedroom. They sat on the bed. Constantly feeling each other up. They couldn't keep their hands off each other for more than a second. And Rose was constantly gravitating towards Joe's muscles.

It just REALLY feels like they're trying to rub it in my face. Especially given how Rose keeps feeling Joe's muscles. And of course (especially Rose) is very transparent about what she does with Joe. So I have to constantly hear that shit when I'm around them &gt;.&lt;

Eventually, I let them know how I felt, and I got a big speech from Rose about how ""they don't even consider me when they're doing it because I'm not at all important in their relationship, and that therefore I should butt out and not interfere and that they will do what they want"".

Some friends. Not even CONSIDERING how I felt, just immediately blowing me off because they're THAT attached to each other.

In the last week or two, I've not wanted to see them at all. I've not talked to either of them for almost a week. I just don't want to see them anymore. I feel as though they are out to make me jealous. Even my mother is advising me to steer clear of them.

I don't know what to do. Do I cut them off? If I cut them off I cut off at least five other friends.

Thing is, I know that this is probably all in my head. The likelihood is they aren't trying to make me jealous....... at least... on a conscious level. They could be subconsciously doing it.... but whatever it is, to me, it feels very real. The feeling that they are trying to rub it in and make me jealous just feels FAR too real. Enough to make me want to not even talk to them anymore.

If you read all of this, give yourself a pat on the back. And please tell me what is going on and what I should do. Am I just a sad jealous sack who is mad that he got rejected by both of them and just seeing things that aren't there? Do you think they could be subconsciously (or consciously) trying to make me jealous for whatever reason? Should I keep trying to hang out with them even though hanging out with them is painful? Why do I feel so strongly that they're trying to make me jealous??

214,"I don't really wanna go into too much detail because there's a lot of really personal shit involved that I'd rather cut out. 

In short my parents got into a fight and my dad ended up confessing that he's still mad at my mom because of the abortion. Turns out my mom got an abortion behind my dads back in college and my twin died from it. 

I feel like shit. I can't believe my sibling is dead and I can't believe my mom is the reason why. I can't look at her the same way anymore. I feel disgusted whenever I'm in the same room with her. 

It's been two weeks and I still can't forgive her for it. I've always thought having a twin would be cool and that opportunity got robbed from me.

My mom keeps apologiesing and trying to tell me that she loves me but it all seems so fake. 

I honestly don't know what do to. What should I do? Should I forgive her, because I don't thing I can? Should I cut my ties with her instead?

215,"So with the holiday season beginning to approach my family is starting to plan holiday movements which involves me flying back to my home town for Christmas during university vacation. 

Only issue, the thought of going home and putting my mental health on the line just isn’t flying with me this year. Going home involves being worked to the bone around the house and town as my parents are constantly “renovating” and my mother owns her own business (and I tend to be employed as free labour). 

The other issue is that my family likes to pick on me for being different. I no longer really enjoy sports like I used to and I follow a different diet to them and I end up being the butt of most of their jokes or the bad guy in every family debate. In general it just becomes a big pick on me fest. (And yes I know this sounds like a big whine but I’m pretty sure I’m not the only person that feels this way about their family). 

So for the above reasons I want to put my own mental health first and stay away from family holidays and spend some quality time with my cat. But how do you tell that to your mother who  will guilt trip you into feeling terrible about not wanting to see your family? ",03Nov2018,1
217,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bit in a messy situation right now and really don't know what to do. I'll try to keep it short.

I'm a first year university student and I got a new job last month at a local supermarket that just opened (the same day as I started). The thing is, the job is taking a big toll on me. According to my contract, I work a maximum of 12 hours a week, but since I started I had to work more than that, this week even 21 hours! I contacted my supervisor about it and he assured me it will be less in the near future, but next week I have to work 18.5 hours! What's more is that I had to work last Saturday, this Saturday, and next Saturday for 10 hours a day! I just called in sick today because I really couldn't do it because I have my first exams next week and school is super important for me. I can quit without any legal issues, because of a 'trial period' of 2 months. You are probably thinking, why not just quit right here right now? Well, I kind of want to but I could use the money and more importantly, the supermarket just opened and they are still looking for people and it isn't very nice to quit after a month of the opening.

Recently, we've been speaking a bit more, not a lot but more than we would. 

I saw her on Monday as she offered to come in help me out at work (I work in my student office at uni) and we spoke for a bit. We walked and then as we parted, I optimistically suggested we should hangout in Friday. To which she said yeah, sure.

Truly, I thought she would forget and not bother. Then two days later, she messaged me on Instagram and asked if I was still up for hanging out. 

I was surprised but was up for it.

So we met at the uni bar, played some pool and had a drink, we were there for a while about four hours. 

I know she's single and I do like her, I just don't know how she feels. 

After, I messaged saying it was good to see her and I enjoy myself, and she said she had fun hanging out too. I then messaged her back saying maybe we should do it again. 

Now I'll just wait, play the waiting game and see what she says.

I'm just not sure how she sees things or feels about things. 

Am I being ultimate friendzoned or is she interested but just shy?

224,"Hi r/advice, not sure if this is the right sub for this.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr when my partner and I sleep in the bedroom with the room closed, I always end up feeling stuffy in the mornings, and a table fan doesn't seem to help.**

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, my partner's mother (MIL for simplicity's sake) bought this flat for her sons, but one of them moved out and I ended up having to move in a month ago (on a lease). We are on very good terms so MIL is probably going to be open to any reasonable changes if we had to make them.

&amp;#x200B;

It was fine to just keep the window open when it was warmer, but it's getting town to 6° (42F) at night and we end up freezing in the morning if we keep it open. Humidity is not the problem - if anything, the air is quite dry since we're 3 stories up.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a chronic illness (probably CFS or fibromyalgia, it's as of now undiagnosed) which gives me chronic fatigue and brain fog, so feeling out of it when I wake up means it takes an hour or two to get out of bed, and can disrupt my sleep and eating patterns, and all of this makes my condition worse. My partner is my carer to it's also very relevant to him. It's pretty important that we do something about this.

&amp;#x200B;

We have tried turning the radiator down and putting a table fan in the room that blows air away over our heads and out the door, but this hasn't helped much and the noise makes it harder for my partner to get to sleep. The radiator is in front of the window so if we put the fan there it would blow warm air over us, and it would block my path out of bed.

This is the UK, so we don't have air conditioning. We do not have £1k+ to spend on installing one.

225,"For 2.5 years, I had an entry level job at a successful local tech company, but 3 months ago I received a “promotional” role within the same company (thanks to a coworker on my new team vouching for me, but more on her later). Now I’m in a coordinator (customer facing) role within HR. I like the actual work/productivity aspects of my job. I enjoy helping others, and I can see this turning into a career for me... but otherwise I’m unhappy and I come home feeling absolutely drained most days because of the interpersonal aspects of the job.. The (the people/the team culture/their treatment of others) goes against my values which is something that’s hard for me to tolerate. I’m a fairly sensitive person, and it wears on me. 

Basically, almost everyone is back stabbing and catty. For some reason, something about the team fosters this type of behavior and people are constantly reporting interpersonal issues to the managers/HR leaders (to sabotage) and talking behind each each others’ backs. It’s a lot of covert bullying and undercutting. Before I joined the team, I knew they had problems, but the extent has been eye opening. And I liked this company in general before, but my feelings are starting to change and I feel like I’m changing too in some ways (since it’s kind of “survival of the fittest”). 

The coworker that vouched for me is a good person, and I can see that about her deep down, but she joins in on the gossip as well and can turn on people quickly. She’s also my lead and is basically in charge of my professional development since my main boss is remote. She invites me to drink wine with a “core group” but the entire thing is mainly just talking shit about other people. I know that’s normal in workplaces, but the way it’s done feels especially malicious. Tonight, they were talking about this guy who joined them on their last “Wine Friday” (I missed this one, thankfully). They were saying how awkward he was and making fun of him. To me, it just sounded like he was new and trying to fit in. Part of me wonders if they also talk about me like that when I’m not there, since they so readily discuss anybody outside their little group and I don’t really feel “in” with them yet. And I don’t really want to be “in” with them, but I also don’t want to become fodder for gossip (and have it hinder my professional growth). The environment is honestly reminiscent of high school, which is a tough pill to swallow because I hated everything about that time in my life. Not because I was bullied, but because I don’t like seeing others get bullied. Then, this behavior was more understandable because teenagers’ brains aren’t yet developed, but now I’m surrounded by adults acting like this. Some in their 40’s and 50’s. 

The worst part is, once in a while I contribute my own catty comments. I hear myself doing it, and I hate myself for doing it, but it kind of feels like that’s what you have to do. There’s a vibe where you’re either with them or against them. I don’t know if they realize they’re giving off that vibe, but because of how they talk about other people that’s what it feels like. And some of them are higher up and impact my professional development, so I’m just trying to appeal to them I guess. But I hate that I feel like I have to do that. Also, they kind of pressure each other into drinking more, and all of the Wine Fridays end with people very drunk and stumbling. It’s basically a shitshow. Whenever I try to say no to Wine Friday, my lead (the one who vouched for me) insists I go and she’s very persistent about it. 

Beyond the whole Wine Friday issue, it’s just a general toxic culture. People are just constantly talking behind each other’s backs (even people outside the Wine Friday group but still on the team.) I’ve had trouble sleeping at night, because I’m up thinking about the fact that I’m surrounded by fake people and anything I say can and will be held against me. I’m very analytical about people, and this whole thing has made that aspect of my personality go haywire. I’m always trying to figure out if someone is out to get me (which is, I think, reasonable given the environment I work in). 

I’m doing great at my job from a mere work standpoint. I’ve considered looking for another one. But I’ve only been there 3 months (and my other experience is very entry level, whereas this is more of a career job) so I don’t think I’d get any calls. Also, I think it looks bad to leave a job after 3 months, but idk.

Anyways, I go back to my original questions:
-Am I being sensitive and is this normal workplace drama? Is this how it is everywhere?

-If this seems abnormal and toxic, what should I do to separate myself from the situation?


Thank you for any advice!

TLDR; I moved up from an entry level job into a “career” job 3 months ago, but the environment is very catty and backstab-y. People are constantly talking behind each other’s backs and anonymously reporting complaints to HR about each other. This has caused me to be very worried about my own reputation, and I can’t sleep at night. My lead (who vouched for me to get the job) also gossips which makes me worried she could turn on me (she turns on people easily). I go to Wine Fridays so I can “bond” with the team (I also feel pressured to go by my lead), but the entire time is mostly spent talking shit about other people. I wonder if they talk about me when I leave. I want to look for a new job, but I only have 3 months experience (though I’m doing well work wise so far). What should I do?

Im not sure about where to post this but hopefully you guys can help:

I’m 23 year old female who have just started enjoying the experience of having sex with someone who knows what they’re doing. However when he penetrate/thrust deep inside me it hurts causing me to have really bad cramps afterwards. Growing up I never was as sexual activity as I am now so I didn’t think much about about the fact I couldn’t “handle” doggy style, because the guy would penetrate too deep inside. Now all I want to do is have sex but I’m constantly worry that I’ll be in horrible pain afterwards.  I went to see the doctor but was told that lack of lubricant was the problem so he and I made sure I was wet  before having sex but I still experience the pain after sex so I went back. This time I got tested for diseases and results came back negative. Then a vagina ultrasound and a pelvis exam was done and they also came back negative. I have had to stop sex in the middle due to me being in pain and though he’s understanding I feel really bad for him. I even tried taking charge by being the one on top and riding him but the moment his dick goes too deep inside me it’s over because I’ll start feeling sharp pain. I’m wondering if anyone has ever been though this before and how can I make sex more pleasurable for me and him? ",03Nov2018,1
228,"So a few facts you should know about me is that I have always wanted to further my studies in a Japanese University since I was 13. I went on a holiday to Osaka and fell in love with the place and this kick-started my desire to study in Japan.

I have been studying Japanese for the past 6 years of my life for 1. To achieve my dream and 2. Because I genuinely like the language. I'm about to finish my A-Levels soon and was recently offered a scholarship by one of the prep schools in Japan (they're needed to enter uni).

So the scholarship basically covers my accommodation + living expenses but the tuition fees plus other stuff (like insurance + application etc) will have to be footed by my parents. Now this is an amazing offer and would have gladly jumped on it! But the problem is my University fees are not covered and either my parents have to cover for it or I have to get a scholarship.

So my parents said to me: Secure a scholarship or not you'll return home and continue your studies here. I don't want to do this because 1. My dream and 2. 30k (which is the cost of everything) will just go down the drain like that so I'm gonna make sure I try my hardest to get a scholarship.

Problem is EJU (the exam to enter Japanese uni) is extremely difficult to score in. I'm an above average student who sometimes get excellent grades depending on my luck so I'm worried that I won't be able to score high enough to secure a scholarship.

So now I'm not sure whether I should go for it or just complete my studies here in my home country then save up money to go holiday in Japan/attend the 1 year Japanese course just to be fluent in the language. ",03Nov2018,1
229,"Well my boyfriend recently came out to me and said he wants to be trans, and with me being gay, having no interest in women this poses a huge problem for the relationship.... I am supportive of his choice I just don't know if I should try and convince him not to go through with it or if I should push him towards his goal, Im always there for him in whatever he needs but we are quite young and to my understanding this os a 1 time decision there's no going back...

I have 2 major concerns about this and many smaller so if you read through all of what I will type in an effort to help me then you have my gratitude!

Well my first major concern lies with how long he's admitting to feeling he wants to change, he said he's been contemplating it for 2 years, on and off talking and a little research here and there, but I feel he's not thought long enough and hard enough for this life changing decision, on top of that, I fear he hasn't looked at the bad side of the change, as in what can go wrong how a huge majority mistreat trans people... That's where my second major concern comes in, he is not very mentally strong, he is very easily upset and anger etc. (we believe he suffers with a hyper sensitive personality disorder, though he needs to seek a professional to know for sure) and I seriously fear that of something went wrong through the procedure, or the negative backlash from people would possibly drive him to suicide hotlines and maybe even to suicide...

Other concerns I have include people mistreating him where I cannot help if he goes through, because if he does then our relationship will end, and like that I cannot help him in private situations...

I also worry that I heard trans people are more susceptible to STD's something that may play heavy on him...

Another concern I have is money... I am not aware of how much a full transition costs, but I would assume it is certainly not on the cheap side of things...

I figured I will not leave him for this because again that would both be a horrible thing for me to do and I would worry for his mental health with everything else going on...

Moving in to London, I've had little use for a Motorcycle (Underground is good enough and cheap enough and bikes are a bit stressful in London). As a result, I'm going to be selling it next month. I do plan to get another one in the future, but for now it's an unecessary expense that could go into savings (insurance renews next month).

I'm 23(f) mine and my husbands marriage was struggling for a bit some of it my fault and some his. 3 months ago I caught him in an affair with his best friend of 12 years, let's call her kara, things went horrible. I begged him to talk to me about it and us but he didn't want to, I begged him for us to work on our marriage and us, he didn't know If he wanted that. 

Then one day he said he was willing to work on our marriage, i told him i would love that under one condition; that he cut kara out of his life because I wouldn't ever be able to trust them with each other again. He then changed his mind and said didn't want to be with me and that he regrets marrying me that him cutting kara out of his life wasn't an option.

This broke my heart even more because to me this was him saying kara was more important to him than me, our marriage, and remaining a family (we have 3 children).  After that he and i started working towards separation, me getting a car, him getting his own place. I cried every night for 2 months just to wake up crying in the middle of the night from dreaming of the events, i lost 20 pounds in 1 month. I've been trying to be civil towards him but it's hard.

He just got his own place, a house, after years of him telling me we couldn't afford a house. Yesterday he came by to get some of his things, I asked him if he could buy diapers and it turned into an argument, he bought the diapers, I broke down crying as he was getting his things together. We talked and once again o felt like he was putting all of the blame on me, him cheating was my fault, him getting angry was my fault, us separating was my fault, there was more to the conversation but he kept turning everything around and somehow blaming me for everything. I was sitting on the floor crying and he came over and held me, we just sat like that for a bit, but then somehow we ended up having sex and telling each other we loved each other. He finished grabbing some of his things after and left, I cooked dinner and then got the kids and myself to bed and now here I am.

239,"A bit of information.

There's this girl in my class who is just... Better than me at everything.

We are very similar people and have very similar interests, to the point where even though we tried being friends it mostly felt like talking to a mirror for both of us, this doesn't mean we're not friends or that we hate each other, it just means we don't talk to each other a lot.

But... The key difference here, and probably the only difference, is that she's just better than me at everything and I'm honestly envious.

I know I shouldn't hate the person, in fact, I do not, but I simply feel constantly inferior when she's around.

She's funnier, smarter, more sociable and charismatic than me for example, and academically (although she's not perfect, she still has her flaws) she simply outclasses me in everything I'm good at and has the same problems I have but simply not as much. (I should probably clarify I'm NOT referring to the American school system, that thing is still a mess to me)

She's also better than me at every activity we have in common, she's a better writer, problem solver, draws better than me, is better than me at sports and chess and problems that to me seem REALLY hard to her are simple pushovers that don't require much effort.

Now, some of these I understand, I get that she's better at chess and sports because she practices more, I also get that chess is not a good indicator of intelligence, Look at Bobby Fischer for a prime example.

I have no fucking clue how she draws so well because she never practices and she never made it one of her hobbies, it just seems a bloody gift from divinity that somehow made its way into her DNA, but I can't get mad at that, it's not like it's her fault or whatever, that would be dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall... I'm just at a loss here. Usually when this stuff happens the arguments are always ""Oh well you can't be good at everything/There's always someone better than you"" and ""You too have your strong sides, he/she's just better than you in this one thing"".

So I put the effort in and was the top student in my class. I got into a top university in my country and proceeded to do extremely well in my first undergraduate year. I was, however, overwhelmed by the third semester at uni, and my grades fell. I felt exhausted.

From the fourth semester on, I gave up on trying my best. I was missing a lot of classes, with the excuse of studying at home, which I didn't. My grades were mediocre. That continued until my Master's, when I got diagnosed with depression. I started seeing a psychologist and we inferred that the death of my dad when I was 1 year old caused me to be overprotected by my mom.

I think isolating myself at home doing nothing and seeing my mom unable to expel me from the house proved to me, subconsciously, that my actions don't really matter.

They think they cant live without us(they have their own social issues. I wont discuss it here) we are living in a small house. One washroom using 5 people. And we can afford to live somewhere nice. I dont like my inlaws. And i dont want my baby to grow in this house. We had tried several times to move out but couldnt because of many reasons. Main was non supporting in laws. I have thought about it alot. The only way for me to move out peacefully is to apply for a new job in some far away place. But I really like this job. And i feel like I am settled in. What should I do? I dont want to stay in this town because I know their dramas wont end. I am very flexible and I have been very very patient with them for that much period of time. But I dont want my child to live in this situation. My father in law is very abusive also. My husband doesnt feel that much confident in moving out because he is not working and I am the only one who is working. Please advise? Is it easy to find a new job when you are pregnant. And I also wish  to work in bigger companies like Microsoft, google etc. Because I care about my career too.

Most of the time it is quick flashes of a bright-ish looking like, always out of sync as well. Sometimes it's a light that looks like its panning or moving from either the left or right side of the roof.

247,"Happy Saturday, r/Advice!

So, I've got a pretty basic one for you all. A few weeks ago I moved to an apartment in NYC (from another one, also in NYC). Everything's been great so far, buuuuttttt I've noticed since moving in that the neighbors above me don't have rugs. And because it's an old building, I can hear EVERY footstep, occasionally conversation, and, worst of all, can hear loud sex above me at night every so often.

My friend who lives in the same building says she doesn't really hear much noise above her, and I think it's because her above neighbors have carpeting.

So here's my dilemma. I want the neighbors above me to get rugs. I want them to so badly, that I'm willing, at least in part, to fund it myself. I'm not sure if there's a clause on the lease that says you mandatorily have to get rugs (some NYC apts require this), but either way, I doubt management will enforce it.

How do I go about getting my neighbor to get rugs for their place?

Thanks in advance.

tl;dr: My apartment neighbors above me don't have rugs and I can hear their every footstep, conversation and loud sex. I want them to get rugs, and I'm willing even to fund it myself (at least in part). How would I go about it?",03Nov2018,1
248,"Started University 2 months ago and quickly made friends with a group of seven. One of these people I hang out the most with, but I have developed feelings for her. She does not know, but she's given enough indications that she does not feel the same. I should be convinced of this fact, but because it's not been explicitly said my mind won't move on because of what ifs. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my closest friend in a new city where I knew no one before, so I hope you understand why I am so conflicted. I have anxiety problems as well when it comes to infatuations and as such I've suffered a lot of stress because of these feelings. I'm ashamed to admit that the strongest anxiety trigger is jealousy. That caused me to leave before a party last weekend. They say that anxiety becomes a disorder when it gets in the way of your life. Well after this happened I contacted a therapist and will have my first meeting on Thursday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday when she, I and a friend of ours hung out she asked if there was anyone that we had our eye on yet. I said not almost instinctively which felt so wrong, a straight up lie. But I couldn't say yes there either.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how to deal with her, I really want to be her friend but this elephant in the room makes it impossible for me to move on. I feel a need to tell her but at the same time I don't want to dump my feelings on her. I could try not telling her and try distance myself from her to move on faster but if a friend of mine distanced themselves from me without explanation I'd be really upset. It feels like there's no right answer here.",03Nov2018,1
250,I'm 21 I haven't finished high school nor have I had a job. Recently my parents have decided they no longer wish to support me due to us not being able to get along. Admittedly I have been lazy about finishing my education but until recently my parents understood the circumstances of why and were willing to be patient so long as I still made an active enough attempt for their standards(8 hours of studying what I would be for my last grade level and the occasional test they would give me to ensure I'm actually doing the work.) This went fine until last night and now I have a semi-unknown time to move out. Is there any way I can salvage a way to live? I don't plan on mooching off someone I didn't think I was with them... ok well I was but I truly have been attempting to further my education comparing myself with my friends who did finish high school and my parents own knowledge I am at the least on a 12th grade level.

254,"Throwaway here, for obvious reasons.

Anyways, a bit of background:I'm male, 27. I used to live with my family while I studied, and on my own since I was 24, but an economic crisis hit my country pretty hard and my business tanked (It seems nobody wants to do a sightseeing flight if they can't afford to pay their bills, go figure), so I had to move back in with my dad.  (My mom lives with my grampa).

Dad says since I've come back (about a year ago now) there's a ""bitter"" smell in the home. He says it's especially noticeable in my bedroom and when one comes in from outside the home, and sometimes but not always noticeable on me. My mom and brother concur. However my girlfriend says I don't smell and that my house doesn't smell weird.

I personally don't notice it (which drives me nuts both because I may be stinky when meeting with a customer and don't notice it, and because it makes it hard to find the culprit)

Here's the things I've tried:

1. I shower daily; with soap! Kinda ovbious but had to be mentioned.
2. I figured that I spend most of my bedroom time in the actual bed, so:

* I take my matress out into the sun for a day every week, one side into the sun all morning and the other side in the afternoon until sunset. I flip my matress around so that I sleep on a different side every week.
* I change bedsheets and pillowcases weekly, and spray some bedsheets deodorant thingy that a friend recommended.
* I washed one of my pillows and threw away the other one (Not related to smell, I was thinking of getting rid of it because of neck posture when sleeping, 2 pillows was too tall).
* I stopped using my bed to read. I now use my bed only to sleep.

3. I washed the curtains
4. I used to store dirty laundry in a box in my bedroom. I now store dirty laundry in the same box but outside the house (we have a separate shed for the washing machine and all the cleaning related stuff)
5. I had a small carpet (like a doormat) so as to not step on the cold floor when getting out of bed. I got rid of it, and the floor of my bedroom is now ceramic tiles only.
6. Whenever the weather permits, I open all windows to get a nice cross breeze, and also sleep with the windows open.

My dad says he's beffudled. He's not mad at me because he knows all the things I did to try and get rid of the smell. He says it's somewhat less but definitely still present, and still noxious, some days more than others.

Any, any idea or tip would be appreciated. This is driving me mad, especially because I don't notice it and I may be scaring off customers.",03Nov2018,1

260,"Hi, I just want to warn you, this might become a rather long text. 
Let me just start out by stating that I am living in Europe. So everything that follows won’t really comparable to the HS-college-grad-school-timeline that is the standard in the US.

I finished what would be the equivalent to highschool last spring, worked as a garbage collector for a year to pay for the first years of my education and to my surprise got accepted into one of Europe’s most prestigious universities for veterinary medicine. I wanted to be a veterinarian since I was a kid and worked as an intern in a animal clinic a couple of times and enjoyed it. 
Now I am seriously considering switching my major. There are multiple reasons for that, I’ll try to keep it brief:
a. The job market looks terrible and pay isn’t good.
b. You are guaranteed to have to work shitty hours (responding to emergencies in the middle of the night).
c. You spend more time euthanizing animals than actually helping them (treatment for farm animals isn’t economical for the farmer and most people around where I live can’t afford any treatment for their animal).
d. You have to deal with annoying people every day. 
e. It takes about 10 years from now to get paid enough to be independent from my parents/working a second job. It’ll take about 15 years until I realistically can think about opening my own practice. 

All those points were somewhat known to me beforehand. I thought I could deal with that but getting to talk to veterinarians more often showed me how fucked up the situation really is. 
Obviously I still like animals but I think I might be content with owning a dog. Lately, I just couldn’t imagine myself working as a vet. 

If I decide to take a different path I figured out a couple of decent alternatives: 
1. I could become an electrician. I am pretty handy and like seeing what I did at the end of the day. I don’t mind hard work, the pay is decent and limited to the usual work hours. I can finish my education for that in 2 years and be able to start my own business in about 5 years. Also, I can work pretty much everywhere in the world because my country has a pretty solid reputation. If I wanted to, I could go back to university later on and get an engineering degree. The biggest problem with that option is that my family expects me to work in a job requiring a higher level of qualification. I don’t really mind that, though. 
2. Change majors to agriculture sciences. A solid option. I can transfer credits I got for some courses. Pay and hours seem okay. Pretty big chance of ending up in a shitty office job. 
3. I have considered something becoming a journalist or editor as well. My writing was always been really good and that could be a career I am passionate about. But I am not really sure whether there is a future in that line of work and pay won’t be great either.

I am really on the fence about this and would really appreciate your input.

In this kind of restaurant, we listed the orders in a piece of paper and pay first at the cashier before they provide our meal. When we were still ordering and I didn't think they have finished ordering, the waitress brought 2 iced tea to their side so I thought that they had taken the drinks as theirs. After we had finished ordering and paying for our orders, the waitress then came again to give 2 iced tea to their side but I didn't notice. After that the young woman who sat beside me gave me the iced tea and her boyfriend gave to my friend. I had thought at first that she was giving her drink to me, so I was confused. Then I saw that there was another drink on her side and I thought that the drink she had given me had been the one that the waitress had placed on the table first, and my first thought was 'Has she drunk the tea?'. I am a saliva-conscious person, so I just stared at her confusedly for quite a while and didn't dare to accept the drink. Then she asked me if I ordered it, and I said yes, but I still didn't take the drink which was placed between us. I then turned to look at my friend. Then from the corner of my eye I saw that the young woman was gesturing something like 'what the heck' to her boyfriend and then suddenly she just stood up abruptly like she was angry and went away to I don't know where, her boyfriend following her. After they went away, I asked my friend whether they had drunk the iced tea or not and checked for traces of saliva before taking it. After around 5 minutes they came back to get their drinks I think, then before going away her boyfriend scolded me something along the line of 'can't you even say thank you?!'. Then they just angrily went off to another table near us. I was shocked, then my friend told me that I was weirdly staring at her face and kind of just placed the drink on the table, ignoring her. So I resolved myself and went to their table to say 'sorry just now i was confused why you gave me the drink and I kinda stared at your face weirdly. I'm so sorry if I offended you, it was not done intentionally'. I kept repeating sorry before the boyfriend said 'never mind we already move to another table.' The woman just kept quiet. I just wanted to know if I did the right thing by saying sorry, and if not, what should I have done when that situation happened?

265,"Main problems:
- Bathroom ceiling almost completely molded (bf &amp; I are asthmatics &amp; I get frequent headaches. Not sure if related)
- Dishwasher completely molded 
- Water leaks through the cracks in wall &amp; floods apartment randomly... The water can be a couple inches &amp; of course makes it into other areas of the house, this is my main problem because I’m having to use my own towels to sop the water up (which is never enough to get all the water up) &amp; trying to mask the water mold smell has been impossible... Laundry is too expensive because of this!
- another huge issue: I have two doors &amp; neither the front or back locks properly! Front door cannot lock the top lock &amp; the back door seems like someone tried to kick it in, leaving the lock barely secure.
- none of my faucets run properly:
     Shower: continuously runs &amp; is loud af!!! 
It’s so embarrassing when company comes over &amp; they can’t use the restroom because I’m embarrassed about the mold or they ask who’s in the shower &amp; there’s nobody in there!!
Tiles fell in on the tub wall &amp; sometimes causes a little bit of flooding. The entire faucet part just came off &amp; it’s just a rusty a*s spout ROCKETING water at you... also the shower head rockets water at you like there’s a pressure problem &amp; it’s hard to get the right temperature because it seems to be more hot water than cold... high pressure HOT water! 
     Bathroom sink: barely has any pressure... barely runs
     Kitchen sink: one time black little pieces began coming out in my drinking water 🤦‍♀️ &amp; we told them. It seems like they left the filter off or something &amp; the water pressure is also too high
AC: causes leaking in bathroom from roof, has left my entire bathroom covered in a brown (DISGUSTING) liquid multiple times

My question is: not only will moving to another apartment be a huge inconvenience... I mean I have furniture &amp; other things that we may have to pay to help transfer, but the fact that i have been so inconvenienced by constant flooding, mold, water issues, and more... I feel as though asking for a credit towards our rent would be fair. We don’t want to move out the apartments, because they’re a good deal, in a great location, and just got a great new management, but this doesn’t fix what we’ve been dealing with. My apartment flooded again these past two days through the wall, ruining anything on the floor &amp; I told the office. 

New management (apartments bought by new owner) came in &amp; said they have had to transfer multiple people to different units because of water leaks and flooding. So they would most likely switch us to a new unit.

We were a bit behind on rent due to a knee injury &amp; having to take off work. So we owe $400 next Saturday to be caught up.

266,"I am currently working in a high tech , high pressure r and d company as a software engineer. This is my second company. In both of the companies that I worked for there was a huge  codebase(thousands of lines of code), very complex domain, time pressure etc. I have been spending a lot of my free time in the last three years to improve myself and make myself a good programmer but honestly I am just tired of that. 

I have been working fine for the last three years but recently I realized that I have started hating my life. There is more to my life then worrying if I can implement all the things for the next Sprint demo. I don't want to worry about problems when I am not at work. I don't want to spend my free time reading c++ books and doing hobby projects. I don't want to worry about creating a perfectly generic reusable design( because someone is gonna ruin the design in the future anyways). I  have done that a lot in the last three years and I think I am just burnt out. In simple words I want a job that is not difficult and should be a part of my life and not the only thing in my life.

I want to find a company where 

1. The work is very easy and I don't have to worry about if I can implement something or not. I don't care at all if the work is very boring or repetitive. I don't care if I don't learn anything new. ( I did enough worrying in the past three years) 

2. There is job security so that people are not easily fired.


How do I go about finding these type of companies? I see hundreds and hundreds of companies on LinkedIn and all of them promise more or less the same things. What I have been doing so far is applying for the famous tech companies in my city but I would like to approach this in a better way. I have seen some people say that you should find a job in a big company if you want an easy life but how do I find these big companies? The companies that I worked for recently we're also big r and d companies. Google  and apple are also big companies but I imagine the engineer s there also having a very hard life as well.

I live in the Netherlands. If you give me advice related to finding companies in the Netherlands that would be great but any advice is welcome.

Of course she ended up having dance recital so I just told her to hit me up if she wants to hang out sometime. That next Monday she texted me but it was about a funny Instagram post and not about hanging out. I was a bit disappointed. Then I texted her this Friday a funny video that reminded me of her but she took 6 hours to read it.. but when she replied it was super engaging and she found it very funny. I told her how the video made me think of her and she sent back a :) face and said the song “happier” played in the car today and made her think of me. I then told her I made a video of me singing happier awhile ago but I was too embarrassed to send it to her and she told me to send it next time. I told her sure I would &amp; that was the end of the conversation. She still hasn’t told me if or when she’d like to hang out again even though I’m sure she likes me. I think she’s sort of shit testing me. Like in person when we’re together she only talks to me, butts in when I start talking to other people, she lights up &amp; smiles whenever I put my arm around her or touch her, she’s told me just about everything about her family and friends, and she never stops staring me in my eyes.

So any advice on how to get the ball rolling again.. like should I text her and be like, “I miss you, I’d love to see you next Saturday or Sunday” (I have a super busy week so I can’t do before then)  or should I continue dating other girls and wait for her to ask me out since I was the last one to ask her out, or should I tell her how much I like her and ask if she feels the same way? Or should I try calling her.. I don’t have much experience with talking on the phone &amp; I don’t know if she’d be comfortable with that but I could try. Or maybe there’s something else I should do, if so tell me cause these are the only options that make sense to me right now.

But I haven't asked him why he decided to make a move all of a sudden, since I don't think my reply would be a very good one simply because of that lol even if I'm curious  


Either way, since we see each other so often I've gotten kinda attached, but I always keep asking myself if it's actually attachment or if it's just my bpd that has decided he's my current so-called ""favorite person"". He *always* has time for me whenever I ask if I could come over/if he could come over to my place (usually same the other way around too of course), no matter whether it's a weekend or a weekday.   


Even the other day he just simply got off the bus on his way home from work and took one over to my place despite taking almost an hour with switching from bus to the train top of it when I told him my mom had gotten surgery, and while it was a minor one I was feeling a bit down and unsettled over it since she didn't seem to feel too well post-op and I couldn't do anything. He just spent the night hugging me and telling me that it is all okay and that I shouldn't worry too much (I'm a worry wart by nature, so he knows how I get).  


So far everything feels sort of clear cut, right? There *might* be something there. But what puts me off is that I usually don't hear from him for days unless when we decide to meet up, and he's sometimes really hard to get in touch with. He works from early morning until late (10-12 hours shifts at times), so he spends the last couple of hours until he goes to bed playing games. So I fully understand that chatting with people isn't his top priority when he's exhausted, but it still makes me confused. We talk a lot when we see each other so it's not like we spend our times together in silence either. I know it might been seen as such a minor thing, but since I don't know where we stand I get paranoid, we all know how it feels to be left on ""read"" by someone we care for if they even look at it at all. Every guy I've had any sort of romantic relationship with the last almost 10 years have dumped me for someone else, sometimes even just 1-2 days after they last told me how much they cared for me and one at one point even had a long-time girlfriend I didn't know about while he was seeing me. So I've gone from the pretty relaxed type to jealous and paranoid (I haven't talked to anyone except a couple of close friends about it since I feel it's my own problem to deal with, just like with most of my issues).  


But I'm an adult, I should be able to ask him about this, right? Well, I feel like if I'm possibly going to get hurt anyway I'd rather ride this out till the end and see where things go. And I personally still need to figure out where ***I*** stand considering my disorder. It's not like I'm stressing too much over it except when I'm overthinking and get myself down, which I do with most other things anyway so nothing out of the usual. But since he went out of his way the other day to cheer me up I can't help but ponder on and off.   


I have only talked to two friends about his and mine ""relationship"" so I don't really have anyone to talk to. I guess I am *sort of* waiting for the perfect moment to ask him, but I want to figure out what kind of mindset I should be in first.",03Nov2018,1

274,"So long story short my older brother who is 26 texted me an told me that it makes him sad to see the house the way it is an that it's not meant for him. The house is an old house. My father (66) is a single parent has really let my house go. He doesn't clean regularly an he is just not good at keeping things in good condition. I (19) have been at my house since I as born an ever since my mother died when I was 11 things really went down hill. My brother is a Marine an really likes it a lot. So every time hed come by the house hed do a deep clean of it. Now some of u will say ""well why dont you clean it"" an to that I say well when your constantly cleaning your dads messes u get really tired of it. I just gave up tbh. You'd get tired to of constantly cleaning dishes (no dish washer) an picking up bags everywhere an my dad leaving bits an pieces of food everywhere. I have sort of a resentment for my dad for not stepping up to the plate an getting stuff done an just letting me live in practiacally a pig sty till last year when my boyfriend helped me clean. 

I'm very devastated an I feel like I dont even have a family anymore. I'm bursting in tears over this cause a part of me feels like it's my fault that he feels that way. Im just broken.

280,"Alright, so long story short, me and a friend are currently renting our first apartment. It's on the third (top) floor of the building. We've been here since early September, and from the beginning I've had a young dog living here with us. I'm personally not bothered by apartment noise as long as it's not shaking the walls or anything, and with a baby we can easily hear down the hall and another family with young kids playing downstairs and a pair of party animal college kids next door, we definitely experience occasional sounds, though luckily not usually past 10pm on weekdays... Except for that baby, sometimes. She's pretty fussy in the wee hours but it's easily solved with a bit of white noise. 

So here's where I come in! Just recently (in about the last 10 days), I've been hearing slamming noises from downstairs. I've always heard random occasional noise from downstairs, but now it's seeming like it's banging on the ceiling rather than just random living noise like doors slamming and such. Lo and behold, I received an email today to find that our property management has been receiving pet noise complaints for our apartment and that we needed to fix the issue. They didn't specify anything besides that, such as a time frame.

Now I can totally understand being annoyed by noisy pets. My dog is young and rambunctious, so I make sure that he's settled down (either in his kennel or sleeping in my bed) between 9pm and 9am. He's also in his kennel while I work throughout the weekdays and when I get home I take him out for a walk. He does, however, sit on my bed and chew on his rope toy in the afternoon and sometimes it drops on the floor. Cue banging on the ceiling. Fair enough. Even though it's not during our specified ""quiet hours"" I'm sure it can still be annoying, so I try to curb it as much as possible.

But now I think I might actually be contributing to the problem myself. A week ago I closed my bathroom door at about 11am (definitely not slamming or anything). Cue banging on the ceiling. I was a little surprised but shrugged it off and told myself I'd be more careful going forward. However, a few days after that I stubbed my toe on the corner of my bed and sort of stumbled over it, and noticed more banging from downstairs as I was sort of writhing in pain. This was sometime in the afternoon. Then yesterday, at about 3pm, I was sitting my desk and accidentally bumped it with my knee when I was turning in my swivel chair. Once again, cue banging on the ceiling from downstairs. And now this morning, at about 10am, my dog dropped his rope toy off the side of my bed again. Obviously, cue banging.

I'm sort of afraid to walk around now. I'm really trying to be quiet, but I guess I'm sort of clumsy. I keep thinking that if I move I'm gonna knock something over or kick something or that my dog is gonna try to follow me too loudly. I'm pretty sure my roommate isn't making noise either, since he spends most of his time at home playing video games and not really moving all that much, and his cat is too small to really make any noise unless he knocks something over (which he's only done once since he's been here). 

Any model upstairs neighbors have any advice for me? I'm a pretty shy and non-confrontational person and I used to think I was pretty considerate, but now I'm not so sure. I'm sort of worried that the next noise complaint will result in serious consequences. And of course I want to be fair to my dog and not keep him locked up in his kennel any time I'm not taking him outside. I'm also afraid that random noises I'm making might be falsely attributed to him. It sort of feels like I'm between a rock and a hard place here. Have I just been totally mistaken in my assumptions about what the acceptable amounts of noise in an apartment building are?",03Nov2018,1
281,"My dad is a lifelong Republican and I would consider myself mostly a Democrat. I can't even call him to say hi without him trying to tell me how the Democratic party is ruining the country and how the media is so unfair to Republicans and Trump. Not to mention he's always somehow tying in that minorities are lazy and love to play the victim. 

His obsession with talking about this stuff makes me beyond uncomfortable. I usually end up just saying that I agree with him just to make him stop, which makes me feel shitty but there's no point in trying to get him see my view. 

I've told him that I really hate talking about politics because very rarely do people have a political discussion these days without both sides getting resentful, and no real insight comes from the conversion by the end of it, but he just won't stop. I don't get offended by someone attacking my ideals, I just get so annoyed and uncomfortable that he feels the need to attack rather than just have a normal conversation about something else with his daughter. 

I feel like I have to stop talking to him sometimes because this is all that he'll talk about. I don't want to go no contact with him though over something as stupid as political views but sometimes it feels like he gives me no choice. What should I do? ",03Nov2018,1

1. Dwell in it and punish yourself because you're a shitty human and you fucking deserve to suffer, get sick &amp; die?

3. ~~Make things right - Improve your actions - Fight your impulses.... Would be ideal but it's not possible....~~

My boyfriend and I have always been great together. We are best friends and we respect each other. When we fight or argue, its nothing we cant ever get past. I trusted him... Until recently (last 2 weeks), we have been getting into nonstop arguments because my anxiety is getting the best of me. He has a lot of girl friends he talks to and chats with which I was always okay with but theres this one I just have bad feelings about. He has hung out with her before but one of those times he has hung out with her, he hid it from me which is why I think I am the way I am right now. I found out by going through his phone and seeing messages but he ended up deleting them that same day. I confronted him and he apologized for it and has reassured me whenever I ask that there is nothing happening. Thats simply the problem, I am always anxious and scared that he will cheat on me even though I genuinely believe he wont. I hate feeling like this because he is stressed out with school and work and I am just another stressor in his life, always questioning his actions and I know it hurts him but, I cant help it. What can I do to get over this? I don’t want to talk to him about it anymore because it has gotten to the point where its not even reassurance, its literally just annoying. ",03Nov2018,1

289,"Using incognito and a throwaway, wishing I had a VPN because I am so ashamed to admit this.  

I have really, really, really, really disgusting intrusive thoughts. It feels like my brain is testing me almost on a daily basis to check if I'm a bad person yet. I really don't even want to type it. It's so gross but I need help so I'm gonna have to. I keep having thoughts regarding child molestation. Almost every single day, my brain throws images of children getting molested to test me and it's almost as if a voice is saying ""Do you like that?"" the answer is always no. But why does it keep  happening? The reason why it scares me so much is because I love taking care of children. I have been a childcare provider by profession for many years. I have never hurt a child, and while around children, those thoughts never occur, and I have never had a thoughts about a child I actually know, and I am never the perpetrator in those thoughts. I am just a 3rd person witnessing something happening to someone I don't know. But now I am thinking of leaving my profession because every time I go home, my brain will think ""remember when you heard on the news this kid got raped? What do you think?"" every single day. 

I thought I wanted to be a mother but I am having doubts. I know for a fact I would never harm them, I know it's not something I would ever want and it gets me overly upset to hear of children who fall victims to disgusting humans who would hurt them that way. Quite frankly, sometimes I wonder if I was molested as a child because ever since I was 4, I had this nightmare where an ugly looking witch would stick his finger up my vagina. Every night for a few weeks. And I have some weird thoughts regarding sexuality, like I want to burn my vagina sometimes because I hate knowing it's there, I get horny but when it's time to have sex I back out because I don't want to be touched there, I just wish I could cut it off my body. 

So I don't know. Sometimes I find peace in thinking, maybe I got molested, repressed the memory, and it's trying to come back in a the oddest and vilest way possible. At least, I'm not a bad person, you know? Would rather be broken than bad. But still. I legit want to kill myself, give up on my career, give up on my wish to have children because those thoughts have gotten disgusting. I had a dream last night, and it was very very bad. I don't want to type it out, it was that horrible. I was hoping I'd forget it after waking up, but no. It's still very fresh in my mind and I truly want to shoot my brains out.

291,"For some background, I recently got into university and I started talking with this girl from my class, it wasn't anything serious, but I could tell she was interested and so was I, kinda. Every semester we have 2 class dinners. This girl, I'll call X couldn't go to the first because her grandmother had died and she had to spend time with her family. After the dinner we all went to a club and I made out with a friend of mine that happened to be near by. It was stupid and I was drunk. Everyone saw us and after, me and a few people from our class went to get some food. 

&amp;#x200B;

While there one of X's friends told me something along the lines of: ""You and that girl we're really going at it huh"". This is where the fuck up gets worse. I denied and then asked them not to tell her.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I did the next day, was tell her what I'd just done and she was obviously upset.  She texted me for a few days basically insulting me and telling me I'm a piece of shit, I apologized and said I hadn't done anything like that before. The last text she sent me was telling that I should put myself in her position and ask me If I would trust me, I said no and it ended there.

I know that she’s also been struggling but I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation and she never texted me to see how I was doing when I got out. I told her a month later that I was still struggling with suicidal thoughts and she said she was too overwhelmed to support me. 

All these things are reasonable; I understand that my friends aren’t my therapists. But until that point she’d never told me that she was struggling. She’d bitch vaguely on twitter but hadn’t confided in me. As soon as she told me I asked what I could do to support her. 

I don’t know what I wanted from posting this except to just get it out. I’ve been trying everything I can to get better but this depressive episode has lasted for two years now and I’m losing hope. I’m adopting a cat tomorrow and all she could do was ask if I realized how expensive cats are. She lost her cat of over 10 years this summer and I guess his end of life care was very expensive.

293,"Hi, I’m 25 and I’m a first semester grad student. I have 3 roommates in a room, and 2 bunk beds. I only have one completely chill roommate who we will call Jill, and her bunk mate, who we will call Kate, is frustrating her (and me, to some extent) because she brings a boy over every weekend without asking. We are not allowed to have any overnight guests, but we don’t want to be buzzkills so we haven’t said anything yet. But they can be very loud and I’ve had to buy ear plugs and some nights when I know he’s coming over I knock myself out with sleep aids so I don’t have to be woken up/kept up by them at 3am. It’s also extremely uncomfortable to wake up to a man in your room when you want to get changed or just go about your morning routine. Jill is pissed off too, we’re trying to figure out how to confront Kate because Kate is also a spoiled brat and doesn’t care about other people’s feelings and has proven this before.

Now my bunkmate has a boy thing. We’ll call her Becca. Becca always asks to have her boy over first. They usually pass out immediately and are quiet because he doesn’t want to take the public transport home late at night. But one night they were fooling around and I could not sleep because I’m extremely sensitive to sounds and little sounds bother me a lot so I can’t sleep if there’s shit going on right near me. Also they were rocking the bed. I told her that night that I had an 8am class and I only got 3 hours of sleep. I don’t know what it is about having a sleeping person 3 feet above you that makes you want to get sexual with another person, but being in college I’ve found that people seem to do this anyway. I have no problem with someone wanting and asking for privacy but this is so uncomfortable for me when I am literally 3 feet above them trying to sleep and I also need sleep because I have both Bipolar and OCD and when I don’t sleep 7-8 hours I will be a wreck the next day which makes it hard for me to function because I am washing my hands more than usual and have a hard time functioning which messes up my ability to do well in class or to just do normal things like eat.

I think they did this because they were drunk, otherwise Becca is very considerate and quiet. But she’s asking if he can stay over tonight and it’s the weekend so they might be drunk. I don’t want to say “no” but I also don’t want to say “yes but I can totally hear you messing around so keep that in mind”. Again, we’re not allowed to have overnight guests so I always have that to back me up. I can literally hear everything though, even with ear plugs. I’m tired of drugging myself up to avoid being woken up at 3am and not being able to fall back asleep until 6am. How do I deal with Becca and Kate? I think I need to approach Kate and say “can you let us know before you bring a strange man into our living space?”, but I’m not sure what the best approach is with Becca. I do like Becca and she’s very nice but it’s my room too and her boy thing doesn’t pay the rent so he has no business being here waking me up.

I don’t want to be a buzzkill or anything and I understand wanting to have guests (but they never ever seem to go over the guys’ places, lol), but this is my living space and if I can’t sleep in my own space I find that to be a huge problem, especially with my mental problems that require me to get enough sleep. I thought I could handle a lot of roommates but I didn’t anticipate these problems. I’m trying to move to a different room with less roommates but that’s next semester.

297,"I've been at a company for 3 years where I never got a promotion, despite my reviews of ""outstanding"" and ""stellar."" In addition to my day-to-day responsibilities, I also worked on a couple of side projects that got a lot of attention. All in all, I've been doing pretty well at work...but have really come to dislike it for reasons I'll discuss.

A girl in my group joined after my first or second year on the job; she came in with no relevant experience and joined because her group (same company) was laid off. Guess what? She got a promotion within 6 months. I have been asking my own boss for a promotion, and he kept mentioning how he has ""big dreams"" for me at the company. Another co-worker (much older and very respected in the company) recently told me that I was cheated. I ended up getting married and took a personal leave in case my husband had decided to move back. And lo and behold...I found out he made me sign a pre-nup without telling me what it was, and mentioning it was for a marriage license (long story), emotionally abused me, and several other unforgivable things. I ended up coming back home, filing for a divorce, and telling my boss I would come back (during my personal leave, he was practically asking me every week what my plans were and that he had big things in mind for me). I told my boss about my situation (not the details), but just enough so he would understand that I may have to take time off for the lawyer, court, etc.

So. I'm back at work. And 2 weeks in, the company is doing a restructuring which I had a feeling my boss \*definitely\* knew about for a while. He was being very hush-hush about everything and kept mentioning how he couldn't tell me what was going on, and that ""big things"" were in plan for me. I don't blame him for not being able to tell me things, but yesterday, he told me that the VP wanted to meet me.

I go to his office. He tells me that I missed a meeting (because I had an exam for school) where they basically gave people a heads-up that there will be a chance for many people to re-apply for their jobs, and I had to do the same. He told me that the company thinks ""highly of me,"" and it's more than likely I'll be fine. But, he said, he couldn't guarantee anything.

So we went to the big meeting afterwards, where the VP gave a presentation on the re-structuring. He gets to our group, and \*my name is gone, my position is gone, and every other college graduate name in my group was still entact.\* They basically had an open position, with several technicians (their names also gone). I was in shock. Although several people's names were gone (people with PhD's, etc), I felt that it was because they were already very, very old - past the age of retirement.

After the meeting, I was pretty cold and distant. My boss told me I had nothing to worry about, to just apply to the open position in our group and I'll be perfectly fine. He even sent me to his boss, who told me that I have a good track record and nothing to worry about. And the other girl in my group came up to me at my desk and put her hand on my shoulder, as if to soothe me. It was a nice gesture, but how humiliating is that?

I'm incredibly upset. Why did this position not come in the form of a promotion? Why did my boss ask me to come back to such a humiliating situation where I'd have to apply to a job that I know I earned, after he knows I experienced a hard time in my personal life? I know it's a business, but he \*repeatedly\* mentions how he has my best interest in mind, how I'll get ""very far"" in the company, etc. His opinion is respected by the VP, as is his supervisor's opinion. Why didn't he fight for me?

Just wondering if anyone experienced a similar situation, with re-applying, etc. I'm planning to leave and get back to grad school full time. This has been incredibly embarrassing and I don't know if I can see my boss, etc in the same light anymore.",03Nov2018,1
298,"A few weeks ago, I took a foster dog into my home who was going to be abandoned or euthanized. He was starving to death. When he got to my house, I instantly fell in love with him. He was so sweet. Great with other animals, house broken, truly a great animal. I already found him a forever home to go to when he was fully rehabilitated. He was gaining weight and peeking up.

Thursday afternoon, I gave him and my other dog a treat and put them in their crates. I was leaving for roughly thirty minutes to get my paycheck. The foster dog just got a brand new, strong crate because he had issues with escape.  It was containing him very well and he had not managed to break this one.

While I was gone, the downstairs neighbor texted me to let me know the internet had gone out. I stopped on my way home to check the website, everything was fine. I got home to my Eskimo screaming in his crate. Everything was knocked over in my home and my foster dog had a treat bag around his head. He had suffocated. Somehow he managed to break out of his crate and get the treat bag I had just used prior to leaving. He was breathing and I got him to the emergency vet but he was just too far gone. I had to euthanize.

I feel tremendous guilt. I’ve barely slept. I’ve cried everyday since. All I can think about is carrying all 65 pounds of him down the steps and sprinting with him. Thinking that he might be okay because he was breathing and making noise. I have a hard time going to work and leaving my other pets even though I’ve put everything up and my Eskimo has never had issues with breaking out of the crate. All I want to do is lay at home with them. What do I do? Am I being dramatic? I’ve never experienced something like this before and I feel silly but ... my animals are all I have. I took this dog in to save his life and ended up killing him anyway.

299,"So my roommate and I have lived together for over a year and this entire time, she has not cleaned our apartment. I clean the whole entire apartment (sans her room) aka our living room, our kitchen, our bathroom, and my room about every 2 weeks. When I say clean, I mean clean. Our apartment isn’t that big but I usually spend about 4 hours cleaning. So today, I was doing my usual thing and when I finished, my roommate basically stomped up to me and said “Why do you always have to be so loud when cleaning? Shut up and just do it!” I was just like “wtf” and said ok, not really knowing what I do. She then stomped back to her room and slammed the door. I’m just super confused because the only time I was loud today was where I stepped on my rug weird, slid, and said “fuck!” I’m just not sure what to do. I’ve tried to get her to clean by not cleaning for a month and she didn’t do anything. It’s not really possible for me to get another roommate at this time.

300,"Short backstory: 
My sister was dating this guy (we'll call him Alan) a while back and they adopted 3 dogs together. They dated for 5 years. After the breakup they decided to stay friends so they could both still see their dogs. They currently live with Alan because we have dogs at our house and it would be too many. 

So my sister's birthday is today. Alan called her around 8AM telling her to come over because he was upset about something. She came over and he was holding one of their dogs in his arms. She had died last night. Her and one of their other dogs got into a fight. She was disabled and at a disadvantage. (Her 2 front legs were abnormally short compared to her hind legs so she struggled to walk around and run.) The other dog killed her during the fight. He may not have meant to, but she already had issues. Health issues as well. I feel so bad that she died on my sister's birthday. We were supposed to go eat with her today. That won't be happening anymore. What makes it worse is that she is a very sensitive person. She is barely getting over the death of my mom's boyfriend who she was close with. She has severe depression and recently started going to therapy. She was getting better. Now it's going to get a lot worse. I'm worried about her. She's been suicidal in the past and I don't want anything to happen to her. I know that I need to be supportive but is there anything else I can do for her? I need advice. Anything is appreciated.

302,"I’ve been depressed previously, a few years ago (end of high school to beginning on university). I turned my life around and was happy for a while. I’m still somewhat happy now but I’ve been feeling depression come back since mid September.  It’s damaged my grades, my weight and my relationship a bit but nothing that I can’t fix. I feel like I’ve been such a pain to be a round recently. I’ve been so moody. I really just want to get over this. 

Today, I sent a few emails to start volunteering again. I plan on deep cleaning my room and bed room later today.
In general, I also plan on shadowing, preparing for grad school interviews, booking an appointment so I can seea counsellor/therapist on campus, cutting fast food, going to class, starting to work out again, seeing people that arent my boyfriend and applying skin care again.
Things I  use to do before this episode and what helped me out last time.

One specific thing about this depressive episode is that I’m very prone to overthinking and later ruminating. I don’t know how to combat this. For example, my boyfriend always says I love you and kisses me before he drops me out. He didn’t do this last night. I was upset because it left me thinking that he doesn’t love me anymore. The truth it, I was moody the entire night so he probably wasn’t feel great himself because of my actions.",03Nov2018,1
303,"Recently one of my closest friends and I had a bit of a falling out (we'll call him/her Alex). Alex consistently would tell me one thing then do another. I've brought it up multiple times that I don't appreciate being lied to and that the hypocrisy is annoying. Alex didn't think s/he did anything wrong. 

So I've decided that I need to cut Alex out from my life almost completely. I'm just having a hard time doing that. Yes, I know it consits of just not talking to them. But how do I get the right mindset of not wanting to talk to Alex? Because what goes through my mind is that maybe I am wrong to do this. I worry and care about Alex so it's hard for me to just let go.

Has anyone else gone through this? I just want to stop caring about what Alex does and says, because in the end I can't control it and it shouldn't matter to me.",03Nov2018,1

I just don’t know how to tell him. He’s very nice and he wants to bring a woman with him to speak with me about my faith. 
I’m so frustrated because I honestly wouldn’t have kept up the conversation if I knew that’s what he was leading up to.

307,"Before telling the whole story, thanks in advance for hearing me out and possible helping me since now I'm in a bad spot in my life, thanks.

So I'm basically as casual as it gets when it comes to being a dude, and my so called ''best friend'', or ex best friend, is a girl.  
When we started way back to talk, she already had a best friend, a girl, and we talked and talked. I talked to her about everything that you guys could imagine, even insignificant stuff. And well she became my bestfriend, and in her eyes i was her ''boy'' best friend. I started being friends with her bestfriend too, and got close with her too. Love them both but you know....my best friend is everything to me and I love her to the sky.

Anyway, we used to be so close with each other. Telling everything that has happened, talking for hours and hours, hanging out a lot. In my eyes she is perfect, beautiful soul and all that, really not a bad person trust me. But then something has changed..yeah she got a boyfriend and fell for him hard, but hey guess what he turned to be like the other shit bags and eventually cheating on her..and you know it ended. Before that, in the meantime she started drifting away, but still we had the same vibe even though she talked differently. 

And we had several arguments about how our friendship was going...things like how she stopped checking on me, how I was, How i wasn't the first person in her mind to tell something exciting that has happened, and she said she's sorry and she'll try differently...anyway she did for a bit then again, and the situation got worse, more friends came into her life more talk with them rather than me, and I KEPT and KEPT talking about her about this but the more I mentioned this her interest in resolving the problem was dropping...

And me...i was sad all the time, she said she wouldn't want to talk to me if she sees me like that but to be honest shouldn't a friend be there for you rather than let things be?...

Time passed and passed and guess what some of those friends turned to be fake, what a surprise, spreading rumors about her and all that..only me, her bff and other girl stood by her side in the end.

But you know she cared for those 2 girls than me and yeah...

I did A LOT for her, I STOOD by her in every bad situation, I gave her everything, and i don't think I ever got something in return...  
She isn't a bad person I repeat, she's just different with ME for some reason, probably none but whatever..

We then..stopped talking for a month...then school started and we got back in touch...everything was back on track we were talking again and all that and we got a ''friends'' group  
Me, her, her 2 friends and my brother...  
I care for her friends too I mean i have history with them too so i have nothing against them for her being the way she is btw!

And well things got shit again...she speaks very different with me than with the others (excluding my brother, my borther being more friends with her bff, which btw is moved to another city and rarely comes)

At school she only stays with her other friend barely talks to me, and when she does is with her too  
So basically we kinda became only group friends...not like those true best friends ..

I love her too much and she says she does love me too and she cares but never proved it honestly...

Now maybe you can tell me I'm overreacting but trust me if you were to see with my eyes, people would understand and even with this long ass paragraph i still think it's like 5% of what the situation in my mind is and kinda not said everything because it's hard for me to express myself and yeah...

Hope it wasn't too vague or maybe idk..

Thank you",03Nov2018,2

For the past year and a half I've been running it circles, feels like, trying to obtain something that my heart belives in but my brain doubts. I know a lot of you guys are grown men who don't really care for high school drama but please hear me out. In August I befriended this girl and her boyfriends, each of our personalities instantly clicked and we all hung out and had fun together. I never really felt like the third wheel because we always enjoyed each others company. However the couple had actually some very deep issues with each other and soon me and girl spent long nights talking to one another about it, then in December of that year (the three of us first met in August) they broke up. However what i did not know was that during time the three of us hung out she had actually been talking to another guy on the side and that December she revealed to me that she had feelings for him. However we still grew closer and closer and we would flirt with each other from time to time. Ya know the usual, compliment each others looks and whatnot but she was mainly into that dude. Throughout January they grew closer and closer as did we. I fearing that she might fall for the new guy (let's just call him fred for confusion's sake) made probably the biggest mistake in this whole ordeal and asked her out. She (lets just refer to her as faith) told me that was good looking and an awesome guy but she just had feelings for Fred. Fred and Faith dated from February to July, but the relationship went horribly and she always ran to me to air her grievances about it. He ignored her and spent more time with his buddies than Faith so that summer, they decided to end things. Maybe a week after the breakup she revealed that she considered dating me, but the timing was just bad and she felt that Fred (now a senior, faith is currently a sophmore) was what she taught was the one for her. Our sophomore year from August to October went great, we spent long nights talking with each other, flirted a lot, and generally we were always together. I could feel that was only a few more right moves away from dating faith until she dropped the bomb on me; she still had feelings for Fred. Stunned I questioned her why she would give the guy who treated her so badly a second chance and she basically said she has a good feeling things will go differently this time around. They're not together........ yet. I feel as if I'm running out of time, I know that for everyday that passes they grow closer. I only have one advantage, Fred's a senoir about to go to university and Faith as a result is hesistant about starting something serious. Fellas please respond; should i just wait this year out for when Fred graduates and make my move my junior year or am I wasting my time? Am i a victim of just poor timing and Faith actually has feelings for me or am I destined to be that best friend that watches my chances of romance fly away?

321,"I'm very sorry about the length of this hit I feel like it needs to be said.

My partner has been working at the same place for at least 7 years or so, he loves his job generally and a couple days ago he was laid off. A couple of years ago the same thing happened but I think more because the business was not doing so hot due to the owner racking up personal and frivolous store expenses on the store credit card (buy a snowmobile for the store so he could take it to his residence and the store would never see it again) but he started working there again because little work was being completed without him.

I honestly dont believe I am inflating the image of my partner by saying he has amazing work ethic, his work ethic is better than even mine and I love my job and think I have a pretty decent work ethic. He picks up the slack whenever he sees things needing to be done, goes out of his way for his customers and literally had to be vomiting to miss a day of work. He regularly says 30mins to an hour extra after work and does not get paid for it. He only takes about 5 days of his two week vacation time each year (and some years those are used as sick days) I know this may sound bare minimum for some people but for the people he work for and with this is a mighty lot.

His boss is never around, he seems like a nice guy usually but is really oblivious to the taxing effect his expenses have on the store. He also has a habit of hiring family that do not want to work there and end up just being there for money and taking a whole day to do a job even an inexperienced person would take only a few hours to do. These things are often done wrong too so my partner is often left holding the bag, fixing the issue or having to explain to the customer what went wrong. It's not like he can explain to the customer that it isnt his fault that their car isnt ready, that it was the other employee basically ducking around. That would be a crappy excuse to hear from someone servicing your car and my partner knows that and takes the fall. 

This sort of stuff has taken quite a toll on his mental state the past 3 or 4 months. He even spoke to me about wanting to see a therapist because of depression. He's snapped at me recently which is incredibly unusual for him and I know it's because everyday he is going to work and hating it. It hurts me to see him like this and I know how hard it is for a lot of men to admit that they are having mental issues. I am very afraid that he is keeping an iceberg of feelings below his skin and I dont want him to hurt himself.

He has been trying to speak to his boss about stress in the workplace, that things need to be done more efficiently because he doesnt like looking like an idiot in front of the customers for something he didn't do. His boss is never around for more than 10 mins a day, if that. He has asked him point blank 'I need to speak to you about the things that are going on at work' his boss's response is to go on vacation for a week and act like his employee never asked him to sit down and talk.

Yesterday my partner asked his employer why he was being laid off because he could have easily just laid off the other guys that dont actually work (which he did lay one of them off) and his boss went off on an angry rant. 

The rant went like this: you (my SO) are just showing up to work expecting a paycheque without actually doing any work. His boss felt like he wasnt gettting paid enough to show up at the store (literally a few hours a week) and from now on at the end of the month he is going to take all the money he wants out of the bank and leave the rest for everyone else to scrap over. Things are going to change and they are starting with laying people off.

This caught my SO off guard and he was stunned and hurt. He came home and vented to me, he was very emotional and I could see his mental state deteriorating.

I was livid. I try to be as honest a person I can be and if I ever thought that someone I loved needed a kick in the ass like that I would tell them myself or tell them to suck it up. I do not think he deserved to be told that. The solution to me was clear. He could not work there anymore. He is being laid off but the last time he was laid off they kept calling him in to work for them because they couldn't get any work done with out him (he is one of two employees that are actually certified in their trade) and I'm afraid that they will do that again and he will be stuck in this situation indefinitely. 

We agreed last night after a long heart to heart that he needs to find a new job and he is actually hopeful about the prospect. He said he doesnt care if he is actually working in his trade at all, just that he is able to put his head down and work without shop politics getting in the way of everything. It would be great if we could collect employment benefits while he searches for a new job but I'm afraid of the employer just firing him at any moment. This is a huge leap for us as we are not incredibly wealthy. I just really need some advice here. Are we overlooking anything? I'm scared for my husband, he tells me he feels like he's on the verge of a break down.

Thank you for reading, I'm sorry I had to vent all of that out, I just dont know what to do.

325,"So, apologies for any formatting issues because I’m posting from the mobile app. My boyfriend and I adopted a cat a few months ago, and our cat’s behavior has been off putting. Full disclosure, I have fostered cats and kittens for five years and also have owned at least one cat at any point in my lifetime, so I have lots of experience with cats. But this cat is different because he was never free fed, and we would always free feed our cats. our cat eats two or three times a day.  Every day around 3 or 4am, he will meow incessantly and constantly jump up on our dresser and knock stuff off because he wants to be fed. he’ll jump on the keyboard and turn it on, and walk all over our faces. When we shut him out, he meows loudly for literally 2 hours and scratches on the door (none of this is ideal because we live in a small apartment building.) what should we do?",03Nov2018,1

328,"My wife got burned out from overwork and severely depressed after she told her bosses she couldn’t keep up with the workload they and her coworkers provided. She describes conflicting feelings with work, both saying she felt like a doormat for everyone there to walk over; but also saying she needs the praise/validation she gets from doing good work as a confidence booster. She’s also had a therapist for a while to cope with long term anxiety, and she’s been on an antidepressant that also doubles as an anxiety medication for the last couple of years.

&amp;nbsp;

This episode of depression started in late June. By the beginning of August we became so strained that we started couples therapy. I’ve also recently started individual therapy sessions to deal with some negative feelings her behaviors have caused me to experience. 

&amp;nbsp;

It’s been 4 months since we’ve been physically/sexually intimate. She participates I’m occasional hugs, but that’s it. She usually comes home from work and sort of retreats into her phone for a couple hours (she says it’s her method of decompressing from a long day). Our conversations with each other lately also feel strained. I miss the intimacy, and I’m upset at feeling like my wife and best friend has just emotionally checked out from our marriage. About the only positive sign I’ve seen in her behavior recently is when I told her she had the night to herself and went out on my own. She actually sounded a little worried when she asked me what I’d been doing (off topic: went to see, “Bad Times at El Royale,” liked it a lot.).

&amp;nbsp;

On an intellectual level, I know she is going through a lot right now. On an emotional level, I’m feeling a little lonely in the marriage. I’m feeling hurt and angry that even with the therapy, there’s been minimal improvement. I want this marriage to work, and I’m wondering just how long should I wait before bringing up this sort of static feeling in our marriage, and expressing a desire for more. I don’t want to be selfish, and at this point I wonder if indulging my wife’s isolation behavior is contributing to the problem more than helping it.

330,"I want to start off with saying I appreciate the advice anyone offers, I really need some different viewpoints and perspectives. 

My husband of six months told me completely out of the blue this past February that he wanted a divorce. I was devastated. We had been together at that point for almost four years. He was my best friend and absolute favorite person. I knew he was unhappy and severely struggling with depression, but I didn’t know that meant he was going to push me away and cut me out of his life completely. 

The divorce was civil, but still excruciatingly painful. I lost weight, couldn’t sleep, had severe stomach issues, it was awful. A broken heart is devastating. Throughout it all he told me how he’d always love me and how sorry he was for putting me through everything. It was like he didn’t want the divorce, but it’s what he thought was best for both of us. No matter what I wanted. 

Looking back these past 9 months, I’ve realized so many mistakes we both made. The biggest being we were both too young (he was 19 and I was 20). The weight of marriage was heavier than either of us could understand. The whole thing has completely broken my spirit. I’ve been so unhappy and lonely. 

I tried to date around, and I have met someone who I think there could be a future with. The problem is that I feel like I’m still constantly trying to be happy. No matter what sweet thing he does or how much enjoyable time we spend together, I’m never truly happy. I honestly feel like I’m dead inside most days. Hes wanted to not just date, but make our relationship more serious and official multiple times. I never can do it though. It never feels like the right choice no matter how much I want it to be. He’s extremely understanding about how I feel, and honestly it makes it so much harder. 

So, this past Sunday I had to text my ex about a password I needed for 23andMe. It was casual and polite, as always. He then kept texting me. Which was unusual because every other time we’ve interacted it’s been brief and to the point. I was unsure about it, but I continued to text him Bc it felt so good to just at least have a sliver of my best friend back. We continued to text for a couple hours, the texts then turned into a phone call. We were catching up, but mostly apologizing and just talking through all the misunderstandings. It felt so amazing. The weight that I’ve been caring for months on end finally left my shoulders. I could breathe again. The guy I’ve been seeing was with me that night, and he wasn’t happy, but understanding of the whole situation. He knew I needed relief and hoped it could maybe help me find closure. 

Since Sunday we’ve talked on the phone once more and texted twice. Both agreeing we should keep our distance, but not being super successful. We both enjoy each other’s company so much and both expressed we want to be friends. If it’s even a possibility, I do not know. 

So, all of that to say that I’m utterly confused on what to do. The guy I’m seeing said that in the whole time we’ve known each other he’s never seen me as happy as I was when I was texting him that Sunday night. It hit me hard. I thought that by dating another guy that I do really like and moving on with my life it would get better with time, but it hasn’t. I’ve never been so depressed and lonely in my life. When I contact my ex I feel that ray of light he’s always brought to my life. He’s expressed he feels the same way too. I know 9 months isn’t that long. So more time could still heal I’m sure. I just don’t know what to do. 

Try and be distant friends with my ex and continue to see this other guy maybe try and give us a real shot?

Talk to my ex and see if us getting back together is a possibility or even a sane decision? 

Completely quit contacting my ex and just hope time can heal my endless darkness?

I have no idea. There’s a million pros and cons to every scenario. All I know is that I need to get this constant tug of war in my head to cease. Please help. ",03Nov2018,1

332,"So about 2 months ago my best friend and I were at a party. I was drunk and so was he but I was moreso... I remember accidentally rubbing his d*ck and then 10 minutes later asking if I had done that, and him saying “yeah, but you were super drunk..” what I don’t remember is that apparently, in response to that I said “well, at least you liked it.” Basically sexually assaulting him and then telling him he liked it. Obviously that’s not okay. But it’s also not who I am, and I was very drunk. 

A month went by of him slowly distancing himself from me, and I didn’t know why until I finally got him to tell me that he is extremely uncomfortable around me now. It doesn’t help that he’s never had any sexual experiences before, so he was probably even more uncomfortable because of that. 

This year is my first year back home, because last year I was at college and now I take community college classes here... All my friends are either at the college I was at before or away at various colleges, so he was one of my only friends here. I miss him terribly, I apologized but he’s just too uncomfortable to be around me, and the guilt is eating me alive. I’ve never hated myself more and I don’t know how to fix it or undo it.

We have open gym as a way for the coaches to see the people trying out in action, and coming is said to show determination, and increase your chances of making the team.

336,"So, my mom lives in oregon with a lot of her family, and my dad lives in California with a lot of his family. I have 2 siblings (brother 4, and sister 8) who I haven't seen very much at all. I wanted to get closer to them and be in their lives, so I moved to California with my girlfriend. Things were okay for the first week or two, but we couldn't find any jobs or anything, so we were struggling with money. 
After about 2 and a half months, we still couldn't find any jobs. We were applying everywhere in town (it's a pretty small town, but we didnt think it would be this hard), and we were calling them every other day to ask about our applications. Finally, after about 3 months, my gf gets an interview at a general store for a cashier. She gets the job, but I'm having no such luck. 
I started applying to other cities up to an hour away, and I finally got an interview at a fast food restaurant. I never heard back from them, and whenever I called or emailed, they would tell me that I'd get a call if I got the job. At this point i was losing hope. 
Meanwhile, we are living with my dad, and we love being around my siblings and all, but we didnt expect that there would be constant screaming and fighting between the stepmom and the kids. I was always living with just me and my mom, so I wasnt used to this much chaos and fighting every day. Neither was my gf. We felt like we were mooching waaaaayyyyy too much by now, and we even started selling our stuff to make money so we wouldn't have to borrow so much. 
My dad paid a lot of money and took time off work to move us here, and so we felt really bad not being able to find any jobs or anything, but we were helping out as much as we could by babysitting and cleaning the house. 
Finally, my Gf decided she couldn't live here anymore. She hated her job, she missed her friends and family, and we both had jobs that would take us back if we ever moved back to Oregon. 
We had a talk, and I agreed that I wanted to stay with her, and we would both be happier moving back to oregon even though we would miss the people here and getting to be with my siblings. 
There isnt anything to do here, the house is chaotic and sometimes awkward when we try to go out and spend time with everybody. 
I know that my stepmom was a big part of my gf's decision to leave. She disagrees with a lot of the ways she talks to the kids, and she can make it really awkward in the house too. So we finally told everyone our plan to move back. 
My dad was sad, and he didnt say much, but I could tell that he wished we liked it better here and he was really supportive. But overall, he didnt say much at all. My mom (on the phone) was very excited that we were moving back, but she was concerned about the money and gas to move all of our stuff back. Completely understandable, and we told everyone we didnt want them worrying about the money or anything, and we would figure everything out ourselves. 
My stepmom, was a little different. She told us that they weren't helping us with the move because they cant afford it again (which we totally understand, but we had already said we would worry about that all), and she kept telling us that the kids were gonna be devastated, and that we should probably wait longer, like up to a year, to move so that we could save money to move. Then, she said that were adults and can make our own decisions, and that she was just shocked, and that we dont even leave the house much so how would we know if we liked it here or not anyways. We live like and hour away from everything, and there are only 5 or 6 stores here, and maybe a few parks. But there isnt much to do here, and we dont leave the house much because we dont have money for gas or fun. Either way, it was just an overall uncomfortable conversation, and it seemed like she was mad at us for not being happy here. We will realistically have to stay here for a few more weeks, and we still haven't told my siblings yet, but we dont want it to be miserable here and we dont want anyone mad at us for not being happy. 
I do understand that they spent a lot of money on us, and they even helped us with a couple of credit card Bills, but we told them we would pay them back and we wouldn't need their help with the move or anything. 

Really really sorry that was so long, I don't post much on reddit and idk how all this works. 

Tldr: my dad paid a lot of money to help me move to California, and I couldn't find a job to help pay him back yet. I wasnt happy here, so I told them I was moving back to oregon. I said they wouldn't have to worry about money or helping us move again, and that we would pay them back for all of their help. People were mostly supportive, but sad. However, my stepmom seemed mad at me for wanting to move back, and tried to guilt trip me into staying longer. I dont want anyone mad at me for not wanting to stay here, and I'm not sure if I can do anything to fix it besides stay here indefinitely. ",03Nov2018,1
337,"I've graduated from college and the workplace I am in is okay... but they cannot give me more than 30 hours a week and absolutely NO benefits. It is a small local business, I am technically her only employee (but we do also have four other people that work here, I am just the only one she is the boss of). 

Anyways I have a potential full time opportunity lined up and I have been humming and hawing on how to approach this with my boss. 

She is fine some days, but MOST days she is cranky, loud mouthed, difficult to deal with, etc. She keeps telling me that she will hate me if I ever leave her, and tried to make me promise that I would just do ""my thing"" on the side and keep working with her. The more I work here and contemplate the things that I will be lacking if I stay here, the more stressed I become. I don't look forward to ANY of my shifts anymore. 

The other problem is, that two of the other people that work here are her brother, and her father. Father owns the business. He tells me not to worry a lot about her and that she is just a bitchy person (his words not mine haha).

So I'm totally afraid that if I tell her I am leaving that she will lose her shit. I'm afraid of her getting so petty about it that instead of taking the two weeks for what it is, that she will just not want me to come back. I am also afraid of her begging for me to stay and making me feel horrible.

We met at work, and somehow we ended up going out. We weren’t really hitting on each other, but it just felt natural. 

When we got to the date location, we both realized what was wrong, and had to address it.

So we start by saying how different we are, but how much in common we have as well.

342,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible but I also would like to give sufficient information in case anyone is awesome enough to weigh in on the subject.

I've never had a long term relationship and I'd guess that much of the reason is down to me wanting to achieve things with my life before I settle down. I know, some people say if the right person comes along, you'll know, but I never really felt like that would be an issue for me and wanted to achieve my ambitions. 

I (a guy) started seeing a girl. It was clear from the get go that she was really into me because she would always reply to me instantly, she was always excited to speak to me, she told me everything I did was perfect etc. Fast forward a few weeks and she's telling me that she loves me and I don't say it back because I've been very open about my seeming inability to maintain close intimacy with anyone.

I tell her that I want to just be friends, because it's not the right time in my life for anything long term. Perhaps just as big a reason, I neglected to say that to me it seems like she is in love with *the idea* of me, not me. It seems like I'm the only person she has been around that has treated her with a level of respect and it seemed as if she was clinging onto that.

I am struggling with depression and have been for a while, and so naturally some of my outings have become less frequent and I talk less to a lot of my friends. I have gone from trying my absolute best to reply quickly and be there for advice, to my ""default"" setting of replying when I feel like it, which is often a day after I receive a message or a call. She is now constantly wanting to spend time together, and even getting upset when I don't. When I take a while to reply she usually messages me with something emotional about the pain she's in or about being in the hospital. 

It's not that I don't want to be there for her, because in truth, I thought she was fantastic and we clicked. Hence, why we decided to give it a go, but I can't help shake the feeling that I'm being emotionally blackmailed on account of her not really having anyone else. I have a constant guilt, all day, that I'm not replying. I know a friendship isn't meant to make you feel this way.

I don't know what to say to her to make the situation better because I genuinely want to help her, I just don't want to constantly pander to her low mood because I have things of my own to deal with, and this is precisely why I didn't want anything long term!

They eat mosquitos and other pests which I truly appreciate. They aren’t noisy and aren’t bothering us. 

Except... the smell. It is awful. The smell from their waste is constantly wafting into our unit. Now that the weather is nicer we have been trying to spend more time with the windows open and enjoying our patio.

Hi, I've never posted here before but I just need some outside opinions.

I can pay the fees myself, but I don't want to go against my parents, and I also really want to get into UMass.

Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.

	My original goal, before everything else, was to take pictures of the sunset. To get a good picture of the sunset, you have to get to the right vantage point. This is what led me to climb the seven-story fire escape of the big brick building down the street from my house. As I neared the sixth floor a man rapped on the windowpane. He wanted to know what I was doing. I stuttered out an honest explanation, and to my surprise, he didn’t care. As long as I wasn’t “breaking in or jumping off.” I had not planned for larceny or suicide, so I finished my ascent, took my pictures, and left. Something about that experience stuck with me; the height, the danger, the forbidden nature of the fire escape. It gave me a rush.
	A couple weeks later, my friend invited me to go climbing on the gothic rooftops of a complex near my house. Nothing crazy: a short ladder to a slate-shingled roof overlooking the grand windows of a library. The roof felt serene and remote compared to the rest of the bustling city area, and if the proprietors didn’t want us up there, then why would they bolt a bright red ladder to the wall?
	My life began to revolve around a simple question: How do I get on top of that? Sometimes it was as easy as stepping over the two-foot-tall divide between shopping mall parking lot and shopping mall roof. Other times it was more taxing: monkeying up a tall tree, shimmying along a long pipe, getting a running start to scale a near vertical wall. But the fun wasn’t just in the process. I yearned to see what others couldn’t, rare views and hidden architecture. My favorite rooves allowed me to peer into the building below. Big glass panes allowed me to watch the people beneath me, who, for whatever reason, never look up.
	The exploration itself became as big a part of my adventures as the challenge of the journey. I started to notice abandoned structures I had previously taken for granted. My curiosity ate at me, and I made a plan to explore a derelict train I had been passing by for years. Upon entry I was greeted with a depressing scene, walls marred with graffiti and floors covered with years of garbage left behind by squatters. Despite the filth, I found the train fascinating, walking from car to car through doors that would be sealed on a normal subway ride. The success of this adventure gave me motivation for those to come. I invested in a respiratory mask, and made my way through the dark and dusty rooms of dilapidated buildings that caught my eye.
	Climbing and exploring these buildings is one of my proudest achievements, and I get a great sense of accomplishment every time one of my adventures goes according to plan. My explorations have brought me out of my comfort zone, and helped me face my fears and become a braver person. They have taught me to explore my surroundings, and focus on every detail, no matter how minute. The city I live in is currently surrounding me with construction. Removing and renovating the old, in favor of new developments. I can’t say that it doesn’t make me sad to see my buildings being torn down or replaced, but change and growth are inevitable aspects of any urban setting. Although the cacophony of construction is sometimes suffocating, it forces me to actualize my situation, and come to terms with difference and loss. All I can do is look forward to the places I will travel in the future, the plans I will make, and the adventures I will have.



Rules:
1.	Don’t explore alone.
2.	Don’t climb in the rain or snow.
3.	Grab tree branches close to their meeting point at the trunk of the tree.

My dad came home and took me to see him. Nobody had told me he died, we were walking up to his room and I saw my uncle and cousins leaving very upset. I walked into the room and just saw him laying there dead. I hate having this be my last memory so much. I wish I would have gone to see him one last time I miss him so much.

As you can tell i don't know anything about relationships I mean i googled what is the appropriate age for dating xD (It said 16-18 is a good age to start) but when i asked my friends she said it doesn't mater.

360,"This is kind of just a vent but also I could use some advice on this. 

Okay so for most of my life I’ve had a hard time being happy and being confident and putting myself out there. But I spent a very long time trying to work around that and to gain confidence and all that. About 2 years ago I fell in love with my best friend and being in that relationship really helped me with the things I was struggling with, and honestly it turned my outlook on life around. Gave me a lot of confidence and it put me in unfamiliar territory that just forced me to adapt and figure my way through, which was great. I don’t regret a second of it. But, unfortunately the relationship had to come to an end about a month ago which was obviously unimaginably upsetting, but also I recognized that it needed to end and that both of us are better off after the split(if anyones interested me and her still talk and have mutual interest in being friends in the future once things have settled and it wouldn’t interfere with the process of breaking up). So although its been really rough, I’ve been able to handle it. 

Heres where i really need advice. Now that im out of the relationship Ive been spending more time with friends and i notice now more than ever that I have a few friends who are generally pessimistic and are unable to put their problems aside...ever. 

Look, i am and empathetic person and i try my best to always help others, especially my friends, but to be constantly listening to complete pessimism is so exhausting. I know that they are going through their own things, but like after this breakup of such a long relationship i know that the best thing i can do for myself is to just try my hardest to be optimistic and to realize that good things will come again in the future. The constant pessimism just makes me feel so much more grey about my own future and i just feel like its gotten to the point where it’s actually just not good for me to be around.

Im sure if you guys see where i am going with this you may be quick to say like “yeah thats bad spend less time with them if they are affecting you negatively” or something along those lines but idk i just don’t find it that easy because these friends are people I care about and i don’t want to cause them more hurt and i still want to be their friends, but the fact that their woes are essentially the only thing they can talk about just is wearing me down. Any advice would be so appreciated thank you if you took the time to read this, have a great day everyone.",03Nov2018,1
361,"Backstory: My AP teacher had a bucket with slips of paper with a random number written on it to determine which group went first (i.e. 1 meant that you present first, 2 = second, etc.) But by the time he got to our group, there was only *one* slip of paper left, so really we didn't get to choose. 

Low and behold, our group was the first group to present. After weeks of working on this presentation, we ended up with a 76 (it made sense, we were too nervous, kept reading off the script too much, spoke too fast, went over the 10min mark by twenty seconds.) I felt so shitty and discouraged because we worked our ass off. The second group who came after us also got a 76. 

*However*, literally every group got a 90+ after the second day of presentations. There's this one group who got a 90+ and went over the 10min mark by one entire minute.

Some groups did similar things that our group did also (read off the script a lot, stuttering, etc.) I felt so discouraged because we did similar things but ended up with drastically lower grades.

If I confront him about this I feel like he'll make an excuse and say: ""Oh, I'm just following College Board's rubric.""

Is there a specific way to confront him about this? Or am I being too petty and demanding?

362,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (19F) have been together for around 8 months. Other than some issues with apologizing (he refuses to ever admit he is wrong), he seems to be a great guy. 

A couple of days ago, I brought up something that is a huge relationship insecurity of mine, details not necessary. I made it clear to him it was something that upset me deeply, and something I very much disliked feeling (but I can't change my opinion about something, even if I hate my own opinion). When we discussed this, I was at his house in his room. He lives with his parents. It turned into an argument because he disagreed with my opinion. We were being quiet, not yelling in their house or anything. We decided to go to my car and sat in there and argued for nearly 2 hours, until it was talked through and brought to a ""compromise"" of sorts.

I found out yesterday (the day after) that he told his parents about our conversation. I find this mortifying and DEEPLY upsetting. This conversation was extremely private and a very big insecurity of mine that I made clear to him was even hard to bring up to him. I can't believe he would bring our personal arguments up and discuss them with his parents. I was angry and very upset when he told me he did, and he thinks there is no problem. I am almost sure he told them just so that he could have someone tell him he was right and I was wrong about the private talk.

His argument was that we argued ""inside their house"" and that they knew we did argue that night, so they have a right to know what it was about. 

I find this absolutely ridiculous. I am mortified, the subject matter was very private and I don't know how to look at his parents again. This situation has made me so angry and so hurt, I think I'm going to end an almost 9 month relationship over it with an otherwise good guy. I obviously don't want to, but he refuses to be sympathetic, see how he is wrong, or even say he shouldn't have. He actually laughed while I was freaking out after I found out.

363,"My grandma is mad that since I started college I havent spent as much time with her. Buckle up this will be long. So to start this off my grandma has had a hard life, she got married and had four kids before my grandpa divorced her for another woman( I think that's what happened but it's a touchy subject for my dad). Anyway she took the kids and moved to a small town in Arizona where she raised them while working a hard job for low pay. Her eldest (my uncle) died when he was 16, and when her daughter's came of age they moved across country. My dad was the youngest and left the small town for phoenix Arizona, but he called her every week and visited as much as he could. In her town of 5000 people she only has her sister and her kids, and a few friends.

Hi Reddit! At the start of this school year (I'm in 8th grade) one of my close friends, lets call him M, suddenly became friends with these two twins, I'll call them Z and X. The rest of our friend group followed him. He has always hated Z and X, and for good reason.

366,"Hello Reddit community,

I’m in a bit of a situation. I’ve had an awful roommate (maybe I’m over reacting) for the last 2 months and I still have till June. I usually wouldn’t post but I’m at a point where I want to cry, scream, and just hide in my bathroom and I can’t do this anymore.


I hate my roommate because she is the most high maintenance, passive aggressive person I have ever lived with, and I’ve had a lot. She always makes a ton of demands like no loud music, no eating, and then does them herself! At night I have to turn my lights off when she wants to sleep, but then sometimes she keeps me up till 2-3 am(our room is tiny so we sleep in same room and share a tiny bathroom).

I’m a quite flexible and chill person so these things wouldn’t usually bother me, but she is always upset about something and is quite rude in the way she asks ALL THE TIME that I’m losing my chill.

She always leaves stuff at the door so sometimes it’s hard to open as well. I now don’t expect us to be bffs or even friends but it has gotten to a point where I hide in the bathroom just so I don’t have to be around her, and she ALWAYS has her best friend over, it only bothers me because the room is so tiny and our beds are right next to each other, and I didn’t sign up for another roommate, sometimes I need my own space or time without constant noise as I do my homework in there as well. Not to mention the passive aggressive notes she left, it’s totally immature! 

I’m quite open so I’m used to just being like hey if this is bothering u let me know I’ll move it or anything. But like she doesn’t tell me until it’s gotten to a point she’ll just demand, do not eat in the room, I even asked if I could just hide in the bathroom to eat and she’s like nope sorry no food. AND SHE EATS IN OUR ROOM TOO, THAT HYPOCRITE. I’m not one to usually make demands so I know that if I tell her these things that makes me upset:

1) I’m not really being me and I’m just doin it cause she’s a hypocrite and too high maintenance. I always do everything she asks so I don’t get why she is still always upset about something. I wanted to talk to her like mature adults, but she obviously isn’t. 
2) If I do I know she’ll well automatically get very defensive about these things and upset and go gossip to everyone and create drama or be weirded out and make an always no speaking passive aggressive atmosphere to even worse, where she’s even more upset because I now have demands as well.

I’m so upset sometimes I just want to scream, cry, and argue. Maybe these are just little things and I get it, and as I said I’ve had many roommates b4 and never had this. I think it’s just a bunch of all these things combined along with her rude and high maintenance attitude I that I don’t appreciate changing just to make the princess happy.
But I’ve kept my cool for now. Maybe I’m being overly upset about such things? I just cant believe she can’t even follow the same standards she demands on me, and can’t be mature to talk to me politely ughhhhh

I’m hoping for a solution. I just hate the situation so much it gives me headaches and I’m the point of meltdown. We can switch roommates but only in extreme situations that they don’t really get along at all. I don’t know how to talk to her about this without going down to her level of making demands and her being a child and being more upset and creating drama.

Any advice?? Do u think I’m overreacting? Or at the most extreme should I try to move out?

Thanks!",03Nov2018,1
367,"This is on my throwaway for obvious reasons, I do not know if this person uses Reddit so I may need to change certain details. I cannot tell if I'm in the right or wrong in this situation and would appreciate your input. I made a hard decision to post this here in fear my friend will see and recognize, but I am truly at a loss of what to do. If I'm in the wrong here then I fully accept that, I'm afraid I may be overreacting, but I also may be projecting.

My friend, Derek, and I have not been friends for long but we made a very quick connection. I had very little information on him when we became friends and I was OK with that. All I really knew was that we both had pretty bad mental health issues, but the only one we share is anxiety and I believe that is the only mental health issue Derek has or, at least, that is the only one he has mentioned. He can be clingy and very sensitive, whereas I am more inclined to being by myself and I'm out of touch with a lot of human emotion.

Derek mentioned his girlfriend, whom he is in a long distance relationship with, was going to turn 15 this year as he was going to turn 16. I helped him with relationship advice and ideas for certain dates and times. I also know Derek for adding girls and meeting up with them, and even at times purposely leading them on. I do not believe Derek has been sexual with these girls, but every time a girl adds him he is convinced she ""likes him"".

That is only a tiny part of the problem. You see, Derek lied about his girlfriend's age which usually isn't a problem. This is where I feel I may be projecting myself onto his girlfriend and where I most need your input. His girlfriend is actually 13, and, if he told me the truth, she only turned 13 this year. I was sexually abused at 13 by a family member who was around 16 - 17 years of age, so I am frightened by age gaps I deem too large. Derek wants to meet his girlfriend when she is of legal age. Derek has very bad jealousy issues and, when referring to his girlfriend, uses words that imply she is his property. He can be extremely manipulative and asks his girlfriend never to leave him, because they started a relationship because bad things were happening in both their lives. He appears like the type to threaten suicide if you wish to leave. His girlfriend is also a liar, she steals art and crops out the watermark and writes her own one in it's place, and they talk about sexual things together. We also have a friend his girlfriend's age who he treats like shit because he's 'too immature'. Please help, I want to know if I'm overthinking or not.",03Nov2018,1

Also it's frustating that they just go to places that are absolutely boring to me and I have to go just because we are friends, even when these places are expensive. The thing is that I have a particular taste of music (electronic music, techno specifically) which makes me go to places that my friends avoid since ""only gay people and blacks could like that"". As you can see, that's not the kind of people that you would want to go party with.

That's why I usually go out by myself or with other people with similar tastes as me and I never tell them where or when I'm going out since for me music is sacred and when I'm out I like to have fun, but when I go out with them I have to act like their mother. The thing is that tonight I'm going to a place to see one of my favourite groups (I've been waiting to see them 5 years) and the only friend that sometimes comes with me told the rest even knowing that I don't like to go with everyone in this tipe of cases.

377,"there’s a girl i’m sort of crushing on in my class who i think might have a crush on me too but i’m not sure. these are some things i found suspicious 

• i’ve caught her looking at me from the corner of her eye multiple times before
• the professor sometimes stands in the back of the classroom to speak so he’s sort of behind her. whenever i go from looking at the professor to her from across the classroom (because i sit in the front) she catches me looking immediately 
• when i was speaking for my part of a group presentation, she was paying attention and smiling the entire time 
• she inserted herself into a conversation i’ve had with other people twice even though we don’t actually know each other
• one of the times that she got into the conversation was when i was going around asking if someone lost their eraser. she kept laughing even though nothing was really that funny 
• the first time we had an actual conversation, my friend kept trying to get in the middle of it but the girl seemed uninterested because all she would do is laugh a little then start talking to me again. the entire time she held very strong eye contact with me
• when i purposely stall after class to leave the classroom slower, she happens to also leave slower too. yesterday she was just sitting there on her phone up until i passed her seat then she got up to exit the classroom. she always ends up right behind me when exiting or a couple people behind 
• i was once standing diagonally in front of her in an elevator. when i turned around she continued to look straight ahead as if she didn’t notice the movement when i’m pretty sure most people would’ve noticed 
• she once tweeted about a cute asian guy who doesn’t have social media. i’m asian and don’t have social media 
• we’ve made eye contact probably over 20 times in just about two months 

does it sound like she might be interested too or am i just reading into things?

381,"I'm not really sure how to handle my current situation anymore. There is so much emotion and anger and disappointment at once. I have two best friends, we've been together for over 15 years. Ken, I'm upset with. Ken seems to be the friend that wants to be around me every day and talk to me every day. That is, until he has a girlfriend. On more than one occasion now, every time he gets a girlfriend he completely ghosts me. Disappears off the face of the earth. I try to make plans with him and he is pretty hit or miss with it. If I want to do anything with him I have to plan way in advance and it's still only a maybe. When I do reach out to him just to be his friend, you know like ask him something, or send him something, whatever. He typically responds with one word or no response at all. It's been a couple weeks since I've said anything to him and he shows no interest in reaching out and being my friend. When I do go do stuff on my own with different people, because my close friends apparently want nothing to do with me anymore, he will be bitter and salty that I didn't invite him to it. For example, I invited both of my friends to a concert back in June. Then they started acting the way they are and changed once they all got girlfriends. I gave up on trying to make plans with them and found people that actually wanted to go and hang out with me. Well, Ken was very salty and is giving me the cold shoulder because I didn't invite him. In my mind's eye, this is a shitty friend.

Then we have Mark. I am fucking pissed at Mark. Mark was literally my closest friend for my whole life, up until now that is. He briefly lived in a different city than I did. We didn't really see each other much because the distance was far enough away to be an issue but close enough that we could see each other same day if we wanted. I later find out he has a girlfriend. Ok fine that's cool man. Then I find out this girl he met on Tinder. Ok... I see less and less of him. I get it. Girlfriends. But then he hits me up and says he hates living in the city he's at and asks if he can move in with me. Absolutely no problem dude. Well, now I learn that this supposed ""girlfriend"" lived in a different city than any of us. She lived two hours away from the city he was in. He moved in with me and she became an hour away now. Remember that. Now for someone who considers to me to be his best friend, I didn't hear about this girl or really see her at all. I've met her less than five times. May I remind you this is the best friend I've had for about 17 years. As Mark has been living with me, he gets a job. But this is when it starts going all to shit. He then enrolls in school. Great! Move forward with life! We have a university in our city. Literally an 8 minute drive from where we live. Oh wait, he picked the school in the city his girlfriend lives in. Kinda seems extremely counter intuitive. Additionally, after I got to talk to him about his career, he literally changed everything about what he was going to do. Which can be expected when going to school. But wait there's more! He is pursuing a career based on his girlfriend's choices for him. So to sum it up real quick, he moved in with me and got a job, only to commute to school an hour away and then study a field his girlfriend picked so they can work together. He then cut back his hours to about 25 hours a week. And only ever comes home when he has to work the next day, that's if he doesn't call in. Now weeks are starting to pass without me ever seeing my best friend, I get we are busy but at one point I tell my friends how I miss having them around. This is the responses I got:

Ken: ""Dude if you're so lonely why don't you just go to a church and meet people?""

Mark: ""I'm sorry man. I'll for sure be around more.""

Ken's response is shitty in its own right. Mark turned out to be a liar. I stop trying to reach out to them completely now. No phone calls, no texts, nothing. I recently found out from someone who knows someone who knows Mark that he proposed to his girlfriend. I found out a week after it happened. He didn't say anything to me. Another week has gone by and still nothing. Not even a text. Now to come in for the finale, my dog was curious and went and kicked on Mark's door. It wasn't latched all the way so the door creaked open. This is when I realized that Mark was waiting for times I wasn't home and moving stuff out one by one, without telling me. What the fuck? What kind of shitty ass friend is this? Now I don't know if these two really are some of the shittiest friends I've ever had, or if I'm too caught up in it to see the big picture. The one thing I do know is it's incredibly heartbreaking. I really want to write them off for good. In a great big fuck you to them. Their behavior has demonstrated that I mean fucking nothing to them. They were always family to me. I always told them they were my brothers. I guess that meant fuck all to them. So please, any advice would be great. I'm just really hurt and angry from it. Thanks.",03Nov2018,1
383,"So this something I probably should've taken care of a long time ago but something I definitely need to take care of now. I posted over on r/insurance but didn't get any solid solutions so I thought I'd try here. Long story short I wrecked my car a few months ago and my insurance company won't cover this damage (front bumper ripped off, hood slightly pushed up, possibly bent frame). I got estimated at $6500 at the lowest, probably more once work has begun on the car. That would probably take me saving every extra penny I have between now and next summer to save, and I'd really like to have a solution before the winter weather gets here (it's currently drivable but there's a big metal piece that's rubbing on the right passenger tire when I turn, I only drive it when absolutely necessary; honestly worried I'm one sharp turn away from popping the tire while driving). Plus I'll need fluid replacements soon. I still owe a good amount on it (probably around $8k) and I am just lost on what to do about it, so I'm listening to suggestions from anyone and anything! Sell it and get what little I can to put towards a new car? Try to find someone to fix it part by part? Any type of loans I'd be able to get to get it fixed?",03Nov2018,1
384,"Some backgrounds context :
I am in year 11 in England and am 16M. This year has been a huge change for me and one for the better, I have completely changed my attitude towards school. Before I wasn't to the minimal required and get decent grades but this year I have been pushing myself for the top grades and have been doing very well in my mocks. A big reason for this change is because one of my close friends (let's call him R) has also changed. We normally go to his house and revise and do homework for a few hours and then play games etc. But sometimes I feel like I spend too much time helping him instead of focusing on myself and when I try to do extension work he complains about the work I do being too hard. There is a significant difference in our target grades and I want to tell him I won't be able to revise with him  as much. I don't want to come off as dick and discourage him of focusing in school. How do I tell him that I won't have as much as time for him ?

385,"Hey friends, 21M here. I have a crush on a girl and I am really unsure what to do with it. Now before you say ""just do it"", here's my issue. I am in an organization at my college with her. I am on the executive board of said organization, so if she says no, I may be forcing both the other members of the executive board and the members of the organization into our awkwardness.

I am also running into the problem of trying to find a ""right time"" to ask her for coffee or food or something. I have some friends telling me to have some patience and get to know her in meetings more, but I have had times in the past where I have lost out on dating people because I waited too long to ask or say anything. I feel like this is the first time in a LONG time that I actually have confidence with a girl (we had a volunteering event last night, and when I made a joke she said ""I love you"". Obviously I know that is friendly, but still that gives you confidence you're doing SOMETHING right). 

So should I try and ask her here soon or should I try and wait and get to know her better? I am basically open to any and all suggestions. Thanks friends and have a great day!",03Nov2018,1
386,"Hi internet people!

It's my first time posting on this sub, sorry if I mess something up. This is a very broad question, so please bear with me.

I have many habits, all of us do. But I question myself everytime I'm indulged in one ( say listening to music ) and ask myself if it's in alignment with my long term goals. I think this is a good thing to do, but a part of me tell me to be very extreme about anything and everything ( it tells me to replace it with listening to audiobooks/podcasts or better yet, quit altogether). That part of me wants me to be indulged in things that only align to my goals (programming in general). It wants me to be a monk with programming skills, basically. This happens all the time and now I feel like I don't know who I am or who I want to be. I don't think it's fair to be treating that mindset as a completely different entity than myself, but I really needed to get this out of my system. Any and all advice is appreciated! Thanks!

388,"I have been working at a retail store for a few years and this happens constantly with my coworkers. It's a small business so literally only 2 people work at a time, and it's really awkward to not talk at all.

I'm not an outgoing person but I always manage to be friendly and talkative to avoid awkward silence. I'm on good terms with all my coworkers and we even talk about our personal lives.

Here is what I noticed though, I'm typically the one who works before any of my coworkers show up, I will mention one of me female coworkers as an example, she typically comes in and doesn't greet me at all or even looks at me, it's a very small store with one cash register, so honestly I hate that habit of her, but I ignore it. She literally comes in and starts working in the store without acknowledging me. And she stays the same way until I start taking, once I do she starts talking normally. But if I didn't I feel like she pretends that I'm not even there.

Other than that, we talk on a personal level, she's also a very outgoing person so I know she's not shy at all to start talking to me. 

I come from a very social culture and we consider it extremely rude when someone you know or you work with doesn't greet you when they come in, but I've been living in the US for over 10 years and I got used to people not greeting and all that, but I find it really odd that this girl would never talk to me at all until I do.

391,"I’m a person with pretty low confidence and self worth. I struggle a lot with depression and loving myself. I often feel like a screw-up that just ruins things. I’m really trying to work on this, but am struggling.

One of the toughest hurdles for me to overcome is accepting kindness from others. Since my confidence is low, I don’t feel worthy of people being nice to me or doing things for me. I feel like I’m a waste of resources. When someone is kind to me, I’ll thank them profusely in the moment, but I just feel like garbage afterwards. I’ll try to avoid future contact with them because I’m so embarrassed and don’t want them to waste anymore energy on me. It’s, obviously, not a good life strategy. This leads me to dash potential friendships before they start, and the other person to feel under appreciated or used.

My birthday is coming up in a few days and it’s always a tough day for me. People are giving me things and congratulating me, but I don’t feel like I deserve any of it. I know that this isn’t a problem that can be fixed in a few days. I guess I’m looking for strategies to help me get through the day without hating myself. Any mantras I can repeat to myself to help me feel like I’m worthy of love and kindness, or coping mechanisms would be very appreciated.

399,"Personality:

PROS:
Honest
Pure of heart
Sensitive (perhaps too much)
Sweet
Loyal - never have to worry about cheating
Patient
Passionate
Smart
good with children
Respectful of women
Open minded
Persistent -would never stop fighting for me
dependable
Doesn’t mind that I never want a dog
Sex - i have painful intercourse and he is patient and gentle with me
Supports my aspirations

CONS
Clingy
Bad at socializing
Doesn’t give me enough alone time
Very jealous

In terms of how dating him could affect my lifestyle:

Well it’s important to note that I recently got separated. It’s only been 9 months. I used to really desire a man like him, but since my separation I have kind of enjoyed the freedom and alone time. Me and this guy dated for a few months but I wanted to break up with him because I dnt feel like I’m ready. also he would have to live with me if we continue to date because right now he is living 4 hours away back in his hometown. So that’s a big deal too.

PROS: 
-would never be lonely/ always have someone to hangout with
-cuddle buddy at night
-could settle down someday and have kids when we are ready


CONS:
-I like my alone time and feel that it would be majorly invaded. 
-I feel like I wouldn’t be allowed to really interact with other men at all
-would be hard to go out by myself and socialize
-he’s really awkward.. and I’m really awkward but I’m good at masking it. Whenever I have taken him to social gatherings he says weird shit and I have to say something to make things less awkward constantly. I dnt like feeling like this persons personality is an extension of mine ya know?

He has so many wonderful qualities, but he has a small handful of negative qualities that may seriously alter my life style and I don’t know what to do about it. 

My life just got stirred up because of my separation and I’m not sure if I’m ready to settle down and have restrictions on me. I dnt know if I’m ready to put up with a jealous guy.
But he’s so fucking sweet.

Is he my soulmate? We have a lot in common. I love that he’s old fashioned and he truly only has eyes for me. Which I feel is very rare. I have no idea why he finds me so beautiful. 

I want to explore the world and meet lots of people in my life time. I feel like a guy like him may not be able to handle it. 

But at the same time
I have some issues like the sex thing and not wanting a dog,
And I feel like most men might not want to put up with me. Maybe I will end up finding no one better and regretting not settling down with him. 
Also traveling the world as a single women could be very difficult and dangerous.

I think that’s everything,,

So I guess the bottom line is that he is so sweet and the perfect boyfriend in the aspects of caring for me, but in terms of my aspirations and desires he may be an anchor. Sometimes I feel like if it’s not a no brainer than maybe I don’t deserve him..

I’m really into justice and civil rights
And sometimes I think I could find someone equally passionate about what I’m passionate about. But maybe he won’t be as sweet and kind as this guy. 

Sorry for rambling. 
Any advice..?

405,"A few months ago, my old neighbor (19M) had keys to my house, and while I was on vacation with my family, placed cameras to spy on me inside with the help of his friend and acquaintance of mine, also 19. My best friend, who is 16 like I am, found out about this and instead of telling me straight away, he went along with it and received several nudes images of me they had gotten from their cameras from a few months back. I feel extremely betrayed, angry, and violated by all three of them but especially my “best friend”.  They had asked him for weeks if he wanted to see the images and he had always said no, but he gave in and then even asked for more. I was lucky I found out when I did, for the three of them were planning to break into my new apartment when my family wasn’t home and place in new cameras. I found out through my neighbor’s ex and immediately called the police, who caught my neighbor and his friend in the act of placing the new cameras, and arrested them both. The problem now is what to do about my “best friend”. He takes responsibility for what he’s done, but says he feels the older two boys persuaded him into it and used him to get what they wanted, which was my new address. I don’t want to press charges against him, but I’m not sure what to do. He was just as much a part of it as they were, despite telling them putting in cameras again was wrong, but still he did not tell me. He’s always been such a good guy to me, always respectful, and this came out of nowhere. I’m at a loss of what to do. I love him, and I even had feelings for him, but he’s not who I thought he was. What should I do? He said he’s confident he can prove himself to me and all he needs is another chance to show that he doesn’t see me in that way. Am I stupid for giving him another chance? 

TL;DR Best friend (16M) gave in to being sent nude images of me (16F) taken unbeknownst to me by my old neighbor (19M) and his friend (19M) and even proceeded to join them in trying to get more of me. The two older boys have since been arrested, and I don’t know whether to press charges against best friend or not. ",03Nov2018,1

So I have a friend and she has ridiculously high standards. Thing is she's nothing special (sounds mean but I'm honest). She's below average. Thing is she wants to date a 10/10 hot guy who will tend to her every need but she has nothing to offer.  
 
She has had one guy interested in her in her whole high school career and yehhhh, she complains he's not good enough.

Guy 1 - she met two years ago and he is very clingy (and jealous) and gives her all the attention she wants. She complains that they have nothing in common and that he's physically unattractive and broke up with him because he didn't dress nicely. This guy treats her like a princess though, he was too good for her tbh.

Then there's another guy she started speaking to when she broke up with guy 1.

Guy 2 - she's been talking to for a month over text but they haven't even met up. He's very good-looking and they have things in common. She complains that he has ""issues"" and doesn't give the same attention as guy 1. This guy hasn't expressed interest in her directly though, I think it's all just in her head.

She keeps complaining that she can't choose and that neither one is good enough. I told her to rather start focussing on self improvement until uni starts so she can meet new guys who ""meet her standards"". (she probs won't but eh) She didn't like my idea lol.

She has typical signs of ""princess complex"". She's highly materialistic, doesn't have financial responsibility (rich parents), said she's gonna be a stripper, has expressed interest in getting a sugar daddy, thinks she's God gift to men and etc...

She also doesn't like kissing and affection so I'm not the sure the Sugar Daddy thing would work out...

I wanna lowkey call her out on her bullshit and try make her more realistic about dating for her own sake.

408,"I’ve been contemplating posting this cause I know I could possibly fix it myself, and I usually am able to approach these kind of problems without any issue, but every time I try, or even think about it, I get crippling anxiety.

I grew up in Texas the first twelve years of my life. I had a few friends I hung out with regularly, but none like these two girls. Let’s call them Emilia and Sophia. We spent every waking hour together, went through a lot of phases together. We were all artists, so we would walk to the local diner, buy a giant basket of fries, and just draw until they had to kick us out for closing. The first three anime conventions I ever went to, I went with them. We were in the Girlscouts together. I would spend an entire week sleeping at Sophia’s house with her four cats, despite my severe cat allergy. We watched hours worth of YouTube poops and Pewdiepie and anime together. I used to just sit and watch Sophia play Sims and Crash Bandicoot. They were my shelter from my emotionally abusive family. They WERE my family. They were my people.

I eventually moved across the country, to New Jersey. The first few months, our friendships stayed strong. I spent more time with Sophia because she was available more often on the weekends that I flew back. We would stay in my empty house, living our best lives cause the only person to look over us was my 20 year old brother who didn’t give a shit as long as we didn’t cause trouble. After a while, I lost contact with Emilia first and then Sophia not long after.

Life had hit all of us like a train. High school and college became huge worries for us, so, although their bond with each other grew stronger, their bond with me fizzled out pretty quickly. I stopped drawing and got into dancing. I started having sex and dating and applying for college. They eventually slipped my mind as I’m sure I slipped theirs.

My senior year of high school, I found out Sophia had a snapchat because her number was still in my contacts. I had seen on Facebook that she actually moved to NYC for college. I was excited to rekindle what we had since she lived so much closer, and messaged her as soon as I found out. The conversation was bland, and it was obvious that she was either angry with me or had just moved on from our friendship and didn’t feel it was important to keep it going. I would still keep up with her in the background, watching her stories and making sure she was okay.

I’m now sophomore in college. Recently, Instagram recommended to me Sophia’s art page. I read her bio and it turned out that she had a girlfriend now! I was so happy for her, and clicked the username it linked to. It was Emilia. I was so happy for them, that they found love in each other despite living so far from each other. It also hurt, a lot. I ended up crying hysterically for hours, trying to cut myself (and failing), and pulling out my hair. The only thing that snapped me out of it was the news that my friend had gotten in a car crash, with my dog in the car (they’re both fine, btw! just a minor fender bender). 

I don’t know why that was so devastating for me. I’m sure that they’re angry or upset with me for leaving them behind. I know it’s not fair to me, but I also know that I would be just as upset if I was them. I still have Sophia’s number. I want to text her, but I’m afraid of the response. Every few days, I’ll pull up her contact, write up a text, and then delete it. Sometime’s I’ll just stare at her name in my phone. I followed both their Instagrams, and haven’t received a follow back. I’ll like and comment on their art, and my comments are the only ones that don’t get a response. I know the answer is to man up or move on, but I’m not sure how I will be able to handle the news that they’re definitely gone from my life. I can’t stay in this limbo forever, either. I’m not sure what to do.

409,"Hi all,


So first off I'll give you some information on my living situation. 


I live with my mom, dad and grandma(mom's mother). My parents took my grandma in before I was even born (I'm 20) because her husband had died and she didn't like living alone.


For a few years now my grandma and my dad have had some issues with each other. My dad doesn't show a lot of respect to my grandma even though she tries to be as less of a bother to him as possible. She cooks our meals and does the laundry, has her own room and takes care of herself. She can drive perfectly fine and does exercise regularly(Shes 80). 


Today everyone was sitting together chatting and my dad acts like my grandma literally is a lifeless object. She gets sad and decides to leave for a while. In which my dad basically says ""oh what is it this time"" sarcastically. I get seriously pissed off and yell at him which caused him to walk away in anger and my mom to start crying.


This evening my grandma walked up to me saying she wont be home till late tomorrow because she doesn't feel welcome and she might go and look for a new place to stay.


I really do NOT want that to happen. If she ends up moving out I'm going with her cause I definitely do not want her to be alone.


It isn't really common in my family to talk about feelings so getting my grandma and dad to sit down and talk is gonna be REALLY difficult.


My mom loves both her husband and her mom so she doesn't take sides. Talking to her about this will probably just make her really sad.


I really don't know what to do anymore. I feel like my decision will either make or break this family.


tldr; Grandma has been living with us for years but my dad isn't making her feel welcome lately.

My parents aren't divorced. Professional, good people. Basically, I have no messed up backstory of any kind to justify this. 

I'm barely clinging on in school. I have a 2.1 GPA. I rarely go to class because I just fucking can't some days. On classes where there's no attendance policy I do ok. I have always been bad at school, but never with a GPA this bad. My ACT got me into college. 

My family doesn't know I'm struggling. My mom went to a prestigious university and my dad grew up relatively poor. They say to come to them when I'm struggling academocally, but they are very uptight people and don't understand how their smart son could he struggling like this. 

The GPA hasn't really been a problem until now that I'm getting closer to graduation. I used to be way more outgoing-making connections. I actually had decently high political connections for a college student. But I feel like I can't even interact with people normally anymore. 

The only thing that makes me happy is making music. Which sounds like something that a burn out would say, or at least it would to my parents. When I don't go to class I write and record songs literally all day. Idk how this factors in but its my life right now. 

I wish I could live in a vacuum with my bare minimum needs met, and just record songs for a living. I have talent for songwriting but my production isn t good enough to be pro. 

Basically, I'm under an immense amount of pressure. For everyone out there who paid for their own college, you probably hate me reading about this. 

It sounds incredibly spoiled. But if I depressedly piss away an $80000 college fund it will be the biggest disappointment of my parents' lives. And for me, with everything that they and the rest of my family, that is absolutely intolerable. But I can't stop the spiral.

417,"I grew up without a father and never really questioned it until I was a teenager. My mum has been a single mother to me my entire life, so I didn't know any different and it just felt completely normal to me. However, I still asked my mother why I didn't have a dad, and she told me how she was seeing my father for a very brief period of time, about 5 years after she divorced her previous husband who she'd had 3 children with. She knew that he was married but he told her their marriage had fallen apart. However, shortly into their relationship, she received a call from him saying that his current wife was pregnant and that he wanted to make another go of things with her. My mother was understandably shocked as she had been led to believe that they were separated and going through a divorce. So they mutually agreed to end things with one another and stopped seeing eachother. However, weeks later my mother also found out she was pregnant (with me). She told him and they were both shocked, but she decided to keep me and told him that she didn't expect anything from him and that she would bring me up on her own, as all my mother ever wanted was for him to carry on with his family and to spare his pregnant wife any pain. I believe he offered her support for me, but she refused it, and they never saw eachother ever again.
I've been aware of this situation from a young age, but I also understood the consequences of a revelation like this, and I too didn't want my existence to cause anyone any pain or to impact on anyone's life, so I've always just kept it to myself. Although I came from a small town, I have never actually seen or bumped into my dad in the flesh, I have only ever seen photographs of him. However, his two daughters (my biological half sisters), being very close in age to me, I have bumped into on many occasions and we have many mutual friends in common. Over the years, so many people who knew us both would ask me if we were related and I simply had to play dumb. The only person I ever confided in was my ex boyfriend, who I thought I could trust with my life. However we split up last year, and it has now come to light that he has told my secret to his friends. The rumour got around the small town where I am from and just recently I received a message on social media from one of my biological half sisters (the one that was born two weeks after me), asking me if the rumour was true... this was my only chance, and I knew i had to be honest, so I replied telling her the truth. She was, understandably, in a complete state of shock... but in a positive way. She kept telling me how sorry she was and that she wished she'd known sooner. Soon after the other sister and the wife messaged me saying how sorry they were, and that they wanted to meet me and make it up to me. I was overwhelmed by how kind, compassionate, understanding and supportive they were being to me. It made me feel a complete mixture of emotions, but mainly ones of happiness, gratefulness and excitement. There was not much mention of my father, except that he was 'devastated' and that he would be in touch.  After a week of exchanging messages with my sisters, we met up in a coffee shop. I was so nervous and excited all at once. We talked about anything and everything for 4 whole hours!! I had such a lovely time, and I felt that we all got on really well which made me so happy and excited for what was to come. We talked a lot about our father... what he was like, his hobbies and interests, how he has been since the news had come out etc.  They said that he wanted to meet me and wanted to know if I felt the same. I explained to the girls that I really did, and although I was nervous about it, I was really excited to meet and get to know him. I also explained that I felt no anger or bitterness about the situation and about the fact that he's never been there for me. I understood his situation and I was just happy that now I could get that opportunity to know him and wanted to embrace it. We left with them telling me that they would tell him everything that I had said and let me know the next steps.  I messaged them later that evening thanking them for a lovely time and telling them that I hope their dad was feeling better about the situation now.. they replied saying that they would be in touch when they had decided on a day and time to meet up. It has been a whole week now and I have not heard a single thing from any of them.... Not a peep. It is driving me insane with anxiety, confusion and sadness. I just feel an immense sense of rejection.. but am I over thinking and overreacting?  I feel as though I got my hopes up too soon... And now I don't know what to do. ",03Nov2018,1
418,"That pretty much says it all. She lives in public housing and the condo she lives in has had an infestation. She found out about a week ago. She called my husband (her son) to talk to him about it. At some point during their conversation, he mentioned having a small family get-together. I don't know if he talked about the get-together before or after she told him about her bed bug infestation (I know, I know, I should ask him and that will probably help better determine a conclusion) but I feel that it would be rude to suddenly go back on the invitation regardless of if it was before or after he knew about the bed bugs.

I don't know what kind of suggestions or advice I'm looking for here but I'm kind of freaking out. I was considering having her put all of her belongings that she brings over when she visits in a plastic bag of some sort (rather than luggage or soft-sided day bags) but that's totally rude and I don't want to make her feel bad about it, it's not her fault. At the same time, I don't want to get bed bugs. I live in a condo building and it could easily spread quickly.

Ugh. I'm thinking of just not having the get-together at all. Maybe just postpone it since the holidays are coming up anyway. That might be the best course for me to take so no one's feelings are hurt. Any advice?",03Nov2018,1

My best friend, quiet popular with women.I think hes ok looking,women tho seem to open up quiet easily and hes been with many of them.Rarely shares anything about his personal life, but best friends nevertheless.Sometimes i see him accompany our female college lecturers, like some sort of friend after classes are over.Dont know if its a height thing, hes like.6.2, slim..friendly and kindoff not scared to approach them.

I,m usually the guy who hangs around with him, but when he starts talking with the girls, I get ignored.

More recently,I noticed hes quiet friendly with my sis.He asked her if she can see him as her own brother and she said, ok.I dint like that.Now its like she has two older brothers and it seems that she responds to his jokes, has fun in general and i get ignored.Also me and her had this disagreement, and he interjects and says..see man, why u scolding her, shes soo cute..(i,m thinking..who are u man?)..Am i being paranoid?",03Nov2018,1

I'm 21yrs old and might get kicked out if my grades aren't high enough. My parents believe I'm not studying enough despite going to school and the library until 8PM because they received my mid-term results. I'm in a repeat secondary school here in Ireland. The first time I got very little points (almost failed every subject)

Even though I'm studying, I still don't seem to be progressing. I'm wondering what to do. They've given me an ultimatum and that when the Christmas results come in December and are low, I'll have to find another place to live.

423,"First of all, I'm a first-timer here and don't really know if this is the right place to post this. If it's not, I'll gladly take it down and post somewhere else.

When classes started back in march, two new girls joined our class (let's call them B and M for short) Since I'm a pretty friendly guy, I got to know them instantly. B was a charismatic extrovert that loved partying while M was more of a quiet and shy girl. B and I went partying together lots of times, meanwhile, M enjoyed chatting on social media until late in the evening.

Both girls made another group of friends apart from me. This, of course, isn't a problem. The real problem started when M started befriending some shady characters. You know, the type of people that would win the ""most likely to shoot up the school"" award. (This isn't a problem in my country, btw). 

This on itself was kind of a red flag, but I dismissed it by thinking ""hey, maybe thede people aren't that bad and are actually really nice people"" (Spoiler alert: they weren't).
M started hanging out with one specifically bad person, let's call him J. J has had numerous problems with school authorities over the years, terrible school marks and problems at home. One would empathise with this poor fellow if it wasn't that he was as nasty as a person can be. I don't really know when or how, but M and J became best friends. Eventually, the problems started growing. He started insulting her and she never replied, always looking down, always being nice.

She told me everything that happened, all the fights, all the insults and how he would react violenlty when she hang around other people. I asked her why she kept being around him and she, kind of offended by the question replied that in her previous school she didn't have many friends and that she was used to being treated like that. I was shocked. I told her that it wasn't normal for someone to treat her like that, and that she should end that relationship before something happened. 

And something did happen. Some months ago she called me very nervous telling me how J had been touching her inappropiately. I calmed her down and told her that we should immediately talk to the principal and to her parents, but she said that it was a strict secret and that she would never forgive me for telling someone else about it. The details aren't the point, but he basically hugged her and when she told him to stop he grabbed her tighter, putting his hands on her butt. He then proceded to insult her and scream in her face that she never loved him and that his life is misery and pain and she never showed him any love. 

This was not the first time J was the victim of everything. One time M got mad and told him to fuck off. He made a scene (in the middle of the school!) Saying how the world hated him and that he would end his life of pure suffering and misery. She never confronted him again, because she hates being the centre of attention, and that time basically everyone showed up to see what was going on.

I really need some help on this. I'm watching a really close friend of mine being abused of her kindness and her incapabilty of confont by someone that she can't stop forgiving. She won't listen, but she also doesn't want me to look for someone who will make her listen. I am desperate for advice before it's too late and a tragedy occurs.

430,"This girl from school I’ve been talking to for a week seems to like me. When I first added her she sent me a snap late at night that said “hey”. I answered the next morning and me and her talked for two hours straight. She used a lot of emojis and kept asking me questions to keep it going. When I saw her in person the next day she got excited to see me and when I left her she turned around and said bye to me.

Thursday night, she talked to me for 4 hours straight. She kept asking me questions to keep the conversation going like “wyd”. Then I played guitar for her and she told me what songs to play and whatnot. I told her goodnight and she said “goodnight, sweet dreams and see you tomorrow! :)”

So I decided it was time to ask her out. I asked her today and she said “yeah! (Insert friend’s name) can come too! :)” So I’m pretty sure she’s interested in me and everyone I’ve asked said so too so I guess she’s just nervous about the first time? What do you think?",03Nov2018,1
431,"I woke up around 3 am and my vision was snowy, completely clear but snowy like I was looking through some sort of pixel filter that fluttered about.

I hate it so much, and it makes me scared to go to sleep now because I don’t know what it is or how to fix it. For example, I sit up in my bed and looked at the covers then got a sick terrified feeling and closed my eyes, and it felt like I was looking into some giant void.

I had told her repeatedly that this was extremely cruel of her, and it was unfair to both Nick and John. The only reason she’s doing this, I suspect, is because she’s bored and wants attention. I suspect she talks to Nick or visits him every time she and John have problems, which isn’t hard because it is a long distance relationship. I’ve told her that it’s bad karma and it makes her a bad person but apparently it didn’t go through to her.

Anyway, my friend, who I've known since my first year of high school seems to be giving me the cold shoulder, and I keep getting this feeling that he is angry or upset with me and I don't know why. 

We were in a group chat together for a few weeks with some other friends, and he was quite active. Earlier this week he started ranting about politics or something, because he is trans and is one of those people who keeps claiming the government is trying to erase him. It's a sore subject for him, I guess. 

Someone came in with their point of view, and a kind of casual conversation started about politics. I wasn't even involved. He got angry because they disagreed with him, and left the chat. I figured nobody else was going to ask, so I waited awhile and asked if he'd like to come back. 

He said no and that he couldn't stand to be in a server with somebody who openly defended Trump, and told me to go ""stick their own foot in their mouth,"" and to ""leave him the fuck alone."" So I did. 

Like four days later, I text him and ask if he wants to hang out soon. All he says is ""nah"" and I'm confused, but don't push. But I got this feeling he was upset for some reason, so I texted him again later and asked if we were still cool. He never responded. 

I know it seems stupid because it was online, but we haven't seen each other in a few weeks because he works night shifts, so this has been our only interaction. He has been known to cut people off for simply disagreeing with his views, or showing him facts that don't align with his beliefs. At one time, he even cut me off completely because I made a joke about liking gay anime, and that devolved into him posting insults about me online, and crossing lines you aren't supposed to cross. I forgave him, but, still.

I've had a difficult couple of years after realizing I was in a career I hated, going through a period of unemployment to figure things out and finally get myself back on track. I'm back at work in a full-time contract job in a field I really like, but what I can't get over is this deep sense of shame and embarrassment that has sort of consumed me.  

I'm in my early 30s and feel a lot of shame about not having my life ""perfectly worked out"" even though I would never have the urge to judge someone else like this, I definitely seem to judge myself. I talk to friends occasionally and seem them very occasionally but nothing feels natural anymore.  

I also have this perfectionistic mindset about communication that if I don't respond to non-urgent texts and emails immediately, I start to feel so overwhelmed and ashamed I've taken too long to respond (more than a couple hours) that I don't respond at all (which cognitively I know is \*crazy\*). Often I get home from a long day at work and I can't bring myself to do more than deal with the most urgent things and ignore all other personal emails and texts, but I think on some level I am hiding too. 

I feel so afraid to start talking to people again because I've been so avoidant and feel really badly for bot being very present, I don't know if I should apologize (I've been an over-apologizer forever) or what to say to people.

She used to stand by my locker and berate me for being too slow and since we attended the same after school program, she got pissed off that I didn't text her to walk with her to the after school class (it's on the same campus). It got to the point where I began to actively avoid her and act standoffish to her in the morning (we sit next to each other on the same bus). I know it's a really childish move to make, but once she started talking to another person when we got off the bus, I would speed up and walk to my locker/first period by myself. I'm not a morning person at all and she talked about the same things: her ""terrible"" grades and how ""difficult"" things were for her (hint: she's smart and she wants everyone to know). Plus, she'd fall asleep on my arm and I hate people touching me without my consent. 

She's never supported me or asked why I don't feel upbeat in the morning (I have been going through some rough times emotionally with all the high school stress) and she's also prone to talking down to or being unreservedly mean to other people, but she thinks it's okay because that's what friends do. I slipped up one day and called her ""toxic"", partially as a joke, and she took it to heart so much so that she confronted me in class the next day. But she's essentially done the same thing to me, over and over again, for the past few months? I apologized, but she's never apologized for the little barbs she's thrown my way. 

She's an only child and a BTS stan, to the point that she got genuinely angry that someone didn't get why Kpop was so popular. Everything about her just smacks of immaturity and entitlement. It's getting harder and harder to interact with someone like her everyday, but I'm afraid that I'm the pot calling the kettle black and I'm overreacting because of my various neuroses. Or because I'm a teenager and things are just ""like that"". How should I interact with her if I see her a lot on campus? It's tiring to pretend to be nice to someone I dislike. Also, am I overreacting? Sorry for the long post. 

tldr: a girl I became friends with over the summer turned out to be immature and annoying. Am I just overreacting, and what should I do going forward? ",03Nov2018,1
449,"so for the past several years, my brothers have been the judge and jury for if I hang out with my cousins. I'm 17, the oldest brother is 21 (ill call him the younger, even though he is older, because he is the youngest of my brothers.) and the oldest is 24. what will usually happen is that the oldest will say something inflammatory, one of the most extreme examples is, ""I don't understand why you're here."". and if I defend myself the younger  brother will start getting mad at me for being the inflammatory one. I have given up haven relations with good steady relations with the older one altogether. but I want to keep relation with the younger one and my cousins. thing is the younger one doesn't really want to talk about these problems. but I was hoping that I could at least stay with my cousins. the problem is whenever I defend my self from my oldest brother both of them will start threatening me with getting the parents involved and kicking me out of hanging out with anyone there. my plan was to get one of the cousins on my side in private, tell them my situation so they can help defend me and talk like an equal and not someone who has to satisfy them or else they will be kicked out. will that work, if not what can I do, is there any way I can convince the younger brother to talk to me about this.",03Nov2018,1
450,"tl;dr I stopped a hobby years ago because of stress but took up another recently, became depressed now I can’t find anything to keep me busy. I don’t know what to do. 

I started cosplay about 7 years ago, I stopped 2 years ago because I lost sight of why I was doing it. There was a heap of drama and I just couldn’t handle it anymore. I stopped, and it’s like I stopped existing to the whole community. People I’d know for years barely spoke to me, I was in a car accident last year and someone I considered one of my closest friends from said community didn’t even contact me to see if I was okay. I guess that was the wake up call I needed to realize I just wasn’t in their lives anymore, that maybe the friendship stopped having meaning when they couldn’t get anything from me. 

For about a year I didn’t do anything - the accident made anything really difficult for a long time but I took up playing WoW a few months back to get my mind focused on something. It went fine for a while but last month I decided to stop playing, things weren’t going too well in the guild I was a part of and because of illness and a new job, I decided to prioritize my work and health but since then I haven’t been able to stick to anything. I’ve tried playing puzzle games (Ori), farming (Stardew and Portia), moba (HotS) and other mmo (gw2, maplestory2) but honestly nothing keeps my attention. I get bored, distracted, agitated. 

I know this feeling is just a sprinkle of depression, I can handle it most of the time but lately it’s becoming harder to not just lay in bed and read shit on Reddit for hours on end. I don’t really have other hobbies, I’m not into fitness at all especially with my leg injury from the accident. I lost a lot of things, I lost friends, fulfillment and pride (from making things for cosplay) and self esteem. I’m almost sure it’s the root cause of this wave of depression. I know it’ll pass though. 

I guess I just want to vent to some extent but if there are any game suggestions or, for the non gamers, just normal life advice. I’m sure you can find enough info on my profile if you look around but to simplify it I’m a 26 year old woman, I live in South Africa. I have a dog, a freshwater aquarium and a boyfriend (who I live with). I’m also not getting any medical treatment for the depression because my job isn’t reliable enough to start signing up for monthly things I might not be able to afford, just before anyone suggests it. I have considered counseling in the future though. 

Last note, I’m on mobile so if this hurts anyone’s eyes, I’m sorry. It was really hard to keep it short and sweet. ",03Nov2018,1

- I'm highly self conscious and take criticism VERY poorly; it hurts and spikes my anxiety
- I'm highly inhibited around people I don't know too well 
- I am ridiculously poor at articulating my thoughts into coherent sentences
- Whenever I speak, it's not engaging at all and I see people lose interest in what I say within seconds (i.e. eye contact goes away and they focus on other things)
- People often cut me off when I speak because I'll have intermittent gaps (this relates to my trouble with articulating thoughts into speech)

457,"So this happend to me and I firstly want to know if this makes me a neckbeard, nice guy or incel. Its basically about me trying to get desperatly in a relationship with a girl. On the surface it sounds kinde stupid so I beg you to read this  through. Its a long story. 

So... I got friendzoned the first time in my life and it struck me like nothing before (I was 16). I never attempt to get in a relationship for shits and giggles and am very carefull with girls in general. I am also shy as fuck. So I got into a pretty depressed state of life and didnt talk with anyone about this. I have a friendgroup consistend of 8 guys and me. They go to partys and other stuff (important for later). I dont party that much because I dont drink and I am shy (still more towards girls but I have confidence issues in generall). So im only gaming with them and sometimes we have LANs. I never talk with anyone about my personal stuff, so this went on for about 5 monthes with me getting more depressed. Eventually we met a girl from the same country and get her on our discord, get her insta and her snapchat. She becomes a consistent part of the group but sticks to gaming like I do. We quickly got very close and I told her about my feelings and also about my now generall opinion of all that. We got shipped very much by the group because eventhough they didnt knew I got friendzoned before, they still know Im miserable piece of shit, so I told her I dont want to experience anything like that. She eventually wanted to meet up with me to wich I gave an OK. I didnt love her at that point but she was my best friend wich is kinda sad considering I only knew her for 3 monthes at that point. 

So I managed to get my parents to drive me to her place. It matched perfectly because my parent wanted to go for vacation in a different city and her town was near the city. She told me to stay over for the whole weekend. This was very overwhelming for me as you could imagine. So I got there and saw her for the first time irl. She was so much cuter than in her pics: brunette,big hazel eyes (which i possibly will never forget) and a slim build. She was for me personally the 10/10 I could have dreamed for. Im not a tits or ass man (eventhough she has a nice ass) but I like small boobs and she would talk about her being unhappy with her sexual-outward-apperance. But that asside my got to is full hair and big eyes. That sounds clichee but I fucking love that. Next to her was her father. He , I think still, works for the police. I gave him my most proud handshake ever and he was impressed by only that. He thought I was a full soyboy- Im not, I have a russo-german heritage. Im not that large with 1.75m/ about 5'7'' but I have  broad  shoulders and a pretty athletic apperance ( I was told so by many people). So we drove to her place form where we met and had I had some discussions with her father. I love that man. So get to her place and she shows me her room. She lived at the attic. It was cleaned up and we talked about how awsome it had to be there while rain pours on the roof. I also noticed a waifu. A FUCKING WAIFU. I knew she was into anime but not that much. The first of three nights we played a little overwatch (never played it in my live) and rb6. And eventually at night we did what we would normally do and watch youtube videos together and even anime. I never watched anime before apart from Naruto and Onepiece. We watched zombie highschool, I think ( to sum it up: its basically 50%tiddies, 30%zombies and 20% guns). we watched the whole season at that night and at one point (a sad part, I have no idea when) she would lay her had on my shoulders. I did the only logical thing and wraped my arm around her and cuddled her more to me. Keep in mind: I never was that close to a girl both phyiscal and mental AND I fucking started to fall in love with her. So we continued watching in that stance and even hold hands. Im a kissless virgin so that must sound pathetic. I went through her hair and she smelled so good. I cant discribe it, but it was like heaven. Eventually we both get to sleep as she nearly fall asleep in my arms. That night was everything I have ever dreamed about in my life. I have never been so happy ever. The second day we went to the movies and watched jumanji. It was so shit wtf. We went afterwords to a cafe next to the cinema and talked about how shit it was. Got pretty romantic. I wanted to pay and for her and the pizza we ordered before. She insisted, that she pay so we bove held up a 20€ note to the waitress. She took her money. fuck. Went back to her place cuddled again and watched anime  and other stuff. I had the oppertunity to kiss her the whole time but I was surprised that she took my hand and even started to cuddle and I didnt know how to react because I didnt went to her with any romantic feelings. We watched a hentai while in her bed which could be the dream porn setting for a weeb. I didnt want to fuck her at that point still. I enjoyed the first time cuddling way more. The third day we told us goodbye hugged and I my parents picked me up. She didnt lean in for kiss as her father was watching. 

So we got closer and we wanted to figure out when we could meet again. But we both have school and she lives about 250 km from me. I made her a surprise present for her birthday to which she said I was the only present she needs. We told us that we love eachother everytime we would talk or text. Now the bad part beginns. She met another guy. That guy basically stuck to her from the moment he met her ( we werent offically a couple, because I figured I first have to have a second date with her). That fucker hated me from the moment we met. She has a problem with people leaving her. He took full advantage of that and cut me off, while seperatly she started talking shit about our first date. I didnt knew that at that point. To be more specific she told her friends how I was creep and took her hand while she played and called it cuddling. We got a date sorted and 2 days before meeting she friendzones me. She undoes that because she realised how stupid it was and we figuerd we should try. My guess was that her previous boyfriend, who cheated on her, left a trust issue on her. So we got a new date fixed. In that time that other fucker meet with her and from what ive heared way way afterwards basically fucked her. At some point she starts to have problems between choosing me or her other friends. She choose me. We meet again for three days. first day was like the very first day but I tried to get her with her friends together ( basically that fucker and her bestfriend). We went next day to the cinema with some other friends of her. One stayed over for the night and because of spaceing problems he slept with her in her bed. I tried to not think much of it. He left the next day and I stayed longer and asked why the fuck she didnt tell me about this. I didnt get a clear answere. We played justdance and mario cart cuddled a bit and her father drove me to the trainstation with her. Again we talked a bit and her father was confinced I would come a thrid time to play chess with him as I promised  him before.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime she got together with her best friend( also female btw) and the fucker and they planed a complot against me. She broke every contact with me everywhere. My friends nearly broke every contact with me too, because she told them the lie. I explained it, they dont give a shit .I desperatly tried to get this figuerd out and talk with her. Didnt work. Blocked. I tried to talk to the fucker and we got friend eventually and he told me how he was sorry for what he did. He still didnt tell me, that he fucked her. He tried to keep me informed about everything. This took a place during 6 months btw. I then heard that she will meet with him again and that basically broke his cover. i got to know everything. I didnt even bother to call him out on anything further. They got together as far as Im concerned now. I want to make my life from here but Im to much of an pussy to pull the trigger. My grades got down to new low so I struggled to make the year in school. I didnt make it and have to redo the whole year wich means that ive lost every person I got to know over 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I will probably join the millitary in about 6 monthes. I havent talked to anyone about it, no one knows not even my parents. Ill try to get killed in war. That way I wont see it coming. Did I behave right? Is this the way to go?

461,"This was initially a rambley text post but I've shortened it into a list of points.

* My housemate slams the toilet seat VERY loudly, it wakes me up in the night, scares the crap out of me. It's VERY, VERY loud. I can't emphasise how much of a nuisance this is. 
* I don't know whether to: talk to him (don't want to create bad atmosphere), ask landlord to install soft close toilet seat (he wouldn't do it - has a history of claiming he's going to do DIY house stuff then puts it off), fit something to toilet myself to make it soft close (how could I do this cheaply and non-destructively??), wear earplugs 24/7 (would rather not...)
* I could ask the landlord if I could go about my own way in installing a soft close toilet seat, so I knew it would get done - is this difficult to do?? 

Ideally, I'd rather just talk to my housemate, but it seems so nit-picky and I don't want to be \*that\* housemate. How do you even approach someone with this sort of weird issue? Am I being nit-picky?

462,"So I am currently working an office job. The pay is ok, definitely not where I want to stay at. But it’s getting me along. The work is easy, not challenging. That can be a positive or a negative depending on how you look at it. I don’t really envision myself doing this type of work forever. 


I don’t envision myself working any type of “job” for the rest of my life. I don’t envision myself waking up at x time every day, getting off of work at x time every day, Having set “shifts” I have to work, being probed and tested for drugs by employers, and having my entire life being centered around some company I don’t care about. 


I really enjoy makeup. I like doing other people’s as well as my own. I don’t really envision myself becoming an influencer or famous. If that happened that would be nice, I guess. But definitely not seen as possible or within my reach, especially in the near future. The influencer scene is too over saturated to allow new people to come up and make a name for themselves. My boyfriend (is bi) and also does makeup, and is good at it. We have had thoughts of maybe starting a company of sorts revolving around makeup but are not sure the best avenue to go. Getting started as a working MUA takes an investment of money that we just don’t have. You have to buy tools and products. It would require working 2 Jobs, the day job and doing makeup on the side) to get started. I already work full time 10 hrs a day and simply don’t have time. 


We were thinking originally of having a salon/studio. Where people could come get their hair, makeup, and nails done in the same place. Hair salons around here don’t have good makeup artists, and none have nail techs that work in the salon. We want it to be more of a relaxed chill environment with music and really friendly staff. Snacks and drinks available, wine for the older clients;) so people can kick back and have their makeup hair and nails done and enjoy it. We want it to be a relaxing experience. I really believe I would love to do this. I would love to own my own place, where I dictate the rules, I enjoy the clients and the atmosphere, and I am not hiding from anyone or answering to a manager. 


We just don’t know where to start. We would need to pick a nice area and make sure that it is attracting the type of clients we want. A more upscale area would attract people more likely to spend their money to get makeup and hair done, as well as do it even for a casual relaxing day or a “girls day” instead of just big events. We live 12 miles from the downtown area of Houston, so this is promising. Houston could be good.  We just wouldn’t know where in Houston, maybe Montrose? The heights? The galleria area? 


We also don’t know the cost of starting a business. Staffing? Rent? Utilities? Supplies/furniture? Ads? We have no idea. How do investors work? I read a little online but I’m still confused and unsure. What are the general necessities you will need to start a business? Ex: permits, licenses, etc. thanks for any help with this ",03Nov2018,1

I just found out yesterday that my partner is now preggers and it's a bit of a shock for us both.

We all get along really well and love one another, but now my partner is up the duff and the timing isn't the greatest.
Our problems are:
- We both aren't a fan of termination if there's no need for it.
- I feel it's too early in our relation to have a kid and we're only just starting to settle in loving together.
- Our families are going to chuck their 10 cents in if we decide to keep it and inform everyone then it's going to be more stress on us both that we dont need.
- I dont know if whatever we decide will affect or possibly break our relation and fear history will repeat itself as my parents busted up when I was 4 weeks old.

We have discuss previously that in time we would like a little one and both would be happy but when the time  was right and we have a lot of positives going for us which us in the direction to go for it.

476,"This is a brother asking how to best approach her sister so she can get some help. Let me say this is a long post but I would appreciate if you could read it and give me some advice. Thanks in advance, love you all

&amp;#x200B;

She is a 40 years old still living at my parents place. She used to work as kindergarden teacher but two years ago lost her job and has not been able to find a new one. She has no boyfriend (AFAIK she never did) or friends, no hobbies, no direction in life whatsoever, other than spending the day watching stupid TV films and shows. 

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't seem to be depressed, but her mood is far from happy. She is not a smart person at all and most likely has a very low IQ, but she does not come up as 'retarded' when you talk to her (although she might well be borderline on it). She finished school (then she struggled with two years of high school before quitting), but she completely lags behind in spoken and written understanding, logic reasoning, and verbal communication. She doesn't make too much sense when she speaks, what she says (even if it makes sense) does not usually match the cadence of her speech nor the context of the conversation, so it comes up as confusing, weird and stupid. When she was younger she did have some friends, and used to go out in the weekends as most of the teenagers of the time. I do not think she had a tough childhood or was bullied at school; nor she was a 'weirdo', I guess she just went through as a very shy, low profile girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my other two sisters have a relatively normal life and successful careers (two architects and one engineer), and one of them has children already. My parents are both well educated (they used to work as teachers, now retired). They treated all of us very well, and we never had anything missing, except more explicit love and caring demonstrations. My father's personality is the one I can see having the biggest influence on my sister behaviour. He suffers from anxiety and mild depression. He is weird, not very good at social interaction, clumsy and goes through life mindlessly.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, my parents and sisters have always tried to put some sense into her, but never succeeded. She always takes any advice defensively and closes up. She pretends to know everything, even is she clearly does not, and does not give up on her views, even if they do not make any sense and are proved wrong. Sometimes, when cornered, she would just act like a child, say that she does not care, get upset and declare the conversation finished, even if it means coming up as dumb or unreasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

We all kind of gave up on her long time ago. My parents both ignore the problem and accept the situation as it is. My father, in private, would acknowledge my point of view, but fails in taking any action. My mother, who I never spoke to this frankly, would not agree with me on the gravity of the situation. Although she is an intelligent person and inside her clearly realises of the problem, she has long decided to ignore it, and keeps playing the role of the overprotective mother. My sisters also keep playing the game of not doing anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, time is ticking and things are not going to get any better by themselves. What she will do when my parents are not here? What will she do when her mood keeps going downhill, when she puts on more even more weight, when she becomes old and start to get sick? No one of us is taking any action even we are aware of this inexorable destiny. I have decided to do something about it, or at least try.

&amp;#x200B;

I think she clearly needs to see a specialist, a psychologist and/or psychiatrist. She needs to get her shit together big time. She needs a complete overhaul of her life, but I am not naive, and I know things are not going to change dramatically for her, as she misses the intelligence required for these kind of feats. However, I would be happy if she just can make enough changes to enjoy the rest of her life as painless as possible.

The thing is that I do not know how to best approach the conversation with her. I do not want her to close up as soon as she sees I am getting into how she lives her life. I am thinking my best bet is to talk to my mother who is the one my sister does really listen to. However, I am not sure how my mother would take it either, as she most likely will default to not do anything about it.

What advice would you guys give me? What do you think is the best way to approach this situation?

477,"Hey guys, 

In a beer-fuelled discussion here about why the bottom half of my body- mostly legs and male region- is very hairy, but the upper half of my body isn’t. I have little to no chest hair, some hair on my neck and face, but nothing substantial, reasonable amount of armpit hair, but nothing much to speak of. 

Does anyone know why this is? I understand the hormone (?) provided to grow a beard is different to normal, but is the chest &amp; arm region different to the legs etc?

I’m mid-20s also, so I’d expect fully developed. 

Also, I’m totally fine with it, it isn’t a touchy subject- I’m just curious if anyone knows any scientific reasons behind it! 

Thanks :-) ",03Nov2018,1

479,"I have a food issue? By the title you can probably guess 'Oh I've heard this one before! Ha, ha, ha.' 

Yet I can't eat most foods, especially vegetables without gagging. Vomiting a few times. You have no idea how many occurrences I've had to make plans to dispose these pieces of shit. I've moved into a new house recently and we're forced to sit at the kitchen table which has never happened and it makes me very uncomfortable. I'm expected to eat them because of food groups or some shit. 

My diet on a weekly basis is, no breakfast, hardly any lunch and if I do it's probably fries and a Faygo. Dinner at my house is basically a fuck ton of vegetables, little meat and these shitty disgusting sidekicks thing which taste like cardboard ass. For snacks it's usually chips, popcorn, canned soup, tuna, and things like that. I don't eat a lot yet I'm somehow still at a healthy weight.

I love seafood and meaty foods. Sometimes I'll buy storebought kimchi bowls. For vegetables it's basically just potatoes and kale. I don't like any fruit but lemons. 

I wanna eat healthier, I don't ever eat what people tell me to and I don't care that much about getting punished for it.",03Nov2018,1
480,"Sorry for the ""in your face"" title. I just need advice. A couple weeks ago my girlfriend committed suicide and I found her after waking up in our apartment. She ended up getting cremated and I've refrained from talking to her family because I just felt guilty about not being there to help her, so I just found this out about 10 minutes ago. So I texted her mom and asked where the memorial is. She told me she had her cremated and has her ashes. This girl was the love of my life, seriously she was the most you could want in a girl. What I need to know is; is it unethical to ask her for some of the ashes for myself or what? I've never been to a funeral except hers. I have no clue how the cremation process works or what even the ash jars look like. I know I cant just dip something in her ashes and throw it in another jar. But I would really like to have some for myself.  How does this work? Is it even possible?",03Nov2018,1
