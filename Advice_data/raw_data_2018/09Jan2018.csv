0,"I am 27 years old. I never thought I would be doing drugs for this long.

When I was younger I felt like I would dabble and stop relatively soon... but I think I've been partying (weed, drinking, cocaine[stopped last year]) to cover up the anxiety and depression.

I was laid of 8 months ago due to company downsizing, I managed to keep my head up and find work 6 months into unemployment but I was fired during my 3 week trial period for reasons which really fucked me up.

I have been non stop drinking and smoking weed daily for the last 2 weeks now and I don't know if I'm going to be able to pull myself out of this one.

I got rid of all the weed paraphernalia and decided to quit the booze for now as well. Hopefully my mood improves.

This is the 3rd time in my life I have spiraled in the same exact way.

What the fuck is wrong with me and how can I fix this? It's ruined my self esteem and I'm worried I won't recover.",09Jan2018,2
1,"I (21f) am currently dating my first boyfriend ever. He (26m) is genuinely one of the kindest, gentlest people I've ever met. I am very very happy in our relationship, and even though I'm a total perfectionist, there is pretty much nothing I would change. That being said, I am currently worried about my boyfriend's mental state, and I'm not really sure what to do. Basically, he is very loving, he's always doing lovely things for me, and saying lovely things to me. When we met I was not at all confident about myself or the way I looked, and he's changed that dramatically. I always pay my way on our dates but, even though we've been together a year, I still have to insist. All this might sound amazing and, truly, I appreciate everything he does, but lately I've also been worried that he does these things because he feels he has to and he feels unworthy to be with me in some way. This is especially obvious on the rare occasions that we fight. Recently, for example, we were watching T.V and he snapped at me for chewing too loudly. I stood up in a huff and left the room, and he followed me and started crying. Then I started crying and saying that I was upset because he had made me feel disgusting for the way I chew. It was such a silly argument, and I was more than ready to forgive and forget, but then my bf started saying that he deserved to die for hurting me, and that he was a piece of shit, and all these other horrible things about himself. He was shaking and crying, and I had to hold him and rub his back and tell him I loved him, and forgave him repeatedly before he could even begin to calm down. He kept saying how 'fucked up' he is, and how he doesn't want it to effect me, even though I told him that I want nothing more than to help him, and that I'm completely content in our relationship. While it's obviously a good thing that my bf doesn't enjoy hurting my feelings, it also scares me that he's quite so terrified of hurting me. I mean, it seems inevitable in a relationship with 2 imperfect people we're going to hurt each other from time to time, and we need to be able to forgive each other and ourselves. If I had upset him in the same way, I'd feel guilty for sure, but I don't think I'd feel as if I deserved to die. My boyfriend is a wonderful, handsome, smart, kind man, and it horrifies me that he wouldn't realise that, or that he'd feel somehow inferior to me. I don't really know what to do. Does this sound like a serious problem or am I just completely overthinking? I've suggested to my bf to go to a doctor or therapist, but he was adamant that he won't, and I don't want to pressure him (he's also stubborn and I don't think it will work). Are there other ways I can support him? I don't know. I feel kind of scared, like he's given me way more power over his mental well being than I can handle. Ugh, please help.",09Jan2018,9
2,"My sister befriended a girl about three years younger than her (they're both teenagers) last summer, and it wasn't long before they were talking every day. This girl, we'll call her Ruby, has a few mental health disorders, and can get INCREDIBLY depressed. My sister was there for her during a few of her episodes, which served to solidify their 'bond'.

 At first I assumed everything was fine. They got along well and seemed to have a lot of fun. But as time went on, things started to get kind of weird. If my sister went somewhere without Ruby, Ruby would find out and get mad. If my sister didn't talk to her for a day, Ruby would spam her phone and ask why she didn't care anymore.

A few times, my sister asked her to calm down and talk through it, but this prompted Ruby to threaten suicide. I feel like it's getting worse, and I don't know what to do. From my perspective, Ruby is just a kid who I don't want to get hurt, but I also want to look out for my sister.

The most recent turn of events has Ruby acting like they're a couple. Now, my sister has a stable relationship with her boyfriend, and they plan on getting married. When she told Ruby this, the response she got was 'Have you even considered what /I/ might want in the future?'
And... yikes. I just don't know what I can do.

3,"To begin, I go to a community college and I am pursuing my major in computer science. I was suddenly dropped from my already enrolled and paid computer science class today because the college failed to recognize how many seats were available in the class. Because of the construction of new classrooms for the STEM department are taking place. Classes space went from 40 - 30 seats and out of 10 that was dropped, I was included. I really need this class if I'm going to get out of community college in 3 years and was wondering what I should do for help. I am also taking 18 credits as of this semester and had straight A's last semester just so you know that I don't fuck around in school.

Here are my options.

1. I can ""sit-in"" the class and wait until someone drops out of the class. (But should I Email the professor asap and ask him to know that I want to ""sit-in"" or wait for OR wait until the first day of class to ask?) 

2. Enroll in a different waitlisted computer science class on a Saturday (I don't like taking classes on Saturday, but I guess I have to do it) and go to both computer science classes until someone drops. 

3. Don't take computer science classes this semester and either take 21 units next semester with the class OR spend another year at community college because I missed this class. 

I would greatly appreciate anyone that spent their time reading this and helping me out in this predicament. 

P.S. I have a computer science teacher that I took last semester who is great friends with my parents and can vouch for me to get into the class.

8,"My wife was in an accident recently.  Luckily, she was not hurt, but our car was totaled.  The driver behind her was at fault and their insurance company deemed our car a total loss.  The original valuation report we got from them showed $1100 for the car.  This seemed outrageously low.  It's a 2002 Mazda Progete 5 that we bought 1 year ago for $1800 and since then we have probably put in well over $1000 worth of parts alone (They do not count service towards the value of the vehicle).  Body of the vehicle has 218000 miles, but the engine was replaced, the new one has only about 90000 miles.  We've spent hours on the phone with the insurance company and have sent them all of the service records.  After one phone call, we got a new valuation report indicating $1800 for  the car.  We finally felt some sense of relief about it.  We would at least get back what we paid for it.  However, I called back this evening to touch base on another service receipt I sent in.  They told us there was a mistake made on the last valuation report and they sent us a new report with our car back at $1300 with all of the adjustments.  I was blown away.  There is no way we can find a car to replace the Mazda with just $1300.  I feel like we have no options, the insurance company is calling all the shots and making all the rules.  What can we do to get the right value for our vehicle?   ",09Jan2018,2

10,"I have these 2 games which I play quite a lot and if I'm playing them, I have this strong desire to play them. This desire distracts me from studying and generally from anything useful for me. 
Although, it's not really a gaming addiction as I have other games which I may play for like 10 minutes a day and then don't play it for a few days.

12,"Throwaway because people know my main account. My girlfriend of six months confessed to me that she is depressed, and has been for a little over three years. She told me she was planning on killing herself in July if things didn't get better. She met me, and things got better enough that she decided to stick around. But last night she let me know that about a week ago she took some pills hoping that it would end it.. She said she was disappointed it didn't work, even up until last night. 

I don't know what to do. I love her so much, I've never loved anyone like this before and when she said all of this to me.. It hurt so bad. But I'm glad she told me so I could try to help.

That said... I'm not really sure how. I'm going to be here for her, obviously, but I don't know how to prove that to her. She's going to try medication, she'll be getting it in the next couple of days and she promise to try it. I'm honestly not even sure what my question is... I just need help.

19,"I live with my best friend [25/m] and his live-in girlfriend [27/f]. His girlfriend doesn't have a job, or even a high school diploma, and all she does all day is sit in his room or our empty ""guest"" room and browse the internet or cook awful food all day. I was kind of okay with this because I actually enjoyed her company for a time, but sometime in November, we got drunk with some friends while my roommate was away. She told us some pretty awful things about her relationship.

To preface what she told me, know that she's OS - objectum sexual - she has romantic attractions towards inanimate objects and my roommate is the first person she's dated in over a decade or something. We own arcade machines, she's into them as well. That night she essentially told me that she lied about trying to look for a job, getting an interview, and going to therapy for her depression and her eating disorder. On top of this, she also said she never really had feelings for my roommate and was only in it for the machines, AND that she'd been assaulted by him. This was all so shocking. They'd been together for a year and I never would have thought that any of it was true. I'm not proud of it, but I put it in the back of my mind and later talked with my roommate at length.

I asked him if everything was okay and I suggested that maybe things weren't going so well. Without saying that she told me anything, I told him that she might be lying to him about her treating her eating disorder and that she might be in it for the machines and nothing more. He just kind of deflected the whole conversation, so I just assumed that it was a sinking ship and I wouldn't have to do anything for them to call it quits. I was wrong.



Nowadays, I hate her. She's nasty, hermetic, and blames her shitty attitude, binging, and purging on her hormones and to make it shittier, my roommate enables her. I get into innocent screaming matches with him and she yells at both of us to cut it out. She cooks all day, drives the utilities sky high cause she's up till 5am, and to top it all off, MY partner says they don't want to move in with me unless things get better. I want to live with my SO of nearly two years and I like this house too much to move away, and I care too much about my roommate and best friend to let it drag on any longer. He claims that things are better but won't talk to me long enough about it for me to know if he knows everything. I want them to just break up already so I can save money and have a happy home.

23,"A couple of months ago I accepted an offer for a research fellowship at an institution at the other side of the country. I am no stranger to leaving my family/friends and starting over however, this time it was different. Since before I even moved out here, I was dreading it. I couldn't think of a worse place to do my higher education. I was going to move to arguably the most racist state, live in a tiny torn-down town, and work every waking hour/weekend/holiday in the lab. As expected, this place I am currently living in couldn't be worse.

I am not the type of person to quit and I've ALWAYS seen things through in my life no matter how horrible they have been or how much I hate it. I put up with 4 years of undergrad at an institution I didn't like and in a major I detested. But that happened in my home state where my family was and I had friends. I could see a future for myself there. I can't imagine spending my 20's in a place like this. I just cannot fathom a future here no matter how hard I try. I have zero interests in common with people here, I stick out like a sore thumb since I don't match the ""desired"" profile, and there is nothing to do here.

I accepted the offer because I knew the professor I would be working with would be an amazing professor. Not only that but he offered a great fellowship that I would be dumb to not accept. I also really do want to get a higher education and I can study other things without having to worry about money or work. I really tried to make this situation work when I got here but it just seems destined to fail.

I spent the greater portion of the past few months thinking of what else I could do with my life. Frankly, given my undergraduate degree, there really isn't much for me unless I get the degree that comes after. I thought about switching programs but I hear it's very heavily frowned upon since institutions will just say you have commitment issues and see you as a liability. The only option where I don't see myself becoming homeless is going back home to go work for my dad's company. I really don't want that though.

Pretty much everything I've done ever since I left for college I did to become completely independent from my parents. As I am at this very instant, I am basically independent, which is good. I don't hate my family (I love my parents) but I just feel like I shouldn't be leeching off them and I should have my own place. Living with them is somewhat restricting and I don't want to end up like my sister who is almost 30, unemployed, and still living at home.

The truth is, if I went to work with my dad I would be making way more money than if I finished my degree and took a job at &lt;Insert Famous Company Name&gt;. I don't really care about money but I also don't really care for jobs. If I am offered job A that pays X and job B that pays Y, I will almost most definitely take the higher paying one (assuming the hours are the same and the work is moral by my standards). To compare the job my dad offers me to the job I'm currently doing, the one my dad offers is better. I don't have to spend every single waking hour and more in the lab. I don't have to give up everything else in life just to push research. And I think I would be okay with doing research if the life here offered me more but it just doesn't. All it offers me is 5 wasted years of despair in a place I hate and will never fit into.

There is a caveat with my dad's job: I would have to take 2 years to get a masters. Which isn't bad and I'm not against it. The problem is another 20 grand wasted getting a different piece of paper that says I'm qualified. (Note: This isn't a requirement he is imposing but I need certification with the state to do that job.)

I tried to make this as coherent as possible but it's also something I really haven't had anyone to talk to about. So I'll summarize:
I hate where I am in life right now but I don't know what else there is for me to do. I want to stay because I make enough to be independent, I get to study what I want, and I'll get a degree after 5 years. However, I have no friends or family here. I can't find the motivation to do the work I'm expected to do because I think, ""why am I putting in all this effort?"". Everyone I know is either married, in a relationship, has friends, or have very clear professional goals. My only known alternative is going back home and working for my dad. I'll end up living with my parents until I'm 30 and never get a higher education degree. But at least I'll have family, my friends, and live in a city with the things I like to do.

I don't know what the answer is. I don't know what will make me happier. I love to think that maybe I haven't tried enough out here and that it's too soon to go home. I don't want to quit and wonder ""what if..."" but I have no evidence pointing towards me ever being happy here. I can't justify spending my 20's here. I know people on Reddit aren't the authority on how to be happy but there isn't anywhere else for me to turn to. Any advice is welcomed.

Thank you",09Jan2018,2
25,"I think my best and only friend may be verbally and emotionally abusive towards me, and we just got in a big fight. He is a trans man and I absolutely support and respect him, but sometimes I mess up when in casual conversation. I don't misgender him, but in the past I've asked if a girl he was talking about was gay, he pointed out that I shouldn't ask that, and I apologized and I said I would try to not do it again. I will occasionally make a mistake like that, and he just becomes extremely angry. I told him that I apologized and I'm trying to learn, although sometimes it's for very petty things like one time I was referring to some pads I was buying for my sister at Walmart and I think I might have said something along the lines of ""lady product"" or something similar and he would go off on me for that. This is his reasoning for why he says that I'm a bad friend. What he doesn't seem to see is how he's constantly calling me names, degrading me, and condescending to me. He's extremely irritable and anything could set him off at any time, quite likely due to some past trauma that he's experienced. Sometimes even when I haven't really said something significant or even just made an observation he'll start almost yelling at me, saying fuck you. This is often in public. I always want to hang out with him, but when I do, I just feel like I leave as a husk, my torso feels hollow. I feel like im always doing something that needs apologising for, even though I know that it's often uncalled for.

26,"I'm currently at university, doing a science degree. I was a medical student for a couple years (again, wanted to help people!) but I ended up failing because of mental health and burning out. I've gotten my shit together a bit since then, but I don't know where to direct my energy. As much as I would love to pursue medicine again now that I'm more stable as a person (haha) I think it would take too long and cost too much - especially because I'm not convinced I wouldn't crumble under the stress again. I also can't see myself working in a lab or becoming a researcher, even though I know those are fields that do help people down the line.

I feel like I am quite an empathetic person, and I could really get into a was fairly people-based. My favourite parts of my medical degree were any parts that involved patient contact. I loved being with patients, I loved doing volunteer work in a dementia home before I even went to university (spending time with residents). I feel like I need an idea of the direction I want to go in now - ideally start working on having a career where I can have a positive impact on people but also use my brain. That sounds stupid but I mean that I want to be doing stuff like problem solving or coming up with ideas or debating or even just learning. I've thought about going into counselling, for example, but I don't know much about it and also I'm sure there's other career options I would enjoy a lot that I haven't thought of.

In my employment contract, it said that every employee gets 2 weeks paid vacation every year, as long as they've been there for at least 3 months. The company owner (and my boss) apparently didn't read the contracts he had us sign. He was furious when I requested it, but he let me take it. And then fired me the day before I was supposed to fly back to Washington. I've come back to pack and sell my stuff and have been spending a lot of the rest of my time looking for a new job back East.

That's where the idea to start my own business comes in. I'm fascinated by 3D printing (but I will be the first to admit that I don't have a deep understanding of how the technology works or anything to do with the software used to run 3d printers and make models) and have wanted my own 3D printer for years. Now they are legitimately affordable to consumers. I've been looking primarily at Monoprice printers due to cost, reviews, and ease of use. I'd like to get one and start selling models on demand (I was thinking fishing lures, DnD figures, smoking paraphernalia, small items) but I want some additional input from you fine folks before I take the plunge.

And now for my actual questions:

1. Other than researching the printers, filaments, etc, what is this first step I should take to get started building a business?

2. How much money should I have on hand before I start buying stuff? I'd like to avoid loans, but what about something like Kickstarter or GoFundMe? I was thinking that having $2000 cash on hand would be good because that'd get me a nice printer, a bunch of filament, and then a cushion to help out while I was getting set up

3. Are there any modeling programs for the layman? Something where I could make designs but wouldn't have to understand coding, etc. If not, what are some recommended resources to study how to make printable models?

4. Is any of this a good idea or should I just get a job and forget about it?

32,"This is gonna be a bit of a longer post but it should all be relevant.

I spent all of my childhood idolizing and worshipping my dad. The love I felt for him and his quirky, snappy &amp; non-conformist ways was unmeetable. One night, for some reason, I asked him a question pertaining to sociopathy. Without further hesitation he shrugs the question off and asks me if I know that ""...[my] own father is a sociopath?"" I remember freezing up and telling myself over and over to ""remember that"". My memory isn't the best so I try to be thorough when it comes to essentials.

I was still a kid, though, and I didn't really know what it meant or what to make of it. I brought it up with him maybe once or twice and was promptly shrugged off in a dismissive sort of ""I've got better things to do"" way. Instead of pushing it I decided to see what I could find out on my own. Unfortunately a whole lot of personal bias and shitty understanding of research weren't the best tools to use. For a few years that I still lived under the same roof I convinced myself that regardless of a diagnosis (that might've been faulty. I mean, they don't know my dad) my dad loved me and that we had an understanding father-son relationship.

Then I moved out. I was still only 17 but I got a whole lot more time to self. At some point I, once again, did decide to try and research sociopathy. I was looking for more understanding, I suppose. It slowly dawned on me what sociopathy or ASPD entails. Manipulation as well as lack of empathy and emotions. It was a tough time, and whilst I was trying to put it all together he called me. I didn't know what to say, at all, and he sensed it immideatly.

Ever since then I've been in a slow process of dissapating from the bubble of control I was in. I've decided to go non-contact on him after assuring myself of the legitimacy of the diagnosis (repeated behaviors, including blatant lies, manipulation, emotion and opinion-shifting within minutes, attempts at bribery, etc).

He has noticed some sort of withdrawal and I have no idea how he has interpreted it. Every few days he calls and asks the same rotation of questions. Sometimes with a few new ones or a story thrown in. He does it all in the same tone and pitch, which significies emotion but varies absolutely nothing from one conveyed emotion to another. I answer as simple as possible, yes/no if I can, and try not to invite any conversation.

So with all this behavior taken into account, and the knowledge that people with ASPD can be impulsive &amp; violent, I am now seriously worried that he would attempt to ""silence"" me if he thinks I know. This may be a bit dramatic, and a logical point would be the risk/reward ratio here, but delusionality can't be ruled out to any extent.

As for precautions, I lock my door and sleep next to a weapon. I don't know what else to do, and sometimes I barely sleep for worrying about bumps in the night. As for law enforcement getting involved, there is nothing black on white I could point to for evidence. Also heard that police can't do much without violence or clear threat of such, but I do not know details.

TL;DR:
I know a compromising secret regarding a family member, and they might know that I know. They might also be violent.",09Jan2018,3

I was vegetarian since I was 16, then went vegan at 19. I’m now 22 and reconsidering. When I was vegetarian I was at my heaviest weight and when I went vegan, I was at my lowest, ultimately normal weight. I’ve made myself vomit a few times to avoid those calories and I’ve also skipped meals to not gain any weight. For a really long time my body has gotten used to intermittent fasting, only eating once a day or spreading one large meal into smaller meals. Well now that I’m starting to lift weights, I’m beginning to see how big nutrition is on getting stronger. I know there’s powerlifters and body builders who are vegan but ultimately I think I went vegan for the wrong reasons and I’ve been considering going back to vegetarian since. although I’ve vegan, I think I was more plant based than anything because I would eat whatever as long as it didn’t have animal but wouldn’t always pay attention to what makeup brands were vegan and stuff like that. I guess I got comfortable with veganism because it was restrictive and also was good for the animals and the planet. I’m now scared of going back to vegetarian and having to explain to people why I’m not vegan anymore or what if I gain 25 pounds again???? I don’t know what to do or who I’d even reach out to for advice irl. . What do you guys think I should do? ",09Jan2018,2
39,"As of now the general idea I have is 1. Take a trip around edmonton with volunteers going door to door and informing the people in edmonton of our cause and what they can do to help. Alongside this we drop flyers to each house which contain the same information in paper. I feel like bi weekly is a good time to collect the bottles (so we collect from each house bi weekly- and the flyer informs them to keep their bottles outside with this flyer atop) we pick up the bottles and cash them in with the proceeds going towards the homeless. Atop of this we can have a website allowing people to subscribe (basically telling us when to come to their house and if they have bottles for us). This website will cover the purpose behind our organization and allow people to volunteer or print more flyers. Then we eventually invest in long term homeless-aiding facilities.

43,"I am a 40 year old man who has been with the same woman for 16 years. We have 2 kids together who are 8 and 10. I started playing video games quite extensively after the birth of our second son. My wife accuses me of neglecting her, the children and the house for years. She claims that I left her to care for the kids, I left her with the cooking, the grocery shopping, the cleaning, the yard work and to make sure the bills were paid all on top of working a full time job. We often had arguments regarding my inability to wake up with our kids if needed during the night or in the morning as I was often too tired due to a long night of gaming. She claims that living with me as a gammer was the equivilant of having a live in babysitter. My wife in the last couple of years had completely grown tired of me being a gammer, so much so that she was contemplating divorce. We no longer slept in the same bed, we barely spoke and had not had sex in years. In an attempt to improve my marriage I was able to limit my video game play, I became more attentive towards the kids and the house work and I left behind the late night gaming. Our marriage was starting to improve, I felt my wife becoming more attracted to me, she finally started wearing her wedding ring again, we started sleeping in the same bed at times and we recently had sex for the first time in 5 years!
In the past month I downloaded a new game which I find really enjoyable. I have increased my video game play throughout the day and have started to game again late at night but only when she choses not to sleep in the same bed as I do. I make sure the house is clean and the kids needs are met however my wife is starting to become increasingly angry with me. I do not believe this is fair as I am doing what she asked of me in regards to household responsibilities. I work full time and bring home a good pay check. I feel I am not the same gammer I once was. My wife states she is ok with me playing video games for a reasonable amount of time and I gather from our arguments that would be around 2-3 hours a day. She does not agree with my late night gaming and get very angry that I am up so late talking and playing with other people online. However my conversations are not inappropriate in any way. As a comrpomise she has requested I turn them off at midnight. 
Gaming is my passion and I often get lost in time playing them as time just seems to fly by. Also the crew I play with are in different time zones so gaming needs to take place late at night so I am able to play with them. I feel 6 hours of gaming after a full day of work and gaming as I desire on the weekends is acceptable provided I have attended to the kids needs, I have helped around the house and I have been involved in family activities. My wife argues that the amount of time I play games is unattractive and unappealing. She states she will not settle for another round of ""video game addiction"". I just wish she would understand that gaming is fun for me, it is the only thing that I am good at and it gives me great satisfaction. What can I do to convince her otherwise.",09Jan2018,6

I have to get the product information, figure out the shipping, create a title doe the product, fix images etc. It is something fairly new to me career wise, but I understand the basic concept of it. I am struggling a lot with what my manager wants it to look like.  
On my first day or two she whipped through things so damn fast I could hardly keep notes. There was a lot of ""Don't pay attention to this part"" and ""...ya know"" in her explanations. She didn't take time to really explain what things were and talked about things like I knew all the terms she was using. I'd ask questions but again a lot of the answers were really technical and a lot of ""ya knows."" I noticed that she is not a very patient person and gets irritated really easy. She told me about how a bunch of people were let go from out department not too long ago and the last person didn't last more than 3 weeks. Also sales were hurting in the company and really had a negative/stressed out attitude toward everything (told me this on the first day).

I'm not doing bad (at least I don't think so) and trying to follow what information I was given, but it seems that when I show her the work I did, it's not good enough/the way she would do it. I'm really really trying not to take it personal as I know I am learning and it's not going to be amazing, but there have been times that I am doing what she told me to do and she'll come back later and be like ""This is wrong"" or I feel like ""Well, if you would have been more clear/slowed down and explained it in the first place, I would have understood that a long time ago.""  I'd ask a co-worker for help, but it's just her and I in the department.

Same if i'm watching a video. Sometimes I have to replay the same few seconds of the video over again, to listen to what they say, what they do. A video that might be 3 minutes long it will take me twice as long to finish it.

Still, I was able to acquire a good amount of trustworthy friends. Of those, I particularly value two - one male and one female. For the sake of convenience, I'll call them Alice and Bob. It is probably worth mentioning that I became friends with Alice by expressing my feelings for her, though that was absurdly long ago and those feeling have since waned. Even though I had many friends, my romantic life was (understandably) not very exciting - had a girlfriend for 4.5 months, tried having sex with her but wasn't feeling it at the time. I also had two or three no-sex one night stands, but nothing to write home about.

All that's from about two years ago. Since then, my relationship with Alice and Bob has improved quite significantly. I've also had no further romantic or sexual relationships with anyone, though I have fallen in and out of love a few times, but my interest in sex of any nature completely disappeared. I masturbated only because I was so used to it I couldn't be bothered to stop, but I felt nothing. It was then that I realized I was an asexual biromantic - and that was quite a liberating thought; I did not depend on sex. 

And it was like that until, a year ago, I kissed a gay male friend at a party (playing a game which is basically randomly selecting two people to kiss). And something clicked in me - didn't know what that night. But, over the following few weeks, I analyzed most of my relationships with other guys only to deduce that I must be gay. All those bubbles of thoughts about sex with other men suddenly popped and countless pleasant images were released into my mind. I couldn't stop thinking and fantasizing about other men, in an undoubtedly sexual way. I AM gay, there is no other way around it. After sitting on it for a while, 3 months ago, I decided to come out to my best friends, and eventually, filled with support, become openly gay.

In parallel with all this, I've been suffering from depression since I was 16. I've been to therapy, but quit because it didn't help at all, even though I told my friends and family I was feeling better.

And that is finally the end of what I think is important. It felt like forever writing it. Now, for the actual stuff bothering me.

The general problem: I find it hard to know myself, if that makes any sense. I can't say if I believe anything I say or think, or whether I think something sincerely or to fit in (or, in some cases, to deliberately not fit in.) Very often I get the feeling that most of my personality, and especially my depression and my transition from heterosexuality through asexuality to homosexuality is simply a guise to cover me being an intrinsically boring person or me trying to seem more special and fragile. Even disregarding that, I have a feeling that even thinking about something for just a little bit longer than I'm used to makes me accept it as a sincere opinion, even if I would never consider it to be so. This has caused me to doubt any and all my qualities, especially my depression and homosexuality, ironically making me even more depressed. This is where I need advice: I don't know how to come to terms with my thoughts, how to be sure they are in fact my own and sincere. I am now openly gay, but what if I'm not? Especially only mere months after I came out to everyone, coming out again as actually not gay would be a disaster, for example. And I'm not sure. Not in anything at all.

The specific problem: Alice and Bob have been romantically involved in the past, for a short time. Bob, however, still has feelings for her, but both of them are in a relationship with other people. I've grown to love them both immensely as friends, but perhaps Alice more so. Recently though, my love for Alice took a strange turn. This is, approximately, what I'm feeling: I love her, almost unconditionally. I love everything she does, we have the most amazing talks; she is very fun to hang around with; she is very pretty; she has the most amazing body, et cetera. I have a desire to hug/kiss her, but not necessarily have sex with her, due to my apparent homosexuality or something else entirely. She's all I've been thinking of as of lately. What I can't seem to grasp is whether I'm feeling romantic love for her. Reading what I've described so far, it would be naive to say it's not romantic. But, other than wanting to spend all my time with her and make her the happiest woman in the world (and wanting to kiss her, I guess), everything else I've been feeling for ages, to a same extent. I have no idea.

Even if I had, I wouldn't know what to do. I'm not in a position to tell her anything since she has a boyfriend and Bob does still have genuine romantic feelings for her, but then again I can't not tell her because I have feelings for her, whatever their nature may be.

I wrote all this only to realize I have no specific question in mind. I'm sorry. It's just that everything's messy and I'm confused about my sexuality, my love for somebody and the sincerity of my thoughts.",09Jan2018,3
71,"Let's say you tell a guy you know your birthday is tomorrow and he says that if you want to hang out to let him know. BUT you politely turn him down and say that you're broke and he says ""maybe next time"". My birthday really is tomorrow and I really am broke. What do you make of it IF in addition to the above, you have turned him down to hang out several times because you are in a relationship and have told this guy that. 

Was I wrong to expect him to as a friend hang out and pay for drinks  / play pool?  I keep turning him down cause' a) I'm in a relationship and b) I don't know if he just wants to hang out or wants something.

73,"I like girls very much but I just have trouble approaching them. I think I'm a good 5-6, but I am rich in personality and somewhat in confidence. Point is I don't know how to approach girls, make them over look my looks and make them stick around without being weird ya know?",09Jan2018,1
74,"I'm a sophomore in high school in the United States. 

I'm part of a pretty tight-knit group of friends consisting of me and a few other people. We get together during the weekends and play music occasionally. Recently they've been starting to smoke a ton of marijuana almost everytime we hang out. 

This group of friends is notorious for pushing me out of my comfort zone. I've had some mild anxiety throughout my life and any experience that I'm not totally familiar with terrifies at me first. This has helped in many ways, I'm much more outgoing and adventurous than I would ever be without them. If I don't want to do something, they will do anything they can to push me towards doing it anyway.

However, with marijuana and drugs in general, I'm not sure what to do. I know they're going do everything in their power to get me to smoke marijuana, but I dunno if I wanna go down that road. I've heard some bad things about smoking marijuana in your teen years, and most of the studies I've read on marijuana use and its effects in adolescense/adulthood are pretty hazy and kinda confusing.

I can't just push them away, I've known them for years, even since kindergarten. They're like my brothers. It's also not the typical 'forced into doing drugs at a party' situation, usually we're at a friend's house alone with just us. I haven't talked to any parents or counselors about it. 

I wish I knew what to do. ",09Jan2018,1
75,"Ok so a little about me, I'm in 10th grade and my highschool has a psychology class that I've been waiting to take since 8th grade. The psychology teacher is a great person and everyone loved him, and I really looked up to him because he made me realize how much I love psychology, and that I want to major in it in college. Anyway, I had him for 8th grade Social Studies, and a few times a month when we had time he would show us his psychology lesson from that day, and I always loved every second of it. I had never been that interested in a subject in my entire life. Since then, I've been learning as much as I can about anything and everything to do with psychology, so I couldn't wait to take his class in 11th grade (which is now next year) and now that he's gone just thinking about psychology upsets me because it reminds me so much of him. There's a new psychology teacher that is a great person, but it won't be the same. His death was very recent, so I know I can get over it, but for now I just don't know what to do. If anyone can offer any advice, I would really appreciate it. 

Tldr; my psychology teacher died and even thinking about psychology makes me upset. ",09Jan2018,1

77,"Sorry if that's a weird intro, I really don't know how to better phrase that. I'm 17 and planning to go away to college in the fall. My parents are against that, saying I'm ""too irresponsible and disorganized to function on my own"" and that ""they won't be there to fix all my problems"", yet THEY'RE the ones who jump on my every problem like I'm begging for them to help me! 

I don't WANT their help and they're holding it against me like I owe them something. They're constantly riding me to do things I have full intention of doing, and it makes me not want to do them. Like, for example, cleaning my room. YES, it's extremely cluttered. I hate it! I can sit at school all day and plan to clean, but when I get home and my mom tells me I need to clean, I immediately don't want to.

I feel like I can't be autonomous at home because my parents act too quickly for me to do things on my own volition. It really sucks! How can I get them to back off and let me do my thing?",09Jan2018,1
78,"I’ve been friends with a man for about two years now. I’m a woman and he’s gay, if that matters. 

This has happened a few times, but I’ve really had it. He will go through periods of seeing me a few times a week and calling me every day. We get along so well and we make each other laugh.  We will hang out, and talk for hours and swim at my apartment. He’s a huge drinker and I don’t drink, so I don’t go to the bars with him. 

Then he will withdraw and disappear for weeks. I’ll text and call but he’ll be pretty cold so I’ll give him space. It really hurts me and when I ask why he just says he’s busy. I got him an expensive xmas present, but he keeps saying he can’t afford the Uber fare to come pick it up( he lives 2 miles away). When I offer to drop it off he claims to not be home. I’ve always been there for him, including when he’s sick (he has a chronic illness), since he doesn’t have any family here. He still has money to go out drinking, and had a NYE get together and didn’t invite me until I saw it on social media and asked what was going on. 

He had a job at a hotel for a few years and left for a new one. I work in finance. 

He isn’t educated and really doesn’t have any skills. He’s been having a bit of a crisis lately, and wants to have a career. The problem is they he doesn’t take work seriously and will always call in sick. He’s in his 30’s and is convinced he’s going to be a model and paid for a photo shoot. He modeled when he was younger but it never really got anywhere. When he complains about not having any direction in life I’ve suggested hair school or college and he acts like I told him to become a dishwasher. 

Am I overreacting? Should I just stop contacting him? I don’t think it’s fair that he just flits in and out of my life when it suits him, especially since I’ve been there when he’s been sick and when he got injured at thanksgiving, when my husband and I went out of our way to bring him some soft drinks when he hit his head (he ended up going to a friend’s house and then going out drinking that night. I know.)

Maybe I’m too sensitive, but I could really use another perspective on this.

81,"I am 18 years old and have had 2 relationships before, both of which were childish and ended at around 16/17...

I have been told by family members that were obviously biased or angry in the situation that I need mental help before I got into a relationship, fuck them. 

So I guess the first thing is I hate affection, all forms of it. It's just gross to me and shows weakness and is embarrassing. It could be from my grandma or the hottest woman in the world, I hate it either way. 

I don't really connect with people, I try to avoid meaningful friendships or conversation because I know it leads to commitment. I can't accept that I have issues because I think it's weak personally, so... Yeah...

I'm a depressed very broken man if i'm being honest who is extremely superficial in many many MANY ways. 

I HATE family, even if they are very nice and appreciative of me. I hate authority in general so family doesn't help. I think family is gross because of how comfortable they are around each other and I hate people that THINK they have good morals when I can see the CLEAR truth that it's a lie! We are all the same beings that have the same thoughts, we all want to fuck things, hurt things, release our stresses with drugs and alcohol, there is nobody better then anybody else. 

I have anger issues but I never release it anymore I'm actually decently cool headed and about good vibrations.

I have hit a woman before to the point of concussing her but I was 15 years old at the time and it had nothing to do with her being a woman. 

I am fueled by ego and feel like time is running out and that I need to do something to get famous as fast as possible because if I don't the opportunity will close to be meaningful, I don't believe in spirituality. 

I have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome as well so that has always effected my life. 

Now if I had a girlfriend again I would treat her nicely though probably lie a bit about things I want to be true, I don't know why I do this but I find it relatively harmless if its little things. 

Also lastly, I hate fat people and feet, both are disgusting in my opinion I don't know why but i've always thought feet were repulsive and people that just comfortably show them around are disgusting human beings, and fat people that aren't fat by disease but by overeating are also PUTRID to me.

So that was just me describing my personality a bit, if you were in a relationship with me, say you were attracted to my appearance or something small about my personality, would those things make you declare me abusive? If so, how? 

FORGOT TO MENTION, I did see a therapist once for a year, we didn't make a single breakthrough and even after we talked that whole year he didn't know a single thing about me other then my name and my age. He was the best at Kaiser Permanente as well.. This is when I was 17 ",09Jan2018,0

84,"So today my boyfriend of nearly one year told me he is going to start a modelling gig as he was offered a job. He’s a very insecure guy and I don’t want this new career getting to his head. I am very happy for him and will support him but I am having mixed feelings. 

1. I hope he doesn’t ditch me for all these other girls he will end up working with. I am becoming insecure of that. 
2. I hope he stays humble. 
3. And this is the main one, I feel completely useless, like why am I with him, I am not attractive but he is. 
4. And again, I feel useless because he’s accomplishing these things in life and I haven’t accomplished anything and I am so lost I don’t know what to do. I am not jealous; it just makes me feel like I can’t be high up there with him. ",09Jan2018,1
85,"Alright, here goes. I'm a 21 y/o 3d artist living in a small southern town. 
I started doing 3d modeling when I was in high school and I found out that I could make money at it by doing freelance work. 
Since attending college was never in my future, and at the time that's all I thought graduating was good for, I dropped out and learned everything I could about 3d modeling.

Fast forward a few years, a family friend who owns his own business (a jeweler) told me that he needed someone to run his cad/cam business (3d modeling and wax milling). 
I told him that I could do it and he hired me. 

That was two years ago and things have been going pretty well, except for the money. 
I'm employed, but paid as freelance (technically ""consulting/design""). 
I make about $125 per piece, but we only make about a piece a week.

I talked to him about a wage, because it'd be a lot more consistent and I'd be making more. 
I told him that I'd be okay with minimum wage, but he talked me out of it, saying that I'd be making more by being paid per piece when we really get set up and start getting more work.
It made sense at the time, so I agreed, but it has been a few months since then and nothing has really changed.
I don't feel like I have a job at all, I make less than $10,000 a year and my ""benefits"" are the occasional trip with my boss.
 
I work from home 6 days a week, (still live with my family) and I rarely leave the house. 
I don't have a license, just a permit and of course I don't have a car. 
Even worse is that since I live in a small town, there's no public transportation, so my ride to and from work is usually my boss or my mother.

My family doesn't actually want me to leave home (small town mentality, family is everything), but I'm depressed out of my mind and I can't just keep ""existing"".
Most of my family also has depression and there's no point trying to tell them how it's affecting me, they know. They just want me to stay. 

I've thought about quitting several times, but I don't have any other options. 
I can't get another job, there aren't any for a 3d artist here. 
It's all fast food, retail and factory jobs. 
I don't have any experience, hell I don't even have a HS diploma or equivalent. 
I'd join the military if I could, but even if I were to get a G.E.D, I'd still have a poor chance of getting in.

One other thing, my boss has talked about retiring and handing the business to me, but that could be 10 years from now. 
Honestly though, I don't think that I would even be happy owning a business here.

I have no idea what to do.

I'm not usually one to ask for help, but I've been trying to solve my problems on my own for years and it's clearly not working. So I guess what I'm asking for is an outside perspective.

86,"Throwaway account

Everything went downhill about three years ago, when my dad got cancer for the second time. It was a very stressful situation for me and my mom, and we were very worried for him. My dad's mom was also there. She caused a lot of problems because she would physically hit me and my mom when we were at the hospital if we tried to visit my dad. My dad still supported his mom, and refused to take our side even after he fully recovered from surgery. As a result, we are no longer in good terms and I have not seen him for about a year. 

My mom has had a very hard time these past years because she had never really worked before. We're not from the country we currently live in, so she's been very stressed out. She relies on my dad's disability and her waitressing job. However, she's very uncomfortable because she dislikes her job and has an accent when she speaks English. She's always wanted to go back home, but she has agreed to stay a few more years so I can apply to college. It's very stressful because she blames me sometimes for not being able to go back to her mother country and live with her parents. 

She recently got involved with a new man at her workplace. ""C"" has been her boyfriend for about three weeks. It's been really weird for me because I don't really know the guy, but he's offering my mom the chance to move in with her. And me too. But it's really scary because I've known him for maybe a day. 

The problem is my dad's disability is running out, and my mom wants nothing to do with him. My mom wants to sell the apartment we own and move in with this guy. I'm scared that this is a really bad move because if she breaks up with C, we won't have any disability payments to go back on and no apartment, and then we'd have to go back to our mother country. 

I haven't lived there since I was 4, and I don't want to do that at all. My mom wants to sell the apartment because there's like a 30 year mortgage and the maintenance cost is too high.

What's the right decision here? Is it wrong for me to feel super anxious because of this? I just feel like my life is very unstable lately. ",09Jan2018,2

 She is SO needy, yet plays what she thinks is a mother figure to us. We cannot have our doors open or else she is in our room asking us what we are doing at all times. I can't go to G's room and ask her a simple question without her coming in and trying to butt in. I've had people over in the living room and she came out and just stared at us while we worked on a project! She gets REALLY upset when we eat without her, or do anything for that matter.

We definitely don’t look alike or have any of the same features, and growing up I just kind of thought I looked way more like my mom and that was just how it was. Then in high school I asked about how my parents met (they had me at 19) and kind of realized that the timeline/where they lived at the time didn’t exactly add up, like they went to high school in different states and would have had to have gotten pregnant the week of graduation for him to be my dad. So I said that to them and they said something like “your dad moved away his junior year and came back after graduation, of course he’s your dad, don’t be silly” and I checked the year books and that all added up so ok, why would they lie to me? And I let it go. So fast forward 8 years, I’m pregnant with my first baby and being pregnant makes your mind go in a hundred different directions, from the family history medical paperwork and just asking my mom what her pregnancies were like and getting Mama to be advice, I started noticing a few inconsistencies in her stories of my first year of life. So I kind of questioned that to her and she said something about my dad being there too yada yada and I’m thinking okay weird but why would she lie? I’m a full grown woman and he’s my dad no matter what so there’s no reason to lie. Okay now a few months later I’m begging my mom to send me pictures of me as a baby bc my husband and I are arguing about who our adorable baby looks more like and I notice that out of the 15-20 pictures she’s sent me of birth to my 1st Birthday that my dad isn’t in one.

So today I was talking to my husband about it and I just got this feeling and I had to ask again, but I asked my Aunt. And I told her I didn’t want to put her in an uncomfortable position but that I really needed to ask her a question and I needed her to tell me the truth and I said, “is my dad really my dad?” And she responded with my dads name in the form of a question and I knew then. And then she told me I needed to talk to them and get answers, that she couldn’t lie to me but it wasn’t her place to tell me. I live in another state and tomorrow is my moms birthday.

99,"Before today, I've had the time of my life, good vibes and going with the flow. Pretty popular around school, have a good amount of friends and no problem with anything social or academic at school. 

We had a 2 week break and my sister, her boyfriend, and a close cousin came back to the house to spend it. Normally it's me at the home alone with my father and mother coming home at 8 P.M and 11 P.M respectively, said father and I eating dinner, then going to our own rooms where I usually play video games and he does his work. When my mom comes home she usually eats a bit and goes to my father's room and sits on the bed with her iPad. This is almost every single day on the weekdays besides the weekends where we sometimes go out to eat or spend time with eachother, and I know some people might not even be lucky enough to have this much time with their parents and that I'm extremely fortunate for this, but this brings me to my problem.
 
After listening to something as simple as a rapper's lyrics, Rich Chigga, or Brian now, in one of his songs, it talks about his loneliness. One of the lyrics were

""20 mirrors in my crib, I'm hanging with my friends""

I didn't think much about it at first but after listening to the song a couple more times I began to internalize it. What did I do at home all day? I had maybe 1 or 2 active friends I'd play online with, and when they weren't there I'd play by myself. Whenever they weren't there, I'd usually turn on something in the background to make noise, to make it sound like there was someone there with me, but in reality there wasn't. It was just me. This was the day that my sister and her boyfriend left back to college and I was left with a sense of solitude. 

Before they left, we'd stay up late at night playing cards or doing something like that, maybe just hanging out in a room with eachother on our phones or something. We'd go out places, eat foods and go to the mall, and have a genuinely good time. In the time they spent here which was about the whole break, I barely touched my computer once, spent all my time with them, and the only time I went into my room was to go to sleep or grab something.

I sat at my computer for a while and loaded steam to message one of the two friends if they wanted to get on and play, but I remembered they both had work. So I sat there, played a couple games of rainbow by myself and tried to make friends with people in casual and competitive. I might have chosen a bad game to try to do this on, because all my attempts were in vain because all of them were either telling my to ""shut the fuck up"" or ""you spelled quebec wrong"", and those were the answers I got when they even bothered to respond at anything I said at all, like ""How's everyone's day going?"".

I quit trying after 3-4 games thinking it's fine and that I could just wait when the song came back into my playlist I kept on for background noise. The line came on and I broke down. I took my headphones off, shut down my computer, got on my bed, and cried for a good hour. Is this what my life has led to? Playing videogames by myself because the only two other friends I had online were making a living for themselves? I could be out there hanging with my friends, and here I am sitting on my ass everyday doing nothing to contribute towards my life. 

It's odd. The only time I hang out with friends is when it's a schoolday, or on the saturday's, but never on breaks. On breaks, I stay only with myself and my family, and never even think about that. But even in this break, all my friend's were out on foreign countries and different areas, not even remotely close to here, so I wouldn't even have been able to hang out with them anyways.

Sorry if I'm rambling on but I just don't know. Is this a phase? Will I get over this? Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.",09Jan2018,1

102,"so a few months ago i broke up with my ex, mainly bc i was kinda insecure. shes on the skinny side while im pretty fat. I didnt feel like i deserved to be her bf and also there were a lot of other things i wanted to focus on. I still love her and when i broke up with her she was devastated saying things like she would do anything to get me back. after some time she went no contact. i broke it many times by trying to initiate some friendly convo on snap she however never did. then yesterday i posted about a can that had some cement and said get rock hard cement, and i made a joke of it on snap that this was a quick fix to get rock hard abs(as a joke). my ex snaps me back that. how come you dont have abs dude? she says. i reply and she never replies back. she also posts cleavage baring shots on snaps and selfies which she never did back when we dated. also i recently saw a snap of her in a messy bun with very little makeup and my did she look gorgeous her skin looked clearer her features a bit sharper. but one thing i noticed that she looked skinner almost dangerously.

104,"I know this sounds like such a silly question, but hear me out! 


I understand that school is specifically for learning, but it varies on the subject, right? I mean, when you go to major in Psychology or something along those lines, I assume they expect you to start fresh, clean slate, learning something new. That it's almost ""everyone is a beginner here,"" sort of thing.


Then you see people in Cosmetology, who when they start, have been cutting their own/their friends hair for years, that can blend their eyeshadow 'til the cows come home. They're just learning how to do it *better.* 


In my case, I'm considering going to culinary school, but under my living circumstances, I have always ate things you just threw in the microwave for a few minutes, or take out.  Fancy or special occasions in my family always meant something that was in a crockpot.

For the first few weeks to two months I will be a model employee I turn up 30 minutes before my shifts and read up on procedures or start my work and repeat the  same procedure at the end of the day. Then comes a period when I'll get anxious and this sometimes means I'll just skip work out of some random fear and when I do finally contact the company it could have been anywhere between 1-3 days instead of telling them the truth and saying I have anxiety I make up something like I fell down the stairs or I got my head. Then before returning I'd try a leave a lump or something to make it convincing. Then I'll be normal for a week maybe 2 then anxiety comes back I realize that I've ruined my chances with that company and never call again. I keep telling my self that it's just commitment issues or I need sort out my anxiety which I feel I have under control but in reality I don't.

So he got one of his friends with benefits  to come over this morning and have sex, and while they were having sex he put a pillow over her head and took a picture of him having sex with her to send to his fraternity brothers.

I told him that’s not ok and I was getting mad and he’s like “whatever I had to”
I kicked him out of my dorm and I am no longer speaking with him.

He did something similar to me back in November- I was engaging in a sexual act with him and he tried to take a picture to send to his fraternity brothers. I heard the camera sound on his phone go off, and I immediately stopped and deleted the picture for good.

116,"Ok so here’s what’s going on: I’ve had a crush on this girl since last February and I think she’s gradually started to like me as well but there’s no way for me to talk to her. Her parents are super protective so she’s not allowed to open her DMs on anything. We also live in different states.

Here’s a little more backstory: In February of last year, I made a Musical.ly account (cringe ik) because I was curious and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. After I made my account, the app gave me some people to follow, and she came up. At first I thought she was kind of cute so I followed her. About 5 minutes went by and she posted a musical.ly and she looked adorable. I decided to compliment her so i left a comment on it. 2 minutes after I did that, she posted another Musical.ly and again, she was so cute. I commented again and she posted again shortly after. Then I started to get suspicious. It’s like she was posting after reading my comments. I decided to wait a good 10 minutes (hardest of my life) before commenting again. Shortly after, she posted again. Either really crazy coincidences or something was up...

Anyway, as the year progressed, she posted more and I left her compliments. Her family has a YouTube channel and they vlog, and as I started to watch the videos, I started to fall in love with her. Everything about her i just love. Super sweet, down to earth, funny and pretty. Through the videos I’ve noticed we have a ton in common too. And there are soooo many coincidences as well. Too many to name but it seriously may be something more.

On Musical.ly, she started leaving her Instagram in her caption. I took that as a hint and followed her on it. Then the same thing happened. She started posting the most beautiful pics on Instagram and I would again comment. Sometimes she would post on Instagram 2 or 3 times a day everyday. What’s funny is after this Instagram thing started, she started posting on Musical.ly less and less. Now she doesn’t post at all. I specifically remember one post over the summer, she posted herself holding a dandelion with the caption “make a wish”. In the comments I said “i think we have the same wish”. 3 minutes after that she posted again, the most gorgeous selfie i’ve ever seen with the most infectious genuine smile. This is when i knew something was up for real.

Fast forward to December 2017 and she posted on her Instagram story that she was playing the game Song pop 2. it’s an app where you play against someone and you have to guess a number of songs.  I decided what the hell, i’ll make an account and play this game. I sent her a game invite and she instantly accepted me. We played all night. Fast forward to now and we’re still playing. Again funny thing: as soon as we started playing Song Pop, she hasn’t posted on Instagram as much. Now maybe once or twice a week.

ALSO: she went to a camp in the summer and the majority of the girls she hung out with all live in the same state as me. some as close as 20 minutes away. she also went on a cruise for new years and she met these girls who live about 40 minutes away from me. coincidence?

I know this was a lot but does anyone have any possible advice on what I could do? I really want to talk to her and unless i’m delusional, she has a bit of an interest in me. She can’t open her DMs and she lives about 7 or 8 hours away. It’s not like I can drop everything and go find her. Thoughts?",09Jan2018,1
117,"So my current living situation has become rather hostile and I'm not sure if we are handling things the way we should. I want to start by saying our lease is up in May 2018 and we will not be living together (mostly with one person) after that.  

My conflict begins in November, my female roommate brought her black out drunk boyfriend home fairly late. Around 1:30 AM the bf wonders into my male roommates room, pees on his floor, and then tries to crawl into bed with him (to sleep, not sex). My male roommate freaks out, kicks the bf out of his room and cleans up the mess. The next day bf apologizes to male roommate, myself, and my gf (its a 3 bed we split 4 ways). We then decide that the bf is no longer welcome in the apartment.  

Fast forward, female roommate thinks thw whole ordeal is just ""frat/college life"" and looks for apologies from the rest of us to make her life easier. Now she wants to try and allow her bf back into our apartment because she pays her 1/4 of the rent and utilities. None of us are OK with that and now she's upset.  

I want to add that I was never a fan of the guy. He basically lived in our apt for a month without any contributions to bills and the whole thing pushed me over the edge.   

I just want to know, in Reddit's opinion, if we handled it well or if we are being overly ""cruel"" to the bf and roommate? I havent found anyone I know that thinks we are in the wrong, but I'm trying to take their side into consideration. Anything would be helpful, thank you for reading.

121,"I'm going back to school tomorrow and I am not looking forward to it at all. Since starting high school I've felt this way in some degree after coming back from our holiday breaks but this year has been the worst. I've been anxious about coming back since the day we got released. I'm not getting bullied or anything like that, I have friends, extracurricular activities, etc. but none of that makes me excited to come back. 

I did reasonably well in most of my classes. I made a B+ in my Pre-Calculus class last semester which I feel like I can improve this semester but I did fail my AP physics class. It was just too advanced for me and I jumped in too quickly. I'm switching to regular physics this semester but I'm still weary about it, even though I've heard great things about the teacher. 

I'm especially nervous about starting the next phase of my medical class/program next week where I will be visiting various clinical sites to essentially shadow personnel and perform basic procedures and such that I have been trained to do. The program was something that required lots of effort to become a part of and many applicants were not admitted. It was an extensive process but I am very grateful that I got in and I understand it's an amazing opportunity. However, since day 1 all of my fellow classmates (who I've grown to love) have been really excited about starting this phase and getting the scrubs and receiving our badges and the whole deal. I looked forward to it, but I was in no big rush to get there. When we toured one of our prospective sites, I was very much put at ease and was actually imagining myself there and it became real to me. But now it's very close and while I'm not dreading it, I'm extremely anxious about it, to the point where I'm tossing and turning at night thinking about it. I'm nervous that I'm not trained enough (it's a large class and we get only so much time to learn things in small groups) and that I'll screw up. Or that I'll annoy the nurse or whoever I'm shadowing and be too intrusive. I don't want to let my instructor (who could not be more perfect) down. 

I'm just so reluctant about going back. I hate being stuck at home doing nothing and love the learning atmosphere at school. I'm also very lucky to have a decent group of friends and to be involved in extracurriculars, but I'm just not happy or motivated to go back. Obviously I'm not dropping out or anything crazy but I'm not excited in any way. There were definitely times when I had a lot of fun and was happy last semester but I was also very dejected, felt isolated from my peers, and overwhelmed.

Final grades are in and I find out that I failed another 2 classes. Since this violates my academic probation, I am now suspended from my University until Spring 2019.

I believe many of my mom's traumas might have been caused by this abuse. She opened up about this recently at a family dinner to me, my dad and my brother after having perhaps a little too much wine.

She says he never apologized to her but that she has ""put it behind her"" for the sake of the family and everybody getting along. I was boiling with rage when she told me the story. How could my uncle look at me in the face, smile, and interact with me after he put my mother through so much grief? What a piece of shit.

I don't know how to go about this post without just listing my smaller issues and hopefully someone can see the weak link in the strategy that my demons has laid for my inconvenience. These aren't all problematic, I am just listing these facts to explain my situation.

-I have Depression. It is minor but has not waned. I find it hard to motivate myself to do anything that I know I want to do, until it is something I am either required to do, or want very very much.

-I have recently graduated, and am nearing the end of my gap year that I chose to take because I wish to go to college but my aforementioned depression makes it hard for me to plan. Not impossible, just hard.

-I live at two houses, and they are very far from each other. I grew up living with split households, and ever since my dad moved farther away from my mom, things have been difficult. Fortunately everything I want to do is in the city directly between my two houses, but it is still hard to make it there every time I want to do something. I am insistent on not choosing either house, and to be honest, living at one house doesn't completely solve everything either.

-I do not drive, nor have the motivation to. I should, but I have not even started on getting my license, and driving terrifies me. I am sure it is in my head, but that is the problem these days, my head.

-I do not have a job. This one is something that my depression hasn't affected to be honest, I have been applying regularly, I just have no actual work experience. This issue correlates with the next one.

-I'm unbelievably bored, and it numbs my mind. This in turn creates a general irritability and difficulty dealing with short term issues, as well as low level teasing/social satire.

-Since graduating, I lost my emotional outlet; acting, and obviously it is harder to join a local theater or audition for a local project that you DON'T have family ties to get yourself into (I've had a relatively privileged childhood, I won't deny that. None of this is surprise, I just want progress). I can't afford an acting agency yet, and I do not have the means to get myself into a theater.

-I'm approaching college, and I'm scared, because I have little funds, and I don't know how I'm going to be able to fit anything together. 


Basically, I'm angry inside, festering in my own shitty white privileged brain, drowning in boredom because I can't do anything until something is given to me. I'm sick of relying on other people, so what do I have to do to get the life that I want? I don't need something shiny or spectacular, I don't need to be rich or famous, I don't need some fantastic house and a beautiful car, I just want to be on the other side of the ""grown up"" fence already, because all I see around me is condescending eyes filled with uncaring pity. 

I don't need someone to do something for me, I need to know what to do for myself. What is the best strategy to go about solving this shit?

132,"I feel as if I'm gradually becoming dumber. I remember all throughout elementary school and the beginning of middle school I was an ace at everything. I took an IQ test in 6th grade and scored 139. I've always been a procrastinator of sorts and it caused me major trouble in 8th grade where I nearly failed all my classes. My teachers recognized that I was an intelligent kid and therefore allowed me to continue on an academic path in high school. 

Before things have come easily to me without studying yet I'm not sure if it's the content or what but I'm finding that things just don't come as easily anymore. I procrastinate things to the point where I turn them in so late that I get a horrible grade or don't turn them in at all. This as gotten better as high school went on after recovering from the grief caused by the death of my uncle in 10th grade. 

I'm just super worried about college because though I'm doing better the mark of my freshman and sophomore year remain on my high school transcript. I do very well on standardized tests and certain things like biochemistry (not regular chem, yuck) come very easily to me yet I've found that things like math have become progressively harder for me. 

I took Honors Pre-Calculus my freshman year, then AP Calc, and now statistics. Previous to high school, Math came very easily to me, feeling natural, yet in High school I've found that I have to study very hard (maybe less comparably to other students of my age) to succeed in these classes which I always put off due to my nature as a procrastinator. Logically this nature makes sense as people instinctively view their future selves as a different person even though they know that this person is their self which is why it makes sense to push things off to the future so one can enjoy themselves now, and not worry about what they WILL have to do. 

Anyways, at this point I'm rambling. Back to the main subject of my intelligence decreasing. During my IQ test in 6th grade I scored exceptionally well on the pattern section yet now patterns are harder to recognize. In 6th grade I remember myself being very good at the pattern game SET. After not touching it for years I played it recently and did awfully. I know that to the person reading this that it is apparently obvious why I didn't do as well; because I haven't touched the game in years yet I don't know how much one's ability to recognize patterns can change in 5 years if not thoroughly greased once in while.
 
I have many reasons for why I have noticed this supposed decrease in intelligence: 1) I was too used to being better than everyone else (in my mind) that I let my guard down in how much I tried and when thrown into the mosh pit of high school, I realized that I'm not the smartest person on earth 2) Not putting enough effort into improving my intelligence or learning new things 3) Very minimal cannabis, nicotine and recreational drug use though I have never drank and my supposed problems began arising before this 4) Obesity; I have read articles that conclude that obesity is not good for the brain though I'm not exactly sure why. I began, gradually, gaining weight in 3rd grade to the point where in 8th grade I had a BMI of 30 or more, though this has gotten better. Some articles say weight loss can improve this obesity caused symptom and other articles say that it is irreparable. This could have been bad for self esteem and though I have never been diagnosed I feel that I have some symptoms of depression, which also, as I've read, can cause a decrease in intelligence. 5) Not efficiently exercising my brain by reading books or playing games like chess, but instead drowning myself in television with shows like Family Guy (which I don't do much of anymore) and non mentally stimulating activities such as browsing facebook/instagram/snapchat (which I still do quite frequently)

I have been obsessing over this for quite some time and I'm trying to find advice from anywhere possible. I'm sorry for the book but I just wanted to adequately explain where I'm coming from so you all can help evaluate my problem. 

Some notable things about me if that helps with finding an answer; I'm 17, have a family history of mental health issues, My dad is Polish/German/Irish and my mom is Filipino/Chinese/Pacific Islander, my mother died when I was 5 and my dad has had a few girlfriends since then eventually marrying again this year, I am overweight, I go to a very large, suburban, and wealthy school with many intelligent students, I'm enrolled in half Honors/AP half regular classes (used to be all Honors/AP), and most concerning to me is that I haven't read a book in about a year and don't read long non fiction stories frequently though I'm obsessed with biochemistry and pharmacology, reading many Wikipedia articles about certain drugs and bio molecules every night, I like most people take the easy way yet much of the time I don't consider it's repercussions, I am very good with trivia type knowledge, I am in S.I. and on the life smarts team (trivia game, tried out out of 100+ kids and got the second highest score), I am very eager to do well and usually take on more than I can handle, I start many projects without finishing them and I used to be an avid writer which I took deep interest in and was quite good at (yet I never ended up finishing many of my stories), In 7th grade I was an avid procrastinator, though I was one who got stuff done to the point of crying over the anxiety procrastinated homework or projects gave me, yet some point in my 8th grade year I realized nothing I do in middle school really matters for high school or college, so I can stop trying and enjoy myself which set a very bad precedent, and lastly I am a bit of a procrastinator. 

In fact I'm procrastinating right now on homework by writing this reddit post. Any advice would help because I'm finding that the more I obsess over this question to myself, the worse my craving for an answer becomes. I feel as if I have gotten wiser over time through my experiences yet for some reason I just feel as if I've reached my peak in mental processing power. Hopefully my writing style will help you all to digest my current intelligence level. I know my obsession with this is irrational yet due to its irrationality here we are to discuss it.",09Jan2018,0

142,"As of right now (1 day before the Spring semester is to start), I have failed fourteen classes for a total of 50 credit-hours. At a price of $171/credit-hour, this means I have spent $8500 on failed courses (this does not count the extra fees, which may even drive this figure up to an even ten thousand). I have also spent 10 of my 50 actual credit-hours on courses that do not count towards my engineering associate's (piano courses). I have learned a lot about myself from community college so far. I'm not going to pretend that none of it happened the way it did. Yes, I struggled with depression and loneliness, but I was a terrible student going in, and I have made the effort to improve myself and my studies. My mistakes have been lessons. I'm not here to justify my terrible performance, or claim that it was anything but my own fault.

Though my parents are covering half the costs of college, we have agreed that any failed courses would be on my dime. I am struggling to figure out where I would come up with this money, but I believe that if I wait tables at a decently nice place, keep my expenses to a minimum, and live at home, I will be able to come up with that money in under a year (I live in an expensive area, and it's not unusual for a waiter to make upwards of $100/day). In order to keep the tough work schedule going, though, I'm probably going to need to drop out of school.

I WANT to be an engineer, and I WANT to be a pianist. Writing this is extremely emotional for me. There is nothing I would hate more than to drop out of college. I just can't justify wasting more time, money, effort, and sanity on this than I already have. I really can't help but feel like I've made a four year, eight thousand dollar mistake.

My parents, teachers, and counselors are deeply supportive of me, and I know they will back me up no matter what road I decide to take. I do have the potential to do well in these courses, and that's why I keep going back over and over again. I CAN do it. In some cases, I DID do it, but failed the course on a technicality. But the issue I keep running into is, is that enough? I have the potential, and I'm putting in the work, but I'm not getting the results, and that is sending up some serious red flags for me about my future success in this system.

It's a tough, emotionally charged struggle with no easy answer. I've been trying for weeks to answer this on my own, and I haven't come up with anything. What's worse, everyone I go to for advice has conflicting answers based on whatever framing I gave the question. If I start with ""I feel like I'm not smart enough for college,"" they say I should finish the degree. If I start with ""I'm failing my engineering courses,"" they say I should switch majors. If I start with ""I just want to finish my engineering degree,"" they suggest that I might benefit from taking a gap year and working full time.

It feels like the choice is entirely mine about what to do, but I can't decide between these options. Today is the last day for me to make my decision, and I don't know what to do. Please help me.",09Jan2018,1

Nan has never had hobbies, she doesn't read, never got her license, doesn't cook, is afraid of trying anything new (never had a computer so technology is just foreign to her). The only thing she loves is to talk. She probably talked Pop's ears off but he was a quiet man who just listened to her prattle on about whatever rubbish.

The one thing she knows how to use is a phone. She calls my Dad (her only living son) multiple times a day. Nan just makes up some stuff about something not working or the neighbours doing something and Dad is fed up with it. He's about to retire because his boss is a prick, the last thing he wants is Nan calling to complain about something.

149,"An employee of a company in which I do necessary business as a regular customer gave me his ph# presumably wanting a date. 

Cannot avoid this business as there are no other options in town or within a reasonable distance.  The company is laid out in such a way that I never know whether I'll ""get"" him or not. 

When I first got him, he gave me his ph# and told me to put it in my cell to add to contacts. He said, ""Call me!""  Because I'm a non-confrontational person by nature, I just respond in a friendly manner. Didn't say whether I'd call him or not (I didn't).  Should have gone by my instincts, as his body language showed that he likes to be in control...... This was in retrospect after googling him, I found out he has a long criminal history! 

The mistake I made was being overly friendly and not giving any indication that I'm anything but single, and being a regular customer at the business in which he works, it'd be obvious anyway. I am single, never seen with a partner, etc.  

It will be awkward if I have to step foot in the place again.  The crimes he was prosecuted for in the past include domestic assault. 

He did nothing legally wrong......anyone can give someone else their phone number as long as it's not harassment or something.

150,"Hey guys,

Kinda a long one but I think it’ll all be relevant.

My wife and I (we’re in college and married young, I’m a computer science major) never really had a whole lot of issues but long story short, instead of talk to me about the few things she didn’t like about me she cheated on me with this other dude. It really took me by surprise because one day she acted like everything was normal and fine and the next she wanted to leave me and I found out she was cheating.

I kinda had to chock up my losses and basically just take the L though and I knew I had to leave. I did a lot of shit I kinda regret now though and I’ll list it I suppose:

-I let her new boyfriend know how much of a POS she is and that she fucked with a married woman. I knew it probably wouldn’t get through to him since he’s most likely thinking with the wrong head rn, but still worth a try.
-I also told her mom, who I love a lot, what she did too. She’s pretty religious and did not take kindly to her cheating. She’s always said I’m basically her son now and has always been supportive of me, so I kinda turned her mom against her too which I guess I feel kinda bad about.
-And lastly, I coded a keylogger (I am a CS major) and put it on her phone before I left. 

And the last one is just what’s really eating me up. Up to this point, I hadn’t offensively hacked anyone but I did make an exception for her and I feel pretty horrible about it. I have the passwords to basically every social media account and email on her phone, I can make out the gist of what she’s texting, etc. anytime I want and I can’t stop looking at everything. It’s eating me up because she meant so much to me and I know this is the opposite of how I move on but it’s hard to ‘log off’ and quit doing this. I’ve basically become a monster and a completely different person. I always valued people’s privacy, especially hers, and I never looked through her phone or anything of the sort.

151,"I live in a third story apartment with my girlfriend. We’re both attending university and live in an off campus apartment complex. Our neighbor is a middle-aged man who lives alone, keeps his house super tidy and decorates a lot for the holidays. More frequently than not I suppose, he gets very irate with himself, people on the phone, utility companies, etc. 

Upon move-in, we found each other walking out of our apartments at the same time so we introduced ourselves and he said “So you’re the new neighbors huh?” Nothing out of the ordinary honestly, but after some strange chain of coincidences tonight, it kind of came off unnerving looking back at it. 

Tonight he did his usual routine of playing music extremely loud with his front door wide open for all of us around him to hear, began yelling about stuff to himself, and slamming stuff/his door every so often. But what he was yelling about was more concerning. 

My girlfriend and I walked into our apartment, shut the door, locked it, and put the chain lock on like we always do. He began to yell almost immediately after we walked in and closed the door, so I decided to listen because half the time it’s kind of amusing. “ALWAYS LOCKING THE CHAIN. WHAT THE FUCK”

“I LIVED THERE FOR 7 YEARS”

“EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE IS SO STUPID.”

My amusement turned to concern as I became aware that he was talking about us and our apartment in particular. How would he know about us locking the chain lock on our door? Could he hear it, even over the blaring music? Why did he yell about living here for 7 years? Why are we all stupid, in this “shitty little town” as he liked to call it?

Anyway, I thought that was strange, but I shrugged it off and went about my business. His music was turned off and door slammed shut, for a few hours at least. It began back up for a few hours until a little past midnight, when I was finally kind of over it and went to my girlfriend to ask if we should call the 24/7 apartment security to see if they can tell him to stop the disturbances late into the night. She agreed and then I notice it immediately stopped the moment she began to look up the number. 

I was over the strange coincidence aspect of it now, and I am questioning whether he knows what we’re doing out of bitterness, envy, delusion, etc. I can’t put my finger on it, it feels like the movie Disturbia lol. 

We are going to be talking to the office/property manager tomorrow, and while this is all speculation obviously, we felt it necessary to address our concerns and safety while living here. Despite the conspiracy level accusations, he is a disturbance quite often with his music and fits, but is there any other cautionary steps we should take? Do we even bother getting police involved over a potential bugging of our apartment? I don’t know if he has a key to our place (“I lived there for 7 years!”) or if he has deep rooted scorn for whoever lives here (“oh so you’re the new neighbors huh?”) , but I’m slightly in fear and was wondering what next steps we should take besides talking to the office. 

We are hoping they can relocate us to a different unit, but I feel like our luck as of late has been kind of piss poor and they won’t abide by this. Just looking for some advice on the matter. ",09Jan2018,1
152,"I work for company X. This company is in the line of business where   things often change: either we're dealing with different customers, we're hiring new people (because of the amount of people leaving), etc. It's flexible, if that makes sense. The hours I work are never really consistent. Blah blah blah. 

Well, there's big talk about some upcoming changes within the company, about hiring new employees, and moving people up in the company. There's several positions that are potentially, well...open. What I mean by ""open"" is that there's positions within the company, specifically my job location, that won't have anybody assigned to that position due to the previous person moving to a different location, moving up, etc. 

I am what you consider to be a regular associate. Technically, the job I have is the job I've had since I started working for the company X amount of years ago. Part of being a regular associate is doing the regular responsibilities that I originally applied for. 

HOWEVER...

Throughout my career, I've really established myself. Over the past couple or so years, I've learned how to do things here and there, and it's gotten to the point where I've become a back-up for my superiors. The difference between my superiors and I is that they've been doing it longer than I have, and I just don't have the title. 

Sometime last year, I've talked to the highest superior at my location and expressed that I'm tired of being ""the backup."" I've learned a lot of responsibilities; some of those responsibilities, I was required to learn because you have to if you wanted to move up. 

One responsibility in particular is extremely stressful. It's a mentally engaging job that requires attention to detail and all that stuff. It's the hardest job...mentally, that I've encountered since I've started working for this company. 

It just so happens that I'm the only regular associate that knows how to do this job. There's at least one more person who knows how to do it, but he's actually my boss's boss. So if the main guy who does this job decides to call out or whatever, I'm literally the only guy who can take over. 

This guy, let's call him John, wants out of his position. Unfortunately, he wants to do what I would LIKE to do (which is a position that many regular associates go into next). I've expressed to all my bosses, in one way or another, that I would do John's job ""if I absolutely had to."" Some of my bosses know more about how I feel than others do (especially the higher bosses). 

Regardless, I have a very strong feeling that I'll be asked to do what John's doing because, if I were them, it would make sense. I already know how to do the position, so there's really not much training involved. It would be a simple transition: John takes the position that I want so he can do something different, and I take John's position to become something other than a backup. 

But that's exactly what I don't want. I don't want John's position. I want the position that I've wanted since I started working there. Nobody wants John's position. Nobody. I originally learned how to do it because it was something new to learn, and I've wanted to establish myself. Apparently that was a mistake on my end, because John mistook that as me showing interest in the job. He thought that I was his out. 

Several of my bosses say that I shouldn't take John's job. It would be a ""mistake."" They tell me all these things about previous people who worked that job, that it won't help me grow, etc etc. 

I've actually been a back-up for the position I want for the past couple of months, so it would be an easy transition to get the official title on the job that I want, as well. I'm qualified for both positions, but I feel like I'm going to get John's position simply for their convenience. 

It's great that I have these potential opportunities, but the question is...what is my best course of action? 

**Knowing what little you know about my predicament, what would you do?**

I've considered some possibilities. 

- If I decide to take John's job, I tell them about what people have said about the job, my desire to move up towards something else, and negotiate for a salary that persuades me to be okay with dealing with the stress temporarily.

- Downright saying ""thanks but no thanks,"" and wait for another opportunity at becoming what I want to become. But that would entail continuing being a backup for John's job, as well as other doing other responsibilities that I don't want to do. It also probably wouldn't sit well with my higher bosses, and I'd be less likely to be considered for the job I want. 

Maybe other options with slight variations from option 1 and 2. 

Like I said, there's something big coming up, so I need a game plan soon. I've talked to the man who is in charge of all those position changes, so talking to him again about the same thing would be overkill. 

What's a man to do in this situation?  Please help!",09Jan2018,8

156,"Let's start off with freshman year; it all started off in Year 9 I was the new kid didn't know anyone. I met Person A who was a hardcore gamer (which I was/am not) and seemed alright. Wasn't into drugs but I would say he was weird. Later came to realize he was a talkshit and I mean he talked so much shit behind my back and still does. Anyways through him I met Person B who was in short a rude, sexual and disgusting person. The friendship was pretty negative we always insulted eachother and mocked eachother.

In the following year, Person 3 moved to our school. Person 3 was an overall racist asshole. Somehow the other two befriended him and he joined us. The friendships started getting really negative. Once I ended up punching Person 2 as a result of him kicking my backside (Yes I know assault and etc) and this resulted in him crying. But thankfully nothing happened from there. The friendships kept on getting more negative. Negative insults here and there. There were positive times but hardly ever. I also use to get in to trouble with them often. The company was bad and I was an idiot to befriend them. I guess I was desperate.

Now in 2016, the trio started ganging up on me and started ditching me, talking shit behind my back and so on. Eventually I had enough and tackled person 3 which resulted in him getting bruised. He took me to the deans I explained them everything and the dean had us sit in a room for a restoration. Which went absolutely nowhere. I came to my senses and knew I could do better, I smartened up and moved the fuck on. The holidays were just around the corner at that time a week away. As the holidays started those 3 compiled all the photos they had of me sourced them together made a collage slideshow in a video format and told me to kill myself and uploaded it to YouTube as soon as Person 3 found out I was going to get the dean he deleted the video but I was ahead of the game and downloaded the videos. This shit really lowered my self esteem and I since then have deleted all my photos on social media. In total 2 videos were uploaded by Person 2 and Person 3. This resulted in Person 2 getting suspended. They started talking even more shit. At the end of the year Person 2 failed and I think Person 3 did as well.

Now 2017 was a pretty calm year. Person 2 and 3 ended up dropping out as a result of their grades. But before they did they hyped shit and talked so much shit. Then they dropped out. The weird thing is they can't even look at me in the eye but they can tell someone so and so should kill themselves behind a screen or the persons back. Was a pretty uneventful year regardless they did make one instagram account by the lines of ""bumholesixtynine123"" and set the email address as my school email or well I am certain it is them as I get along with everyone else.

Now 2018... I just came back from holiday today checked my facebook and there was a friend request... it had my name. The exact same spelling and had an image of a food which my ethnicity is known for eating an example of this is Mexicans and Tacos. The same for my ethnicity. This page had references to pedophilia, rape, racism and so on. Like in short what the fuck do I do? The school cannot do anything. 2 of them have dropped out.

158,"I'm almost done with a degree, which strongly relates to Human Computer Interaction. After this, I can do a post graduate / master degree in HCI. However, before this, I studied Electrical Engineering (with a specialization which I will not name, but for all intents and purposes it was 85% EE). I struggled especially with the math heavy classes, and got to a point where I failed too much and had no more motivation and decided to switch, so I could at least move forward. Please don't judge me too harshly for this. Now I have two choices (well I have more but I want to specifically look at this), I can further specialize in this HCI like master, or buckle up and finish the EE related bachelor. I must confess neither of these things is my ""passion"" , whatever that really means anyway, and I am not sure what my true passion would be anyway. There are things I enjoy a lot more though. There were subjects I couldn't stand within the EE major (I did not like Systems and Control Systems at all) and I generally don't like math very much. Wasn't great in high school, just good enough. Basically really not that talented at math. I am very worried that if I try again at the EE related degree, that I will fail again or get discouraged too much when the going gets tough. I realize it is useful to learn to overcome that kind of stuff but I really do not know if I am ready for this yet. And I truly can't afford to fail. Also because I know this would leave me in a total mess.

159,"Hey r/advice. I’m struggling a bit with an online friend situation. I’m a college freshman, so once I moved to college, my irl life turned around and I’ve been doing pretty well socially.

Online is a different story. There are a lot of people online who I’ve known for years. I’m struggling with whether to break off most of these friendships or not.

I have a chronic issue with not being able to open up to people. I’ll tell white lies for no reason, avoid talking about myself, and have a complete inability to express my feelings. (And yes, I’m a girl. ): ) When I feel close to someone, I feel too shy to tell them. If someone upsets me, I just stew in it or act passive aggressive because I don’t have the bravery to face them. I know that this is wrong.

My online friends are pretty bad about staying in touch, even though we’ve known each other for years with constant contact. I’m always the one who has to message first. They’ve never made it seem like they dislike me, but it’s frustrating to live like this. I tested this during December by not messaging a single one of them. Not a single person messaged me for the month, even when I ended up getting an IV (it wasn’t anything super serious, but I didn’t say that) and uploaded pictures to snapchat and twitter, where they all follow me.

They frequently lean on me for emotional support and they certainly don’t mind taking my birthday/Christmas gifts, but they’re never there to support me. I gave all of my friends expensive presents for their birthdays. Only one of them gave me a gift for my birthday near the end of the year. One of the ones who didn’t give me anything said happy birthday, said they were working on a present, then never brought it up again. Whatever, I don’t really care about presents, it’s more about them thinking of me... for Christmas, none of them got me a present. I had prepared to get gifts for all of them but returned them when it was clear I wasn’t even going to get so much as a happy birthday text!

These people are very close to others in their individual online lives, and it’s frustrating that I never seem to get closer to anyone myself.

I’m really not sure what I’m doing wrong here. I’m pretty popular IRL (not to brag, just trying to provide more insight). I’m in a sorority, have a few large friend groups as well as ~6 or 7 close friends within those groups. I’m also friends with many random people on campus. I text people and hang out often. I don’t think it’s an issue with my social skills because of this? But at the same time, I’m more open to people IRL.

What should I do? Talk to them, or are they just not worth the time? Or is it something I’m doing wrong?",09Jan2018,1

168,"I got rear ended today, about 20 minutes before I heard I got my dream job. Wild. My neck and head hurt, and I think it's best I skip my flight in the morning to LA, take care of myself tomorrow, and fly in on Wednesday, the day it's supposed to start. 

This kind of kills two birds with one stone. It saves me having to worry about what to do with myself tomorrow in LA, when I need to spend some time healing, as well as some funds that I won't have to spent in LA since I'm getting there 24 hours later.

How do I bring this up in a way that makes me seem like a strong team player? I'm not supposed to work until Wednesday morning, after I get in. So, it's just cutting it super close. I could go to LA in a couple of hours, when my flight leaves, but I just don't think that's the best idea.

190," Ok this is somewhat of a petty question, but it still bothers me. I'm a 15f, sophomore in high school, and this was a shitty fucking year. Ive made a huge mistake and lost my best friend who wouldn't accept my apology and attempt to make it better all because of a boy. He then was an emotional replacement and became my ""best friend"" (complicated ass relationship). He can be a great guy, helped me a lot, but he has a lot of emotional power over me. Almost every week I would cry because of him for some reason,became socially withdrawn, and I would get anxiety attacks by being with him. Oh, did I mentioned I distanced my self from my other friends because I emotionally connect with him 50x more than I ever did with them and because he said I have bad friends (don't blame him, we weren't that close) ? Luckily he dropped me. I've been trying to find my way back ever since. 

In the midst of this, I sit with a friend (call her J) at lunch this year. I spend more time being with J then my actual best friend, and the few times I try to see my best friend at lunch (our friend was highkey dying because of my anxiety towards her and the mistake I made), she told me ""I really wanna throw this milk in your face right now."" I still liked her, because I forgave her for saying that shit, like wow bitch, go fuck yourself. For the other parts J's pretty nice, likes me alot, because apparently I'm her only friend at this school since she just came this year.

I feel withdrawn from my classes, I have friends or acquaintances in barely any of my classes. If I do, there's a fucking class, I can't just talk. Lunch is my escape time,the one time I can maybe finally sit with people and not feel lonely  and anxious 2/3 of the time. I have to spend it with her ass;when I see her less and see other people or mostly, get some quiet time, she gets annoyed. When I told J I can't sit with her everyday since I have other friends, she almost felt like crying. When I invite her to come with my me to see the other people, she refuses. Like please let me be happy. J was there when I felt like I had no one, that's why I stuck with her;she hugs me when ever I see her. I even plan to buy her chocolate for sticking with me. But seeing more people and friends is what will finally make me happy,I feel lonely as fuck this year. I lost a lot of fucks for her to the point now I just want her to fuck off but still like her.

191,"So, long story short. I'm a hairstylist. I've been doing hair for 3 years now. I enjoy aspects of being a cosmetologist, but day to day salon life? Its killing me. 

Its been a slow burn, but my husband has noticed the decline in my mental and physical health as well. Some highlights:

* The constant need to be ""on"" socially in the salon has made me straight up hermit-like when I'm not working. I dont want to go to social functions, I dont want to spend time with friends. I snap at people with a moments notice. Its unhealthy. 
* Anxiety. I've struggled with anxiety for most of my life. It was largely under control, until the past 2 years or so. I have trouble sleeping every single night when I have to work the next day. The only thing that helps are sleeping pills, which I dont want to make a habit of. I sit in my car before work frequently... just crying. Crying with anxiety over what the day will bring, feeling trapped, dreading another day of being treated like garbage by clients with unrealistic, insane expectations. 
* My back is constantly in excruciating pain from the long hours on my feet. I have flares of plantar fasciitis. After this past holiday season in the salon, my hands were so stiff I could barely move. I feel like I spend all my time off laying in bed.
* I've gained probably 30 lbs in the past 2 years, which just makes the above issue worse. Stylists dont get lunch breaks, so you shovel whatever you can down your gullet. I fainted last year from dehydration and was hospitalized. My schedule is split shift garbage and most nights I'm too exhausted to cook anything. I hate how I look and hate how I feel.

Looking at this all written out, its just absurd this is even a question to me, because most of all? *I dont need the money*. I am lucky enough that my husband makes more than enough for us to be very, very comfortable. He has told me time and time again that he supports me in whatever I choose to do, even if that means taking a sabbatical from work entirely for a while to heal emotionally and physically, going back to school, focusing on my art (my paintings are my true passion. i havent painted in 2 years because im too fucking exhausted and depressed). 

I dont even make enough working for either of us to notice that money is gone - I work 32 hours a week on commission but am frequently expected to stay well after close, unpaid to clean up. My w2 says I made 15k in 2017. I do get tips, but its still not much and I spend so much on supplies to do color and maintaining my tools (my boss is cheap and only buys the cheapest of materials, so we lack what we need to do a lot of the more modern coloring techniques), that I doubt I even make minimum wage. My sanity isnt worth minimum wage. 

So why the hell am I having such a hard time quitting? I've considered a few options, but I'm still paralyzed with fear of actually leaving this job. 

* My boss/owner means well, but she takes people quitting personally. I havent seen a single person successfully leave the salon without my boss making a scene and turning it into a giant drama bomb. She believed in me when I was fresh out of school and has fed me lots of clients (granted, she profits off that as well, me being commission and all), so I feel like I'm leaving her high and dry, and frankly I'm scared of how she will react. I'm scared of what she will say and think about me. I'm scared of losing the friends I've made there. 

* On the surface, to those who dont know how little I really make and how much I'm falling apart, I look oh so super successful. My hair work gets a lot of attention. About a year ago I was selected to be an ambassador to a very well known, VERY popular hair product company. They flew me all expenses paid to several hair shows, and for several days for what was essentially a luxury vacation. They give me a substantial product credit in exchange for using and featuring their product on my social media pages. I just learned I'll owe taxes on all of this as if it were income, something that wasnt disclosed. I dread thinking how much will be owed, there. 

* For the above reasons, my parents love to brag about me. My husband and I are well off solely due to his job. We enjoy the nice things we have solely due to him. My parents are clueless, and my husband is such a wonderful human he lets them believe I have anything to do with the nice things we enjoy. Due to my anxiety, it took me a long time to really behave as a functioning adult, so even though this success is fake and superficial, i cant help but feel they'll see me as a lazy quitter if I leave this job and this industry. 

I feel stuck, reddit. What do I do? Am I right to want to leave? How can I just cut ties and do it already? What the hell is stopping me?

I work $13.50 an hour on a job I don't know I'll have for much longer. I spend a total of $18 a day on Uber to go and leave work. Uber is taking up a majority of my expenses. Unfortunately it's a necessity to get to work. I have no way of getting to work without it. 

She's asking me for $500 a month plus $180 for a bedroom set I never wanted or asked for. She bought me clothes for Christmas and asks me to pay her back. I never asked for these clothes and would have easily gotten them myself if I needed them. Every time I call her out on it, she acts like she's doing me a favor and I'm being ungrateful. 

I tell her after I get paid, I won't have money for Uber to go to work and because she works 2 jobs, she can't give me rides to work. She doesn't care.

194,"Context: My current wife is a foreigner who has been in the US illegally for years. She married a US citizen for a green card years ago and paid him money. He took her money, so the marriage was annulled. She then married an illegal immigrant and had a child. They divorced after 8 years. Following that, she posted online looking for someone to marry for a green card in exchange for money. Later on, we met and she told me she was illegally in the country. I’m a citizen. I accepted her situation, fell in love with her, and we married. She is in the process of receiving her permanent green card. She has lied to me many times and I’ve caught her. She has done devious things like secretly taking pictures of my medications, check cards, etc in my safe, which I had given her access to, and had her friend order a USB thumb drive that records audio so she could record our conversations/fights that I found out about. Her explanation was she was gathering evidence to show the immigration people it was a legitimate marriage in case I divorced her, which I was threatening to do. She says she married me for love, but there have been many red flags. We are currently legally separated. I told her that before I would be willing to reconcile and move back in together, she would need to complete and pass a polygraph test regarding whether she is married to me for love or for her green card and also whether she has done any deceptive behaviors again since the last time I found things. She feels like this is unbelievable, that I am trying to humiliate her, and she points to how these tests are only pseudo-science and worthless.

Am I in the wrong to ask her to do this? I feel like this would, in a sense, wipe the slate clean if she passes and put us on a foundation we can try to build something from with honesty.

I felt really betrayed because I loved my mother a lot and beleived it when she said she wasn't lying, currently my dad is at work and my mom was threatened that he was going to kill her when he gets home. 


I asked why she did it and she told me that my dad didn't give us enough money to support our family, our family has a debt of over 7000 usd so she ""made friends with him"" in order to get his help, she ofcourse didn't tell us everything since my siblings are young but my dad did send me the voice messages over and it was really depressing to listen to, it was pretty nasty so I stopped after the first one I don't even want to start listening to the other 8 messages.

As much as my dad seems like the victim here, he's not. He used to have relationships with multiple women when we were young and my mother couldn't do anything because he used to beat her. The only reason she didn't leave was because of us since she had no way to support us financially.

It's so bad that I considered not submitting it at all, but in the end I decided it's better to at least not get a zero. I've been really worried about this and it's becoming hard to concentrate on other things because I keep thinking about how bad it is and how everyone is going to laugh at it (and me). 

I asked my teacher if we could skip showing mine and she said no (I'm pretty sure this is a common question haha). She just said ""You'll probably find it's not as bad as you think it is"". We are watching the films through youtube though (we submitted our assignments by sharing the link), so I could make the video private and hold it hostage for a while, but that might cause a scene and will probably make my teacher hate me, and I don't want to cause a scene and make my teacher hate me.

What should I do? Is there any way I can not show the movie and also not get on her nerves?",09Jan2018,3

 At the moment I go to a public school. I have gone to 3 different primary schools and they’ve all been public.

The thing is I have an option to move to a private school next year or stay at this public school. 
I don’t really have any friends at this public school besides 1 so when she’s away I sit in the toilet stall or in the library when it’s open. This ‘friend’ is not really a great friend though. 
I have never in my life been able to make a friend so the thought of moving schools is terrifying because I’ve been at this school for 5 years (it goes from reception to year 12)  but I also want a fresh start. 
I can’t stop thinking “Is private school a good option?” “Will I have better learning opportunities or will I just be lonely and miserable.” 

I was wondering if anybody has any advice on if I should move or not.

One of my best friends just had an extension on a sentencing for sexual assault, but it is still likely he will go to prison.

The sentencing is imminent, but I don't want him to complete suicide. He still has so much to live for, but it seems that his grip on life is truly slipping this time. What can I can do about this?

210,"I currently am a college student and work two part time jobs. My second job is at a large office that has strict attendance policies based on points. I had a couple of points over the past few months but I wasn’t close to going over the limit until recently. Now apparently I’m over it.

I was up most of the night sick one day last week and ended up sleeping through my alarm the next morning. I called in immediately after waking up but they want a doctors note now. I do not have one because I didn’t go to the doctor because it was just a cold/the flu and I didn’t want to spend $75 going to the ER (I currently don’t have a GP and can’t use the student health center until a couple weeks from now without paying around the same amount) for something I knew would resolve itself. 

Today I went in to talk to HR and they told me that I had another absence in the past that is very serious because it is listed that I left early without approval. When I looked at it, I saw that the day it happened was a day that I had requested the last 2.5 hours off of way in advance, had been approved and I double checked whether it was okay that day. I wouldn’t not have left without knowing it was okay.

Is there anything that I can do about this besides talking to HR? I’m not sure I’m fired yet because they still have to talk to scheduling and another HR person, but I’m scared this is going to make future employers not want to hire me. 

I have never been fired, but this seems like an unacceptable reason that I don’t think employers will be understanding about. Is there anything I can say to future employers that will make them still give me a chance with this on my record?

211,"Hello I am a college student who recently switched majors. 

My last major required me to take a lower level calculus 1 one class. 

My new major requires me to take both the higher level calculus 1 and calculus 2. I can take an online placement exam and get out of calculus 1 and head straight into calc 2. If I score high enough. 

My issue is that I took my original calc 1 class a year ago and would not do well on the placement exam if I did not google answers. (I would not be able to skip the higher level calc 1). 

I do not want to pay to retake a class I have ""already"" taken.

I might struggle in the harder calc 2 if I cheat on the placement exam but I feel I am a good enough student to still do well. 

I want to do well in the classes that I take. I also don't want to pay unnecessary money. 

I am at a big university so the cost per class is ungodly high. 

What advice do you have on the matter? What are some new ways on thinking about this issue?

214,"I am in college. I have been renting a place with few rooms that have paper walls with a roommate for 2.5 years. This year is getting insane. He plays video games and talks on skype literally entire day until 2-5 am every day. 

I can't fall asleep. I have to wait until 3 am+- until he goes to sleep. I can't have peace at day since every day there is constantly non stop conversation going. It's so annoying. 

So what have I tried to do to stop this madness? 

* Talking to him. He agrees to be silent and then everything repeats itself. I have anxiety so it's hard to even force myself to talk to him, but when I do and it has 0 effect next day, it's so damn annoying. He always makes excuses and justifies himself. 

*  Talking to a person that rents us the apartment and him talking to my roommate. We had a conflict few weeks ago. His drunk friend attacked me because I was not letting him sleep in my room. I had to call the cops to throw him out. So I had to talk to a person that rents us the apartment so he would have the conversation with my room mate. He told my roommate to not have any friends around and to not be loud. One week goes by, he is talking on skype at 3 am again and I can't sleep again. 

Nothing works. Yesterday I got so annoyed when he was loud at night that I spent entire hour learning how to control our internet modem using my phone to disable the internet from distance for him. I disabled the internet at 2:10 am and then he spent 20 minutes trying to fix it, he failed and went to sleep (thank god) after that I fell asleep in like 5-10 minutes .

If I do that again today, He will understand that it's not the internet, but me messing with the internet. He tends to get mad.

What should I do? What would you do? Should I just shut down his internet that we both pay for at 12 pm and that's it. But he will be mad, so idk, plus anxiety...

1. Work at agency where friend is working. With her recommendation I would pretty much get the job. I would work on really high profile projects and I would learn a lot and I could start in a month, also really great work culture. Only thing is the commute that would be about 55 mins and maybe 1hr 20 with traffic, I'm not sure how sustainable this is past a couple years (however working from home 1 day a week is a possibility). It would also mean my bf and I would have to get another car asap (we're currently buying a house as well so I'm really stressed about new house/new car/new job all within a month and I feel like maybe it's not the right time?).

2. Look for job in my city. It may take a few months for something decent to pop up and I doubt I could land a job as cool as no. 1, but I could probably have a commute under 15 mins and have more of social life. We could also get by on one car. I'm going in blind so I won't know what the culture is like or what the work is like. As well, it may not boost my career like option no 1 would long term.

Im a 27 year old male with a wife and 9 month old daughter. When I was younger I never took school seriously at all. I did poorly in high school but graduated and went to college. I struggled in college because I was too immature to apply myself and see the bigger picture. After 2 years of college, I dropped out and started working full time. I started working in sales and have done okay and worked my way up to a higher position in a different department handling finances. Its a very stressful industry with a lot of hours. I make good money for not being a college grad but I want to get out of the industry and work a more stable, salary type, 9-5 job with room to grow. I've gained a tremendous amount of business experience but unfortunately with out a degree I wont have much of a chance in todays work world. I want to better my families future and would literally do anything it took to make that happen. Everything I do is for them.

With that being said, can I get back into college? online or night school? even thought i dropped out about 7 years ago?

he has been messaging younger girls (25-30) for over a year now and my mum has confronted him several times when she has seen messages. there are a few he gives money to or buys food for and a few he asks for photos from. he was messaging one woman when my parents were on a date for their anniversary. he messaged her stuff about bondage. and my mum eventually was sick of not knowing who he was speaking to all the time so she collected evidence and confronted him. he said none of it was serious, he's always joking and has never cheated

yesterday he came home and was oblivious to the fact that i was there because he was too busy messaging someone so i zoomed in on my camera to see and it was a girl who is engaged to a man that works with my dad. i was reading the messages for maybe 5 minutes. 

she told my dad she loves him and wants him and he shouldnt doubt her. 
he told her he has been hurt by her before and has offered to introduce her to family and profess his undying love for her. 
she told him she thought they were getting somewhere to live and he told her he will come and meet her after work. 
when he meets her he tells us he is going to the office so there is some obvious suspicion there.

im pretty sure they only go for coffee and to talk. and i know she has sent him nudes. but clearly this is going too far now.

he was also messaging the girls fiance asking how their relationship is, the reply was that she is stressed at work and it's affecting their relationship

he was on the phone to a friend the morning before i saw the messages telling him that my mum/his wife wants to discuss the relationship and he might need to move out for 5/6 weeks. which is not true. think he is trying to cover himself amongst friends in case they find out


tldr; dad has been messaging girls inappropriately for over 2 years. denies any actual cheating if mum asks. i saw messages between him and one girl saying he will introduce her to family and profess his undying love and leaves home to meets her after work for coffee whilst telling us he is going to the office

233,"TL;Dr: should I talk to a girl who can't choose between me and another guy who she sort Of fucked me over with? She came back to me and keeps coming, but I feel like a backup.
LONG STORY AHEAD!!!!!
Backstory: for since around October we've started talking. Just us two, apparently she was friends with this guy but she was invested only in me.
 We got along very well, I had enough charm to catch her and well it was sort of great when  we hung out. Although I turtled my feeling and got angry at miniscule things.The thing is: I had sort of a nice guy attitude. 
Basically I would get angry and small things or angry she ignored me or didn't text back. She was very iffy, for I am an attached fellow. I constantly didn't know how she felt or what was going on, and well One week before she left for Christmas vacay, we clicked very well, untill one Friday right after a heart to heart I blew up about a misunderstanding. She had given me chances before when I blew up and that was apparently the last straw.
 To my defense, she was always unsure about me, citing red flags of her ex. Constantly comparing me and well not giving me the time of day because she either ""didn't know about me"" or was flip floppy about me. She never really gave me a chance(in my eyes). Of course I fully fucked up multiple times, but she was always apprehensive and never talked to me about things, which she recognized. I recognized that I just fucked up, big time. 
Fast forward, she flip flops around some more. Telling me she wants to talk, not talking to me per usual, and I'm just trying to figure out what's going on, confused. We stop talking because of a falling out where I was really pissed about how she was treating me. She was supposedly done, but winds up texting me again. We finally get to a point where I'm purposefully being ignore. I call her, we chat. She says She's had some time to finally think and tells me that she's willing to give me a try when she gets back.
 Over the break I had been working hard, changing myself and my thinking. Trying to be a great guy for me.
 So she tells me this, and it's set in stone. I ask her if she's talking to someone else, for I don't want to be strung on while this is happening. She said no.

Fast forward next day of being ignored I call her and she tells me she's starting to like this other guy after a couple of days(compared to our ~ three months). She just flipped on me, again, and lied to my face. Just threw me away, I feel. Another falling out, suicidal stuff. we stop talking. I treated her horribly from New year's to about a day ago, texting her ""I hope your new year is complete shit and wish nothing good happens"". So cut to maybe the 6th.
I've made a complete 180 in thinking body and mind I feel.  Some things are still there, hence why I've come for help, but none the less I very made a significant change. Her big deal was that she needed to see a change from those red flags. However she never gave me that chance to.
Around the 6th I finished a song in which I used her voice, a few recordings of when we were together. I thought it'd be fair if I at least shared it with her, despite us not having communication. 
I did it in a mean spirited way, saying I used her voice and then telling her to go away when she stared asking more and more questions. Later that night she said ""you have a good heart. I'm sorry I hurt you."" I tell her how I don't believe that for she wouldn't have done what she did to me. 
Anyway, less details: we talk on the phone. She says she isn't sure about this guy, that she sees some things she wouldn't like and that maybe he just wants a gf just to want one. Now I'm sitting here like..what the fuck?? Now you want to talk to me?? I listen to her problems, and decide to coax her into giving me another chance. 
We talk again in person though. She said Yes on the phone, then she flipped irl. She tells me that she's unsure about this guy, not sure if she wants to hurt him or me. I'm saying if she was so easy to hurt me, but not this guy what's the point of another chance because obviously she feels for this kid more than me. 
She's constantly telling her problems with him, and saying how she can't promise me that they won't start dating. she keeps telling me she really wants to give me a chance, but is unsure about her and the other guy. He's been there for when we blew up or my mean texts. Obviously she keeps coming back to me, we Have something that they don't. 
Now we've settled on giving it a try, but she can't promise me anything like her choosing to be alone, with this guy or me. I'm supposed to show her that I've changed, but if this guy starts doing right, then she doesn't know I assume. 
Here's my problem, should I continue to even entertain this potential relationship if she's talking to this guy? I personally don't like the idea of trying to romance her while she's doing the same with someone else, which I feel is okay. She said logically from our past she liked him, but heart she has for me. 
Not only, I invited her somewhere and she's worried about how it'll make him feel and how he'll be worried that I'm with her because of the falling outs. She doesn't want to hurt him, like she hurt me and gave this guy such an easy chance comparable to me.
That means she must really like him more than me, right?
 We've discussed this. What should I do? Should I continue to try and show her I'm the better choice? I have a problem with this because she'll be talking to this guy while I'm trying to woo her. And there is always the chance of them getting together. I just kind of feel usedBut is it worth trying for this girl that's also feeling for this guy in a way? Should I continue talking to her while she's also talking to someone else? 
The reason she would seem to not date him seem kind of thin: he seems clingy, he seems uninterested in her feelings, he seems like he like he likes the idea of a girlfriend, and he kind of pressured her to come back earlier. 
These could all be valid reasons, but they seem like thin reasons that i feel maybe she'll get over. She likes him because he understood her, while she ignored me...for him he didn't have problems with it (when she never gave me the chance to understand her, virtually at all. we've discussed this). He's been there for her when i was being mean after the falling out.

I first met him a little over a year ago; he lives in Australia and I in America, so he only visits for weeks at a time, and these visits could have 8+months between them. 

Last year, we had feelings for each other. The issue at the time: I had a boyfriend. In the end, we got lunch together the day he left and that was that. 

For the next 12 months, we spoke every single day. Our snapchat streak rose well into 300, and the only days we lost communication was the weekend my phone broke and had to wait a few days for it to be replaced.

It’s obvious our feelings are still there, and that they’ve gotten stronger (considering the amount of flirting that’s been going on). But there is still one issue. 

He has a girlfriend back home. 

Now it’s the same situation as a year ago, just flipped, and I have no clue what to do.  

How can I approach the situation to him before he leaves, in a respectful way? I don’t want to be mean and cause the other girl to feel horrible by stealing her boyfriend, but if I do nothing then he and I could possibly never happen.

240,"Almost 6 years ago I moved with my then-boyfriend, now fiancé from Oregon to an oilfield town in West Texas. We relocated for his job. 

Since moving here, I have gained 40 lbs. (my own fault due to stress eating), had panic attacks, have been robbed, have had my car broken into, have had my car totaled after being hit by an oilfield truck, and have been extremely  depressed for most of the time

I have no friends or family here. All the friends I did have moved away because they got better opportunities in better cities, or because they just couldn’t stand living here any longer. There is nothing to do here but drink. There are no trees. You can’t drink the water from the tap. It’s 5 hours away from any major city. 

We have both been regularly applying to jobs for the past 2 years or so. We’ve gotten close a few times, but have never received any final job offers in other cities. Both of our fields are extremely competitive.

I am originally from a large city in Texas, so I’m at the point where I feel like I need to drop everything and move back in with my parents. I am almost 31, so this is NOT an ideal option. I would prefer to move with a job lined up, but I don’t know how much longer I can wait. I also feel awful about the prospect of leaving my fiancé behind, he is just as depressed as I am. My job now is fine, but I am getting burned out. I’ve been promoted a few times, but can’t make further advancements in my field without a masters degree. I do feel that my sadness is affecting my job performance. 

I have tried volunteering, exercising, antidepressants and therapy, and traveling/leaving town as much as possible, but I don’t know how much longer I can stand it.

I'm not sure what to do in this situation, I have a friend who's suffering from mental issues (she's under 18), she's been very self-destructive/suicidal during the past couple months.

I've been trying to talk her into getting help but recently I found out that her mother doesn't want her to get help. Her mother's reasoning for this is that ""having diagnosed mental stuff will affect her future!! blabla""..

How exactly can I stay motivated to learning new skills and improving upon them?

248,"Her test contradicts the book which, because this is an online class, is the only material we have to learn by. Additionally, she is giving us information that is just outright wrong. For example, one of her test questions was based on the assumption that the defining characteristic of a chordate is a vertebral column, which is false. That's true of the subphylum vertebrata, but there can be chordates without backbones because a notochord is not the same as a veterbral column as she told me.  




When I brought several questions to her attention, she just emailed me back the correct answer according to the test, as if she didn't read my reasoning at all. Her test questions are wrong and it could mean the difference between an A and a B for me.

I've struggled with depression for years and left my previous course (zoology) after two years because of this. Now that I've had professional help and discovered some new hobbies, I want to apply for a new course in computer science.

Because this is how I feel and this is why I think I may be a better candidate than most. I know that I want a career in computer science. 
I'm very aware of my mental state and have a solid team/safety net of family and friends to keep me up should I need it.

251,"My cousin says that boys and girls school are better because you learn to hang out with both genders so you have more experiences for college or work. Meanwhile, in an all girls school, girls have it difficult in the future because some of them didn’t grown up with boys (excluding girls who had activities outside school). 

I go to an all girls school, and many of my friends get boy-crazy when a brother or cousin of another girl comes to the school. Others know boys from classes outside school or social media. I go to classes outside school so I have a little experience with boys, but, for me, it’s strange to hang out with boys due to being with girls all the time.

252,"I have a job offer so I can leave Chicago, Illinois to Denver, Colorado (pays more and better overall career move...the details aren't super important). The family guilt trip is starting and I'm concerned that my girlfriend won't like the area and will want to move back. Worth mentioning that she was a champion of the, ""Let's quit our jobs and move the hell away from here."" Now that it's a reality we're both like ""Oh shit this is real. Holy cow."" 


My family isn't really that much of a support network and I don't have many close friends. I doubt I'll feel all that homesick - I went to Minneapolis for college and it went smoothly. My girlfriend, on the other hand, has a ton of friends and much more significant support such that I'm concerned that she won't like the new city despite saying she's excited and will be fine with it. She's good at making friends and already has a few connections in Denver, but I'm essentially asking her to leave her old friends behind and it worries me. 

Now I haven't signed the offer. I want to but the consequence will be some backlash from my family. Her family is super supportive of this and it's a hilarious dichotomy. 50/50 shot my mom will never visit or talk to me unless I happen to move back.


Worth reiterating that my family and I aren't that close. I'm cordial with my brothers but it's not like we're best friends and hang out all that often. I have an authoritarian relationship with my parents (they care more about that I'm not a fuck up as opposed to caring about my hopes and dreams) and there exists a strange tension between us. They'll be passive aggressive about this entire thing. 


Sister-in-law is throwing all these what-about-if questions:

- What if your parents get sick?

- What if you get married and have kids? Don't you care that they won't be close to cousins/family?

- Moving out like this without being engaged would be disrespectful to my parents. I've been dating my girlfriend for 8 years and this is the first I have ever heard about this.


Not seeing my nieces as often would suck - yes I can concede that. It's probably the worst part about taking this offer but when they are teenagers they aren't going to care that dear old Uncle stayed around. I just can't get where all this apprehension on their side is coming from considering we're not even all that close. I'm trying to be logical about this I really am, but at this point I'm not convinced that I shouldn't take the offer and go.

253,"I was in a steady relationship of one year and a half, it was long distance but we managed to see each other once or twice a month. Things were starting to get slow and he didn't seem to care about it at all. I was getting bored and tired of him. But we used to be so good together that I didn't care about it at all. We had similar tastes for everything and we had a lot of fun when we were together but long-distance he didn't even seem to care about our conversations or whatever we did together. I broke up with him on June of 2017 and later started seeing other people. He started seeing another girl after a month or something like that.

We had the same group of friends so we used to chat about things we had in common. Even while he was dating, he used to talk to me a lot and I always found that weird, his current girlfriend was jealous too. So what I did? Blocked him on everything. I was single and didn't want to seem like I was hitting on him. We spent almost a month without talking to each other and then he broke up with his current girlfriend on December. I missed him a lot. Around that time all I could think about was him and how we were happy together. He told me that he missed me and he was going to try to fix his previous mistakes, but he still wanted to see if ""there was something"" between us. I was so happy at the time. Spent two pleasant weeks there. Where he told me that he loved me and treated me really well. On the same day I left, he went to a party with his ex girlfriend, which he broke up to ""be with me"". I'm feeling very humiliated and broken and I'm really sorry but this post is almost like a big-ass rant. I want to become better and get over this but I feel so hurt and I miss the good times we had so it feels like I don't know where to begin.

EDIT: He cheated on me on the same night I went back to my town (last friday) and she probably is still at his house since she has nothing to do of her life.

tl;dr: Ex said he missed me and wanted to go back together and then cheated on me. What was going in his stupid mind when he told me that he missed me and then cheated on me?

255,"Before reading, I want to point out I come from a modest background. Only child, one parent worked as a janitor. We got by, but we didn't have much. No vacations. Limited friends in middle and high school. Even through college, I was just the funny guy who was really smart. Read on.

I've been going through a tough time on whether to keep my Youtube channel operational. It's a vlog based on cars and racing, which I participate in, mainly autocross. I've been doing it for 3 years with 272 videos.

I intitally started it because I wanted motivation to get out and do more. Buying a camera did this and I wanted to travel, go to car events, etc. and use the camera to bring people along.

Locally, in my city, it's a hit. People ask questions in person, comment in person, I'm literally known as ""the Youtube guy"" here. However, I've always chased more views and subscribers. Now it is just a chore to maintain, output videos, and advertise them. All for a measly 200-300 videos a video.

I asked myself why I'm chasing numbers. It's validation. I see views, comments, or likes on Facebook and I get a dopamine hit from it. Same thing with attending events, taking pictures, or anything. It's all about the likes.

I also noticed I was extremely frustrated with trying to improve my standings in racing, getting better, or placing in the top 3. Again, I asked 'Why?' and ended up back at ""I want credit, respect, and people to notice me."" Not because I loved doing it; I seemed to have lost that portion.

I started questioning just about everything. My relationship with my parents and my career. Everything is based off praise and validation. Why am I driven to make more money? It's really to impress my parents and others, not because I want it. Why did I want good grades? Praise and avoiding getting yelled at, not because I wanted them.

Lately, I've been catching myself thinking of buying a lower-end Porsche or some high end import and don't focus on the driving experience I'd get (which is true somewhat), but more on a video I could make or posting up those first pictures with the keys on Facebook.

In 2015, I figured I needed to get my dating life in order, so I dove in and talked to 500+ girls (2-3 a day), hand numerous dating experiences and whatnot. Dated a former prom queen and 'cam' girl, etc. I had to question at this point, why? Bingo, because validation. I traced this back to past relationships and being cheated on three times, one of which involved some guy coming from Australia to the US and getting engaged with the girl I was seeing for 3 years. That resulted in the ""I'll show you"" mentality.

Ultimately at age 29, I feel everything I've done so far is all based on external validation the world taught me to seek out. **How do I go about fixing this?** Without validation from others, it feels like there's no point to amassing money, investing, moving up from finance manager to director and beyond.

Right now, all I can think of is shutting down the Youtube Channel, posting a lot less on Facebook, and just focus on driving because I love it, not for winning. Catch 22, because the point of racing is to win, but also the friendship and fun you get from doing it.",09Jan2018,1

259,"Dear Financial Aid committee, I am appealing my federal aid ineligibility as a result of failing to meet SAP requirements during Academic Year 2017 Fall semester. I both understand the decision for dismissal and take responsibility for the actions that led up to it. I have written this letter in hopes of conveying the gravity with which I regard my academic future and the steps I have taken to remedy my current academic standing. The actions leading to my grades not meeting up to SAP standards were due stress due to taking too many courses and the depression and anxiety I contributed because of it. Before enrolment as a transfer student in 2016 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.I went through a few doctor visits and was put on Levothyroxine medication which did at the time help with the depression and anxiety symptoms. In fall 2017 semester is when my refills of the medication went out , at this time is when I would start seeing the symptoms again.As a result of being off medication my stress and anxiety started to build up as it was the first semester in which I took more than 4 classes. This gave me constant insomnia, troublesome fatigue walking to class and constant just streaks of depression with academic scores not being met to standards that were I wanted them. At this time I did not seek any counselling for my depression and anxiety. In september though the end of the academic year I would see my advisor for academic advice on my major, as well as an attend academic peer coach session which started on 10/17/17 which in a way did help with insecurities about my academic decline. I have sought treatment for these issues and am currently on a new insurance plan and will have funds to buy more levothyroxine for my hypothyroidism in order to help my depression and anxiety symptoms. Appointments have been made on 1/9/18 to see a counselor for my depression issues until I am able to receive medication after my doctor check up in later date january. I have come up with an academic plan with my advisor which will enable me to make better academic decisions a choices in order to graduate in my major. I have also dropped my course load from 5 classes to 4 per semester and will be taking a break from accounting for a semester in replacement with an elective course as to not work myself which could result in an anxiety attack or stress overload. I have already started to attend harc in university suites center and will continue to go weekly as well as make tutoring appointments in academic success center as the semester workload starts to kick backup.

This is what I have so far, how is it? what would should I add, get rid of etc and grammar.

here are the sap rules: The SAP Appeal process requires the submission of a written statement by the student outlining the extenuating circumstances which led to their academic difficulties, how the circumstances have changed, and the student's plan for improving their academic status. The statement must be typed, signed by the student, and must specifically address the courses, grades, and terms of enrollment which are affecting the insufficient SAP standing. The statement should have correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation and should be written in a professional manner. The appeal must be accompanied by supporting documentation from at least two individuals who can corroborate the student's circumstances. If the documentation is provided by a professional (business, medical, counselor, clergy, etc.), the documentation must include the institution's professional letterhead, the professional's credentials, and must be signed. If a letter of support is provided by a personal reference (teacher, family friend, etc.), the documentation must be signed by that reference.",09Jan2018,0

264,"How to break it to my mother that I can't let my brother move in with me.



Backstory. A year or so ago I moved back home, mainly to get myself back on my feet. There was me, my brother and my parents.


Now, my brother left in October to teach English in China. I in the meantime got myself a great job which allowed me to plan to get my own place again. I mentioned to my mother that I planned on getting a 2 bedroom place (cos I have a shitload of books and need the storage space) and without missing a beat my mother said ""oh that's good, you can take your brothers stuff with you when you move"" because they wanted to move.


Later it changed to ""when your brother gets home he can move in with you"" without even asking me about it. 


So I found a place and am in the process of getting it sorted, filling out the application for just me moving in, as extra persons would cost more and have to go through verification checks.


Boom. My brother decided to quit his teaching job in China because ""it's too much""


So my parents still want to move to thier own place and I'm expected to let my brother live rent free for as long as he needs. I mentioned to my mother about my brothers rent and she said it was my responsibility. She also said that I don't have to tell the landlord about him or the estate agents as he'd only be there a few months (yeah, right).


I don't want him moving in.


So, I checked the estate agents terms. Any extra people in the property have to be declared and go through referencing and affordability checks as they'd be classed as co renters. My brother would immediately fail those checks as he's unemployed and has no money. So he can't move in.

267,"I dated a man on and off for the last three years. He cheated, he lied, he was paranoid, accused me of all the shit he did, made me think I was insane for questioning things that 100% deserved to be questioned. Refused to take responsibility for his actions and seems to have a really skewed view of how our relationship has played out.

The details aren't necessarily important, all that needs to be said is it was on and off again, there wasn't a lot of respect, and the tumultuous nature of it impacted my friendships.

We've broken up, but now he's ""homeless"" and is still staying with me until he gets word on a job that will take him to a new city at the end of the week. 

Despite it ending, and despite the relief I feel for not having to be doing this back and forth anymore. I'm obsessively thinking about all the things he probably lied about, how he likely cheated way more than he let on. 

On top of all of this the thing I want most isn't for our relationship to end and for us to move on, it's for things to just be better. I feel guilt for still wanting the relationship and for wanting to be with him, but I can't deny that's what I want.

My questions are:
How do i move forward from the obsessive thoughts about the things I suspect happened but that I won't get closure on?

How do I let go of the guilt I have of wanting to still be with somebody who has been a large source of unhappiness?

Me and 2 of my (innocent?) roommates left our house on the 15th and 16th of December for the holidays while the other roommate, we'll call him roommate x, went on vacation around the same time. When roommate x returned to the house on December 19th he, for whatever reason, decided to turn off the heat in our house(trying to save money I suppose?) then went back to his hometown as well for the holidays. 

On the 20th, in our group chat, one roommate let everyone know the management company sent an email reminding everyone to leave the heat on at a low temp over the long break(for some reason I didn't get this email). Roommate x responded that he got a phone call from the management company letting us know that they would be performing a ""heat inspection"" between the hours of 12 and 5pm on the 22nd so he didn't feel the need to go back and turn the heat on. 

We all thought this was taken care of until today, when one of my roommates received a call letting him know the pipes had frozen and busted. It is now uninhabitable and the management company is making it sound like they want us to pay. 

So my question to you all is who is at fault and how should I proceed? We have texts confirming that the management company was in our house to perform a heat inspection, but we never received word back from them about the heat being off. We all just (foolishly) assumed they would've turned it back on for us, or at the very least let us know it was off. Am I liable to the damages even tho I was gone at the time of the heat being shut off? How should I proceed? I'm really freaking out because it sounds like this is going to cost a lot of money. Any help is much appreciated.",09Jan2018,3
271,"My first year of uni was not so great for me. I was depressed, suicidal, sleep deprived because of my noisy flat mates, of whom I rarely spoke to and I had two friends at the very least. 

The two friends I did make weren't until second semester, so they had already sorted out their living arrangements, so I had no where to go for next year. BY SOME MIRACLE, one of the friends said that one of her roommates wasn't going to be living in their new house anymore and asked me if I wanted to join. I was ecstatic to actually be living with a friend next year. But then... the friend dropped out, basically leaving me with a bunch of strangers. As for the other friend I had, she was repeating first year (we were on the same course). 

Classes weren't so bad, I think I did genuinely learn things. I do joint honours in creative writing and fine art. I enjoy Creative Writing more but art, not so much, definitely not now either. 

I was extremely skeptical going into second year, no friends, living with strangers and my depressing thoughts were getting worse. To be fair, my new housemates are a lot nicer than the previous ones, but they are in their own circle of friends and I didn't fit into it.

Then, there are the classes. Creative writing, that's still fine, but art got much worse. The biggest problem, I had clashes. The day looked like this. 9am: art lecture 10am to 1pm: practical 2pm to 5pm: more practical. In between? 3pm to 5pm English seminar. This could have been fine if it wasn't for the fact that the art school was on the other side of town. My English lecturer said I couldn't miss any of the seminars, so I went to those instead of art. I thought it was fine, I could just go to the first practical and do extra work on another day. 

But... I became very behind on art. Turns out there were things explained in the second practical which I missed. The module was printmaking, doing various techniques. If I didn't know how to do it, I was fucked basically. All the art teachers did was explain the technique for half an hour, leave, and expect everyone to have made masterpieces by the end of the class. Okay, perhaps that's a slight exaggeration, but that is honestly how I felt the entire time. It didn't help looking at people's beautiful finished work either. 

For a while, I missed a couple of art classes, then... I missed, a lot. I didn't show up for 5 weeks... I was shitting myself when it came to handing in my portfolio since I basically had nothing, but then I found out that due to my absence, I was dropped from the module... Yes, I know this is my own fault, I understand that, but I felt so alone, I had no one to talk to about how I was feeling, nor anyone to force me to go. 

I have no idea if this means me failing this one module means I have failed the entire year. At this uni, we were told you cannot repeat second year, even if I did, I don't think I could survive another two years here.

Despite all of this, I wanted to make this second semester count, go to everything, get good marks and study. Then... I got my timetable for the second semester starting in February. I thought the clash in my first semester was bad. I have an English seminar slipped right bang of the middle of an art practical which is also all day long like last seminar. 

There is no way I can run around, going back and forth and get work done at the same time. I will be asking if there is another seminar I can go to another day because I know there should be one since it's a compulsory module. And yes, I'm sure it's a computer who generates the timetables, but it kind of disgusts me that no one seems to care to fix it. I have felt so little humanity at this university that now I'm thinking it's not even worth it at all. I have been thinking about leaving, but uni seems to be the only way to 'confirm?' a job, but in my field, they were already slim chances

Tl;dr I'm depressed and suicidal at uni with no friends and I have missed out on work because of clashes I couldn't solve. 

If anyone has any advice, it will be very appreciated, thank you

All my life I've felt that one has to take the opportunities that allow oneself to be better prepared for the future such as studying abroad, taking hard classes or going to well reputed schools. For instance, I'm currently studying in France because I got a scholarship to do it, I was born in Mexico.
I've ever regretted this or other decisions like this I've made but right now I have another opportunity to go abroad for 3 months and even though at first I was excited to, I hesitate more and more. 
The main problem is that if I don't take this opportunity, it would be like making a choice that would destroy all my future just because going abroad seems ""the best option"".
I would like some advice concerning the way I see it, I feel that I can calmly decide not to go and everything would be fine but I can seem to convince myself quite enough.",09Jan2018,3
275,"Work has been killing me lately, I have severe depression and chronic headaches as well as migraines. I commute an hour and a half each way to sit in an office waiting for emails so I can do the 40 minutes of work for my job. My job is based largely on my knowledge and less on actual work. Here's the problem. My dad is my boss, he owns the company. And he already gives me Fridays off, I'm young, never went to college and went straight into a corporate job. I have been getting worse by the day. Just watching my life drain away from me hating every second. 

Last week because of migraines I had to work from home all week. It was amazing. I had all this time to do the things I wanted and I was still getting work done and getting paid. However whenever I try to muster the courage to try and talk to my dad about how bad I've been with depression and headaches and possibly working from home to relieve some stress I just feel like a dissapointment. I feel like I'm embarrassing my dad infront of his employees and playing the little brat in a movie. I should have to work just like everyone else right? But people in our company already work remotely, we are based in Washington and our accountant moved to Florida a few years ago and does all her work from across the country. Is it rude for me to ask for this? I'm only 21 and about 20 years younger than the youngest person at the company, I've only been here a year. It feels like a bad idea. But at the same time I cannot go on like this, I'll be bald by 30 I'm loosing my mind wasting my life away like this. And the amount of pressure being the youngest at a company in this industry as well as the owner's son is just fucking killing me. I grind my teeth to a powder every night and sometimes wake up with a migraine.

How should I start this conversation? Is it even a good idea? Will my coworkers hate me? What if he says no? There's just so much up in the air I can't even start somewhere. How do I even begin to tell my dad any of this? Let alone ask him that I stop coming into the office it just feels like I'll be laughed at. And even if I get what I want I feel like I'd just feel guilty and hated by everyone else who does have to come in to the office. I feel so lost on this. but at the same time My dreams of having a fun fufilling life are draining away day by day. Could really use some advice here.",09Jan2018,3

Me, my boyfriend, and his best friend (who is a chick, I don't need to hear it, there's nothing weird there), are going on a trip to Paris in february.

She decided to ask this guy she met on tinder like 2 weeks ago and hung out with a few times to come with us. She apparently told my boyfriend about it and he was like ''yeah sure ask him'' because ""he thought he wouldn't come anyway'' (great logic right there).             
I was not consulted about this at all, I only found out when she said we should wait till tomorrow before booking an airbnb, so the guy would say if he's coming or not.

I got angry because for one, this is our trip that we planned together and this is a strange 35 year old dude we know nothing about. We're all 10 years younger than him, mind you. 
We're in another country and all stuck in the same house and to each other for 4 days - so if the guy is annoying or weird we can't just tell him to go home. It means i can't just walk out of the shower in a shirt and underwear because there's the guy there. We can't just do whatever cause we gotta include this guy we've never met in conversations and activities. Not to mention I just don't trust her judgement of people, cause she tends to think a lot of VERY questionable guys are ""totally fine""

I was very honest with her and I said I'm not okay with this because this is our trip as a group of friends, and this is literally some guy. I also mentioned the fact that she barely knows him and it's not okay for anyone. My boyfriend agreed there, but she said it's too late cause she already asked him, blablabla.

Now that I talked to my boyfriend and told him he pissed me off because he can't just say ""no"" when that's what he actually means, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and overreacting and that ""this is her vacation too"". Like that means we can just bring whoever and whatever and the others have to comply. 

Seriously now, am I really overreacting? I feel like what she did was rude and not thought-through and that my boyfriend's logic and handling of the situation is absolutely retarded.

285,"I suppose the story starts out like all the others. Dating an amazing girl, we've been through hell and back. She would do anything for me (which she does by her actions) 
She's said she doesn't care what happens to her if we ever broke up. She only cares about us. She's madly in love with me, I'm in love with her but on a lesser point because I've been jaded my whole life after my mom died. 

We had a small fight Wednesday because I caught her in a lie. She was going to take the day off work because she felt sick, but didn't want to tell me because it would let me down. I believe that, but it could also be something else I ""caught"" her in (itl make sense below).

She's quit spice and heroin cold turkey, haven't been on it for a long time. Before we were together. A lot of her friends have died, nobody will tell her where her dad is, and the rest of the family cast her out. After our small fight Wednesday, she stopped talking to me. I was mad and I knew Thursday she was talking to her boss for a fact, he told me. I told her to call me right away so we can work it out or were done. Nothing. So I texted fine were done. 

I'd never break up over text. I love her too much to do that. I thought she would know that too. She stopped going to work. Won't tell anyone what s going on. Ignoring everyone, me included. I talked to everyone she might see, and many people said she looked spiced out. She went in to work Friday to get her final check 600 dollars worth. Vanished. 

I know she's back on spice. She has seizures so it's only a matter of time before it will kill her. I texted her I'm sorry I want to see you and work this out. Saturday she texts me I miss you I will see you soon.

When I ask. Tonight? She said.
I tried calling at this time and she denies my call. 
I'm too tired I'm going back to bed.

Not another word from her until this morning.

I learned through other people she's been getting rides and getting around, but she's had her phone turned off. Last I knew she got dropped off in a bad spice neighborhood.

She texted me today saying I love you I'll see you later. 

I don't think she's wanting to break up. She's zoned out on spice not able to do anything.

This happened once before at thanks giving, same neighborhood because her best friend died. I had to track her down and carry her out of the house she was in. 

I honestly don't think she can function enough to figure out a plan. I don't think she wants to tell me where she is cause she just keeps wanting to get high. 

But at the same time she loves me and I love her so much. I can't do this no communication thing. If she told me what was going on and she needed a break id respect that.

Do I track her down and save her from a possible death/suicide? 
Or do I wait and see if she has the strength to choose me over drugs (which she's gone cold turkey before too so I know she can do it)

Sorry it's so long, any second opinions would help me so much. My heart hurts.",09Jan2018,5

287,"About a month ago, I got asked out by a coworker of mine, a white guy. I like him, but I had to say no because of my living situation. I'm a Native American girl with a very controlling mother, a mother who only wants me dating other Natives. Not only that, but she's also threatened to take away my car if I date any non-Natives. It's one of those ""my house, my rules"" scenarios.

But after rejecting him, I started to regret it and I decided to tell my mom about him. I told my mom that there's this white guy at work that I like, but she immediately shot him down and reminded me that I'm only to date within our race. Me and her got in a fight over who I can and can't date, but my mom still wouldn't budge.

I've been trying to get out of my mom's house for a while and I think I finally have an out. My dream job is to be a cop and I'm currently trying to enroll in the police academy. I've already passed the written test and I'm waiting to take the physical later this month. I've decided that once I get into the academy and start making a significantly higher salary, I'll move into a place of my own away from my mom and start living my own life the way I want and that includes dating this white guy.

Dating him right now isn't feasible, and I'm confused as to what I should do with him. I feel like it'd be unfair of me to go up to him and say ""Hey, I still like you, but we can't date right now. I'm just going to need you to wait until I move out of my mom's house."" But at the same time, I want him to know that I'm still interested in him so that he doesn't move on to another girl. I figured that my plan for now is to just remain friendly with him at work and occasionally throw in some signs of interest, but not directly tell him that we have to wait until I'm moved out and situated.

292,"This is long and stupid, tldr at end. I think I fucked up my opportunity for my dream job, and I think I’d just rather be dead now. Two years ago I got signed to a decent agency, and a year after that I was requested by a sister agency in Chicago to go to a casting for a Michael kors show. I was majorly depressed and suicidal and couldn’t afford to stay in Chicago for three days, so I made excuses and then it was too late. I should’ve driven there and slept in my car, it could’ve been a career making opportunity but I fucked it up.

I was fucking penniless when I first got signed, and majorly stressed over money that first year modeling, so stressed that a golfball sized chunk of hair fell out at my temple and lost about half the volume of my hair, it was so fucking thin. After missing my chance to walk for Michael kors  in the depth of my depression I quit and started working at a factory to save up money. Hurt my foot, but was so poor I didn’t have the option to not work and it happened so early in the job I wouldn’t have been paid for time off. My job involved walking constantly for 12 1/2 hours 3-5 days a week. A year and a half later  it still hurts to walk barefoot and I don’t even know if I can wear heels anymore.

Shortly after starting the factory job I felt a lump in my cheek, and it’s grown so that it’s rather noticeable and has wrinkled the skin. Went to a free clinic and the doc said it’s a sebaceous cyst that would need surgery for removal, leaving me with a scar. Doc recommended leaving it alone, but I’m running out of time. Doc also didn’t seem concerned about my year and a half of foot pain.
Im getting wrinkles around my eyes and my laugh lines are hella deep. I developed an astigmatism so when my eyes are closed you can see my cornea move grotesquely beneath the skin. The stress has aged me immensely and I look like shit.

I hate myself everyday for how I’ve fucked up such an incredible opportunity and I’m trying to think of ways I can give it another shot. I’m not traditionally pretty but I’m tall and skinny, and I booked a decent amount of castings that first year. About half the girls who signed at the same time I did have since walked in nyfw milsn Paris and London too. One girl is working with Dior, another got the cover for Elle. I just didnt give it a real shot and I’m going to regret it for the rest of my life. And I’m 24 now which is like retirement age for models. Some girls get careers at 25 but it’s almost unheard of, agencies won’t sign someone that old

Oh and was fired from the factory job, this is my last month of my lease and i only have $107 to my name. Haven’t been paying most of my bills so I can make rent. Don’t know where I’ll go at the end of January 

So I think I’m going smoke some blunts get drunk while watching the sun rise, and then shoot myself while standing on the edge of a cliff. Hopefully between the gunshot and the fall I’ll die, nothing would be worse than brain damage or being paralyzed. Idk fuck this life I screwed up the only thing I ever wanted and I’m just so tired

305,"I've known jack for about a month now. He wooed me quick and we had like 3 dates in a week. He was sweet and enthusiastic, used emojis, etc. He went home for the holidays and ever since he's not been himself. Max 5 word messages, not initiating anymore. He Came to see me last week when i enticed him via nude pics. And I always have to ask now for him to come.over. he is so sweet IRL but you wouldn't know it through messenger. 

I'm thinking of just giving up on him. I asked why does he leave all of my stuff on read..he said he was busy. I haven't messaged him since Sunday. And I won't until he responds to me. It isn't an enormous loss since we are only casual dating. I told him that I was only seeing him. Bit at this point I am going to start seeing my old fwb since jack is not talking to me. Never even told me I was pretty, and my fwb showers me in compliments and is passionate, so he is my backup for now. Should I just give up on jack?",09Jan2018,1
306,"I live with my family and a few years ago my eldest brother started to act strange, he was aggressive and paranoid, he would lash out verbally and sometimes physically, he would hit walls and even swing at us (his siblings). He was like that for several months before we found out why, it turns out he thought my family hated him, we told him that was untrue, but he didn't believe us, he was still the same (in some ways worse). Eventually he made a list of rules my family had to agree to follow or he would kill himself and blame my family so, we agreed to it.
 
* No one could get a job before he got one first (it's been years and he still won't work).
* No one could move away (no one in my family has moved away, there's seven of us).
* No one could have any friends at all.
* No one could have any form of romantic relationships.

There's a few more, but those are the important ones, he made us agree to those for 5 years, but my family knows full well that he's holding those much longer than that. I'm 23, I have no education, I've barely been out of my house, I don't have an I.D.,  I've never had a job, I have no money, and money is tight for my family because of his ""rules"".

I then asked if it's anything I should be worried about and she replied that ""we're still gathering information"".

This job is only something I do in my spare time, but that last comment really left a pit in my stomach.

Should I be worried about this? The only two reasons I could imagine she'd be cross about is one incident when I forgot to clock in (which I'm pretty sure I asked her to fix it) and last week when I left early because she stated that if there isn't much for me to do, I can go home early.

My co-worker (we work at a school) has been going through a hard time the last few years. I get that. But she has made me her punching bag for most of it and I feel that within the last 6 months, she has really begun to spiral out of control. 

Lying about where is she (getting ""coffee') and taking 2 hour lunch breaks, leaving me stranded, and then getting mad at me when I called in an administrator to give me my lunch break because she just straight up went MIA. Yelling at me in front of kids. Constantly finding things to nitpick over. 

Once, when she got upset at something, I told her, ""I know, I'm sorry but so and so student needed help so that's why I went over there"" and then she just goes off on every little thing. 

Today was bad in particular, she yelled at me in front of kids and I reported her to the principal, but all he wants to do is have a ""check-in"" meeting. I've reported her several times before. 

Anyhow, after I came back, she was all smiles and was telling me something that a student said that she thought was funny. She acted like NOTHING happened. So she went from yelling at me for no real reason, to that? It's not the first time this has happened. 

I have long suspected she is bipolar or has *something*. Aside from the interpersonal issues we have between us, I have seen her blow up at several people like that and maybe she is just a volatile person, BUT I see her the most and she has extreme highs and lows throughout the day-it's like working with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. 

It's getting worse and worse, each day, it's something new, whether it's directed at me or not, and like I said, it's literally like she is spiraling out of control. 

Because it's touchy...how and who do I talk to about this? The principal again? HR? I just don't think someone like that should work with kids and it's getting really scary, to be honest, and I do think she should be evaluated.

I put up a confident facade, but I'm extremely insecure and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about it.

I find myself unattractive and am not confident in my ability to protect myself or others, which makes me paranoid.

For most of my life, this has made me very socially awkward. I'm a lot more sociable now, but the cracks are still kind of there. I have very little friends in my personal life, and absolutely no sex life - I'm afraid to make eye contact or even talk to pretty girls in the street because I feel ashamed of myself. Also, because of this, I am deathly afraid of putting myself out there, so I don't party or go to any kind of events, which doesn't help me weak social life.

The first week or two I let it go because I assumed she was just helping move stuff in, but now it’s at the point that she’s always using our shower and laundry machine and other stuff. I have no sense of personal space in my own house and I feel I have to seclude myself to my own room because she’s always using the living room TV and stuff, I have to schedule my OWN laundry around hers because she’s always doing laundry here.

331,"I graduated back in 2014 from Virginia Tech with a BA in psychology. When I started school, I wanted to be a Psychiatrist. Then that changed to being a couples counselor. Then it went to not wanting to do psychology anymore at all, I didn't realize this until senior year though and it was a little too late. I finished up my degree and continued working in restaurants. While I was still in school I helped out with a research lab and I found that really fun, just not the research I liked. I would like to get in with abnormal conditions but we were working with normal childhood development. 

I am now a GM of a restaurant making $40,000/year. I hate this career path though. Just the thought of going to work tomorrow puts a huge knot in my stomach and my heart starts beat faster and I want to just run away instead of going in. 

I decided that I want to go back to school to get out of restaurants. I have two options. I could go back for a different BA (something like electrical engineering), or I could go to grad school for psychology because I've realized over the years that there's more jobs to the field than just counseling. 

We are living in a new state so I have to wait until Summer/Fall 2018 to get instate tuition. I would also have to retake the GREs to get into grad school (I didn't do too hot on them back in 2014).

My idea was to wait until I can get instate, quit my job, take out some extra student loans to help with bills, and wait tables (Thur, Fry, Sat/uber to pay the rest of the bills while I go to school. 

One problem is that I forgot about having to retake the GREs, which means I need to study for a month or so, then take the test, but I think I'm already approaching the deadline for Summer/Fall admittance. 

Another problem is what happens if I have to wait until 2019? Should I just throw away my psych degree and start over with a new degree so I can start sooner?

I really don't know how much longer I can stay in restaurants, it's so physically and emotionally draining and is impacting my mental well being to a dangerous level. 

I want to quit my job right now and just do uber/wait tables until I start school but my wife won't let me. She's concerned about our finances. At the moment I support us both 100% (she's sick). Our monthly bills are about a break even. With budgeting we could knock out a few hundred dollars a month. We have $15,000 in the bank at the moment which was supposed to be going for a down payment on a house in a few years but if I switch careers, I can add to that fund even faster. 

I did uber/lyft for the first time yesterday as a test run. I did it for 6 hours and made $100 (about $80 after gas). I had the most fun I have ever had working. Every day since I was 16 I've dreaded work. Up until a few years ago I could just power through it, now it takes all of my energy to even get out of bed and put my uniform on. Yesterday, I looked at the clock and was surprised that 6 hours had already gone by and I could have kept going for another 4 (right now I'm working 50 hours a week and was planning on doing the same with uber/lyft). When I got home and ate dinner, I wanted to go back out there and do more. Today on my other day off, I want to go out there and drive more (but today is a clean up day at home so I can't). I've never worked, came home, and wanted to go back to work. 

My wife says I should just power through work until I start school, then quit and do my plan. I don't know if I can last that long though. Best case scenario that's still 4 months out. Also, yes I'm on anti depressants and anxiety medication but I need to get my meds tweaked a bit soon. 

I was also thinking I should meet with an adviser or admissions person and see what they think about my best route to take with school. 

I guess I'm just asking, what would you do in this situation? Should I do what makes me happy and quit my job now and just wing it until I start school? Should I tough it out? Should I do a masters' degree or should I just forget about psych and do something else?",09Jan2018,1

He is very charming and comes across as the perfect gentleman although slightly wierd... but having looked more closely at him, I know something isn't right about him.
He has displayed very openly that he is controlling and dominant and has been untruthful and inconsistent when we have questioned him about his past.

My first question is this. His court docket says that he is not allowed to own a firearm. He has told her that he HAS guns and was allowed to keep them because he is an active member of the reserves.
Is this possible? 
Would he be able to keep guns as a reservist if the courts had stipulated that he could not?
Is he actually still a reservist or would he have been discharged because of the conviction?

335,"Using throwaway 

(This is part rant / part advice seeking -- apologies for wall of text)

I've never been engaged/married, and I am going to propose to my gf soon. I was talking to my mom about it and she offered up her an amazing engagement/wedding ring combo given to her by her late husband (2nd marriage), and as a second option a pearl ring that he had from his previous marriage where his wife passed away many years before. 

I accepted the set she was given. The engagement ring alone is valued at $20,000. She has no desire to keep the ring, and had mentioned she wanted to sell it just to rid of it. She was never one for jewelry, my step dad left her with house and a huge retirement ROTH-IRA and she lives modestly so she doesn't need the money - hence why she hadn't actually sold it yet.

Now that I am making arrangements and plans, my mom says my sister got word, and told her (and I quote) ""She said she was expecting whichever ring costs the most, and that it should stay in the family"". Which to me is code for ""I want the expensive one""

My first reaction is to tell her ""it's my moms to offer, and she offered it to me"". My 2nd reaction is that my sister is not someone I'd want my mom to entrust this ring to:

* she has been married once before and had their own ring, they annulled a week after because he wasn't ready or some BS
* she is 36yr old and still lives at home, makes under minimum wage and claims disability for mental health issues around depression / anxiety / bipolar 
* she has some shady people in her life and has been mugged in the past because she was wondering in a bad neighborhood visiting friends

I don't want to fight my sister. I love her in all her faults.  I also realize some of her depression is because she compares herself to me. I am 4-years younger and still seen as ""the baby"" of the family (i'm 32), successful enough in my career,  always taking care of the family / paying bills / taking them on trips / fixing stuff around the house when i visit, yadda yadda. So she's going to take this as a ""you're always giving him everything."" I never flaunt anything, but it's there.

But I also don't want this ring to be sold off just because we fought over it, and I don't want to pass up on such a beautiful ring. It's not about the ring for my gf, she's low maintenance and has mentioned ""its not about the ring"" to her,  this is because it's a special ring that I want to accept and make a part of my new family. And of course it's an amazing ring. Who wouldn't want it.

Final kicker: Just yesterday my mom says ""don't worry about her. Just take it. she doesn't need to know"". Obviously this is a bad idea. She will definitely find out (duh), and my mom is pretending like my sister wont get crazy about it. 

I want to have a conversation with my sister beforehand and not be sneaky. How would you approach the situation without being a complete asshole?

--------

TL;DR: My mom offered me her engagement/wedding rings from her late husband. After finding out it's worth over 20k my sister is now arguing for it. I already accepted, I honestly don't trust my sister with it for reasons above, and now my mom is saying just ignore her and take it - ""she doesn't have to know"".

I am a habitual person so when I enjoy something whether it is video games, tv, or whatever, I will do it often. I play basketball around 5 times a week, which gives me great exercise (I’m pretty fit). But in the case of bad habits, I really struggle to break them.

I need help figuring out what else to replace this wasted time with.

Secondly, I want to improve my relationships with others. I want to make friends and find a girlfriend. As I said, I am an introvert, so all of this is tough. I have trouble starting conversations with random people which makes it tough to make friends obviously. Now as to getting a girlfriend.

346,"Ok I know the title makes it sound pretty final but let me give you the background:
 My girlfriend (23) and I (26) have be dating for over 5 years. We dated since the beginning of college, came from the same hometown, and have a really close relationship. The catch comes that I took her virginity and she has never had sex nor dated another person in her life. Since the beginning I’ve had this doomsday thought in my head (deductive logic  has put me where I know I’d be right now). Flash forward over 5 years and now she feels like she’s “missing out”. I totally understand her feelings and if I was in her shoes would probably feel the same way. The problem is I love her more than anything in this world. I love her enough to let her be (I don’t own her) but I also love her enough that I feel if I let her go it would mean I didn’t care about her. My question is what should I do? Do I let the love of my life walk away or do I try to keep this together? Has anyone experienced something similar?",09Jan2018,16
347,"Hey guys. I've tried basically all methodologies on my own to no avail and now I turn to you, people of reddit, to ask a serious question.

Not too sure how many cops are on here (or who would admit) but there are some of us out there that really aren't the bad guy and are out to protect you guys out there. Unfortunately that brings in a lot of A-type personalities, and some of which are uneducated and arrogant bullies...even to their coworkers.

Basically i'm in a situation which two people tag team me by calling me nicknames over the radio (a big no no for the cop world out there), to humiliate me on a larger scale, as well as f*cked with my personal stuff, glued my lock, things that might seem silly but this has been continued harassment for almost a year now.


To give the obligatory justification story: no, I did not do anything to personally disparage these people....they are just bullies who find humor in torturing me in a public setting because I usually don't fight back and am not quick witted, and on the timid side. It's sad because anyone IMO who gains pleasure in ruining someone's day for no legitimate reason is a sick piece of human garbage. and this may contribute to why people hate cops and you see those bad ones out there. 


any fellow cop would know that going to a delegate would make me look like a crybaby and god help me if i went to a boss, which i would never do. I know people will say if you show it bothers you they will pounce on that which I guess I have let them see but , at this rate how will I ever get them to mind their own business? and for you non LE I hope this sheds some light into the profession, there are sh*tty people everywhere.

350,"Hi everyone, first time posting on this sub.


My sister is 32 years old and 7 months pregnant. 

We have never seen eye to eye on a lot of things because she is a very dominate, brash person and I am not.  About a year and half ago, she met someone through a friend and not only has she been extremely happy, but her partner is lovely and has taken the role of step-dad to her children very seriously. He is brilliant with my niece and nephews, and treats them like they're his own.


5 months ago, they announced they were expecting and the family were all thrilled. After a few scans, it was confirmed to be a boy.


Over Christmas, the inevitable conversation of baby names came up.
My sisters partner is a sweet guy. He's a couple years younger than her, but is mature.  His favourite band is Metallica...so they have decided to name the child Hetfield as long as my sister can call him 'Harry' as a nickname. 

However, this is not the problem. 
Her partner has a very normal name followed by the last name Hogan. And so, to capitalise on this, they want to name their child Hetfield Ulrich Logan Kirk Hogan - so that his initials spell H.U.L.K Hogan. 


Everyone in both mine and his family absolutely love this idea, they think its a nice ode to his favourite things and its funny. I feel like I'm the only one thinking about the future of this child and the repercussions this might have for him. 


I tried to voice my opinion and was told its none of my business. I was told I'm ruining a magical time for them. Am i out of line? I feel like naming your kid after a combination of Metallica members and a wrestler is ridiculous. 


I get shut down anytime I've tried to talk about this with them.  I tried to reiterate that his credit cards, application forms and ID will all have H.U.L.K Hogan on the front and this may stifle job opportunities and the only response I get is ""I like it"" or ""I think its awesome"".

What can I say to them to try and drive home what a bad idea this is? Or am I completely out of line, and making a bigger deal out of this than I should? 

Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL;DR - my sister and her partner want to name their unborn son ‘Hetfield Ulrich Logan Kirk’ because the last name is Hogan and the initials will spell out HULK Hogan. ",09Jan2018,8

I asked her recently if she thought she was drinking too much soda, and she replied with ""No because I only drink one portion of soda per day.""

356,"This is my first time ever posting on this sub. I've read through the rules and tried my best to adhere to them; please let me know if I've breached protocol in any way.


My sister is one of the kindest people I've ever known. She never thinks or speaks badly of anyone. She's universally trusting, to a fault. She has all the character traits that would make her a wonderful friend for anyone, but her social anxiety absolutely cripples her. She was harassed and tormented relentlessly throughout high school, which permanently shut her off from the idea of connecting with new people through conventional means. I should also mention that she's attracted solely to women, and only recently became outspoken about it to me and our parents. We're loving and accepting of every facet of who she is, but her anxiety prevented her from being ready to share that part of herself with us until fairly recently.


Anyway, she moved out of my parents' home at the age of 27, just a few months ago. Throughout the last couple years of living at home, she began to develop an unhealthy obsession with wanting to meet and connect with people online. She would search Apple's app store for chat room/meetup/dating apps, make accounts for all of them, and broadcast her loneliness to the world, hoping for a kind soul to reach out to her. Of course, being the steaming cesspools of sexually-starving creeps that they are, her use of these apps attracted countless predators and manipulators, posing as women and pretending to also be autistic, bisexual, etc. in order to gain her attraction and trust. This inevitably led to her being told to record herself doing things she didn't understand, sexual pictures being exploited from her, etc. When I got wind of this behavior and what was taking place, I spoke with her at length about what was really going on, who these people really were, and all the more common and obvious tactics employed by your typical online incel. I then told our parents about it, and they handled it gradually and carefully. After a few apprehensive weeks, we felt confident that she understood exactly what happened, and how dangerous and toxic those environments can be for someone of her vulnerability.


Fast forward months later to today, and my sister happily announces to me that she once again 'met a girl online.' She shared a picture of the girl with me, which I reverse searched immediately, and it's (obviously) yet another fake sent by some creep trying to sexually manipulate my sister. What do I do? What can I do? It absolutely infuriates me that this sort of behavior can go on without any sort of consequence, and it makes me fear for my sister. Where is the line between ensuring her well-being, and getting in the way of her life?


Thank you in advance for any advice anyone has to offer. It's extremely distressing for me to know that I can't trust the rest of the world not to look at my sister and see someone to be exploited for personal gain.",09Jan2018,10

359,"Okay, so I’m going to try to condense everything I’m feeling right now... bear with me:

My parents have been married for almost 30 years. Recently, I found out my dad cheated on my mom about 16 years ago. I hate to admit that I was eavesdropping but that’s how I found out. My mom decided to stay but she harbors so much resentment and distrust towards him and it is apparent everyday in the way they interact with one another. Just now, they were arguing yet again and I found out some more things about my parents’ marriage. The main thing being that my Dad gave my mom several STDs as a result of his infidelities. Also, found out that they filed for bankruptcy not too long ago! I had no idea the financial situation was that bad! 

Now, I’m feeling a mixture of emotions. Here’s some background about me:

I am 23 years old and have suffered from severe clinical depression for the last 5 years. I’m constantly going in and out of depressive episodes. There are a few main causes of my depression... 1. I often feel that I am hideous and unlovable 2. I have lost my faith and truly believe life is meaningless 3. The horrors of the world seem to outweigh the good 

I have never been in a relationship and have never had anyone express interest in me , this further amplifies my feelings of loneliness and isolation. 

I say all of this because after hearing my parents talk about their marriage, I feel like there is no hope for me. That I am cursed to have the same fate. If I knew for a fact that my life would end up like theirs, I would blow my brains out right now. I’m sort of rambling but I simply can’t believe all that I’ve found out about their marriage. I feel so disillusioned, literally every woman in my family has been cheated on. What’s the point of marriage? What’s the point of anything? I feel so lost and utterly alone. I don’t even know what the point of this post was but if you have any advice I’d love or hear it.

I’ve been having the urge to pull out of uni, I’m a mechanical engineering student and I honestly don’t know how I feel about the subject. I feel like my lecturers are lacklustre and boring (bar two modules that I actually really enjoy, but they’re very heavily mathematically based), I lack any real motivation to get up and actually turn up resulting in me missing at least 90% of my lectures and now I have assignments due in over the next few weeks which I’m going to have an uphill battle trying to do. 

Before anyone scolds me for being lazy, I know, I’m an idiot and I deserve the circumstances I am in however I didn’t really want to do the course this year. I wanted to take a year off because my mental health has been hit very hard over last year, this is to the point where I would go sleepless nights and maybe have 2 hours sleep every other night, my hair has been falling out like mad causing me to sink in and out of awful moods. I don’t want to say I’m depressed because I don’t think I am but I can’t really say I’m happy with where I am. I hate showing up to uni it feels like such a chore. And to make it worse it feels quite forced. My parents have put a great deal of pressure on me to succeed in life because we come from a pretty poor background, I stayed home instead of moving out like my other friends because  my parents didn’t want me to. Whenever I speak about taking a break from education the topic is quickly dismissed and I feel guilty when my parents have a talk with me about how hard my dad has worked for us to come this far. The idea is that I get my degree so that I can be of financial support to the house. I feel like shit because everyone I know has moved out and is enjoying “the greatest years” of their lives while I’m stuck in my room with no real motivation to get up. I feel pretty stupid too because I put myself in this situation with no other options. If I do drop out I really don’t know what I would do next. I have no plan. I wanted to take a year out to get my head straight but my parents give me a home and what they say has to happen. They also keep telling me to not end up like my sister who is at uni but doesn’t do anything with her life and has been stuck repeating the same year over and over and I feel like that’s where I’m headed. I fucking hate myself. I wish I wasn’t so stupid and I wish I made better decisions in my life. I don’t even know why I made this post as I’m not even asking for advice.

I suppose the main event I can't seem to loose a grip of is this girl who I was in a relationship with for 3 months until about November of last year. I've liked her ever since high school started (am currently a senior) and we dated for a week once in junior year, but I guess it didn't work out at first until we tried again senior year (I broke up with her this time during a really emotional state of my life and full-heartedly regret it). Anyway, she's moved on and in a relationship with someone else over the internet. Seeing as there probably is no way for us to happen again, I feel as if my only solution is to let go and move on (that sentence hurt so fucking much).

I am a 20 year old guy that has been studying a certain subject at my university for three semesters now.

I really like my subject and am interested in it, but in my current university I do not feel comfortable. I have had history with social anxiety, I am diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder so other people really affect my well-being. 

I have had no motivation to visit my lectures and actually study, because my university and the people there make me depressed and induce anxiety. 

I recently started a very good job and can now afford to transfer to another university where I think things would be better, because it is more modernistic and generally feels more futuristic. 

Right here is where the problems begin. I do not want to transfer and continue from where I left in the old university, I want to just quit the old one and start from 1st semester in the new one.

This included when I confessed to this person that I liked them. The next day at school they had told their friends and acted like it was a joke. I was constantly target practice for them to laugh at. But I took it because I figured they were only kidding and that there were times when they genuinely took interest in me. 

But if you made fun of them, it was a different story.  Any joke about them was off limits even when they were so cruel to everyone else. I made a specific joke about them and they quite literally told me to kill myself. They had an obsessive personality where they were obsessed with control. Every group chat we had, they had to be the owner. They'd abuse their power and cause members to be unhappy and leave to where they'd just blame everyone else for being weak or an asshole or something. Narcissism was their strong point. 

I could go on and on and on about terrible mean shit this person has done, but that isn't why I'm here. I'm here because we recently stopped being friends. I'm guessing they got bored of me, or were still mad  about an old incident. I think that this year is when I finally stopped being so door matty to this person and that's why they decided to drop me. They like ego strokers.  
But even so, it's hard to drop someone after 4 years. I do think they're a bad person and whatnot, but every light and fluffy feeling has just been replaced with dark and angry feelings at the bewilderment that someone could be like this and just continue to be fine. I know it's immature and irrational to expect the world to stop because someone hurt me, but that's how I feel. So how do I make peace with it? How do I let go?

379,"Recently I made a post about whether phlebotomy or pharmacy tech school would be better. Pharmacy was the winner. Now, I have yet another decision to make- pharmacy tech school or medical billing and coding. My aunt is a medical biller and coder at the Mayo Clinic and does pretty well, and my sister was a pharmacy tech and also did pretty well. I live in San Diego and I’m planning to move to Phoenix temporarily once I get either certification. Does anyone have any experience with these? Difficulty, time, pay?

380,"Hi guys something happened less than an hour ago and idk how to approach this situation please help.

My girlfriend (22F) and I(23M) have been together for nearly 3 years and have lived together for 2 of our 3 year relationship but currently we're in different cities.

I manage a phone store and she sales cars.
Today at my girlfriends job she had a run in with her manager. 

She saw him in an office and had to ask him a question about a car. Their interaction started as a typical office conversation but it quickly devolved to a weird line of questioning. 

He asked her what would she do for a million dollars. Initially she responded by saying nothing, but after thinking about it for a couple of seconds she said ""If i wanted any amount of money i guess id do anything that doesn't comprise my morals.""

He responded by asking her what her morals were and she deflected most of the questions by giving vague answers. This went on for a minute or two and the manager switched his question. He asked her what would she do for $10,000. She said ""It's the same concept as the million dollars."" 

The manager walked closer to her while lifting a black plastic bag he had been holding in his hand. He began shaking it next to her face and repeated himself in a more unsettling tone.

If someone offered you $10,000 what would you do?

She began to grow aggravated and told him to get that bag of chocolate out her face. He opened the bag and it was full of money. 

He repeated himself one last time in a tone that made her skin crawl, ""This is $10,000. If someone offered $10,000 to you what would you be willing to do.""

This is when someone walked in and he walked away to talk to one of the other managers.

My girlfriend scurried out the room scared, confused, and in disbelief of what just happened....

Here's the issue, the HR department for the store she works at is shit. She tried talking to them earlier this year about an incident where she was falsely written up by a manager but they refused to contact her back. She tried to email them, call them, and even tried going above the HR department to corporate.... nothing.

She doesn't trust any of the other managers and we don't want this to happen anymore in the future. 

What do we do?

P.S. I'm trying to be level headed but I want to go down there and blast his bitch ass for disrespecting my girlfriend and our relationship but I'm opting to handle this animal in a more human way.

I can be mean and jealous sometimes, someone pointed it out and i realized thats how i’ve been. I would like to just be mature, and have self control. I don’t have any, sometimes when i try to get some or force myself to be okay with the current situation at hand i blow up. I have an anxiety disorder.

382,"I have a pair of diamond earrings. I don't want them, so I'm trying to figure out where to sell them. They came from Jared's, and I still have the little Jared's paper that certifies that they came from there. They're absolutely worth less than $1,000, probably closer to $500, however, I would like the cash.
Should I find a Jared's to sell them to? Should I go to a local jeweler? Do I need to get them appraised if I know basically what they're worth?

383,"So recently I've made a new group of friends at school and they're all really good people, funny, nice and just generally good to be around. However, my best friend doesn't seem too keen on hanging out with this group too much and refuses a lot of the offers to do things with them. I on the other hand have started hanging out with them a lot more, but my best friend seems really hurt by this, as he feels that I'm ignoring him and I don't care about him, which isn't the case. I've offered for him to join us in activities with our group, but he always declines. 

He's my best friend and he's like a brother to me, but I don't want to lose my group of friends as I find it difficult to interact and make friends with people and I don't really have many friends. Any advice?",09Jan2018,1
385,"Hi advice,

I have a bit of a problem. 

About this time last year, I got a file job at a bank. It was a simple job, I just had to make files for bank members and assist loan officers if they needed help with their work.

As I was working, people kept leaving left and right. So that left us backed up a lot of times. I was then given work that I wasn't fully qualified for. This eventually caught up with me, and I was terminated for poor performance. I have no hard feelings towards my past employer, the job just got overwhelming for me. 

That brings me to now. I'm a criminal justice major, and I graduate in May. I was recently informed about a job with the state (California) for a position that would fit well with the field I want to get into. On the application, it asked if I were ever terminated from a job. I was hesitant to put my past job at first. But I thought it would be better to be straight forward, rather than lie about it and have it catch up with me later. 

I'm mainly just worried that the employers will see I marked ""yes"" and automatically throw my application out. I'm currently interning at a court house, but I got the internship before I was terminated from my old job. 

I'm just worried what this could mean for my future career. Does anyone who's been in this position before ever been fired and was still able to find a job they want?",09Jan2018,3
386,"I live in a one-bedroom apartment and frequently have people over.  I have tried to keep them out of my room but to no avail.  I don't know why, but they always think I am joking or not being serious when I ask them not to use my bedroom (I have a very polite manner).  The thing is, the bathroom has two doors--my room or through the main area.  I can lock the room to prevent people from getting in through the main door but they can still get in through the bathroom (and... what kind of host would lock people out of the bathroom? lol!)

I have tried to tell people politely not to go in my room, tried to be joking (""Oh! hey, you left something in my room?"")  or just straight up tell them but it seems almost every time someone comes over, I find them walking through my room like it's a public corridor and I don't like it as I try to keep my things private.

What can I do?  Do you guys know a firm enough phrase to keep people out, or must I stop hosting?",09Jan2018,4

Is there a good resource (besides browsing job listings) for finding out what's most needed in the area?

392,"Throughout my entire life, I can't say I've ever been good at anything. I've never had a talent, either. I used to draw a lot, mostly horses, but I also drew some anime. I was always... fine. They were never good, nothing to ever get excited over. There was always that one kid that is better at drawing than you, just like it is with everything. I wanted to be a musician, and play the clarinet. The only reason that sounded 'good' was because the instrument was designed for professionals, and was wooden rather than cheap plastic. I played for years. I stopped due to financial problems. I want to play the piano, but I know I'll suck, and I once again cannot afford lessons. I'm not good at maths, nor science. I'm bottom for both classes, though it would help if I wasn't in the highest ability sets. I wanted to be a writer. I stopped writing after confiding the fact to a friend, and they wrote some questionable fanfiction which I read, and it was so much better. Then another girl started writing fanfiction and, despite the fact I do not write fanfiction, I feel awful because I think hers is better. Everything I've tried in life, I'm awful at. Everyone goes on about how bright I am. 

And that annoys me. I am not intelligent. It's always been said and it just is not true, otherwise my grades would not be so low. I wouldn't struggle in classes so much. I'd be good at something. 

Obviously this is bothering me, and I just want it to leave me alone now. Please tell me how to accept that. I just want to move on from this. ",09Jan2018,3
