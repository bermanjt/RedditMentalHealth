0,"I very recently got out of a relationship and now I have absolutely nothing to do. I deleted all of social media months ago so now I am stuck trying to find something to do without the help of that. Also, all the friendships I had prior to the relationship fell apart and I haven't been able to find anybody with the same interests or hobbies as me. Another thing that turns me away from being friends with somebody is if they're constantly on their phone and need it in their sight and hands at all time, or if they are super into social media (even unknowingly) because then it feels like I don't know the real them. Where do people usually go to organically find friends? I know a big one is hanging out with groups and finding mutual friends from there but I don't have that. I literally feel so alone. I am a female and 18, and I would really like to enjoy life and have fun but it is really hard to find anybody, what should I do? Where can I go to meet new people?",17Dec2018,1

2,"Long post but really need advice..

So in March of 2018 I had been training for a half marathon (I was running 6-10 miles for my long days and 3-4 on other days) On my long runs I felt my leg starting to get tight after a while but it did not hurt. Then one day I started running and it immediately felt tight so I stopped running. I took time off from running and just did the gym, it didn’t seem to be getting better so I started going to physical therapy in June. After a few months of physical therapy I didn’t feel like it was getting better but worse/ I would wake up and my knee would hurt and then sometimes my left just from walking. I ended up going to an orthopedic who thought it may have just been from overuse of running and not warming up properly. He said let’s try an MRI to see if anything comes back- and I was kind of wishing something would show up to explain why I was still feeling pain.. well nothing showed up so he tried a cortisone shot and honestly I feel like it made things worse. I was so tight and sore the day I got it I could barely walk, my hips and both knees felt like they were burning for the first week and half. I had a follow up appointment, he doesn’t see anything on the MRI so he is referring me to a different orthopedic. I have to wait until January. I loved running so much and now it just hurts to walk. I know most likely nobody is a doctor here but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else or if anyone has any advice!? Thank you all for reading all of this!",17Dec2018,1
3,"For some context, we want out on a coffee date and it went alright. I’m just so interested in her, but I don’t think she’s that interested in me.

To kind of give me a peace of mind, I was thinking of just saying “I’m kind of getting the vibe that you’re not interested and it’s ok if you’re not.” Would this be too rude or out there, she goes to my uni and I wouldn’t want to make this extremely awkward. I

Right now I asked her to smoke and hangout and she said she would be up for it but she doesn’t have any flower on her, even though I have concentrates or what’s known as a pen. She left me hanging with I’ll let you know, and it’s been two hours. 

I just don’t like being left in limbo and I don’t want to be thinking about her if she doesn’t care about me. I’ve just stressed so much over her and I think I’m just an option to her. 

Any thing I was thinking is just unfollowing her after a couple of days if she doesn’t initiate anything, but I feel like that would be more jerking.

5,"I have had a truly horrendous fourteen months. I will not explain it all. Only what I believe to be relevant. A little backstory about me; M24: I moved fourteen months ago, 250 miles from my family (the only family member to have ever done so in generations) with my fiance, who shortly left me because ""She couldn't deal with her shit if she had to be there for mine too"". My world collapsed and 11 months later I am still not over it. Now, a combination of pride and hatred kept me in my new place and I remained living there, moved my friend up with me and found a new girl. Three house moves and four failed jobs later (I've never been fired. I just quit frequently due to anxiety/depression/etc.) and I'm diving between sofa cushions for enough money for pasta or rice.  
Long story short things are no longer working with this girl, I'm horribly depressed and have cried more times in the past two months than in the preceding ten years. My house mate/best friend and I are drifting more and more into resenting each other and our very different ways of life and ultimately I've lost all purpose and drive due to repeated failures. I have told my housemate and girlfriend that I'm leaving to go back home in exactly a month and have been offered a month to stay at my dad's place. Now...I always said I'd rather be a good man than a happy man and subsequently I have no cash as I spent it all on paying for my fiance's house post-breakup (I moved her here to achieve her dreams, letting her crash and burn as well seemed like a waste of the past few years of my life) and moving my friend here took a lot of cash too. We're talking a collective 12,000 pounds. Essentially my yearly earnings after tax.  I have no possessions because I sold them all to those ends. No matter how obvious it may seem, I need some advice on starting my life fresh with me as the focal point. How do I find purpose? Where do I go from here? Is this even the right thing to be doing?

10,"Some backstory to help understand. I worked at the job in question for nearly 3 years, and then was fired last November without being given a reason (I can't think of anything termination worthy I did, but have an idea or two why I was let go, although neither are likely). I've applied for the job 3 times since then, once in April, once in July, and once in September. No call in April, no call in July, and then in September, I received an e-mail citing interest for a phone interview. Phone interview went great, and she mentioned how she saw I was a former employee. During the interview, I let them know that if I was chosen, I would need to give my current employer two weeks notice, and I also had a preplanned vacation to Florida the second week of October. She said it was fine, and that she still had to see if I was eligible for rehire, and that she would call or e-mail me with a decision either way. Never heard from them again, and I left a voicemail that didn't get returned.

Well, the job showed up *again* on Indeed (the job has a massive turn around rate, it's like a revolving door). I mentioned I may apply again, because I've never officially been told that I can't work there again. I honestly think it's because they needed to fill the position, and I wouldn't have been available until almost end of October. My wife said I should remove it from my resume so they don't see it and avoid me. I think this is insanely stupid, because even if they don't see it on my resume, they do have records that'd show I was a former employee, and then wouldn't it just look like I was being deceitful?

So I come to you guys. Should I apply again as normal, maybe even call ahead and see if HR can tell me why I was let go in the first place? Or should I remove the entry from my resume and see what happens?",17Dec2018,1
11,"I was in the military for four years, just got out in 2017 to go to college and get my degree. My time in the military was not good at all; had some terrible things happen. I figured college was the best option for me. I've been going school NONSTOP since Spring 2017 and using the GI Bill to live off of. I just recently decided not to go for the winter term, as short as it is. So since I'm not going to school, I won't be getting paid for the time I'm out. Knowing this I applied to a bunch of jobs and ended up getting hired at a marina on a military base, as a recreation assistant. I'm supposed to start tomorrow morning and no matter how I think about it, no matter what angle or perspective I look at it, I cannot shake this bad gut feeling. I do have anxiety but I've had it all my life and know to recognize it, as well as push it aside when it comes to important things like this. Basically my options are: start this job and possibly go part-time to school or go back to school in the spring and keep getting paid from the GI Bill. Both options are about the same amount money-wise. 

I've asked my family (parents and older sister) and boyfriend the same and got a mixed response. Family said it's just nerves, boyfriend said go with your gut.

So Tim and Gwonda have been together for roughly 5 years, and over that time they have broken up a couple of times because Tim cheated several times, but about a year and a half ago he promised to change and Gwonda said this is his last chance and they have been fine since. Around 8 or 9 months ago she moved in with him from her home about 3 hours away and they have been reasonably happy. Recently Gwonda has started talking about how if it wasn’t for her not making enough money she would leave Tim or that sometimes she wants to just run away because she thinks he’s cheating again. I’ve known Tim longer than Gwonda but I’m not a fan of cheaters, I recommended pre marital counseling to Gwonda but I’m unsure if I should tell Tim that she is having second thoughts.

16,"My uncle, who I have always been close to, has recently been convicted of distributing child pornography. Let me be clear here, as far as we know he hasn't been engaging in sexual activity with young boys or making child pornography himself, he has been active in several online communities that share such images and videos. 

As a result of this, my family have completely disowned him to the extent where my father (his brother) has taken to destroying images of them growing up. 

Since his conviction (forced to declare himself as a sex offender, and community service, no prison)  he has attempted to reach out to me through WhatsApp twice claiming that he needs at least one family member to remain close to him in order to survive. I ignored the first message but I told my father about the second as he seemed genuinely desperate for some form of contact. My father, surprisingly, told me I could do with my life whatever I wanted to and it wasn't his place to tell me what to do. 

So I guess my question here is should I reach out to him and 'be there' for him despite his perverted crime?

17,"I have anxiety issues, and one best friends (let's call him W) is starting to trigger it.I had a crush on him in 8th grade, but managed to repress it as he showed no interest and I realized we didn't have chemistry. We remained friends, but I don't think I did a good job of getting rid of a crush because every time I would talk with him, it felt like there was a bit of artificial distance. We still trust each other a lot. 

About a month ago, college admissions stress exacerbated them, but little later, I started talking more with W. Then, for no reason in particular, every time I start seeing him, my anxiety response kicks in: severe migraines, neck strain, heightened senses. Now, talking with him literally feels so wrong but so right. Just to be clear, there is precedent for things/people I care deeply about (i.e. cooking and one of my best friends) giving me anxiety, but they always had a singular cause. I can't really identify a cause here, except perhaps the repressed feelings. 

This is about when I start to realize (and learned through a mutual friend) that he's interested in a friends with benefits, which I do somewhat reciprocate (he's cute af), but my anxiety is getting in the way. Yet he's always on my mind, and I'm pretty confident I feel something for him, but I don't know if just me being horny or a full romantic crush. He took me on a date of sorts yesterday, and while it was fun, it was also somewhat awkward because my anxiety made it a little difficult. But then last night, I facetimed him, and my anxiety didn't really get in the way of that. 

I guess what I need to figure out is

* What I want from our relationship
* Why I have this anxiety
* How I can stop this anxiety",17Dec2018,1

19,"I started college this year in psychology , away from my hometown in Belgium to Brussels which is an hour by car of distance away. The problem is I haven't shown a cent of motivation for going to class. 

I started by going to all my classes and more and more I would skip classes that I find were at an unconventional time for me for instance. There are a lot of things that bother me though, and I know I'm supposed to be an adult but I hate needing to take the train back to Brussels every Monday (by skipping class and not telling anyone (because I profoundly hate the idea of going back on Sunday afternoon)). 

Every end of week I tear up thinking of going back. It's not like I didn't make any friends the people are nice I'm even paired in group work with this cute girl I met; that's the only reason holding me back from totally wanting to stop college... 

I have two cats and one stray I look after and I don't know why but I'm very attached to them and they keep being on my mind every day of the week, I also don't like living with six other people and share the kitchen because since the people that share the floor with me don't even speak french like me and don't even go to my college so we have 0 interaction so I decide to be socially inept and not eat at the same time as them or even sometimes starve myself till the kitchen is free...

Also I smoke weed everyday, and I devote a lot of money into it (50$+ a week) and I want to learn to slow down on that, because I smoke way too frequently and I don't think it's helping me in any way... I don't want to quit but just learn to not smoke so often because I'm tempted.  


I haven't gone to college for a while now and my exams are in November... I know I'm fucked but how can I maybe pass this semester? If I end up actually motivating myself?

And what should I do otherwise?

Well most if not all comments told me I really needed mental health help and therapy. A week ago happened to be my doctors appointment for a checkup. I told them about my depression and they referred me to a therapist.  I went on Friday(after a lot of struggling of not wanting to go out of anxiety but I pushed myself) it was mostly setting up my plan and stuff and I did get to talk. 

I did get diagnosed with depression, anxiety and trauma (From a time where I was on my way to school and a guy in a car tried to persuade me get in the car and obviously rape me but I never got in and he ended up taking his dick out and masturbating as he stared at. He thought I was in middle school but I was only 17. I ended up running crying to a guy who was crossing the street for help. It scared the guy in the car but the guy crossing the street basically told me to fuck off. So I ran to school and reported it while bawling my eyes out. I really don't know why that guy did that considering it was winter and I was bundled up in big winter clothes. I think he just mistook me for a middle schooler which is even worse.

23," 

Urgently needed advice about a weird/first situation.

So, in short: a couple of days ago I (20F) got really drunk, like, very wasted, and ended up sleeping with an acquaintance (a dude from the male soccer team (with which my team - girls- trains)). Now, I'm a virgin regarding PiV, but I've done lots of other things. Only, since I've never had a boyfriend (so no regular sex with 1 person) and never felt lubrificated enough, although I tried, I never arrived to penetration, it hurt too much. With this dude I slept with. so, I gave him lots of head (although he said he couldn't come just from that, he was very happy with what I was doing), he did the same to me a bit, and we tried penetration a couple of times and failed. I may have even cried once for the frustration but my memory's hazy. anyways, he was really sweet and I enjoyed myself. After we cuddled for the rest of the night till early morning and talked a lot. He did most of the talking actually, but I was enjoying myself. I told him not to tell anyone in the teams what had gone down (gossip is crazy there) and he promised so, I don't think he took it personally.

Now, I think I might be crushing on him. I don't think we could ever actually date (very different places in life -he's 10 years older than me-, he just broke up of a really serious relationship, I don't think I want him as a bf), but I miss the intimacy we had right after the night. I think I miss any kind of regular intimacy with boys, it might not even be a crush, just this need. So, if I was a different person, I'd think that a FWB situation would be the ideal. If only I was able to actually fuck and make him cum. Also, I'd be wary to propose it to him, cause even though we were both sober by the end of the night (so by morning), I still get anxious it might have been the alcohol to have caused his attraction to me. I have a pretty face but am a bit overweight, although proportionate and very healthy. Also he seemed to enjoy my body a lot. But again, drunk.

Saw him again today, he played with his team and gave me a ride home after the match, so that I could give him some stuff he had left at my home back when we fucked. Was kinda hoping he'd come in the house with me and we'd have some fun but nope, waited in the car. The ride was kinda awkward, but we managed to talk about our holiday projects. After I got him his stuff I made him laugh recounting a thing he did drunk that night (not while fucking, but a note he wrote for some reason at the beginning of the night saying I hadn't killed him, which I told him would immediately get me arrested if he was found dead), and then hugged him good bye and happy holidays. He still shoud give me my sweater back, so I might see him again before the holidays, but who knows.

I just don't really know what I could do with this man. If I was anybody else I'd propose him to fuck again but that isn't possible in this situation. Also dating sounds complicated, and not even sure something I'd want. What I'd want is a situation where I get to give him and receive some head, we then cuddle and then chat a bit. And maybe we even try PiV (also, while drunk I told him ""when I buy lubricant I'll call you right ahead to try and do this again, would you do it?"" and he said yes absolutely but yeah, drunk and horny, maybe the wrong time to ask that).

SO I'd like to know in your opinion if this could be doable and satisfactory for a dude, and also if exists another kind of relationship in which I could be with this guy that would make us both happy.

idek, I still need to process a lot of stuff, but in the meantime I'd love some external feedback.

tl;dr: is there a relationship situation aside from dating where I get to give him and receive some head, cuddle and chat with this acquaintance I'll see regularly with whom I had a random one night stand a couple of days ago? Or should I just get over it. Also, in general, is there a way to get physical intimacy (aside from sex and dating, both things I'm terrible at) with guys? I really miss it and I don't want sex to just be a way to get there.",17Dec2018,1
24,"We broke up today after what must've been the millionth argument. Been dating almost a year and a half and I really thought I was going to go far with him, but obviously not. I know I should have realised sooner that he wasn't going to change (he's treated me unfairly and done many things that have hurt me while being minimally apologetic about it, but I'm not here to discuss that anyway.) And honestly, if I was a woman with more self-esteem that wasn't so petrified of being alone, I would've broken up with him like, 6 months ago. But stupid naive me thought if I just kept going and believing he'd change then things would be different. Now I know loving someone isn't enough to keep a relationship afloat, and I'm done putting in 80% of the effort to do that.

He does love and care about me, but he loves and cares about himself more, and is clearly too selfish/childish/not ready to be in a serious relationship. I do one day want to stay friends with him but right now I'm too unbelievably angry at him (and myself for putting up with it for so long) to do that. How do I get closure and move on from him? I don't want to spend every night crying anymore. I did that enough DURING the relationship.

They (almost) all have a loved one, they have friends from high school who still hang with them, and they’re doing great in their social life.

Me however... this scares me. I am a natural introvert and I don’t like to show my feelings, but the thought of abandonment (recently experienced with my ex), the thought of being forever forgotten, the thought that never being able to achieve true love with someone and having them stick with you till death. It’s scary, it’s a thought that shakes me to my core. 

I’ve never been in long term relationships, most of my current friends are old relationships rekindled by circumstances, and others lost due to those circumstances. My ex-girlfriend left me for another girl and that’s totally fine, but I felt the feeling of being abandoned. With the recent events that have been going on in the world, and with my lack of friendships. My life is feeling more and more worthless. And currently, my future as a human being is looking grim. All I got going is my education and my will to learn, I’m not a hot guy, I’m not the smartest person, I’m not the most sociable person either. More and more, each day, I feel a hand grab my chest and it feels tighter each day, because of these feelings of being abandoned, these feelings of being forgotten, these feelings that my life really isn’t worth anything in the grand scope of the entire Universe, it feels that I’ll live and die and no one will mourn my death. 

In the end, I came to ask about your thoughts, what do you think about this? I still have hope that I’ll be able to have a loved one like many do, and that I’ll have friendships that last a life time, but... that seems like a grim chance each day.

When I was about 15, she started getting prescribed pain pills, and now abuses those and drinks. She has gotten mentally out of control, and manipulates everyone around her to an extreme. She is very hateful and aggressive towards everyone but myself, and will never admit to doing wrong. While I have accepted her as being a piece of shit to even my brothers and sisters, it is hard to ignore that she is my mother, and that she was a good one for the first few years of my life. As a mom to two young kids, it is hard to reconcile that fact. I have tried in the past to take breaks from her but I end up believing she has changed every time. No one I know has any advice for me saying that they would’ve just cut her out a long time ago, as she has done some pretty horrible things to all of us. I’m at the point now, where I can’t sit by and allow her to treat herself and everyone else like crap. My question is, do I set up an intervention and try to help, or do I give up on her? Her family (brothers, sisters, mom, and husband) believe her every time, as she manipulated them to think she’s the victim and the rest of us are just out to get her. She is mentally unstable and typically holds us hostage with “I’ll just kill myself and it’ll all be your fault line”. Which is why I’ve never taken steps before to get her help. I’m honestly confused as to how to deal with someone in this mind state and don’t want to make things worse, but I also cannot ethically live with myself allowing her to lie and manipulate everyone, nor can I mentally break the connection with her to let her go.

I'm 21 I still live with my parents with the trashy Walmart job I had when I finished high school and in two years i'v learned and dealt with a lot and I think i'v matured a lot.

I made this Reddit account because i'm looking for advice on my situation. I want to go to community college and dedicate myself to being something. I wanted to go to college for IT but i'm worried if the damage is already done and if I just shouldn't try and give up and i'll just always be a failure. Did I set myself up for failure with my terrible high school grades with my immaturity and ignorance and am I just a lost cause?",17Dec2018,1
29,"Throwaway here. I’ll try to nutshell this ridiculous story....

I work at a small hippie grocery store where everything is “fun” but hardly professional. My supervisor served me a write-up because he thought he saw me chatting to someone on the floor; in reality I was asking a coworker a work-related question. I refused to sign the write-up and went straight to HR; HR suggested I have a mediated meeting with my supervisor, my department boss, and the HR guy. 

It takes them a week to finally do the meeting (I was starting to think they’d forgotten). Without hesitation, my boss tells me he’s defending my supervisor and backing up the write-up, saying that regardless of the situation I’m apparently just *such* a bad worker that I was overdue for a write-up anyway (side note: I’ve been working nearly 7 full-time years, never had a problem until this). I start to protest saying that I was on-task, to which my boss fires back that he spoke with the security guy in our store who presented my boss with a report on my poor work performance. This absolutely floored me and I really had no way of defending against such an accusation (I’ve never had my work evaluated via security footage before, and I don’t think anyone else in the store has!). HR guy basically sided with them, which was frustrating as he was the one who suggested I have the meeting. 

Today, I bumped into the security guy and earnestly asked him if he had any advice as to how I could possibly improve, as his report was mainly responsible for the tone of the meeting. He gave me a blank stare and said that all he was asked to do was check the cameras to see how long I was talking to the coworker, nothing else. The notion that he parsed through my entire day and made a report about my work was false. He said he wanted to speak to my boss and tell him not to make shit up. That’s where we both ended our day.

So now... I’m worried. I’m worried that I may have opened Pandora’s box by going to security guy. I’m worried this will be seen as me not letting things go and trying to go over my boss’ head. My employer is at-will and I guess I’m freaking out that they could potentially fire me over this. This is my first job and I really don’t want it to end as such. But who can I possibly go to when my boss, my supervisor and HR stand by the decision that I was wasting time (when I really wasn’t)?

What should I do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you. ",17Dec2018,1

31,"I was in the military for four years, just got out in 2017 to go to college and get my degree. My time in the military was not good at all; had some terrible things happen. I figured college was the best option for me. I've been going school NONSTOP since Spring 2017 and using the GI Bill to live off of. I just recently decided not to go for the winter term, as short as it is. So since I'm not going to school, I won't be getting paid for the time I'm out. Knowing this I applied to a bunch of jobs and ended up getting hired at a marina on a military base, as a recreation assistant. I'm supposed to start tomorrow morning and no matter how I think about it, no matter what angle or perspective I look at it, I cannot shake this bad gut feeling. I do have anxiety but I've had it all my life and know to recognize it, as well as push it aside when it comes to important things like this. Basically my options are: start this job and possibly go part-time to school or go back to school in the spring and keep getting paid from the GI Bill. Both options are about the same amount money-wise.

I've asked my family (parents and older sister) and boyfriend the same and got a mixed response. Family said it's just nerves, boyfriend said go with your gut.

33,"Idk where to post this but I would really like some opinions on what this could mean...

To start off I live alone and I am a female in her mid 20s. Friday night I go to the grocery store around 9. Wake up around 8 on Saturday and go outside to find a cookie shoved into my door. I have a regular front door with a wrought iron door in front of that. It sort of has a design and well... functions as bars over the door. Not the best neighborhood. There’s a cookie shoved into the bar area of the door. Someone obviously visited my house in the middle of the night and left... a cookie?? It looked like a homemade chocolate chip cookie. Also want to note that I have a gate at the end of my driveway so someone would have had to open the gate to come on my property.

Other people opinions have been “cmon is a burglar or rapist going to go walking around with cookies??” Most people I have told think it’s a kid playing a prank. I’m honestly freaked out simply because someone came to my house at night.... My thought is that they wanted to know if I was home or possibly on vacation, and checked back to see when the cookie went missing. Something as innocent as a cookie certainly isn’t going to get the police out to someone’s house (I didn’t call them).

Thoughts??? I did invest in Ring and some more locks the second I found it. ",17Dec2018,1

My wife doesn't know how to deal with this. She thinks I do these things for attention, and it feels like she chooses not to understand and learn about what is happening to me.

36,"This is why I made a reddit account but it took a while to figure out this website. It is weird that I can't post the images I want to post so I will just describe it in the text.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my mother handed me a book while she was cleaning the house. It was a first edition English copyright 1952 by Otto Frank and Introduction by Eleanor Roosevelt - ""Anne Frank the Diary of a Young Girl"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we was deep cleaning the house I almost threw it away but then I decided I would just donate it since I had read the school version of the book. Mom handed it to me because I used to collect WWII items and a lot of books. But I do not remember ever getting this book. 

  
( Otto Frank was Anne Franks father and the only member of the family that survived the concentration camps. )

&amp;#x200B;

When I flipped through the pages...photos started to fall out. There was a total of five. Two was like a post card one photo was of the building they hid in the ""attic"" of, the next one was this chapel church post card. The other three was original photos. The first one was of Jan ( but called Henk on the photo) , Miep, a boy, and Otto Frank, it was even written on the photo. The back has the year and month ""Juni 1963"". The next photo is of Otto Frank and his second wife Elfriede, Back says ""Otto Frank and Mrs. Frank 1959"" with a red numbers and letter stamped on it. The last photo was of Anne Frank. She's sitting in a chair outside with a hat in her lap. You can see this photo online. But the online photos are all zoomed in. I couldn't find a photo online of the entire photo that I have. The back has pencil and pen ( blue ink ). The pencil says Anne Frank then the ink says ""Sommer 1941"" there is these red numbers and then very faded is the watermarks the watermark is ""Gevaert"".

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted the Anne Frank Museum in the Netherlands. They are very interested in the photos and we have been corresponding through email.  They have requested scans of the photos and I used three different scanners but none turned out well where you can see the details on the back of the photos so I have offered that my cousin that is a professional photographer to take the photos of the details and watermarks.  

&amp;#x200B;

The museum is actually not surprised the photos ended up in my state in the U.S. they said that Otto Frank had a lot of correspondence from America after he published the book in English.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is something really terrible happened to me legally and it cost my family 30k. Now we are in serious debt because of the situation. My mother says she wants to sell the photo if it is the original.. Because we are having to mortgage the house again to pay off my debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I know you're supposed to donate to museums not sell the items.. especially since I contacted them about the photo. I think it would be rude to just sell the photos instead of donating to the museum especially since I was like ""Look what I found"". I am torn up morally about this. I would never ask money for these photos but my mother wants them sold to help pay towards the debt... I would rather just work and keep paying the debt through a job.  

I think it is extremely rude to contact a museum and then decide to sell them if they are the originals. I will donate them if they are what they seem to be.. but it will disappoint my mother. Am I making the right choice?? I am dedicated to paying my family back the 30k, I just don't want to sell the photos to help pay the debt. ",17Dec2018,1

49,"Background a little bit:  I work in a smokeshop have been since August of 2017. I quit during shift back in April because the manager said some fucked up shit to me. They fired him a month later over some shit he said to a customer and they offered me my position back.

I was there through the transition of finding a new manager, worked my ass off, covered shifts, helped train new employees. 

Fast forward a few months. Have a new manager, he ends up letting go of our assistant(that's a whole other story in itself). So I should be up next to move up. I've been there the longest, I know this store from top to bottom, our customers love me, I'm not going to school.  But instead he puts me up against another clerk who has been there 6 months. still screws up on shit constantly. 

So he trains both of us. But not in a usual train for 4-5 days and see who's best. He trained me 2 days then no ones trained for a week and then the other clerk 2 days, it goes on like this for about a month and a half. The 2nd week of our 'training' the other clerk is late to her training shift. She doesnt get written up. Okay whatever, were still training together. Another week goes by, I'm late and got written up and lose the position. So I'm sitting here wondering why it mattered when I'm late but not her. Whatever let it go, start looking for other jobs because I feel like its bullshit. 

Comes to light that she was late AGAIN and then last Friday. She came to work drunk when she was supposed to be training another new clerk. Our manager is aware of it and he didnt write her up or tell our district manager. 

I want to know if I should say something to him. I've been treated like shit since I was late almost 3 weeks ago now and now this clerk is gettin special treatment and I think its fucked up. I've worked my ass off here only to get stomped on. I just feel I deserve better treatment and dont want to be hushed under the rug

55," I lived with 2 roommates (they are brothers). I looked at porn when living with them despite knowing they are both software engineers. At the time, I didn't care because none of my interests are illegal, and I figured it would be unethical for them to spy on me. I trusted that they wouldn't. We were also friends for 6 years so I didn't think much of it. I didn't use a VPN or anything like that. However after sometime I noticed that when our other friends would visit they would allude to some of the porn I looked at. In sort of a passive tone- just poking fun. It was pretty clear to me what was going on and I was/am extremely pissed off. Who the hell would violate someones privacy like that and then tell everyone? I'm assuming the router was logging my browsing history. Who knows what else they had to monitor me. This was well over a year ago. I moved out because of this and they were also disrespecting me in many other ways. I just got sick of it all and cut my ties with them. We squared our finances and signed the paperwork. We are not friends anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that allegedly I still owe them $900. There's no way to substantiate it. They messaged me about it countless times saying that I need to pay them back or they would take me to court and sue me. They were trying to scare me, but at the very least all they can do is take me to small claims. It's been a year and nothing has happened and I don't think anything will ever happen. At first I was sort of responsive to them, wiling to pay them, then started realizing the extent of which they told everyone. Thankfully I never admitted to owe them money. So I blocked them on all social media and stopped responding. They never mentioned leaking my porn habits to mutual friends. We all know it happened, it is still happening, but they just want their money back so they will never mention/admit it.

Ultimately, I sort of care because it does slander my reputation. So I figure - fuck them. Not going to pay them a cent. If they tell people about my porn- I can say they are trying to use that against me so they can scam me. Am I in the wrong? Should I try confronting them about the porn thing? ",17Dec2018,1

TW in advanced- sexual abuse 


About four years ago, when I was 16, I woke up to my aunt’s boyfriend touching me. I slept in the living room of my grandparents, I was wearing shorts, and I remember waking up because I was cold and my legs were feeling tickled. I have no idea if that’s the only thing that happened, but that’s what I woke up to. His creepy, leering face. 

My mother wasn’t home, as she was on a weekend trip with my sister. I did go to my grandma. She told me to just stop wearing shorts. Since then, I’ve avoided going around him and my aunt or family functions, as if I do, he doesn’t leave me alone and it’s left me frightened of the dark and having continuous panic attacks at night. I feel disgusted at the thought of him. 

Recently, I found out my family is planning on going to my cousins for Christmas Eve, everyone, including my aunt’s boyfriend, will be there. I told my mother I didn’t want to go, and she is still making me.

This brings me to tonight, and I got into it with my parents. Out came the anger, because I know my mom knows, and she is still making me go around him. I told her I felt like she didn’t care about me if she is making me go around someone who did what he did.

My father apparently was never told. My mom flipped out and started screaming that I’m lying, I’m a compulsive liar, and that it’s a slap in the face to a victim of sexual abuse that I would lie about being molested, amongst other awful things.


I am not lying, quite frankly I’m already depressed and suicidal and this is adding onto it, and I don’t know what to do. It’s not even about the Christmas Eve shit, I just don’t know what to do because my father is standing by my mother’s side and agreeing with her. 

I have a history of sexual abuse, and assault, some of which my parents/family don’t know about. My mom also through in the fact that I “allowed” myself to be sexually assaulted by a friend, and have a track record of befriending awful people. I would never lie about anything, and it’s caused life-long anxiety, self image issues, and panic attacks.

He can’t control his job, his living situation, or anything else, but he said he can easily control us and therefore he wanted to end “us” to focus on other things. He said he can’t put his time and energy in a relationship because it’s making him more stressed out. When he told me a month ago that he was starting to feel depressed, I tried giving him space and tried being there for him whenever he needed me. Everything seemed fine, but now it’s the complete opposite and it literally came out of nowhere. 

I lost the love of my life. I lost my world. He told me he doesn’t want to be in contact with me for a while. None of this makes any sense to me. I feel helpless and worthless and like trash. I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder for a very long time. I’ve attempted suicide in the past and have gotten help, but I went down that road again. I overdosed on Tylenol and ended up in the hospital. I feel broken.

Some friends have told me that he’s been reaching out trying to see if I’m alive and okay, but I don’t even want him to know. He promised me he wouldn’t break me like every other fucking relationship I’ve had, but he did. I’m so sick of opening up to people and breaking my walls down for them to just get fucked in the end. Every single goddamn time.

He said we both need to reflect on what went wrong in our relationship. He needs to try building his confidence back up and get rid of his depression. He wants to see his friends, but not me? How does that even make sense? I was there for him for everything. I tried helping him every single goddamn time he needed someone. He’s just going to move on and start dating again. They always do. I can’t do it anymore.",17Dec2018,1

70,"Context: I'm currently a 20 year old college drop out, I moved country to study &amp; I dropped out. I'm home for Christmas &amp; I'm debating whether to go back or not.

So I'm Irish, I have completed my Leaving Certificate and also a course after the LC (It's basically a level 4 and then I went on to complete my Level 5). Bachelor's degree is level 7 &amp; Master's is level 8, if that makes it more easier to understand. 

So I moved to Malta about three months to study 'Software Development' and I had an interest in it but I always was into the server side of things (cyber security/networking). I'm going back to Malta in January to work as a 'Customer Service Representative' and also as a 'Bar Man'. I will be on good money but that's not the reasoning for this post that was just insight into my current situation. 

One of the reasons, I want to move back to Malta is maybe I could meet people in these types of companies and I could start low and work my way up? (This mightn't work at all). Or will I move back home and start college again for the next three years? (I don't think college is for me). 

Malta is an island right now where all the tech companies are so if I got lucky and started in one and work my way up? Or I was thinking of moving to the USA or Canada? \*I know what's the point, I literally don't have a college degree\* I need some guidance on this, I'm so lost at the moment.

I have a little extra mass, but not much. I am awkward around her but I am really outgoing and entertaining otherwise. At last years at homecoming, there was a lock-in afterwards (it sucked). But there was this truth or dare game, and me and her were in it. I was truthed into telling her my feelings. She smiled really big and went ""Aw, that's so sweet. Thank you!"". Since then we haven't talked that much outside of school, since I do not have social media.  We'll have little moments when we talk. We'll both laugh and smile, they usually are kind of awkward. Sometimes I catch her staring at me and we also will lock eyes for what seems like an eternity. She's really friendly to me but I just don't know if she likes me or if shes just being nice. I don't know if she is dating anyone but I don't think she is. Homecoming is Jan 12. Should I ask her out, yes or no, yay or nay? Sorry for such a long post but I really need this advice.

72,"I was venting to my mom about a roommate1 (her own room) that I have that talks crap about my roommate2 (shared room with me) and I. Roommate 1 told a mutual friend of roommate 2 that we were messy (just for context: she’s right, it was finals week and I had to do a project for my art class so I laid out my work in the living room floor, was exhausted so went to sleep and woke up early to keep grinding. additionally there’s three stacked big plastic containers on one side of the wall because roommate 2 is part of a club on campus and she couldn’t get stuff to storage, so they’re in the living room). Additionally, roommate 1 always spends time in her own room AND has never cleaned (not even a fucking crumb,) off the counter, kitchen, etc., and never hangs out in the living room (that is basically furnished because of me). So I’m like oh hold up, roommate 1 really called us messy?!?! Also, mind you she (roommate 1) never makes an effort to communicate with either of us about anything. So, as I’m talking to my mom I’m telling her that literally any shit that roommate 1 talks behind my back, that it’ll eventually get back to me since I know a lot of people and I’m basically on their good side. Sorry this is a lot longer than I was anticipating but my mom offered me this piece of advice:
Whenever anyone asks you what it’s like living with roommate 1, tell the person it’s like living with a scorpion. They’ll attack only when you have your back turned, but never when you’re facing them face to face.

79,This has been bothering me for a few months now and I need some advice. I used to work part time at a halfway house three years ago and I thought my female boss was possibly having an affair with an inmate. What started it all was the inmate joking about going to the boss's house when he would come in from work. Well sometime after that he started going back to the same job at night working twice a day and we were suppose to make verification calls and we could not reach him and I called the boss and she said she would talk to him and she told us a couple days later that the section he works in at night has no telephone service because we had to call the only number on file and that part of the office is locked at night. So I reported her and said they need to investigate if she is having an affair with the inmate and she found out it was me and told me I was trying to ruin her reputation and I quit the job. I had a crush on her and she knew it. Emotions are irrational at times. I was thinking of writing her an apology letter but don't know. One part of me says let sleeping dogs lie and the other says dont leave things unsaid. Should I write her an apology letter or not? Thank you. ,17Dec2018,1

\-Slamming a worksheet onto a Mexican student's desk after talking once.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Violently snatching a book out of a Mexican student's hands because they were reading when they weren't supposed to be.

\-Spends more time disciplining Mexican students than some white students who arguably act out more in class.

I (21f) have a coworker (40ish f) who makes rude remarks to me a lot. she says them under the guise of a joke which is why i haven’t said anything but it’s really starting to bother me. 

we wear all black to work and I have dark hair and a monotone voice and she makes a lot of comments about me being “creepy” which my close friends do this as well bc im a dry dark person but she is not a friend or close friend and i don’t appreciate it. 

what pushed me over the edge was today we saw a woman wearing these really tall platform heels ( like the kind strippers wear) and i made a joke about how i’m going to start wearing shoes like that to work and she said “well it was already bad enough those tight pants you had on yesterday, but we just figured you were trying to impress *name of other coworker*” the pants I had on were just dress pants and they aren’t tight on me they just fit properly and when I said this she said “well they were tight and you still need everything covered, you don’t need to be getting between *coworker* and his wife’s marriage” 

it was about the end of my shift and I just went to the bathroom and cried because she essentially called me a home wrecker because of a pair of pants I was wearing, this is all sounding silly as i’m typing it out but it’s made me feel really insecure that people are talking about my clothes and not saying anything to me about it.

86,"To go into a bit more detail, my father in law has recently become obsessed with healthy living. While, I support his changes and very happy for him, he has started to become very obsessive. He now believes 100% in holistic healing, truly believes doctors and governments are trying to poison and kill us, that vaccines cause autism, that doctors are purposefully trying to give us cancer and only doctor’s in Mexico can cure cancer. Now, he can believe whatever he wants to, I’m fine with that, but he’s starting to overstep his boundaries a bit. Every time he comes over, he won’t stop badgering us about how we’re raising our son. He’s upset we vaccinate him, he’s upset that we bring him to a doctor. Now, the last couple visits, I’ve kept my mouth shut. I usually just avoid the topic and change the subject, however, the last time he came over, he would not drop it. I finally cracked and unloaded on him about vaccines, cancer and just basic biology, because if he even understood how our bodies work or how cancer forms, it would immediately contradict a lot of his statements. You can probably guess what happened, he didn’t want to hear it. He very immaturely threw his head back and rolled his eyes and talked over me. He gets all his information from Facebook and YouTube, even though I have tried to explain to him that those sites are not reputable. I eventually had to just start ignoring him because it was getting so bad. My husband has tried multiple times to tell him to stop pushing the subject. He’s tried nicely and he’s expressed frustration a few times. After he left he has been calling my husband every other day and texting huge long texts about why we shouldn’t vaccinate, etc. We have stopped answering his calls for now and his texts, but he’s not stopping. I feel like i’m going to explode. He won’t listen to reason, he basically doesn’t want to hear it, even if you shove the proof in his face. He won’t respond to gently telling him to drop it, he won’t respond to sternly being told to drop it and he won’t respond to ignoring him. I feel like the next time he comes over, I’m going to snap.

I don’t know if I just keep ignoring the subject, or potentially cause a rift in the family by putting him in his place. Thanks! ",17Dec2018,1
87,"**Context**: My direct roommate and I live on an on campus apartment that is under our university. In other words, we do not pay rent, each one of the students pays the university under their tuition. There are four students who live in this apartment building including my direct roommate and I. Just so things don't get confusing, my direct roommate/best friend is named Sarah. The other roommates are named Kaitlyn and Lucy. Sarah, Kaitlyn and I are all the same major, and we typically spend our mornings having breakfast. We hang out occasionally, and Sarah and Kaitlyn would often go out to parties together. Also, Sarah and I were roommates with Kaitlyn the year prior. About a month ago, Kaitlyn met a guy on campus from an online dating app, and they got very close. **TOO CLOSE**. After two weeks, they made their relationship official and basically, they do not spend one second away from each other. Kaitlyn basically dropped Sarah and I as friends. We do not eat breakfast together, we do not walk to class together, and she has been recently more moody with us ever since she got a boyfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Problem**: This boyfriend is **ALWAYS** at our apartment. Even when we are all in class (we basically have all the same classes), he is **STILL** at our apartment. Now, he is not bothersome. He is quiet and keeps to himself. But, what is a problem is that Sarah and I feel that we are confined to our own room. No, it is not like Kaitlyn and her boyfriend tell us to leave or give us dirty looks, it's just a vibe. Plus, who likes to wear a bra and appropriate pants where they live? Kaitlyn and her boyfriend come unannounced and I have my boobs flopping everywhere. Not like I'm trying to impress him, but it's not comfortable. Besides that, he is ALWAYS there. How should my direct roommate and I approach this situation? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Side Note**: We are beginning not to like Kaitlyn based on her moodiness and her constantly putting in her two cents towards us. For example, we could be making pancakes at 2PM and she is like ""Why are you making pancakes? It's not even breakfast"" with an attitude. So she is not the best person to confront without getting some attitude back.

In one of the classes I formed a group with two of closest friends, X and Y, but all the other groups in other classes were bad to say the least (bad as in I will have to do 80% of the work bad) so I was happy with this group because X and Y are really competent in school. The thing is, as time went by and as the semester started getting intense, I started procastinating a lot in the project I had to do with X and Y because I had to give more attention to the other projects where I didn't really have a choice but to do 3 people's worth of work by myself. I should mention that I participated in all the the other reports for the classes with X and Y. 


They were always saying that they had a lot to do and yet I had the most projects (but that is just me being petty in a meaningless thing). And then on friday I had to submit a project right after a test I had (they didn't even seem to care that I was clearly stressed out about everything) and then on Saturday I went to my brother's in hopes that I could start another project I have due next week with his help. The gave me a task, albeit one that they knew they couldn't do themselves, and I started getting into the project at night. I should tell you that I have been sleeping 2 hours a night so I was pretty tired by then... The project with X and Y was due Sunday (11 pm) and the things they sent me were full of errors (because the had Mac and I have windows) so it took me a lot of time just to get it all working... I actually thought I was contributing to the project by solving those errors, but they never used the things I sent them. Then, I started getting a little uneasy because I had to submit another report at the same time. Fortunately my other group decided to write it, but I still had to check it and see if they had put everything in it (which they didn't) and put some more stuff also... 
Let's just say that X and Y didn't that very well... I came back to the project and tried to get some more of it done, but they said they were going to submit it and then I apologized sincerely and what they said was ""don't expect a good grade, we didn't finish all of it""... 
So there's the story of how I got my great friends from college to hate me over a stupid project and stupid me. I really don't know what to do about this, I already apologized...

98,"I work at a membership services company (spa, leisure) and had an unpleasant encounter this morning. As company policy, we receive complimentary visits and are allowed to bring a guest (friends/families) several times per month. Today, my manager saw me and my friend together (a former employee himself who referred me to his position and knew my manager too) and approached us, asking my friend if he planned on buying a membership. At first we thought he was joking around, but then he said (in a rude manner) that he wasn't allowed to come as my guest anymore until he purchases his own membership. He then walked away, leaving us stunned.

&amp;#x200B;

We were taken aback by this, and when he passed my friend again (I stepped away for a minute), my friend said he wanted to speak to him in his office for a second before we left. I approached my manager afterward and let him know that I wasn't aware of anything I was doing wrong, since I was following the company policy and only bring him once a week or once every other week. My manager then told me that there isn't anything else to talk about...he is not an employee, does not have a membership, and comes at least once a week and is abusing the policy. He also mentioned that he has told me in the past that I cannot bring him anymore, which is not true. (Of course, if it were, I would immediately take that seriously and not bring him again.) I didn't tell him he was lying since that would worsen the situation, but I told him directly that I didn't recall him ever telling me anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

A few minutes later, we left, and my manager was gone, presumably to avoid confrontation. My friend and I were reflecting on how severe my manager's reaction was to all this, and I was trying to think about what to do next (follow up with him/talk to my other manager in person or over email/let it go, etc.) A few minutes later, my manager texted me, apologizing for coming off so rude. ""Hi Jake sorry if that was too blunt. I was just dealing with a rude customer and I came off too severe since I was trying to deal with that. Apologize about any misunderstanding about our guest policy. Hamza has come in several times before so he needs to get a membership or really decrease the amount of times he comes in to our facility.

100,"Hi the title says it all.  About three years ago I was admitted into a very good school for a pretty good program.   The main problem was that I hated it, but the actual main problem behind that issue was that I was a drunken drug addict who decided to work full-time while also doing this program.  Predictably it turned into being overworked, overtired and constantly binging.  There was actually one week where I spent literally almost every minute either wasted, watching pornography or doing both.  I failed really bad, and didn't even withdraw properly so I still got billed for the year.  Whatever.

Anyways, I ended up in fine dining because that's where degenerates drift to, and I've realized as of late that I'm not much of a degenerate, just a guy with some problems.  I'm more functioning than I previously was, and have enough savings that I wouldn't have to work full time (and would work in a much less stressful environment if I were allowed to go back to school).  The problem is that I don't know if I'm allowed back?  I don't know how university works.  When all my friends were graduating high school and going to university, I was being a lunatic and a moron.  My family is fairly unsupportive in a benign and clueless way, and all of my current friends are uneducated and don't really know how this works either.  

If I want to try and get a degree (not in the same program I flamed out in), what the hell would I even do as a first step?  I know a lot of this post comes off as snarky and nonchalant but that's mostly because I don't know what I'd even go about doing, and I'm kinda scared any school would just look at my record, saw I lasted a single semester before disappearing and not bother.  Basically I'm pretty concerned I've ruined my life because trades aren't for me and the longer I stay in food service the less I like myself and the world.

TLDR want to go back to school, failed out the first time and not sure how to get taken back by the sweet sweet lady of Higher Education.  Do I just say I'm sorry and I've learned my lesson and give them money?  Do I have to do a bridging program or something?  Or have I definitively sabotaged myself and ensured a lifetime of abusive low wage labor with nothing to look forward to besides sleep and its more final cousin?",17Dec2018,1
101,"I (19M) am curious if my friend (19F) would like this and maybe if it’s a bit too much. We became friends over a year ago while studying abroad with a few other people and we have since become really close. We’ve had dinner together over a dozen times, if that matters.

For Christmas, I’m planning on compiling ~10 of my favorite pictures of us together with 2 bonus pictures of my dog and putting it into a photo album using Shutterfly. I also want to put a message inside telling her how how much I appreciate her and how grateful I am that we’re friends.

To clarify, I am perfectly fine being friends and I want nothing more.

102,"My parents are divorced, they have been for quite a while now, if it means anything. Let's start with my dad. My dad and I don't always get along. I love him, but we argue quite a bit. He has a habit of making small issues bigger than they need to be and when he argues, he doesnt back up his claims with evidence or facts, when I do say my rebuttul he just says ""Thats what I'm saying,"" and continues to argue, ignoring what I say. Over the past few months he keeps asking me to cut my hair, bringing it up everytime my sister and I go to visit him, because it's his turn. I hate it when my hair is short. I guess because we're a blacl family my dad wants to ""uphold his culture"" and always says stuff like ""We're black, we have a culture,"" or sue to the fact that I watch anime he says ""Stop trying to fool yourself! You aren't Japanese! You don't see these Asians trying to look like us, why are you trying to look like them!"" Even though, that is not the case, I simply just want to grow my hair out. He doesn't even want to comprimise and let me get a trim, he wants it CUT, short, often comparing my hair to that of my friends of my old school, because they all keep their hair short, continuing to follow the standards of our old school, as it wad required to keep your hair short. Though, I'm not them? I'm me, they are not me. Sometimes he even says that the people around me don't like my hair, but they won't tell me, especially the parents. Even though, not even my friend's parents care, which was already confirmed. He's always inflating my hair into a bigger issue than it is and keeps trying to bring other people into it. He's started to reap some of my previliges until I cut my hair. I can't hang out with friends until I cut my hair. Sometimes he takes my laptop, 3DS, and the Wi-Fi for the whole day, but sometimes returns it. Last time, I gave in and got the sides of my hair trimmed and left the top untouched, which was fine by me and my dad was fine with it too, giving me my stuff back, until a couple weeks later when we visited him again and he didn't like it anymore, saying my hair is overgrown and whatnot and has been pestering me about it since. Today he took everything except my phone and threatens to keep my laptop, until I cut my hair, meaning I won't be able to take it back to mom's place, even though my mom bought the laptop, and the 3DS is a gift from my friend. I tried telling my mom and asked if he was allowed to do this, but instead she said that if I cut my hair, none of this would be happening, which she is right about to an extent, but she is usually chill about my hair, not really caring other than advising me to get a few trims. How should I go about this? Should I get my hair cut? I don't like it when it's short and I feel more insecure and self consious when it is short, but I don't want him to continue to reap me of my previlidges, though.

Onto my mom. My mom can be kind of controlling and she makes me feel trapped on conjunction with my dad. She doesn't really let me hang out with friends and when I ask she says ""You guys hang out too much, friends should only hang out once a month."" Even though I barely get to hang out with friends to begin with and was only ever allowed to for the first time last year, and I only hung out with them once last year. The last time I hung out with them this year was a couple months ago. I tell her this, but she doesn't listen. Sometimes when we get into arguments she'll start off by saying her argument, I ever remember what we argue about, but then I'll say my claim, sometimes even backing it ip with facts, but she'll either ignore it (if we're in the car), ignore me or walk away, still standing true to whatever was on the topic of the argument, ignoring me. Communication has been a problem for me concerning my mom, and she says it's bad, but when I try to confront her about something, either something she did or believes in, she'll twist the truth and ignore what I have to say. One time she punished my sister for ""being late to prayer"" because she was supposed to be in her room at 8:45 even though she was, and when I told my mom that it was, in fact, 8:45 and we were right on time, she starts to say it was 8:45 while my sister was drinking water in the kitchen. Which wasn't true because my sister and I both checked our watches while we were in the kitchen, and, believe me, it was 7:53. She also hasn't let me save any of my money until recently. It was only on my most recent birthday that my birthday money has lasted longer than 2 months, and it's not due to my spending, I don't even get to spend it anyway, it's due to my mom's, I don't even know were it goes, even though she assures me it's being saved, that is, until its not. Some people may say that she's using it on us and using it to provide, but I dunno what a mother, who payed for my dad's college, my sister's and I's school fees, and pays for the bills and groceries, is doing with $100 of a kid's b-day money.

With my dad my peoblems concerning him are like a punch to the gut but its only for a weekend, but with my mom its like a bunch of small slaps that add up and create some sort of chronic pain. I really don't want to stay with either of them at this point, as in I want a break, but I don't really have a choice until I'm 18.
Any advice on how to go about these situations?

103,"Hi friends. I'm sharing a personal experience that happened to me last night, Dec. 15. I'm sharing this because I know there are women and men who feel as though they have to keep quiet about their experience and they feel as though they can't tell anyone. I had a hard time admitting this to my closest friends, but I decided to post it on here for my own comfort.

 **I'm female.** I decided to go out to dinner with a friend of mine at a local pub. We ordered dinner and they ordered some alcoholic drinks for themselves. They asked me if I was ok with it and I told them, ""no, I don't mind."" Later that night, we went for a drive around town and they parked their car in a parking lot downtown. As per usual, we were talking about stuff. I had known this person for over five years, and have consistently talked to them. However, that night, things started to get fucked up...

I strongly believe this person took things too far. 

They started grabbing private areas of my body and I kept telling them, ""No, stop"" and they didn't. They kept saying, ""I know this is what you want.."" etc, and they were being very aggressive with me. They kept taking things further, and kept talking about how I wanted them and that I wanted to kiss them, but that wasn't my intention and I made it clear several times I didn't want too. There were moments they kept pinning me against the windows and I kept fighting it. They would forcefully make my hand touch their private areas to make up for them touching mine and each time I tried to pull away and they wouldn't let me. After a while, they stopped and drove me home. I'm a person who struggles with generalized anxiety disorder and this experience made me severely anxious and uncomfortable. I barely slept last night and I haven't been able to eat because they saw me as being vulnerable and took advantage of that. The worst part is that I feel like it was my fault, and I know that it wasn't but I still feel guilty. I feel betrayed by the one person who I never thought would hurt me. I considered them my best friend. I don't know what to think or do. I just know I'm writing about it on Reddit in hopes someone will feel less alone.",17Dec2018,1
106,"Okay, I feel extremely bad about this situation. Please don't think I'm a scumbag, I would never cheat and haven't but I feel like if I keep talking with my friend and stay with my girlfriend I could do something bad and hurt her.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 8-9 months and I love her. But lately things have been dying down and I don't feel the same as my girlfriend as I use to... This has occured ever since I started talking to my my friend. Myself and my girlfriend have only ever had one major fight and it was over me talking to my friend (I might add that we have dated before for a couple of months, we were young) and my girlfriend told me to never talk to my friend again, which I couldn't do so I talk to my friend behind my girlfriend's back.

Me and my friend have know each other for about 12 years and have been talking everyday for about two years as best friends. There's history there. Recently she has seduced me to send a explicit photo, which I know was my fault. The other night she said she found me attractive and she would like to ""have fun"" but didn't want to date me and to my disgust I actually wanted this. I've always had a crush on her and we constantly talk about sexual things. 

So I'm very confused, whether to breakup with my girlfriend and explore other alternatives with my friend or stay with my girlfriend and stop talking to my friend as she will most definitely be the end of my relationship.",17Dec2018,1

For example, I had been talking to this guy daily for a month and a half, and went on 4 dates. There were mutual feelings, mutual attraction, and mutual chemistry (as expressed by him as well). Today he ended it due to unrelated reasons making him unable to sustain a serious relationship at this current time. Now I’m devastated as I really liked him and saw a lot of potential.

So, in August I developed a weird illness where I would throw up very frequently after eating. Over the course of a few months, I could no longer keep down any real food. I lost 15% of my body weight (and I was already pretty thin), I had to stop my internship, I was miserable, suicidal, and in pain all the time. I felt incredibly isolated, I slept 18+ hours a day, etc etc etc. I truly thought I would die or have to drop out of college. 

I saw a new doctor and he figured out it was this incredibly rare stomach disorder. I had surgery that completely fixed the problem about a week and a half ago. Since I was able to eat my first full meal 2 days post-op, I have not been able to control my emotions. I am so happy, I have so much energy, and I can EAT!!!!

113,"It happened to me with a guy I met online, he messaged me through Reddit after reading one of my posts and randomly offered to help me with my depression issues (talk, give me advice etc).

When I told him I was worried about my physical appearance he said 'what's wrong with your physical appearance? You seem like an attractive girl, you just need to smile more ;)' then complimented the few pics I posted etc

I talked with this guy a lot but he claimed to not be interested in dating at all. He gave me a lot of attention, advice and we talked a lot in general. Later on he rejected me because he said dating was a waste of time, he was too busy to bother etc

I confessed I liked him after he asked me randomly if I received attention from guys 'at school or in the street' and I was like confused because I am clearly not that attractive...he said he was just curious etc and he realized I was into him because 'people are predictable and they follow a pattern'. He clearly said 'I knew about this already' and I was like wtf, am I this obvious?

I mentioned my feelings other times and he Always said it didn't bother him, he didn't mind, he just wanted to help etc

Do you think he said that just to cheer me up? Because later on other weird stuff popped up into our convos like he wasn't interested in dating but he had  'very high standards' for a potential partner and no one has reached them' (both looks and personality). He considered celebrities (which are generally the most physical attractive people, like Actors/actresses, models etc) plastic and fake and not even them reach these 'standards'.

Considering all of these things it felt like being called 'attractive' felt like some kind of joke, I know I am barely average looking...I posted twice on here and I got many mixed opinion but the majority was 'cute/average' while other said I was above average and found me attractive others thought I was masculine and unattractive/below average.

I know it is subjective and all but do you think it wasn't fully honest? This guy complimented me about other traits as well, like my intelligence, personality etc

He ended up cutting me off because we had anything in common according to him and he literally said he talked to me a lot just to 'help me out' and at some point he said that the fact that I mentioned my feelings (because I was feeling pretty bad due to depression, loneliness etc) bothered him even if before he said dozens of times 'don't think this is bothering me at all because it is not the point' and 'don't worry you are not making me unconfortable/it is almost impossible to make me uncomfortable.' 

He seemed to be flattered and even if he knew my attention fueled it so he constantly messaged me, started convos and showed a lot of interest in my life and mental state. At some point he just cut me off and blocked me, then got all pissy when I confronted him on Reddit (I admit the message was a bit straghtforward but I told him the Whole thing was weird because he showered me with unasked attention even when he knew I liked him a lot, acted strange sometimes etc)

I used to have depression, and I was real high stress all the time, last year I resigned myself to try to make a change. I changed my philosophy, mindset, and general outlook on life and became a lot happier. 

I was doing a lot better for probably almost a whole year, haven’t relapsed into depression/bad mindset in over 6 months. Then a couple things converged at a bad time. 

Finals are happening right now at my school, I realized I was crushing on this girl, and my friends started hitting me up more often to hang. 

Because I was busy with school I had to turn them down which is not something I like doing.

*My problem is* that I can’t concentrate on anything, can’t get excited about anything, and I don’t want to do anything. 

If I take a study break I have nothing to fill it with. 

If a friend wants to hang I wouldn’t want to go.

If I’m trying to write a paper it’s hard to focus.

Meanwhile I can’t sleep so between work and school I’m real busy, then I’m up all night even on my nights where I don’t have to stay up, and I have NOTHING to fill that time with. 

It’s really driving me crazy.

I can feel depression creeping around the corner, I’m getting stressed cause of the deadlines coupled with the no sleep, and I have to force my self to go anywhere and do anything. (“Fun” or not.)

I just keep thinking all the things I don’t want to do.

And the worst part is, no matter where I am, including my bedroom, I have this unshakeable feeling that I want to go home. 

Like if someone asked “do you want to go to the (sports) game?” I’ll immediately  think “I just want to go home.” 

My appetite is shit right now too, haven’t been hungry all week.

I want to get past this. I don’t want medication but I want to avoid some sort of mental break down here. I am open to all advice.

We got to know each other more because bigs and littles are expected to hang out, so that's really how we started dating. 

He just texted me and told me that something exciting happened, and when I asked him what, he told me he adopted someone. The girl he adopted is also in our student org, and they both currently serve on the executive board together. 

When I read his text, I felt my heart fall and I got upset. 

My relationship with my boyfriend is secure - I'm not worried about this girl in that way. But the fact that he adopted someone is making me upset for some reason. I know that it's kind of dumb to feel hurt by this because we're both part of the org and adopting is tradition for the org, but I just never expected him to do it. He always said that he didn't think he would ever adopt someone, and now he has.

I need a sanity check/advice...

I'm female and my female friend gets very sexually aggressive when she drinks. I've only known her since February of this year and even when she's sober she touches my boobs and butt constantly. It makes me uncomfortable and I've asked her to stop; it's even worse when she drinks.

We had a Christmas party this weekend and she told my husband that he needs to make me drink more so we can make out. All night she was trying to feed me shots, shoving her boobs in my face, grabbing my crotch, my boobs, my butt. My husband and all our (male) friends were laughing, but I refuse to find it funny.

I'm unsure how to proceed. If she were male, this wouldn't be an issue. Everyone would have seen her actions for what they are; completely inappropriate. Feeling a little lost and alone with how I'm processing this.

About two hours after picking up the phones from my wife, he sends me a message saying he wants his money back, he says the camera is blurry in one and the other shows battery degradation when running the self check. I offered to call the shop that did the replacements for me to see if he could bring them in and have them double check everything/make repairs under warranty but the guy just wants his money back.

I don’t normally sell stuff online and this is why. Part of me wants to not worry about it and just take the phones back and give him his money. The other part of me wonders if he dropped the phone or something on his way home. They were both working perfectly when I sold them.

126,"**This is long, TLDR is at bottom.**

I've never lived on my own and I've been depressed for months just living with my parents and barely working. Finally got my shit together, started working, and saved up money to move out. 

I found a little studio apartment in a seemingly nice apartment building.

My upstairs neighbors are so loud every evening. From around 9pm to 11 or 12 at night (sometimes later). Really loud stomping around, yelling, banging on stuff, dropping things?, Ect. 

One evening people on my same floor were having a loud get together and running up and down the stairs and I realized they are friends with the people above me. Lots of slamming doors, yelling, and running past midnight. 

I don't want to be a fucking buzzkill or debbie downer but oh my god. I am seriously getting really depressed about this.

I signed a 12 month lease. I saw the apartment 3 times and heard zero noise. I could not see the apartment at night before I moved in. 

Everyone in my life is telling me not to write an anonymous note, and not to complain to management. My mom's response was ""that's apartment living"" (which I do understand I really do!) 

Buuut I am paying for this place and there are quiet times and they made it really clear when I signed my lease that the rules were to be followed. 

I just can't sleep through screaming and stomping and slamming doors every night..

I actually got a letter from the realty office saying that I had a stain on my apartment door and it violated my lease and I needed to clean it up (this is my fault I know). So someone complained about my door and it was taken seriously by management. 

What do I do? I just moved in a couple weeks ago and I don't want to immediately go to management and complain. I also don't want to leave a note and run the risk of making things worse. 

I am seriously miserable thinking I will have to live with this ever night for the next year. 

**TL;DR** Upstairs neighbors very loud every night past 9pm. People telling me not to write a note and not to bother management with this since I just moved in. I am feeling depressed and hopeless about this situation

Literally the only person that exists in his world is him and his friends and colleagues, but his family is completely out of the picture. He's gone through his whole life without learning anything about his family history, bonding with his family or doing anything that involves them. He doesn't talk to them, just walks by them in the house and goes about his business. It's a disgusting scenario, and he can't believe he had any worth in himself back then as he slowly begins to understand the importance of family and how none of the things he has done (or not done) to them can be taken back.

I was going to try making maybe some kind of a curry? Or stew perhaps? Or maybe a good, saucy pasta dish? 

I need some advice on what I could cook? 

I Cannot decide, can’t find any recipes I like the look of online (I did get frustrated quickly and gave up) and I have the below ‘criteria’. 

-Basic cooking skills
-Nothing spicy, my Grammy cannot handle any sort of spice - so looking for flavoursome not spicy/hot!
-Something hearty and comforting. 
-Chicken/fish or veg based (don’t eat red meat) 

Anyone got any foodie advice/recommendations?

134,"Run down, we have been together for 1.5 years. I am (21f) and him (21m). He has been feeling confused for about 2 years now roughly, and says he is 100% attracted to woman, but is curious about men.  Basically, upon knowing this information and being bisexual myself, I could never stand in the way of someone finding out their sexuality. I said yes. He can go and experiment as a one off thing to understand himself better and to grow as an individual. Now, we both love each other very much, and he is basically the love of my life. I trust him very much. This was all discussed briefly yesterday. Today, he sends me screenshots of him talking to another guy on Grindr, which he downloaded the night before while drunk and started talking to a guy. The guy is lovely, and knows about me/what the situation is. Since this, I have had a sick feeling to my stomach. I have never been in this situation, nor really prepared myself for it. In saying that, I will not go back on my word. I guess now that it’s initiated I’m feeling unsettled and very nervous, and I didn’t expect myself to be because it’s another man and not a woman.

I am worried about what happens next, the aftermath. What if I lose the love of my life to another man? What if he doesn’t like our love life anymore? Soooo many “what if’s” and possible outcomes. My question is, how can I deal with my own emotions without it effecting his decision?

Today she didn't text me all day and left a snap on open. I decided to text her in the evening and see how she did with some tests. She answered once then stopped. I texted her again just seeing if she wanted to hangout but she said she was studying for finals. She left another snap on open.

145,"Hey guys, hopefully someone reading this will know a thing or 2 about looking after air quality in an apartment, cos I'm lost. I moved this year from Canada to Australia. I was in the Prairies, where the air tends to be dry, and every place comes with pretty good quality heating and ventilation systems. Usually the biggest issues were dryness and stale air from having the windows closed all the time in winter...   


Now, I'm in Australia and am totally lost on how to manage indoor air quality, cos the situation is so different. We definitely have humidity &amp; ventilation issues in our new place. We live in an apartment with 4 windows, a big one each in the living room and bedroom, and a small one each in the kitchen and bathroom. All the windows are on the same side of the apartment, so there's no cross-ventilation. The bathroom has no fan, just the window for ventilation. The kitchen has a range hood over the stove so that helps a bit when we're cooking, but things like making tea or washing dishes generates a lot of humidity. So far we're keeping the widows open as wide as we can, basically all the time, but even on somewhat windy days the airflow into the apartment is minimial. It's also fairly humid outside just as it is inside (though I'm sure inside is worse due to cooking and stuff). Oh, and also there's no AC unit or any other mechanical ventilation system.  


So I'm looking around for solutions, and there are AC units, like 4 different kinds of fans with possible different configurations (eg. pedestal, tower, floor, ceiling, put in one or multiple windows, blowing air in or out..), dehumidifiers, air purifiers... I've been looking stuff up but really, I feel totally lost. I don't suppose there's anyone here who can give some insight? Also, I'm home most of the time (I have health issues) and so I need something that will work given that situation. ",17Dec2018,1

148,"Growing up I have always wanted to be something like a doctor or a lawyer. I am about to graduate college and have lost faith in my ability to achieve my dream job. I picked a major that I did not like and get Cs in those classes, but all of my other classes not related to my major I do well in. I am always accused of not giving it my all by my parents and they think I just do not try my best. They fail to realize how difficult these classes are for me and when I do try hard but still get a C in a class, it’s just them telling me I’m not trying hard because I don’t lock myself out from everything but them and school. I have a SO that I talk to, he keeps me sane and pushes me to do my best. They fail to see this and think he is a distraction. So it results in the repeatedly telling me I’m not trying hard enough. This makes me feel horrible and not want to even try if they do not believe me. Once I graduate I could pick a different path that I feel more confident in, but have to deal with the disappointment of my parents and constant claims of me just giving up and then pushing me away. 

It has come to the point where I would rather settle for less and not have to live with them because of all of the stress and anxiety they cause me. I could see my self really trying towards my goal of a doctor but not while living with them. They take it the wrong way and have for the past 7 months have been telling me to go live with my real mother (my parents are my dad and step mom). I have spent nights away from home at her place because they tell me not to come back home any time some little argument or disagreement happens. I fear that this continue to happen and I can not work towards my dream job. Yet they believe me living with my SO once I graduate will deter me from becoming a doctor. 

I guess I have a lot of questions: 
How do I get it through to them that living at home is not the best for me and they are really just holding me back? Am I in the wrong and am dumb for thinking I can be in a relationship while trying to become a doctor? Should I settle for a job that isn’t my dream job to get away from the anxiety and stress they put me under? 

TL;DR: I have extremely controlling parents that believe the only way to be successful is to isolate yourself and do school. Yet I believe that they are the ones holding me back and not my SO. Do I settle for a job that isn’t my dream just to get away from them?

149,"So I'm an 18 year old male, I have a little sister who is 11. I'm 5'8 and 105 lb, I'm not anorexic but I am seeing a doctor about trying to put on more weight and strength. My sister is 5'0 and about 90 lb. She does dancing pretty seriously, sometimes goes to the gym with our dad as well so she's strong for her age.

We were in the garden playing football (soccer). She had an open goal so I jokingly tackled her to the ground to stop her from scoring. She dragged me down with her and was sitting on my chest and pinning my arms to the ground. We're not really a play fighting kind of family, so I was surprised she had the strength to pin me given the age difference. I was more surprised when I attempted to lift my arms off the ground but they weren't even budging and it became clear that she was stronger than me. So it was kinda funny at first, but then she started taking grass/dirt from the ground and kept trying to put it into my mouth. I had told her to stop but she wouldn't and she was doing this for about 10 minutes before she got bored and let go.

I was really angry and embarrassed, it's immature but I wanted to get back at her. She has this stuffed animal that she's slept with since a baby and I cut its head off with scissors (our dad sewed it back on so it's fine now). When she found out, she was crying, screaming, hitting me etc. She had managed to drag me to the ground and she wrapped her thighs around my waist and squeezed. And immediately, I could feel my ribs getting crushed and I was in a lot of pain so I tried punching her leg in an attempt to give her a dead leg but she just restrained my arms and kept squeezing.

I apologised and even said ""please let go"" but she wouldn't listen and my ribs started to make popping sounds. After awhile I realised the ground was getting damp. I didn't know what it was at first, but then realised I was urinating without realising. I told her and she let go.

Then later on our parents had finished dinner early and had went to the shop. My sister finished her food and then told me to clean her plate. I obviously said no and she threatened to beat me up if I didn't do it. I was like ""since when did you become such a b!tch?"" and she dragged me to the ground, wrapped her thighs around my waist again and squeezed until I said I'd clean her plate. I really regret doing it now though because she keeps telling me to do stuff like that and it feels a lot like bullying now. I even did her Christmas homework earlier.

I don't really know what to do about the whole situation, like what to do when she tries to boss me around? I can't fight her and I obviously don't want to tell my parents that I'm getting ""bullied"" by a child. It took a lot just to make this thread on a throwaway account, I wouldn't be able to tell them. Especially my dad who is a fitness buff and already seems to be kind of disappointed in my skinniness and favours my sister. My dad would probably congratulate her lmao.

So this is a muscle comparison: This is a [pic of her](https://snag.gy/UNRkAC.jpg) and this is a [pic of me](https://snag.gy/4dAxW5.jpg). I don't understand why wrapping her thighs around my waist and squeezing hurts so much in the first place? If you look at the pictures, her legs look kind of fat and my core looks decently muscular (not that I'm muscular) so it should be able to withstand the pressure from her legs, no? But instead, the pain is so bad that I even wet myself at one point. I don't understand why it hurts so much when she's just a kid? I know she's strong for her age, but that's not saying much when she's only 11 years old and a girl on top of that and I look stronger than her?

Kinda pissed about the whole situation, so this is a bit of a rant as well as asking for advice. Sorry for making you read all this garbage lol. There's no-one I can really talk to irl about this.",17Dec2018,1
150,"One is a Subaru Legacy GT limited, the other is a Volvo 240. My dad bought me the Subaru as a first car but due to financial issues from a few months ago he ended up driving the car for a while. (Few months) 

After high school graduation I got some money from the party we had, so I ended up buying a car with that money as my dad was driving the car he got that was intended for me. That car I got is a Volvo 240... 

I can't drive yet, and now have two cars that need a lot of money in repairs but both run and drive without major issue. I can't afford these repairs due to no job. Here comes another issue when it comes to learning the drive the 240, it's a manual. No one is willing to teach me to drive a manual. Also I realized once the hot Michigan summers come around having no AC is gonna make the car borderline impossible to drive some days.

The Subaru concerns me for the fact is it almost chugs as much gas as a truck. That is gonna be horrible for me to keep up with due to having little income. Also it needs a few hundred in repairs...

Now, I'm considering just to sell both of them and get something nicer that is good to go and would be more viable for me as a first driver. Namely a Scion XB first gen. That way I would get something that is better on gas, and has AC for the horrible summer days.

I'm kinda stuck at my decision, sell the Volvo which I haven't even gotten to enjoy yet and the Subaru which is just gonna be horrible on the wallet. Or keep the two as I already have them and can't be sure of the fact I could get enough from both to get a better car.

157,"Using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my usual.

TL;DR: Made a deep emotional connection with a guy over a road trip, broke it off, moved on mostly. Need help on making it hurt less.

I was on a working holiday last year, became great friends with a guy, and we ended up going on a three week long road trip in a van around the country together. Of course feelings developed, we thought about our future together, made plans etc etc. I’ve never been with just one person for such a long period of time before, so I was super nervous. Of course it turns out to be the time of my life. This was over Christmas time last year, so now feelings are boiling over.

Both the guy and I were not from that country. I knew I was going back, he still had time on his visa. We thought we could make it because he could come work in my country or we could get work in another country and meet up there. I mean, clearly we were so infatuated with each other that we were strategizing a substantial next move.

Long distance was NOT easy with this guy. He is needy and was literally on the other side of the planet. He wanted to talk all the time, but I was trying to find work and was stressed. He and I were dysfunctional before, but him not understanding that I needed some leniency and I couldn’t give him attention every second really made me frustrated. I told him this, he’d apologize, but he wouldn’t change. I broke it off with him.

VERY shortly after breaking it off with him, I started going out with my current boyfriend who is just absolutely everything. This was not in my character (I like processing time, I don’t want anyone to feel like a rebound, etc), but I didn’t want to pass on the chance on getting with current BF.

Now the dilemma: it’s been nearly a year since I broke things off with Road Trip Guy and started dating my current guy. I’m glad I “moved on” quickly because my boyfriend is just my absolute everything. I just feel so sad and overall guilty that when I’m alone with my thoughts that I just miss my Road Trip Guy. Against my better judgement, I’ve sent him a couple emails over these months that he hasn’t responded to. 

I just need advice that is not just “give it time.” I mean, if it exists. If time is what’s needed, how do I make it hurt less while going through the process.

Reddit,
I found this platform in 2010, when I was 11 years old- I’ve been hooked ever since.  with varying degrees of involvement over the last 8 years (mostly, lurking), I’ve always been moved by the immense kindness of users in these communities. even moreso, overall astounded by the way this website has grown and flourished. 

Instead of lurking, though, i made this throwaway to post my story. I want to open the doors for any and all commentary, love, support, and advice to be offered. (I have pretty thick skin, so I’m less than worried about comments that’ll get downvoted appropriately lol). 

but let’s get down to it. 


I’ve always known that i come from a broken home, and tried to remedy the effects it had on me to the best of my ability. Growing up in an affluent suburb, everyone has secrets behind closed doors. 
Despite this being true, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more sinister. 

i was right. 

despite not participating in intercourse, or being  raped penetratively by my father- I am the victim of incest. careful with the associations, though-i by no means was a voluntary participant. 
I was certainly molested, possibly by extended family, also, not just my father. 

as a child, I was always incredibly precocious. on top of that, i was also a “daddy’s girl”.  I was showered me with love, gifts, and affection throughout my childhood. Since he worked long hours, i was always thrilled to be able to spend time with him. 

As my parents marriage started to fail, they grew apart in all regards. My dad, frustrated with his sexless and loveless marriage used me as a surrogate wife. He has chronic pain due to back injuries, and once he fell ill it only got worse. and he also had undiagnosed mental illnesses that wreaked havoc on the house as a whole. As for my mom, she struggled with alcoholism, was incredibly controlling in general, and began to habitually cheat (there were no secrets. we heard EVERYTHING). In short, it was a clusterfuck. 
I became responsible for his needs for physical closeness, carried the burden of his emotional turmoil, and subsequently triangulated into this failing relationship. 
on top of that, he exploited his occupation as a doctor throughout my childhood and into my teenage years to continue this sort of abuse (my dad/mom were my primary caregivers, they “knew best” and didn’t trust anybody to misdiagnose or mistreat their precious little girl). it was not unusual when I had a medical concern, to have to bring it to my father. on many occasions, I had to strip down to be semi, or completely naked so he could “examine” me fully. because him, my mom, and few trusted coworkers were the only people I was allowed to talk with. I was trapped. 

my brothers were always taught to objectify me the same way my father did, from an insanely young age. my older brother would often participate in making lewd jokes about me alongside him. he abhorred me for the attention and privileges I was given, but when we were young we had to team up to care for my little brother and ourselves. The three of us needed each other. we had no other option but to stick together through, to de-escalate the screaming, physical fighting, threats, and more despite not being able to fully understand it. 
we were rightfully fearful that if we didn’t step in, one of our parents would either kill the other. or after the fact, would kill themselves. the domestic abuse began fairly early in our childhoods.

despite being a bright kid, relatively accomplished, and always socially active I felt radically different from my peers. I was terrified of my body, and myself. I couldn’t ever carry myself with pride, and never even stood up straight because I was undeserving of it.

I became increasingly defiant to authority figures across the board. teachers, my parents, athletic coaches, you name it. I’ve always been bit of a little shit, and that’s what everyone chalked it up to. honestly, so did I. 

I could never sleep, developed a slew of somatic symptoms, body dysmorphia, depression, etc. I began to self harm, saved up my funds and had a plan to become a runaway, suicidal thoughts and ideation, and more all by my 11th birthday. 

In my teenage years, I danced with danger in any way I could to try to feel alive. I drowned myself in alcohol, illicit drugs, cut class, and became the best nomad I could while still being under my parents control. 

I’m currently a sophomore at one of the top universities in the country. I don’t know how I got to this point. I don’t feel like I deserve it. I should’ve died, or ended up in jail. I came close too many times to count. 

It wasn’t until just two days ago that I concretely came to these conclusions. Memories have been flooding back into my consciousness, and I wanted so badly to make sense of anything I could. two days ago I found excepts of “the cult survivors handbook” online. I fucking lost it. (http://www.survivorshandbook.com/the-incestuous-family/) 
 I was reading the story of my life. 
A concoction of emotions surged over me and I couldn’t even make it halfway through the page before completely breaking down. at the end, I looked into the mirror and saw the terrified, hurt, little girl I once was staring back at me. 

this resolution has left me raw with rage and sorrow that I can’t even attempt to put into words. 

I don’t know how to process any of this, still, nor do I know what to do next. 

For the moment, my mother is in control of all the finances, and my tuition is being covered by my parents. they’re still divorcing, and my little brother is in shared custody of them. i don’t want to leave, but I can’t stay. 
If I leave, I’m most likely going to lose my entire family. if I stay, this is never going to end.  

my entire world has completely shifted under my feet, and i think I know what I need to do, but I’m scared beyond belief. 

thank you to anyone who reads. truly. ",17Dec2018,1
159,"An old friend and I rekindled our friendship a few months ago. In past years, we’ve gone back and forth between liking each other and nothing came of it. The timing was always off and we tended to clash personality-wise. For the past few months, we’ve been hanging out a lot and things have progressed, but from the jump I made it clear that I did not want to be in a relationship with her. Recently, she’s been asking the “what are we?” question and saying that we’re in a weird spot and that it’s hurting her. I told her that we should take some space because it was never my intention to hurt her and I don’t want to be in a relationship at the moment. I told her that I’m struggling a lot right now mentally and I need to work on loving myself so I can properly love someone else. A few days ago she told me she loves me and I was in shock. I didn’t say it back because I don’t feel that way, but I said that I appreciated it and that I cared for her deeply. This grew into an argument and she completely blew up, asking why I don’t love her back, what’s wrong with her, etc. She said that I need to figure out what I want and I told her that I want to get some space so I can stop hurting her and that I’m not looking to be in a relationship. She got even madder and said that she doesn’t want space from me and that she was pissed because now all of her family members and friends ask about me. I apologized and eventually the argument ended, but she continues to tell me that she loves and misses me. 
This constant “I love you, I miss you” is driving me mad and I can’t say these things back because I don’t want to lead her on. Honestly, I just want to be friends, but I feel like it’s not possible at this point and sadly, I’m prepared to end the friendship. What can I say to tell her that I do not feel the same way and that I would be happy to be friends, but I don’t see potential for anything more?

TL;DR - My friend is in love with me and she keeps telling me that. I don’t feel the same way and I just want to be friends. I told her that...and she wasn’t having it. She continues to tell me she loves me. It’s overwhelming and I need a resolution to this. ",17Dec2018,1

161,"Just to add a little background:

\- He is what most would consider ""alcoholic"", and even though the doctors strongly advised him not to, he drinks alot.

\- He has severe trouble sleeping at night, and will usually fall asleep at around 5am

\- He hasn't gone outside in a long time. He is ADAMANT that he will NOT go see a doctor, or even go for a drive outside

\- His body is very weak and fragile, most likely from the sleep deprivation / alcohol and maybe anxiety/depression. He will not eat more than a single boiled egg plus a little bit of soup, usually two times per 3 days.

\- The whole family has pleaded with him to go visit the doctors, maybe get some kind of anti depressant medication prescribed, or even so much as go outside for some fresh air and sunshine, but he will not listen to us. Being old school traditional Korean alpha male type, he will never listen to me (his son) or his second wife.

164,"I'm 16, almost 17. My parents and I have a pretty bad relationship, as I get in trouble a lot at school, they know I smoke weed, and I'm a mostly B student. I have ADHD, i'm on antidepressants, and I got anxiety.

My sister, who's 19 now, goes to UCSC. She was a straight A student and got a pretty good SAT score- around 1200. My parents would always compare me to her. 

My parents always ask my why am I not like her and how I'm throwing my life away. I work at Taco Bell (a dead end job) but I'm only in High School. My parents are saying that if I keep doing what I'm doing I'm gonna work there my whole life and I keep saying that I'm only in High school like it's a job for now. 

Not to mention I have 3 other brothers who are all younger than me. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to be the loser in the family, like the one who lives in a sh\*tty house with a crap car and stuff like that. My parents act like it's either be a doctor or engineer, or be a garbageman or fast food worker. I always try to get out of the house and stuff but it's too much. I don't really know what to do for the rest of my life. what career should i have? I dont really have any interests. What college can i get into with 3.2 GPA and a 1160 GPA? SF State is the one I'm looking into but my parents think UC's are the greatest. Are they really that great or are they overrated? Like to be completely honest I have no idea what to do with my life. Does anyone have any advice on what to do?

165,"Well, we're already legally married, but haven't had a wedding. She's a busy doctor, so we admittedly haven't had a lot of time to plan anything. She's pretty laid back about the whole thing, too.

My daughter had a great idea to sort of ""surprise"" my wife with a wedding. Sort of like a proposal, but since my original proposal was lackluster, it'd be like doing the whole thing in one go.

I actually think it's not a bad idea. My wife really likes surprises. More than she lets on. But I'm not exactly the most romantic guy on the planet.

I have an address book with her extended family, so I can invite them all on the D-L, but most of them are kind of ambivalent toward me (they say I'm the opposite of what they expected her to marry, so they don't think it'll last), so I'm not sure how to get them all out here or even if I should.

I was thinking Lake Tahoe with just the two of us, our two kids, my sister and her husband and my buddy (her co-worker). Snow would be beautiful I think. And I'm sure she'd love me in a suit (hate them, but I'd do anything for her). But that's where my expertise ends.

168,"I am a 24F who has been married for two years. My husband and I are just enjoying each other right now and do not want kids until we are 28-30ish years old. Most of *our* (husbands) friends are older by a few years and they all have at least 1 child. 

My husband gets frustrated sometimes because I’m not better friends with some of the wives but they never contact me and we don’t really connect. When some of them ask me why we don’t have kids yet I just say I’m not emotionally mature enough/we have things we want to do first/we aren’t ready yet and I always feel like they are offended when I say that. It’s the truth and I don’t have a nicer way to put it? 

I do have one or two friends my own age. One lives in another state (has a baby) we talk weekly, but it’s usually short.

One is my cousin who doesn’t have a baby, isn’t married yet, but is living with her boyfriend. She lives an hour away from me, has work friends of her own, and it’s kind of hard to see her because our SO’s don’t really vibe well together. My husband is a good ol country boy and her boyfriend is extremely quiet, sort of just the opposite of my husband. They just don’t click.

Another friend I have is a work friend and she is my age but she has a baby and all her friends have babies. 

It’s like there is no one around me who doesn’t have a baby!!! Or is just married with no kids. 

I’m struggling to connect with these people and I’m sorry I just don’t want a baby right now I don’t know how I’m offending them by saying I don’t want a baby. 

Should I just try to find other friends? How can I connect with these people? It’s hard to find friends when you just work with the same people and then go home to your SO :/ ",17Dec2018,1
169,"So heres some subtext. I have worked at my job for perhaps 2 years now. It is a part time job, but I always work more than 30 hours, but the pay is shit. After taxes, my pay cheque is minimal. I have a second job as well, but it is important for me to have that job as it is a stepping stone for what I would like to do next.

I've also been partaking in pursuing some higher education around a year now. The first year, I was surprised the work load wasn't super crazy so I took on more shifts. But now, I know the work load is going to get crazy busy and it is going to move really fast. There is no way I am going to be able to do 2 part time jobs, and study full time at the same time. 

I want to ask my manager about working the minimum part time hours. But, I've also been away from work for some time due to some health issues, and I feel guilty about requesting that my hours decrease,even though I know I have to. My job is a retail store, so it's also open weekends. I don't want to be working weekends either because the weekends will be my time to be writing everything for my higher education. I feel conflicted because I like my job, but I also really need my hours to be decreased.

170,"1 1/2 years now i met this guy on IG we talked for a two month or less. i'm a girl with dignity so before i can actually get to know alot of things about this guy he wanted to start sexting like our 2nd week of talking and remind u we only talked 3days out of the week and instantly get into sexual things (i found him very attractive too of courseee)

i told him i respected myself and can we take it slow until i get to know him, he did respected it but stop talking to me altogether, until he made a direct post about me after i respond to it and things went left with us. we stop speaking but we watched each other off our pages on social media on a daily. 

but b4 we stopped talking i asked him a question on ""why he's single?"" he leaves me on read and never responded (so that grew my suspicious with him) so i felt a type of way about it and didn't press the issue anymore to him about it because silence is the best answer on that.

Months and months passing us by and he doesn't say a word to me, i don't say a word to him he stop interacting with me, i hit him up because i felt maybe i should say hi to him i responded to some of his social media stories and his texting to me was dry as if he really didn't want to talk to me so i said my words told him happy bday on his bday and left it alone with us. he stopped liking my pics, never told me happy bday, didn't have a heart to tell me sorry for my lost or anything but even though we weren't together just the point of me meeting him i would have showed him kindness. but he always liking other girls pics and everything and stopped liking mine but i liked his pics no matter what until i seen he was ignoring me but keep watching me, so i stopped liking his pics but i have a good heart and didn't want to feed into the immature behavior

 i decided i didnt want to keep this slient immature game of us watching each other social media and not talking i haddd a big crush on him and theirs many guys after me, but i always felt like he's the one for me but i can see he likes lots of attention from women &amp; he loves to flirt wirh women he like which i was one of them but not the only one, but he had a very funny way of showing me he still likes me after i told him i respected myself.

Anyways again i got fed up with him not speaking to me or even ackknowledging me so i kinda stop watching him and everything he does. So i guess NOW he decided to completely cut me off since i stop watching him he stopped watching me and even blocked me from seeing his post. its ok. ig, i kinda wanted it to happen because, if he really still liked me after i told him we should take it slow he would still try to make an effort to talk with me.. but i have a guy who wants me but his behavior is kinda why immature then the first guy. i want to be in a relationship but its hard finding a guy too want me for who i am.

my question is Why do we chase after those who practically ignore us but ignore those who want us ? ",17Dec2018,1
171,"So I got into an argument with my mom about her constant talking about my nephews mother.
My nephews mother is a young mom. She’s not the best mom at all &amp; from the beginning my nephew has basically lived with my mom. My brother is an absent father, but that’s a story for another day. Anyways my nephews mom moved to another city &amp; allowed my mom to keep him for a year. She’s now back &amp; my nephew still spends the majority of the time with my mom- but he spends a lot more time with his mom.

My mom is a great person &amp; genuinely cares about my nephews well being. She wants custody, but his mom would never allow it. She resents his mom which is understandable but the last 6 months since she’s been back she has allowed this girl to consume her IMO. 95% of our conversation is about her. It is never anything positive. She analyzes everything she does. If she posts something on FB like a pic of her and my nephew my mom will complain about how she’s a fake social media mom. When she comes over my mom complains how much she was texting on her phone the second she leaves. If they go to church the second my mom leaves she calls to tell me how she dressed or what she said. If she decides she wants her son for the weekend or the day it makes my mom’s blood boil &amp; she goes on a rant about that. My mom talks about her so much that at least once a day she goes on a rant about the same story verbatim &amp; she doesn’t realize she’s told me the same exact story 4000x before. If she could talk about her all day she would. Even when I try to change the subject she brings it back up or says wait 1 more thing and will continue for another half hour. This is every single day. 

To her face my mom is nice. The girl is not very nice to my mom &amp; uses the fact my mom loves her grandson so much to her advantage to walk all over her. My mom is always in fear she won’t let her see him. My mom kind of treats me like shit when she’s around. If I call her she’ll rush me off the phone &amp; say it’s because his mom finds it weird we talk so much or that she’s nosey and listens to our conversation. 

All of this has made me dislike my nephews mother 1. Bc she sucks as a mom 2. Bc she’s rude to my mom 3. Bc she’s changed my mom’s entire personality- she’s always stressed or upset about something due to her or if she made my mom mad, my mom takes it out on me &amp; is snippy towards me.
She’s also made my mom act crazy towards me. Once my mom’s phone was broken so his mom couldn’t text her back. My mom then accused me of telling her everything she’s said about her &amp; that’s why she wasn’t texting back. When she found out her phone was just broken she never apologized - but just stated how stressful it is dealing with her. 

I told my mom today that I miss talking to her about other things &amp; I feel the amount she talks about this girl &amp; analyzes her is unhealthy. My mom has never taken “criticism” well &amp; just dismissed it &amp; laughed at me that she’s not consumed by it at all. Which blows my mind Bc she talks about it every single day. She also claims she only talks about her to me. She then claimed that I’m the only person she can vent to about it. Which isn’t true. She talks about it to all of her friends as well. Her best friend is a therapist and they talk about it all of the time &amp; diagnose her behind her back.

I feel like a bad daughter bc I want my mom to be able to talk to me about anything. However I’m just tired. I miss hearing how her day was. Anything other than my nephews mom. I feel like if I don’t want to talk about her my mom doesn’t really want to talk to me. Or she’ll listen to another topic &amp; wait for me to finish my sentence so she can bring it up again. Or eventually says well I’ll call you back if she sees I won’t engage in the bash session.

Am I wrong? Would it be cold/evil to refuse to allow my mom to discuss it with me anymore? I feel like I am enabling her to allow this person to consume her...

Summary: my mom talks about my nephews mom every single day. I’m sick of talking about. It’s not healthy for me or my mom. Does this make me a selfish daughter? ",17Dec2018,1
172,"I'm not sure how to start this or if this is the appropriate sub, but this started 1 year ago. I met this girl online from Europe on a chatting app. She only had one picture and she seemed shy but sweet so I decided to message her. She was difficult to read as she was shy (as am I, but less so online) but we started talking and seemed to sort of hit it off. After a week or so of talking back and forth on the app everyday we exchanged numbers. She was less interested in random chats and deleted the app soon after. We kept talking everyday and although she was a quite possessive with me (wanting quick replies even though I'm in medical school and really busy and we have a 7 hour difference between us), and she would randomly act out and even be mean (I started to think she had Borderline Personality Disorder possibly), I really liked her and enjoyed getting to know her, despite how closed off she could be. We'd talk and send each other videos and memes and whatnot, she'd send me snapchats and add me on instagram. I started to get pretty close with her although she still seem to get upset over little things and be moody for a day or two. We talked on the phone a couple times even though it seemed to scare her to. She shared personal things with me that she had never shared with anyone before and I was an open book with her.

I would say that we talked as more than friends. We had pet names for each other, would say good morning, good night, sweet dreams, and on occasion say things like we'd want to snuggle and watch a movie or even flirt a little (she comes from a pretty conservative background so she's not a huge flirter, but liked me flirting with her). Eventually, almost \~9 months of talking everyday passed and I mentioned that I brought up the possibility of going to Europe. She suggested to visit her and I agreed, but soon she said she wasn't sure if she was going somewhere with family and she'd get back to me. She's pretty closed off and hard to understand what she's thinking or feeling at times.

Eventually it was summer and I was studying for a major exam so we talked a little less and then I started rotations where I was really busy. She'd get upset I had less time for her. We missed each other and we'd fight a bit at times over the lag time in replying given my schedule and time zone. We started to talk a bit less and she seemed less interested in keeping a conversation going or just replying a bit less. Again, hard to read given how she doesn't like to say what she's thinking. Still, I tried to be positive and we kept talking but I asked if she had met someone romantically and she replied with a question I asked, but ended up saying no she hadn't. Some time passed and I made a joke about her meeting someone since I felt we had started talking less and she said she hadn't.

More time passed and she said she couldn't have me visit her since she was stuck on a family trip. We had talked less given my schedule but I tried working with her by compensating with phone calls. Since she gets nervous with them, she kept saying no but then saying that I stopped caring or trying. Things got to the point where I again asked if she had met someone and she casually said yes (in person). I pried and asked how long and she said a couple months. My heart dropped because we used to talk so sweetly with one another as if we were more than friends and then with my rotations and her being too nervous to talk on the phone, I figured that's why things had changed...I reacted badly to it given how non-chalant she was about it and how she even a bit callous about it. She had previously said that she wanted us to have a relationship where we could be open and honest with each other. It really hurt that she had lied about being in a relationship for months apparently and I felt hurt because I felt like I was a convenience to her or almost like a placeholder. She said there are things about her that only I know though that she hasn't even talked about with her boyfriend.

Why didn't I say how I felt? Well, when we talked earlier on she said online relationships were stupid and people who fall in love with each other were stupid. She didn't mind friends but she seemed to imply that relationships that started online were ridiculous. I don't want an online relationship either, but I like to consider myself open-minded and I wouldn't write it off. Life to me isn't so black and white, and you never know what will happen in the future.

I said some pretty hurtful things to her based on how I felt, which was immature and awful of me. I felt badly and I apologized and explained I had feelings for her. She seemed surprised, but she said why didn't I say anything? **She said if I had, things could have been different**...I asked how and **she said we could have been together**. This was about a month ago. I felt stupid. Stupid for having feelings for someone online that I had never met, stupid for wanting to buy a ticket and fly to visit her. Stupid for everything. I still felt resentful, but I obviously care about her so we could be friends, but it was hard for me to view her the same after the repeated lying about being in a relationship. I was obviously still hurt.

Things were weird after that and she still felt hurt by some of the things I had said before. We talked but not everyday, like once a week or so until she stopped replying. She had blocked me everywhere. I made a new snapchat and sent her a message because I didn't want things to end on a bad note and I wrote her a long message about how/why I reacted the way I did so she could better understand and an apology and she really appreciated it. She said she'd like to talk again and be friends, as did I, but her boyfriend hates me and says she can't talk to me. We talked for a bit and made up and she said she wish we could talk again and it makes her so sad that we can't and she doesn't know what to do. We both were crying.

I just want her to be happy so I said I'd respect that we can't talk anymore and sent her a letter via email sort of as a good-bye and telling her how much she meant to me and that I'd always be there for her.

That was 2 weeks ago and I tried to not message her, but a couple of days ago I did, but she responded and we joked a bit like before and she said she still doesn't get why she can't talk to me but that she'd try to convince her boyfriend. She said she can't talk to me, but she felt bad ignoring me because she doesn't want to hurt me.

I've decided to leave her alone, but I feel like there's something there and after almost a year of talking every day, it's hard to just shut your feelings off like that. I feel like a mess and I keep thinking about her and when I do, my heart just sinks and I start to feel sad. I don't want to destroy her relationship, but at the same time, **how can she honestly say she doesn't feel anything after a couple weeks ago she said things would have been different if I had said something?**

I realize that was a really long story, but I don't really know who else to talk about this with and I keep fighting myself not to message her again, but if I do, I'm just making it harder for her and causing her stress and I feel awful for that too.

**Any advice or thoughts? Should I just let things be? Obviously her boyfriend doesn't want her talking to me and she's doing her best to respect that...I still feel like a part of her has feelings for me, which has only made not talking to me make more sense. She's blocked me everywhere, but our last conversation was last week and she said it breaks her heart that she can't talk to me, but that she can't talk to me anymore. And that was that and then she blocked me.**

&amp;#x200B;

I am filled with regret for not doing anything about my feelings sooner. She's all I can really think about now and it's just eating me up. I just keep wanting to message her despite knowing it would probably just make things worse. Part of this post is venting, but another is asking for advice. It kills me that we don't talk anymore and it seems like it's hurting her too. She's such a complicated person, but I I really want her in my life even though she can drive me crazy. I've never felt this strongly about someone. I would buy a ticket and visit her with a drop of a hat during my vacation time if she'd ask me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Made an online friend on the other side of the pond, grew really close, flirted, talked sweetly to each other. Wanted to visit her, but her schedule was unclear. My schedule got busy with med school rotations and we started to talk less. She met someone and lied multiple times about being in a relationship. When she finally admitted, things sort of blew up. I became resentful. Things got weird. I found out she had had feelings for me after I told my feelings for her. She said if I had told her, things could have been different...her boyfriend asked her to stop talking to me so she did. I messaged her again and we made up after things sort of blew up and she said she wished we could talk and she didn't know what to do. I left it at that and said I'd leave her alone. I did but then 2 weeks later sent a message and we talked for a bit. She said she'd try and convince her boyfriend to let her talk to me, but now we've stopped talking. I think she's doing her best to respect what he wants and I have stopped because I don't want to cause her more stress.

I realize this whole thing was ridiculously long, but thanks to anyone that read it. Maybe it's a weird story, but it's my story and this girl means a lot to me. Thanks in advance for any input.",17Dec2018,1
173,"Before I get started - Throw away account because I don’t want to deal with the potential dms of doom. 

So me and my now wife have been together for almost 3 years now. When we met things immediately fell into place for us. I used to think that love at first sight was just a bunch of bullshit but from the moment I made eye contact with her I knew she was the one that I wanted to spend then rest of my life with. We dated for about two months before I asked her to be my girlfriend and didn’t get married until a little over two months ago. 

After we got married things were amazing. Our sex life was on point, careers were seeming to finally fall in line and our connection was seemingly unbreakable. 

Since me and her have been together I sadly have had the worst luck imaginable with jobs. Not sure if I’m doing something wrong or it’s literally just bad luck for me right now, or even if I’m just subconsciously not giving it my all, but I can’t seem to find a 40+ hour a week job that pays more than minimum wage ($7.25/hr) for shit. 

Roughly three times since we have gotten together she Gotten so pissed at me about my job situation that she has tried to leave me. Well this last time I think it may have genuinely been her breaking point and believe she is truly on her way out the door. I CAN’T lose this woman. My son is as in love with her as I am and I can’t bare the thought of her not being in my life because of a financial situation. 

Anytime I lose or quit a job I communicate effectively with her and stick to the plan. I just can’t seem to find anything. 

I need major help with advice on how to make this right. This girl is literally the root to my happiness and I can’t bare to lose her. 

Shoot it to me straight. I need the most honest advice you can give me.  ",17Dec2018,1
174,"So my school is known for providing for the really rich kids or the athletes. I didn’t think it would affect me until my ex abuser started harassing me at school for 3 years straight. Freshman year, he spread bad rumors about me and starting shouting insults at me. I reported him to my school and they took his side when he said no because he’s an athlete (a bad one too but not the problem lol). 

The next 2 years, especially my now junior year, he have been harassing me. This led me to report him to my school twice this year because he have been going up to me and start to yell and insult me in front of my peers. Those two times I reported him, the school didn’t even pick up the case. This causes my mental health is slowly decrease as my ex abuser is doing the same thing.

Last Friday (December 14th), he decided for the whole week previous that he wanted to hang out where I was on purpose and being a dickweed. Friday was the last straw and resulted me in having an panic attack. I don’t feel safe at my school at all and I shouldn’t have to move new hanging spots because he decided suddenly to be there.

My school has an option for a in-school restraining order and I’ve been attempting to go in there after winter break and file a official report. Yet, I’m scared to because I’m afraid the school will just ignore me again and I don’t know what to do. A lot of people should say I should do it but others are saying I’m just overreacting. 

I don’t know what to do. Help?",17Dec2018,1

178,"A friend will be staying at our house for 2-3 nights a week as he started a new job at where I work. He lives a lot drive from here so we figured that would take the strain of traveling and gas expenses a bit off him while he is looking for a new place here.

We made some agreements but have yet to decide what to do with groceries. We won't be charging him rent or anything as it's a favor from us to him, but we all figured that sharing groceries costs would be a wise thing to do.

Does anyone have experience on the best way to go about this? Do you ask for a specific amount per day at your house for breakfast/lunch/dinner? Do you calculate how much it was? I have no experience in sharing grocery costs for just a few days a week so any advice of what the most fair and easy approach is would be great.

181,"My sister cares about me a lot, she’s going through a really hard time having relationship troubles with her boyfriend. She’s studying for our exam (were in the same class) and she’s been really stressed. She cares more about my success on the exam than herself.

I asked her to go to the upstairs and grab printer paper so we could start our crib sheets, she wasn’t finding the door and I was like “it’s so simple HOW do you not see it!??” And I guess that was rude of me to say, she came down and made me go check and I realized she was right, there was no open entrance way at this time, so I quickly apologized and admitted I was wrong. 

She stayed upset. I asked her some questions about our exam and she ignored me angrily. I asked her more questions and she kept ignoring me. So I asked her why she was mad and she said “because you’re annoying”  so it turned into an argument, she started swearing at me and I told her I never speak to her that way, she grabbed my paper and ripped it up and then grabbed my phone and started destroying the pop socket saying she wishes she could do it to my face, she flipped out grabbed all her stuff and went upstairs crying. 


I really pushed her over the edge. I should not have started a fight during the hardest time in her life especially after she cares so much about me. Yeah she threw a tantrum but it’s because of all the weight she carries on her shoulders. She cares so much about me and is always worried about me. I’m just selfish and I let my ego get in the way.

Is there anything I can put out the back for her? Like a square meter of grass in a shell pool? I'm trying to figure out how to make her as comfortable as possible, considering she's always had a yard of grass.

I will send photos from time to time. I don't expect a reply back and I never get one. On some level I want to keep some line open in case he changed a new leaf, or my son wants to reach out. My son wants nothing to do with a dad who does not want him at the moment, and that is ok by me.

193,"Using a throwaway account and fake names for privacy. I moved in with one of my best friends (A), her boyfriend (B), and the boyfriend's relative (C) a couple of months ago. Everything was great until my friend and her bf broke up about a month and a half to two months ago. Neither of them moved out because we had just begun our lease, so things have been REAL awkward at our house. I can tell things are spiraling out of control now. 

One week they'll not talk to each other and the next week they'll go on pseudo dates, watch movies together, etc. Whenever A gets drunk, she breaks down and says concerning stuff like how unhappy she is, or tries to hook up with the first guy she sees, or asks me to take snapchats of her drinking and asking me to specifically send it to B. Meanwhile B isn't moving on and keeps doing stuff for her like making her dinner, buying birthday presents, etc. He just refuses to move on. I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells and I'm always afraid I'll say the wrong thing. I've recently started a new relationship that's been going extremely well and I feel a little awkward bringing him over. Kind of feels like I'm waving my successful relationship in A and B's faces, but since my BF is a commuting college student who lives at his parents' house, my house is really the only place we can spend time together. 

I know A is going into some kind of a depressive spiral because I have had a major depressive spiral in the past myself and I did the exact same kind of self destructive stuff during that period of my life. I've come a long way since then and through therapy I've learned how to manage my own negative emotions - I've been clean of self harm for 2 1/2 years now and I'm very proud of that. I've done my best to be there for her, but I can feel myself being dragged down with her. I'm constantly stressed, sad, and angry all the time because I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells, I don't feel comfortable in my own home, and it's hard to see my friends spiral like this. I sometimes get slight urges to self harm again and this has become very concerning to me. On top of all this, my friend group from college is having an internal conflict and both sides coming to me to trash talk the other side. So I'm caught in the middle of 2 different conflicts and it's really taking a toll on me. 

I need to put my own mental health first, and in order to do so I need to distance myself from A, B, and C - especially A. Easier said than done, because I think A has the expectation is that she is first in my mind, and that I will always be there to cover for her. For example, I know she's expected me to keep her in line when drunk and to stop her from saying stupid things while drinking. But that just adds to the stress and I can't even have fun while out with her anymore. I've been keeping my distance and I think she's noticed. I've started hanging out with my friend group from work more, staying away from the house, and talking to her less. I'm afraid that if I outright say that I need space to A, she'll get mad at me and ostracize me from our friend group. She has a habit of trash talking other people in our group and she's been going to our other friends' apartment almost every night so I'm afraid she's saying bad things about me. I don't want to paint A as a bad person, because she's not and I know she's only acting out because she's under duress. But her negative actions almost always affect me directly and I feel almost like I'm absorbing all of her negative emotions. 

Am I a terrible friend for distancing myself from A? As a friend I should be there for her, especially since I'm her only ""ally"" in the house. But my own mental health is taking a toll too, and I don't want to go back into my own depressive episode, especially after I've come so far. How do I go about telling A she needs professional help? How do I go about telling everyone in my house to get their shit together? How do I take care of my own mental health while still being a good friend?

194,"New user to Reddit, haven’t posted before - I need some advice please? 

My current SO and I live together, have a cute cat and have been together for 4 years. Our relationship without sounding cringe or smug is amazing, I can't fault it. 

I am looking to propose at some point in the next 6 months hopefully. I’ve seen (not bought yet) a ring and I honestly cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.

But I have no idea how to propose. We’ve had conversations on the topic of engagements and weddings (when discussing news of other friends engagements) about our proposal preferences. And she has plenty!

She doesn’t want it to be in front of family or crowds as she thinks it is a private affair between two people. 

She doesn’t want a ‘cliche’ date like valentines, Christmas, birthdays or anniversary’s. 

She doesn’t want a place where other people have been proposed to like the Eiffel Tower or Empire State or London Eye. She wants it to be personal to our relationship. 

She said she wouldn’t want a staged proposal where other people knew/were involved in setting up some big proposal, she would rather it be intimate and private and on the spot. 

But she also said she’d love to be able to watch it, if she could she’d have it captured on tape to rewatch forever.


She doesn’t and never has like soppy shows of affection, And she’s made remarks about guys who have speeches about how much they love their partner and blah blah will you do me the honours etc. 

So I’m kind of at a loss of how to propose! She’s not said any of these comments to me about my proposal, just comments I’ve picked up over the years about proposals in general. But how am I supposed to plan and pull off the perfect proposal? 

She loves the park, there’s a lake in our park where she sits in the summer whilst I’m at work with a book reading for hours. I always join after work and she’ll continue to read in between my legs until she falls asleep. So that’s my place - personal and meaningful to us. 

But how do I propose out of the blue, but manage to record it? 

And I don’t even know what to say in regards to the speech because I have a big declaration of love and promise but what if she hates it? 

Help! I’m panicking a little! ",17Dec2018,1
195,"TL;DR: I am overly trusting. I've been vaguely told to not trust pretty much everyone in my department, and now I'm distrustful and paranoid. 

This is kind of a long post, sorry in advance.
I am a high school special ed teacher in a small town in Oregon (8000 people). I just moved from a big city in California about 5 month's ago.

A little background on my personality; I am very trusting. I have a very bubbly personality, I'm nice to everybody, I love to talk, and I will admit, I very much want to be liked. I have trouble saying no to things, I will go out of my way to be helpful, and I know that it comes back to bite me, but I can't not do it.

I teach small classes of students who really struggle behaviorally and academically, and I have instructional aides in most of my classes. Our department is made up of myself, three other teachers, six instructional aides, and our department chair. The aides work with all of us, but report directly to the department chair. 

So I started my new job, and because I'm learning how things are done in a new state, I heavily rely on support from others in my department for the first month or so. Everyone is super nice, accommodating, and supportive. I learn quickly and become pretty self sufficient. I also form relationships with everyone in my department. Things are going great. 

But then, in the last couple of months, I notice that things are kind of strained between the department chair (I'll call her DC) and two teachers (Tam and Sue). DC has a take charge personality and can sometimes be a bit abrasive, but to me she seemed like a good leader in our department. I don't think much of it. 

One day Tam invites me out to lunch. At lunch, we have this conversation: 
Tam: Hey, how are you doing? 
Me: Fine. How are you doing? 
Tam: Not good. Can I ask you a question? 
Me: Sure. 
Tam: Are you being targeted? 
Me: Targeted? I don't think I am. How do you mean? 
Tam: Are you having any issues with DC or admin?
Me: No. Why, are you? 

She proceeds to tell me that she and Sue are being targeted by both DC and our vice principal. Things like giving them really low scores on observations, putting down their teaching methods, not taking discipline referrals seriously, and just generally being passive aggressive. It's gotten so bad that Tam is not coming back after Christmas break. Sue is also threatening to quit. She then proceeds to tell me about DC, each and every aide, and the principal, and why I should never trust any of them. I kind of just sit there quietly as she tells me this. She tells me that last year everything was fine between her and everyone else, but this one teacher was targeted until she was asked not to return (I don't know too many details). Now she's being targeted the same way. 

At this point, I'm just kind of shocked. I had no idea this was going on, and up until this point I have had nothing but positive interactions with all of these people. I'm not sure how to take it all in. It's all sort of vague, but plausible information. 

Now, I'm terrified of interacting with my coworkers. I'm afraid of being targeted just in case someone decides that they don't like me, I don't talk to my coworkers unless it's absolutely necessary, and I am afraid to leave my class anymore. I used to talk to everyone about how their day is going, joke around, and be friendly, but now I'm so afraid that someone will turn their back on me and make my work life unbearable until I am forced to leave. And people are starting to notice. They make comments about how they don't see me as much anymore, and they miss my goofy nature. Some are concerned that something is seriously wrong. But I brush it off that everything's fine. 

I don't know how to proceed. Because it's such a small community, everyone knows everyone, and I feel like if something like this were to happen to me, then small town politics will come into play and I will lose. But I don't know without a shadow of a doubt if any of this actually is happening the way my coworker is telling me it's happening. 

What do I do?

196,"I [23F] have never worked anywhere consistently for longer than 6 months. I have been pursuing my Associate of Art’s degree for 5 years (only have 3 classes left to take). I don’t know what it is, but I can’t stay at a job for long. I end up quitting because I never feel like the job is intellectually stimulating enough for me or pays me enough for all the bullshit they have me do. I live in a city that has cheap rent &amp; shitty food related jobs. Everyone in my life seems to have much more confidence in me than I do. I think. Sometimes I think I’m too skilled for certain jobs though too. Kinda hard to explain. 

For some reason everyone in my life enables me to be this way. My mother lives off my grandma so she never says anything about me not keeping a job, my best friends always say they just “know” I’ll be great and do amazing things one day, like own a business, so they aren’t worried about me; and my fiancé pays my bills and does talk with me about career ideas or degrees he thinks I would be good in. 


I do want a career and I am very goal oriented, but I also am very minimalist and don’t give a single shit about money. Don’t get me wrong, when I do have a job I’m paying my own bills. I’m definitely a hard worker when I am working, so I know I am not lazy. I just can’t see myself living my life to work it away like most. I NEED to find a career I’m passionate about right? 

I want to move out of this town, there is zero opportunity here. Do you think that’ll change the way I feel about working in general? I’ve only worked food related jobs, call centers, and hotel front desk (that one only lasted 2 days).

I guess what I’m asking is, is my town a reason I feel so uninspired all the time? does anyone else feel the way I do? What kind of job/career field should I go into that will actually make me excited to work for a living? Any advice would be helpful.

200,"It's always been hard for me to open up to people; video games have been an interest of mine since early childhood, but I was never able to share it with my family as my parents would simply berate me and call it nothing but an addiction.

Over the past few weeks, I've been trying to get my friends to watch my favorite anime with me; all of them except one refuse to even watch it because *ew anime*, and the one who does constantly reminds me he ""only is watching it to see how stupid it is"". It really hurts that they're so negative about something that means a lot to me.

But here's the catch: I went to a therapist to talk with my parents about this, and now they occasionally ask me what I've been up to online, but it doesn't feel genuine; it feels like I whined and made a big enough deal about it that it's more worthwhile for them to pretend to care than to express their actual opinions.

201,"So this group of girls has been harassing me online for almost 2 years now. It’s a long story as to why and isn’t really that necessary to share but long story short- we were all friends they turned against me after one of them stole my then partner and haven’t left me alone since. 

Normally it’s just petty things like saying I’m ugly or this and that but at times it did escalate to them telling me to kill my self as well a show to do it and other things. I did have to go to a mental institution for a while because they were relentless. I’ve blocked them countless times and they keep coming back with fake profiles to harass me. Because of how bad it is I don’t use Snapchat anymore and I hardly use Facebook. But my Instagram is very important to me. I have a decent following and work with a few brands, it’s not just a person account it’s a business to me. At one point I made a personal account, they found it in 2 days even though it wasn’t linked to any of my online profiles, didn’t have my name on the account, didn’t use my phone number or Facebook, I even made a new email to make this account and have my own space online. Yet they still found it so making another account is out of the question right now. 

Anyway back to my business account. I’ve had this account since I was 16 (I’m 22 now) and worked very hard to get where I am now. But because of these girls my photos were being reported and removed, Instagram warned me that if another photo was removed my account could be banned/deleted. So I archived all of my past photos and started my feed again in November. I blocked accounts that view my stories but don’t follow me, with some exceptions. If anyone follows these girls and me I block them as well. Their friends, family, partners, alt accounts, you name it I’ve blocked it. But yesterday an account commented on a maternity photo of me, all it said was “gross”. I know exactly who this person is but they managed to block me on that account before I could block them sadly. So now i know that they have accounts that i can’t block right now. 

Now I’m asking for advice because even though I’m okay with blocking these accounts all the time today I tried to upload a photo with a caption and for some reason it wouldn’t upload the caption. Then I couldn’t comment on posts, my own or others. After a while I could so I think it was a temp ban. If I can’t use my account or it gets banned I lose my partnerships and all my years of work. I also can’t make my account private as i have to have a public account for some of my sponsors. I’ve done everything I can think of. it’s not just about me being happy or them being petty anymore.

She is charming and sweet but I have never felt an attraction to her like I have the past month or so. We both talk about how we individually want to fool around and the yearning to get laid. Point is I really want to find out if she wants to take a shot at being intimate but I'm not sure if I should or how to go about it if I should. Do I put my cards on the table or keep my thoughts to myself and hope she comes my way?

206,"It’s been a year and a half. We dated for a month, it’s silly how obsessed I became with him. I tried for his attention, yearned for him.
He is completely self-centered, emotionally abusive, and could care less about my feelings. He very much fits his horoscope sign, a cancer. He finally added me on Snapchat, we’ve been talking and he makes many rude comments and I still go for it. 
In the past, I’ve taken control over any relationship I’ve had. Always, and I don’t go for rude comments. But with him, I crumble. I allow him to continue to talk down on me, use me. 
Just earlier today, he told me I had gotten fatter and my ass had gotten smaller (whatever) then proceeded to ask me for nudes later on. Which I didn’t send! So bravo to me, I guess.
Our relationship ended bad. Few days after our breakup I was with him and a group of mutual friends. I got completely drunk, two of his friends kept asking me for head. 
Me: I won’t do it if you tell me not to [ I just wanted him to care ]
Him: I don’t give a shit what you do
So I did it, he blocked me. 
So I was in the wrong, but I’m still in love and he clearly is not. Can someone give me advice for this? Please ",17Dec2018,1

212,"So for background information:

&amp;#x200B;

I work 12 hour shifts at my job most nights and my short nights are 9 hours. He usually works 7 hour shifts with two 10 hour shifts. Since we both work in restaurants though our schedule does change here and there and we don't usually get to leave when we're scheduled to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of us work night shifts but it overlaps in a way where we still don't get much time together and he ends up home alone a lot. We're not guaranteed to have a day off of work together either. We've been lucky but I don't know if we'll continue to and this week is one of our weeks where we don't have a day off together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship isn't hurting per say, like it hasn't created problems but I have noticed my mood going down because I don't always get any real quality time with him.  It doesn't help that I'm usually very exhausted from work and I can't go without at least 6 to 7 hours of sleep or I have issues driving safely to and from work.

&amp;#x200B;

Which the drive is also an issue because both of us have 30+ minute commutes to work so our time together is limited even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do about this and I can't even ask for him to request specific days off because my schedule fluctuates so much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also worried that, even though right now our relationship itself is okay, maybe in the future it will start to hurt it. I'm just not sure what to do or how to work around this, even though I know people do it all the time. Part of it is because in the beginning of the relationship we we're almost always together and now it feels like we never are.

&amp;#x200B;

We do live together but most of our time spent together now is sleeping and getting ready to go to work the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being too sensitive about the whole thing? Because it is hurting my mood at work even though I try to leave it all at home. I know the holidays are making it worse because we're both having to work during the holidays and all these people are coming in an constantly reminding me about him because they always have to ask if I have plans for Christmas and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do to make more time for us to spend together or at least feel like we're spending time together?

Am I just making a big deal out of it now and I'll get over it as time passes and I get used to not being around him as much as I used to?

I'm just not sure what to do at this point and I feel silly even asking for advice.",17Dec2018,1

Clothes are out of the question because my mom is super picky with clothes lmfao!! Can anyone recommend any gifts? Nothing expensive because this girl is making peanuts lol.

214,"The other day I took an exam in one of my college classes, and during it my calculator stopped working  and against my best judgment, I glanced at my friend’s desk next to me a couple times to see if he had one, but he didn’t. Just then my teacher walked by and looked at me but didn’t say anything, and I realized she may have thought I’d been trying to look at his test answers. I also realized after the test I mistakenly forgot to take off my smart watch, which she said not to have during the test. She didn’t say anything about looking at my friend’s test or about my watch when I asked her general questions during the test and after I turned it in and left, so I was wondering if I have anything to worry about. I’m anxious that she did actually notice and decide to just tell the academic council about what she saw, instead of talking to me first about it.

215,"Reddit,
I found this platform in 2010, when I was 11 years old- I’ve been hooked ever since.  with varying degrees of involvement over the last 8 years (mostly, lurking), I’ve always been moved by the immense kindness of users in these communities. even moreso, overall astounded by the way this website has grown and flourished. 

Instead of lurking, though, i made this throwaway. and I want to be heard.
I appreciate any commentary, love, support, and advice to be offered. (I have pretty thick skin, so I’m not worried about asshole comments, they’ll get their karma.) 

but let’s get down to it. 

I’ve always known that i come from a broken home, and tried to remedy the effects it had on me to the best of my ability. 
but I couldn’t ever shake the feeling that there was something more sinister than “two parents who just tried their best”. 
(In short, it was a clusterfuck. two people who spent most of their marriage “getting back at each other”, domestic violence, alcoholism, addictions, etc. Big yikes. But they were controlling, selfish, and fought ruthlessly to keep their children from getting help, because they wanted to save their own asses. bigger yikes. But wait, there’s more!)

i was right. 
despite not participating in intercourse, or being  raped penetratively by my father- I am the victim of incest. careful with the associations, though-i by no means was a voluntary participant. 
I was certainly molested, possibly by extended family, also, not just my father. as far as I am aware my brothers have not been sexually abused. I was the target. 

as a child, I was always incredibly precocious. on top of that, i was also a “daddy’s girl”.  I was showered me with love, gifts, and affection throughout my childhood. Since he worked long hours, i was always thrilled to be able to spend time with him. 
As my parents marriage started to fail, they grew apart in all regards. My dad, frustrated with his sexless and loveless marriage used me as a surrogate wife.
I became responsible for his needs for physical closeness, carried the burden of his emotional turmoil, and was subsequently triangulated into my parent’s marriage. 
on top of that, he exploited his occupation as a doctor throughout my childhood and into my teenage years to continue this sort of abuse (my dad/mom were my primary caregivers, they “knew best” and didn’t trust anybody to misdiagnose or mistreat their precious little girl). it was not unusual when I had a medical concern, to have to bring it to my father. on many occasions, I had to strip down to be semi, or completely naked so he could “examine” me fully. because him, my mom, and few trusted coworkers were the only people I was allowed to talk with. I was trapped. 

my brothers were always taught to objectify from an insanely young age. my older brother would often participate in making lewd jokes about me alongside him. he abhorred me for the attention and privileges I was given, but when we were young we had to team up to care for my little brother and ourselves, even though we were constantly physically fighting and at each others throats). 
we were rightfully fearful that if we didn’t step in when needed, one of our parents would either kill the other. or would kill themselves. 

but I couldn’t make sense of this, i was too young, and it’s been locked away until now. 

despite being a bright kid, relatively accomplished, and always socially active I felt radically different from my peers.
I became increasingly defiant to authority figures across the board. teachers, my parents, athletic coaches, you name it. I’ve always been bit of a little shit, and that’s what everyone chalked it up to. honestly, so did I. 
but in reality, i developed a slew of somatic symptoms, body dysmorphia, depression, etc. I began to self harm, saved up my funds and had a plan to become a runaway, suicidal thoughts and ideation, and more all by my 11th birthday. 

In my teenage years, I danced with danger in any way I could to try to feel alive. I drowned myself in alcohol, illicit drugs, cut class, and became the best nomad I could while still being under my parents control. 

I’m currently a sophomore at one of the top universities in the country. I don’t know how I got to this point. I don’t feel like I deserve it. I should’ve died, or ended up in jail. I came close too many times to count. 

It wasn’t until just two days ago that I actually got to play connect the dots, despite them being lit brighter than canis major. my emotions are undoubtedly raw right now, and I’m in a bit of shock and denial. 

For the moment, my mother is in control of all the finances, and my tuition is being covered by my parents. they’re still divorcing, and my little brother is in shared custody of them. I’m terrified, but I can’t stay. 
I’m going to lose my family if the truth comes out, but i need to be free. ",17Dec2018,1
216,"Hi all,

I need some advice on social media. I have instagram and facebook but never post anything because I never had the need to share my experiences. But now everyone I know is doing it, even some of my friends that have never posted before have begun connecting with people through social media. 

Should I start making posts about my hobbies and my life to connect with more people? how do you cope with the negative judgement of others on what you post? what do i post about? what if i never get likes, should i just stop posting? 

I'm not the best looking guy, and I get anxious when I have a photo of myself for everyone to see. Should I post selfies? Should I ask my friends to take pictures of me just for the sake of portraying to others that i have a life? do alot people who post on social media connect well with strangers?

",17Dec2018,1
218,"So to start, I'm kind of in the midst of a chaotic situation. I grew up in a financially stable and rather privileged family, but anything other than finances was extremely unstable and quite dangerous. My parents are extremely abusive, beginning with just my mother but after time my dad realized that if he took her side he didn't get nearly as much abuse and I ended up having to shoulder it.  For some clarification, the earliest I can remember it is when I was six and wanted to part my bangs to the opposite direction  I got screamed at and accused of wanting to be like Hitler ( apparently his bangs parted that direction. The instance that stuck with me was after the first time I was raped by a very abusive boyfriend I was with at the time. Terrified that it was my fault I talked to my friends since I trusted them, my mother  caught me on the phone and  blackmailed me into telling her. Since I was terrified still ( it was very soon after, I was still in pain, bleeding etc.), I dumbed it down and told her he forced me to give him head. She asked if he physically pinned me down. Since he used another method to achieve his assault I said no and didn't get a second to explain what he had indeed done (which left me unable to move either way) and was told ""I didn't raise you to be such a slut. I can't believe you've gone and acted like a white for that boy"". So with some very very minimal basis for the verbal abuse I should elaborate on my situation. My parents have withheld all my legal papers from me ""since I can't handle the responsibilities of having them myself"". So I have been unable to get a job throughout my life unless they approved of the time I was getting it and the job.  Therefore I have no money to my name, and have been forced to live with the system they set up for me. They have legal ownership of the area I am living in for college so I have no sense of privacy as they are able to enter at anytime.I have struggled with depression all my life as well as ptsd as a result of the rape mentioned earlier as well as repeated incidents like that. I had a car but after a recent freak accident ( my car quite literally slipped out of park into reverse) theyve taken that from me as well. As of recently they have been threatening to throw me out on the streets with nothing. Shes been justifying this by coming to me when I am peacefully doing nothing wrong, screaming at me and starting a fight, and then calling my dad in after I have moved past calmly addressing her and moved to defending myself.  Earlier tonight she laid her hands on me and on my throat after I was crocheting in the kitchen. I confronted my dad for help and he yelled at both of us that he was trying to sleep and to leave him alone. I have no arrests in my past, not even a speeding ticket. I got my first college degree at 17 ( for free) through a program I decided to attend. I'm attending a local university now to get my bachelor's and only have two semesters left till graduation. I make good grades and am an honors student. Basically I don't do anything to get into trouble. Her excuse for lately is that in September I attempted suicide after a hard few months after my fiance and I broke it off ( he'd been having an affair for a year). Right before I attempted suicide I had slept with a few boys out of manic desperation to feel something. After I got out of the hospital I made some solid friends who are all guys (literally a fraternity on my campus). I spend alot of time with these guys as a result. She's continued to set up hoops I must jump through to possibly have use of my car again, continue school via their funding, etc. I'm unsure what to do because I've wanted to leave in the past but as I've mentioned 1) no car 2) no access to legal papers to get a job 3)no money to live off of to even get a start. I'm very grateful for the financial support they've provided but the emotional costs are getting higher and higher and beginning to destroy me.  Now that she's threatening to throw me out I have no clue what to do. I don't even know how to fill out fafsa or get a student loan because she's always had me 'let her handle it' and not let me watch.  Any advice is appreciated. I know this is a chaotic ramble but I'm still pretty upset, if any clarification is needed on anything please just comment and I'll reply with the information. ",17Dec2018,1

223,"For the last 2ish years I've been forcing myself to accomplish goals no matter what it takes because I was sick of disappointing myself. Needless to say I have accomplished some goals that I thought were just silly dreams and I'm on track to complete my biggest goal I have ever set. 

And yet I feel like I'm on the verge of crying everyday, but I can't muster up any tears to release my emotions. I am almost 22, I have 3 friends, 2 of which live over 25 driving hours away, and my other friend of 10 years who lives across the state has become someone I truly do not like anymore. My accomplishments have become nothing more than numbers on a screen seen only by myself. I get aching feelings of loneliness at night. When I'm around people I crave to be alone, but when I'm alone all I want is a companion. I don't know what I'm doing, it feels like I'm just floating by, watching others go on with their days. I want to open up to someone so badly, I want to cry with someone. I just feel alone and empty, even more so than when I was complacent in my disappointment 2 years ago.  

The last 2 years have instilled a mindset of pushing through difficult times to get to the end goal. Which has helped me tremendously, but has slowly worn off. I feel weak and like I'm giving up, and I hate that because I'm competitive and want to be better all the time. But the side of me that wants to stop being so tenacious is getting heavier each day, so I have been trying harder each day to keep going at life, but it's running my mind ragged.

I work out and will continue to do so. I'm 5'10.

I eat right and will continue to do so. 

I already have some muscles. Trying to get super lean though(like Fitness models). My face is chiseled and women call me good looking online and after meeting me from Tinder too. But strangely women in real life don't look at me on the street. I really want them to look at me.😭 I work so hard for it 😭

I use face wash twice a day. I use moisturiser. My teeth are perfect and white. I have short spiky hair(Ronaldo ish).

 I sleep well.

I am clean shaven(I grow facial hair real quick but I shave it because it's an ego thing, beards are like a cheat code for men , and I am the kind of guy who refuses to cheat even in video games so yeah).

My eyebrows are not shaped however. Thinking maybe that's the missing ingredient. 

I already get sex/making out with average looking women from Tinder(without having to take them out on coffee dates or movies or good conversation skills, so yeah). They all say I'm good looking and stuff.
But what do I want? Several hot Friends with benefits who like me because of my LOOKS(not my personality). 

Preferably a couple years older than me(like I'm 21 so like 23 -28 ;) I mean I have already gotten with average looking 26/27 yos but now  I want hot ones(what is hot for me?

225,"I am a 19 year old (f) freshman in college. In the last 6 months I have lost 2 jobs based on performance. This has been so devastating to me not because of the money or the job itself because both of these jobs I had issues with anyways, but my pride is killing me. My whole life I have grown up with my parents and those around me telling me I am something special and how people are lucky to work with me, etc. Other jobs I have had have reaffirmed these ideas as well. From the time I was 16 until I was 19 I worked at a chain retail store where I was promoted quickly and well praised by management. In school I was always praised by teachers for being likable and responsible. To boil it down I care a LOT about what people think about me and I always want to be that person that is ""The best"". The first job was a job as a personal assistant to a CEO at a marketing firm. I was so surprised to even get the job but they told me they liked my ""go get it"" attitude because I came in and followed up about my application. I worked there for about a month and a half before they let me go because I made a few mistakes in my job (wrong water softener salt for his house, forgot tomato on his burger, struggled finding him a suitable landscaper for his house, stuff like that). Losing this one killed my pride. Fast forward 5 months later to now. I have been working as a guitar teacher at a music studio since January of last year. During my first 6 months I had some retention issues but I really think only 2 of the 6 students I lost were due to my fault whether it was just not clicking with the student or parent issue with schedule. I lost a few more students more recently due to their schedules changing (at least that is what they told me and the studio) and one due to parent issues and miscommunication. I learned from all these experiences and the students I had left were doing very well and I got along with them and their parents perfectly, yet they just told me they would not be renewing my contract next year due to those earlier retention problems. I am devastated. First off because I love my students so much and they are technically property of the studio so I cannot keep them. Second off my pride ACHES. How could I have fucked up this bad? What do I need to do to move on from this? Am I a shitty worker? Is this something that has happened to other people before? Because right now I feel like the biggest loser in the whole world.

When we were in the car driving from the airport, she freaked out and attempted to attack the driver (her fience) and I had to physically restrain her for the hour drive.

231,"Small, simple, question.

Every night I call up my long distance GF with facetime and we talk together until she goes to sleep; she likes having me there as she's going to bed. It's super sweet, and I love doing it. But one thing that I always wonder about is that, as she's drifting off to sleep, occasionally she'll whisper/say my name over and over. I just assume it's a bad dream, so I just whisper that I'm there, she's OK, and that I love her, but she's asleep so I don't think I'm doing very much and she keeps going on. She's very active in her sleep, she'll constantly be saying things, laughing, moving around, etc. but on the occasional nights she does this it's always right as she's gone to sleep. I've asked her about it, and what she dreams about, and she always says she doesn't remember. I'm super curious, any ideas why she does this?",17Dec2018,1
232,"I’m 19 M and currently a sophomore in college. I don’t have a social life and end up playing video games most nights with my younger brother and his friends online (all of them are in high school). The only social thing I do is play frisbee but I don’t really get along with anyone on the team. I had a ton of friends in high school so I don’t think I’m socially inept or anything. 

I also feel like I am not learning anything in any of my classes and I feel guilty because everyone around me seems like they are learning stuff so why am I not? I feel like I’m in the right major but just the classes and what I’m learning are so boring. 

I have serious FOMO all the time because I here stories of all of my high school friends partying and doing crazy college shit and having friend groups and stuff. They’re also enjoying they’re classes and seem to be having just a way better time than me. I’m not really interested in partying or doing drugs but I feel like that’s one of the main ways or only ways to socialize at my college. It makes me feel like I’m not normal since I don’t want to party or do conventional college stuff.

I have serious doubts that I am just some weirdo that no one likes or wants to talk to. I feel out of place all the time at my school. I feel like I just want to be done with college and be 30 and have a job and live in the suburbs. College to me just seems stupid and I don’t want it to be but that’s how it feels. 

I always want to come home and never feel comfortable in college. I don’t feel like I can be myself.

I feel like everyone has told me “college is so great” or “best time of your life” and that the academics are more enjoyable but I just feel lied to. I enjoyed high school 10000 times more than college and would so rather be in high school. 

Am I at the right school or am I doing something wrong? It feels like a mix of both but I could just use advice on how to enjoy college or get a better social life because I feel so lost currently. ",17Dec2018,1
233,"I bought my sibling a Christmas present costing several times the usual amount. At the time I thought this would be a nice gesture to make up for not getting them a gift on a few other occasions where I should have.

However the closer we get to Christmas the more I think this was a bad idea. The gift cost more than all of my other sibling's and parent's gifts combined. Money isn't the issue, I'm worried about what kind of message this sends. 

I don't hold this sibling above the others, it's just that we usually exchange slightly more expensive gifts than the rest and there were a couple of occasions where I should have gotten them something and didn't. I don't want my parents to think that I value this sibling more than them, and the more I think about the disparity between what I've bought them all, the more unfair it feels to me.

Did I fuck up and is there anything I can do about it? They already know roughly what I got the sibling, so I can't change it now.

235,"I'm a trans guy (21 M) in the process of coming out. Currently I am out to my immediate family and almost all of my closest friends, and there is only one other people I feel the need to sit down with and talk to personally. I am going to have the paperwork to legally change my name all squared away before next semester starts, and I plan to be out publicly by then.

My question is, do I need to talk to my *roommates* about being trans before I come out? (Not making a big announcement, just changing my name where it's listed publicly and updating my documentation everywhere.) I live with two people, D (20 F) who I'm decent friends with and J (22 M) who I barely knew before this year but who I get along well with. All of us are very busy, we're all full time students with multiple jobs, and so we aren't super social with each other. J and I both have girlfriends and so we tend to be out on weekends, and D's family lives close by and she goes home a lot. It's not uncommon for us to go a couple days without seeing each other. 

D and J currently think of me as a lesbian and J is bi, so I'm not worried about either of them having a hugely explosive reaction or turning into an unsafe situation, but D is straight, kind of religious, and super uninformed about trans people. She's said some things in the past that make me concerned that we'll be less close over this, which is a possibility I've considered and accepted. J is super chill about everything and probably won't care. What I'm trying to figure out is what information exactly I owe the two of them before I come out publicly. 

If I didn't live with them, I definitely would not talk to either of them personally. But since they do live with me, I feel like they are entitled to know...sort of. If I lived with two women, I definitely would feel like I owe them advance notice in case they had specifically wanted an all-women living situation, but J is a dude so that's not a concern. People irl are super divided -- I've heard everything from ""You definitely have to sit them down and tell them"" to ""Fuck that, you don't owe them anything,"" and I feel like the answer is somewhere in between those extremes but I don't know what it looks like. I don't want this to be a big deal. Everyone I've talked to so far I've told because I knew they could handle and would want to use my correct name/pronouns in private as soon as I was sure and/or were close enough to know something was up so I felt like they deserved an explanation. I don't feel that way about my roommates. We're all moving out in June (graduating, and also the building is terrible), but I want to avoid spring semester being awkward for either of them or me. Do I talk to them each separately? Do I just put it in the group chat? I know I've overthought this far too much at this point but I'm really not sure. Would you feel confused/hurt/betrayed if your roommate came out as trans and you found out from a changed Facebook name? 

**tldr; I'm trans and I'm coming out publicly super soon, haven't talked to my roommates. Do I need to and what should I say to them?**",17Dec2018,1
237,"So just to give a little background on this story, this year I started high school, I am a boy who started the year with many friends, I often get very angry over little things.

So a few months ago I said some really horrible things to my closest friend, obviously after that we didn't hang out again because she was really hurt, I apologised heaps and started hanging out with some over people in my class (they come into the story a lot later) All the people that were friends with me and the other girl I used to hang out with stopped speaking to me, they lost respect for me, but like a few weeks ago I messaged the girl and we started talking and she told  me she just wants things to go back the way they did before all this happened (we had like a really cool friends group). One day the new people I was hanging out with annoyed me so much I went and hung out with the girl I was really close to before, they then got really offended and messaged me and said things like ""oh so we were just a rebound"" and ""so we were never really your friends"" which got me mad cause they were, but then I realised these people make me feel so annoyed and dumb and just not relevant, we then just agreed to take some space and so now I'm kinda flying solo.

I'm just posting this to get some advice, These new friends make me annoyed but I need people and the other girls won't accept me.

what should I do, should I just give them space and go back or just stay solo.

239,"Quick setting, I work in an after school program where the rooms are grouped by several grades.  I worked for several years with the youngest group, but at the beginning of this year I switched from Room 1 (grades K-2) to Room 2 (grades 3-4) in to try something different.  And I'm glad I did because it's learning process for me as a new teacher, I got to work with a different teacher and sponge up some of his style with my own, etc.  However one of the things I learned was that I really prefer working with grades K-2.  I work better with them, and really I think I have more to offer them, and so on.  Plus they always ask me why I left when I see them and it's heartbreaking and truth be told I really do miss it everyday.  Cut to now, the assistant teacher in Room 1 is leaving soon, and they need a new asst teacher.  They're looking for someone, but I could potentially swoop in and say I want to go back there. HOWEVER, I'm doubting myself if that is a good idea because of (A) the impact it would have on the students in Room 2 if I suddenly left, especially in the middle of the year, (B) do I have more to learn from being in room 2 and from the teacher in said room? and (C) I will likely be leaving this job soon to pursue more permanent teaching position somewhere else, should I really switch right before leaving? HOWEVER (C part II) I don't know how soon I'll leave, should I go somewhere I'll be happy? ON THE OTHER HAND (C part III) should I focus more on my happiness or on the stability of the students and additionally what I can learn from the situation?

249,"Let me start by saying that my husband is amazing and works extremely hard for our little family (him, my daughter and myself), to support us both financially and through encouragement. We have been together through many years of turmoil, lots of ups and downs, LOTS of emotional battles (I have BPD &amp; suffer from extreme anxiety), and lots of financial struggles. Through it all he has been there, working his ass off at a job he absolutely hates, where he is treated horribly, and where he has for the past 11 years has worked each day in fear that it may be his last because that's just how they operate. Can you even imagine the kind of stress that would cause? And it has. To the point where he has over the past 3-4 years started to drink when he gets home from work. 

It started with just a couple of beers with some coworkers after work. Then that lead to coming home and fixing a couple of (liquor) drinks instead because he doesn't get out of work until after 8 or 9 o'clock pm sometimes (sometimes even later than that-and he leaves the house in the mornings at 6:45 am!!!). So 1 or 2 drinks became 2 or 3 regular drinking glass sized drinks on a daily basis. That's the way it has been and continues to be. He knows its not good. He even says he doesn't like to do it. But he feels like he has to. I've told him I think he needs help. But when I have asked him to talk with his doctor, and also to maybe ask about getting on medication for his depression instead, he just dismisses me. 

Please remember, he does provide for us and he is an awesome father. He is very involved and engaged (when he's not at work), he cares for me still after all these years-even though I've put him through hell and back with my mental issues. But every time I ever have anything (at all) to dispute with him about, it becomes something much more and he always turns it into an attack on him, and asking every single time, ""Why am I not allowed to have these feelings?"" or ""Why can't I have an opinion about this/that?""...and inevitably it ends with, ""It doesn't matter anyway, nobody cares."" I've always tried to tell him that I DO care but that is never enough.

So, tonight, again, he had a few drinks in him and he was making some grandiose plans for us to travel abroad next year. 1) we don't have the $ for that &amp; 2) we have two family weddings out of state that we will all three have to fly to already planned. So I asked him about that, if he remembered them and where he thought we were going to get the money for all this travel...and he says that he just wants to leave them all behind and go do his own thing. When I challenged this idea by asking if he had a sense of ""duty or obligation"", he proceeded to tell me that he has spent his entire life obliging them. He became very emotional, brought to tears even, explaining to me how he felt growing up, how he was treated. He went into how he felt disregarded. How his interests and talents weren't encouraged and supported (the way he always supports our daughter). How they were always there for his sister (and still are), and practically ""lived"" at the church volunteering and expecting it out of him as well. How they missed an extremely important event in his life because they didn't take the time to realize how big of a deal it was to him. And because he never finished college, his family doesn't focus on how hard he works but rather on how he didn't get a degree. 

He has rejected the church, religion, pretty much anything involving faith of any kind. I wondered for so long why? Because when we met, he wasn't there...not yet. But I guess the years of hardship have broken him down. I'm not saying that he has to run back to the church or anything. I myself have a rather open and liberal belief system. But my concern, given the fact that we do so much with his parents (they live very close), and will soon be seeing his sister &amp; her family over the holidays, is that he will just be continuing his ""obligation"" and file the resentment away to be drowned out with more alcohol later. 

So do I say something to them or not? And if so, how and what?

250,"is that the same thing? not really sure. 

anyways we’ve been dating for 2 years. things are great and then every now and then we go through these rocky patches that are becoming all too familiar. 

so it’ll usually start this way. he’ll do something that upsets me and i tell him. then he starts babbling on why he does this or that and that it’s okay. never apologizes or offers any resolution or really shows that he validated why i’m feeling that way. and then i usually end up feeling crazy and apologizing. 


in october. we had plans that day to do stuff with my parents and brother for a late bday celebration for me since my brother couldn’t make it the week before. bro makes the drive over and we’re just hanging out everyone asking okay where is he (my bf) because they were ready to get going. it was like 2pm and i hadnt heard from bf all day even tho he knew we had plans at some point that day with my fam. 

i’m getting pissed bc my fam is waiting and my brother drove in and it’s kinda for my bday. i end up going over to his place and knocking on the door. he answers and he’s like what’s up? he was playing video games all day that’s why he didn’t answer. i was so mad at him for not just hitting me up at all responding and he called me crazy for coming over. how else would i reach him?? he always says video games is how he unwinds. he works 10-12 hours each day except sunday’s. so i get it and that’s fine. 

the most recent example- Sunday was my brothers birthday dinner. my bf confirmed earlier in the week but we didn’t have solidified plans yet. Saturday night i left his house and i said i had to run errands in the morning but we can hang out after he said okay. 

Sunday afternoon comes im finished up so i text him to see what’s up. no response whatever that’s okay so i move on with my day and go out. i was trying to get a christmas present for a mutual friend he knows better. so i was at the store trying to get something and call my bf to see if he thought it was good. no answer. okay that’s cool. then my parents tell me the plan for my brothers bday dinner. 

it’s getting close to that time so i need to communicate plans with my bf so we can go on time. i text him. no answer for hours. we need to leave at 4 and i said that. he finally answers me at 4pm saying “so we going?” and i pick him up and it looks like he just got out of bed. he said he worked on editing some footage for something which is great but and i get resting on his one day off but i really don’t see how that has any relevance to just sending me a text. 

i told him how frustrating it was bc i thought it wouldn’t happen again and how all i want is just like a text bc i was trying to get his opinion on a gift to buy and also make plans to go to my brothers bday dinner. he didn’t apologize and just said well whenever i text you and you don’t answer i assume it’s bc your busy and that if he doesn’t reply it means he’s busy doing stuff.. i never ever not reply to him which i told him. 

he just continued explaining why it’s fine and that’s just how he is etc, i say it’s just frustrating because i feel like i should have confidence and can rely on at least hearing from him once at least. i feel like that isn’t irrational. i don’t ask for a lot. but i know he must’ve picked up his phone once that day. or at least thought of me or how we had plans so he could’ve texted to ask when it was??

he went on to say it’s so out of character for me to care about texting and it was so clingy of me. i was in shock because i literally don’t care about texting. i just wanted to hear from him and know that if i need to get ahold from him i can. i ended up apologizing for being clingy and annoying and overreacting. 

but in reality i don’t feel this way. i don’t know how to explain to him that i should be able to reach him it shouldn’t take a whole day especially when he’s in his room doing nothing. i’m not sorry for being upset at all. 

he’s never called me clingy before and i know i’m not. i’m very independent. it seriously shocked me how he took ahold of the argument and made me feel so out of control and crazy. 

this isn’t the only instance he does this. whenever i express to him how something he did upset me, there’s NEVER an apology or convo it’s just rationalizing and explaining why its okay that he does something. 

sorry this was so long. i don’t know what this is. was that wrong of him to do?? what do i do. ",17Dec2018,1

252,"Hello everyone, so this term in school I did very poorly. This entire term I have been under Academic probation for the second time. 

To summarize really quickly, my last couple of terms have also been very bad. Home life, work and other personal issues have taken all motivation for school out of me. After a series of poor grades, they threw me into academic probation and then academic suspension the next term. I hated being out of school to be honest. I didn't realize I was missing so much, which is why I was very motivated and prepared to go back to school. I started up the term with the complete intention of dedicating myself 100% to school. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I'm not blaming anyone other than myself for this blunder. Unavoidable and unpredictable events took place in my life that distracted me from school (fell in love, my uncle almost died, birth of my cousin). 

 In the end, this term turned out really bad. This will result in my grade point average dropping below 2.0 which is the boundary for good standing at my school. I'm fairly certain it will only drop to about 1.95 ish though. I'm going to end up on academic suspension again at this rate. They haven't put me on academic suspension yet, but soon they will. I really really don't want to go back to academic suspension. I feel like I am going to waste away if I go back to that. 

I want to know if there are any options I should explore to avoid this. I'm considering emailing the dean to see what I can do to fix this. I of course will also be discussing with academic advisers. Has anyone ever dealt with a problem like this that could help a friend out? ",17Dec2018,1

So, ill provide the background. I met a girl on Reddit last year for a concert meet-up. From like pretty much the first time I met her I was awe-struck. So we talked on Facebook and the likes, we met up in my local city, we went to a music festival, and another few concerts. She invites me to party's at her flat and even to a show that her drama club put on. She's the only person I've actually had proper interaction with this year.

The problem is, that she's finished her university course and is moving back to her home country, we'll still talk and she said she was planning on inviting some friends over to visit and that she wants to come over again to go volunteer for some festivals. 

The other problem is that I'm not sure if she's just being nice because thats in her nature or if she actually likes me. I know I certainly have feelings towards her, I just don't know what kind of feelings. I just really want to tell her but I'm terrified that I ruin everything.

So my girlfriend requested that i don’t tell anyone we’ve had sex which i completely understand, however she has told her friend that she has been very close to and plans on having sex w me. However now that we have she hasn’t told her friend. So i’ve told my friend we had sex, cause he’s my best friend and i wanted to tell someone, anyway i feel quite guilty and want to tell her, but however we’re very far away rn and we both are trying to not to make conflict as it’s hard to sort it out at long distance. So the question is should i tell her now, or later or just keep it tell myself and if she asks me tell her or not tell her at all. if u need anymore info just ask",17Dec2018,1
257,"So this account is a throwaway. Mostly because I am embarassed.

I am a 28M. Broke up with my GF of 5 years this summer, which hurt me alot emotionally.

Luckily, i have the most wonderful family and friends. I feel Lucky. Couldnt ask for anything better.

Im normally a pretty polite, outgoing guy. I think most of the People in my life Will tell you I am a kind person that likes to help out and be supportive. Im also VERY caring and PROTECTIVE.

I had a period in my life. For about 8 years ago. I used to hang with a bad crowd. Nothing too special. We used to drink alot fridays and saturday.

Right off the bat, ive never started a conflict. But i have ended them. And at the time, i felt badass. Like IT was cool to be this guy People feared and respected. Keep in mind. This is 8 years ago.
I feel that i have matured, and when i look back, i feel Sad, ashamed and embarassed. How can someone think this is OK? Well i did for 8 years ago. So after the period, i got a GF. She is the sweetest girl ever. God how i love her. And how i want her back, but i cant.... Thats another story.

Things calmed Down, and i was happy and proud.
Life was Great while i had a partner. I looked out for her when she was Down, vice versa.

Ff july 2018. We Broke up. We both agreed. Harmless breakup but nonetheless Sad.

Im Down, but my friends and family help me up.
Lately ive been using tinder, because of needs. Well. That isnt enough for me. I Long for a partner. I need love.

So now comes the shitty part. Last friday i was at the christmasparty with my Job. All well. Got drunk but nothing out of the ordinary. Like regular ppl get drunk. 
So after the party, i went to a friends. There were two of them. Nice guys. I got a blackout. And i was aggressive, only verbally Luckily. They got mad, totally understandable. My behaviour was unacceptable. They managed to calm me Down and get me to sleep.
Next Day i was trembling, extremly Sad and anxious.

So the reason im afraid of myself is because i heard about what ive done during blackout episodes about 8 years ago and it isnt pretty. I have hurt People pretty bad, but not to the extent where they needed treatment at the ICU. I also think ive been depressed for maybe 10-15 years.
I havent spoken about this to my family, barely to my friends and Brothers. I cant. I try to spark it up but then i cant bring myself to speak about it. Its Just churning inside my head.
Ive spoken to my doc about my feelings and my mental health. But he says theres nothing wrong with me. Maybe there isnt, but i wouldnt know, all i know is that i feel pretty Sad.

Also. I difficulties expressing how i feel. Its kind of Basic. Sad, angry, happy. But theres obviously much more happening that i cant express.

I dont know if this is the right sub to postthis on. But it felt very Nice to vent. Have never done it before. I feel like its way easier to write it Down than expressing it verbally.

Also i am afraid of being percieved as a bad person. Im really not. I always help out friends, family and strangers in need. 

Im mentally exhausted, i feel alone, i feel like its worsening everyday, and i cant seem to find a sollution. Am i going crazy?



Sorry for the grammar. Im pretty tired, i sleep about 3-5 hours a night.

261,"YLDR: pointed out shitty roommates (f20&amp;m26) poor behavior then they tried to get my to buy a lost toliet plunger that I (f23)  bought.

I have already made a post about my crazy disgusting roommates (couple) which you can check out in my profile. And here's how crazy my week is. I'm flying out of US in two day and wont come back for a month and something, leaving school a week early while still need to finish three papers online.  In 48 hours I am helping a friend move halfway across the state which total of 15 hours, then having to go back to my place to move my stuff into a storage unit to avoid my crazy roommates. 

Long story short: I was gone for Thanksgiving week staying at my bfs and while I was gone two of my almost brand new bottles of liquor were consumed. I came back and confronted them, though didnt straight up accused, and they blamed on it on their friends. Later that weekend, my bf came and tried to make martini with what's left over and he had watered down vermouth. 

He was upset because technically those belonged to him but I bought it because I owed him. He confronted them that night and asked for reimbursement and they passively nodded in agreement. 

Fast forward to saturday, right before I leave my apartment I told one of them that I'm deducting 30 dollars out of my rent check to them because they were supposed to pay me for the bottles and they were okay with it although seemed upset when I left. Ten minutes into my 5 hours drive, this roommate texted me saying that they already bought the bottle and I should pay full rent and that I also need to pay the half of the bank fees for checks, when it's supposed to be split three ways. That's another story about them being lazy. 

Few hours later my bf texted them himself because it's technically his issue but I'm just voicing it for him. They agreed after he sent a long message. But they also included that I should pay for a toliet plunger that was tossed out. I dont remember a plunger being tossed out, second, I bought most of the household cleaning supplies, e.g. cleaning detergent, broom, vacuum,  bathroom trash can, toliet scrubber and plunger. And I do most of the basic cleaning and deep cleaning. So after my response, they sent a long winded message about how they spent a lot of moving and bought a toliet plunger and they couldn't find any in the house when I texted them, and suspected me keeping it in my room. 

Background to all this shit, they were very slow on moving all their stuff in. I put my square table out in the living for us to use because there was only my couch and my table for a few weeks. Also, i had two extra lamps, of which they are using one for their bedroom and one for livingroom. And they just escalated the phone conversation because I make an action to get reimbursed and pointed them out on their poor behaviors as adults. 

I dont have the time while helping a friend move but I'm packing all my shit into a storage while I'm gone. And maybe give a notice soon... still dont how to proceed from this point

262,"I had to put down the first of my two dogs last year, absolutely destroyed me and even through we had no diagnosis of what was ailing my dog it was clear he was suffering. He couldn't climb stairs, difficulties breathing, almost no teeth left, a huge sack of fluid on his chest, so I know what a sick dog looks like. 

Now my second dog is pretty old at 12 years, but he isn't in any pain whatsoever. I still take him for a walk daily and we throw a ball around the house all day, this dog seriously still has the energy of a puppy. His only issues at the moment are a minor heart murmur and his esophagus is starting to get a bit weaker which causes him some minor coughing about three times a day, but that's pretty normal for shih tzus his age from what I've read online.

My mom has been mentioning the fact we're going to have to put our second dog down ever since we put our first one down last July, she mentions this weekly and it's just depressing whenever she brings it up.

But tonight at dinner I learned she's planning to bring him to the vet right after Christmas to ""end his suffering"" during our next vet appointment . I have no idea what to do she won't listen to me, our dog is in fantastic physical shape for his age  and I know he's not nearly ready to go yet. What do I do? My dad seems neutral on this so far but I'm just completely appalled, she doesn't even want to see if there are any treatments or medications that could help with this coughing. (And even then its only minor coughing).

I need help on how to talk to her about this, putting my first dog down without a vet consultation really sat poorly the first time, and I don't think I'd be able to live with myself if I let my mom put down a relatively healthy dog too early.",17Dec2018,1
263,"So, my friend met a guy while she was in a toxic relationship. They were both in a relationship. They both ended their relationship around the same time. It seems they are thinking of getting together despite only speaking online without even a video call or irl meeting. My problem is the guy is known to say hard N words and other words like it. He also called his ex friend a ""cuck"" and his ex the S word because according to him, he knew his friend's girlfriend wasn't good so he went behind his back to seduce her get her nudes to prove it to him. Which seems plausible because there are so many other ways to prove that. There is also the fact that the guy she wants was friend's with her ex. And a few weeks after her 4 year relationship he started flirting and told her he loves her, not like, when they were semi flirting for a maximum of a month or two without dating or meeting irl. His ex friend (the one whos girlfriend he got nudes from) told me that this guy would lie to get anything he wants and he is a bad person never to be trusted.

&amp;#x200B;

Her reason for liking him is because he is nice. I tried explaining it's so easy to fake being nice online to ""have fun"" and leave it at that. With all the things mentioned above, am I overreacting to try and protect her? Or is she just naive? She easily believes people as long as they are nice to her.",17Dec2018,1
264,"Ok, so me and my 3 siblings have been getting our cousin a box of Cadbury favorites each for the past 5 or 6 years.

We're not going to take the high road and.get him something meaningful because of who we are as people. So we want to trick him into a false sense of security, only for favorites to fall from the sky as he wails and cries out in despair.

265,"Didn’t want to post this in r/relationshipadvice as it applies more to me. So I’ve recently come to terms that I (self diagnoses, just seems too convincing) have separation anxiety. My girlfriend of a month and a half has gone home from university for Christmas for three weeks. 

This is my first real relationship and the first time I’ve felt genuinely alone. I’ve cried more times than I can count over the last 3 days, and she’s now only been gone for 16 hours. I can barely eat and my motivation has dropped heavily. I miss her bad.

Therapy is out of the question for now so how would you recommend I get over it? I’ve tried distracting myself but I can’t stop thinking about her. If it helps I’m pretty sure I have separation anxiety because I stopped seeing my dad at a young age and my mother grew colder, pawning me off to my Nan. I’ve never had a lack of familial security and I’m scared of feeling awful until she comes back.

I really love her and took things far too fast, now I want to stop being a paranoid myself and re-learn how to live for myself a bit. Any suggestions? Thank you.

A couple of weeks ago though I was told that our works Christmas party was arranged for the same night, the boss is really looking after us with it and has said he’s even put me up in a hotel for the night if I go.

I’m in two minds about what to do, on one hand I haven’t seen my friends in a long while and feel like me not going on the bar crawl will put an even bigger wedge between us. On the other hand I feel like going to the work do will really put me in good stead work wise - a few of my colleagues have expressed disappointment in me not going and I’ve not been to the last few work events for one reason or the other.

268,"I recently moved to live close to a cousin.  We grew up together like siblings but the cousin was always kind of sadistic and toxic. 

My cousin is older than me.  I am in my thirties and cousin is in her forties. 

Cousin grew up and as we grew older we try to work to have a relationship. 

 Cousin married and has whole new life and personality away from our family of origin.  Cousin is not the same person with others, is pleasant and puts on this huge persona of positive.  With me,  cousin is still very critical and judgemental and I try to limit what I share. 

Parts of cousin's life are not positive, but cousin acts like she is the only successful member if our family,  acts superior to others and is very very good at her job and is extremely successful in her career.  

My job is a professional one,  I am no longer happy in it and want to leave to find something else.  

Since she always talks about her work,  I try to talk to my cousin to get out some of my thoughts.  My cousin will not hear it,  she just really limits me and if I text her something venting she won't respond if it's about work. 

I just stopped but since I have so much work stress right now and since she is the only person I have to share anything with,  I tried yesterday to share that I was seeking some other job prospects.  She immediately shut me down and I asked her about her work and she launched into a discussion of over 20 minutes all about her work stress. 

Right now my work situation is so bad that I  can barely make myself go to work.  I am though because I am responsible. 

It's other things too,  like I was sharing about wanting to buy a house before anything negative happened at my job and everything was stable and cousin has a ton of money and cousin has a big house and I was talking about my plan to buy a home and cousin was immediately acting like its not a possibility ever for me,  even though I spoke to a lender and it is.  

A lot if that,  like me sharing things that feel happy or keep me afloat and her just being like really separate from me and if not caring then just really negative and making me feel like I can't make good decisions or like I am planning for things that will never happen for me. 

I don't know how to share anything with her.  When I don't share she acts all supportive and I fall into the trap again thinking it was me,  that I was just being too sensitive and misinterpreting things. 

Does she sound like she has some narcissism issues?  

How do I interact with her?

She invites me over for fun at her house but then acts like its a chore and it's not fun at all.  It's all fake and awkward.

270,"There’s this guy I’ve been hooking up with that I don’t like. I have intrusive thoughts 24/7 about having real cheek-slappin sex with him and it’s really interfering with my work. I want to call things off with him but I want to have real sex with him.

Also, every time we physically meet it always leads to a makeout session/foreplay and it’s addicting just being around him and he feels the same way about me, we can’t get enough of each other. He says I have the perfect goddess body and I think he has the hottest moves, like he can give one hell of an erotic massage and knows how to please a girl.

But I don’t like him as a person and this wasn’t supposed to be long-term. I tell myself I don’t need to have sex with this man and I can just tell him it’s over, but I do need to have sex with him because it feels so good. 

The timing’s just been terrible but I feel like when the day begins it’ll finally be right. 

So assuming we’re gonna do it later today, how should I call it off? I want to call it off right after bc the only reason I was even involved is because he’s 10 yrs older and hot af. 

Also, assuming the timing doesn’t match up AGAIN, how can I just call it off? 

I feel like I’ve been making rly bad decisions lately to cope with stress and alleviate my depression and if I just call it off I’ll experience withdrawal symptoms and lapse back into a deeper depression, but I know that calling it off will be better for my overall health and having sex to solve my problems isn’t the best way to go about that.

My parents are the most financially stable they’ve been in their entire lives, and they can afford to do have nice things and spend money frivolously. My mom would (still) take the kids and go to the store or mall whenever we didn’t have anything to do. Then we’d spend the day blowing through money.

284," 

This life I'm living has gone WAY far enough. I'm done. Getting into fistfights with people. Me getting hurt and hurting others.

I've been financially struggling in Korea. I lived my entire life in US, and regret coming here. My parents wanted me to learn proficiently in Korean, and that's why I came here. By the way, My parents are Asians (not Koreans), and doesn't believe in psychological help. They wanted me to ""toughen up"". They sent me for another reason that South Koreans are ""tough and resilient"". Instead of ""wimping out"" like I'm doing, I should get to Korea. My ass. Fuck this horseshit.

So what the fuck's the point? I suffer from paranoid schizophrenic and bipolar disorder. I shouldn't have left to Korea.

But I had no money to defy, otherwise, I would get kicked out. I can't get any help in US. There aren't any services in US that could help people with people who are mentally incapable to get a job. If I don't have any money, I'm screwed. So I had to head to Korea to survive.

I regret it. Psychiatric and psychological services are poor here, and I can't get any sort of help. This drove me nuts, and started fighting with people, including my boss.

Now, in South Korea, laws are laxed so no troubles. People get into fights often here, and no one does a damn thing. But I'm a US citizen. Getting arrested in Korea means going to jail in US. I just know it by feeling. So If I get unlucky, I'm screwed.

By the way, I'm sometimes too scared to go back to US. My aggressive, paranoid behavior could land me 30 years in jail. I cannot go back.

Nevertheless, I should've never come here. When My parents told me to go to Korea, I shoud've committed suicide. There's no help here. There's no help in US.

I don't know what to do. I may have to get a lawyer and defend myself. Hell, I might have to serve time. But what worries me is what happens if I get deported back to US. Will I get programs for people suffer from mental illnesses get back on their own feet? I don't know.",17Dec2018,1

Then, the next day I got up before they got back and was just sitting on my bed scrolling through YouTube. A couple minutes pass and I hear them coming back, but then I heard them talking outside the door. There was some muffled talk about a “he” and then one said to the other “are you sure you didn’t do this for Solo reasons”, referring to me, and the other saying no.

This kinda just rubbed me the wrong way, because there’s something I did or something one of them think frequently enough to be dubbed “Solo reasons” that I don’t know about, and more importantly they didn’t tell me straight up and they still don’t know I heard that. What do I do?

288,"**A bit of context:** I live in another country and she lives in the US. We are dating for (almost) 4 years. On the first year, her mother would look our private messages and punish my fiancee, then on the second year she stopped, but i went visit her for the first time, and we had a lot of rules: **Couldn't use the same blanket to sit on the couch, couldn't sit on edge of the living room's bed, she took days off and would check on us every 30 minutes, wouldnt allow us to hug close to the bed, etc.** We were 18, fine. Then on the third year, everything stood the same but the check every 30 minutes, while her sister, when they were our age, could share blankets, lay down together etc. Don't know if its important, but her bf is also from US, unlike me.

I'm going to visit them again while engaged for the first time (we got engaged this year when she visited me), and another problem came up: While her sister's bf is over, they both sleep downstairs and when my Fiancee brought up that she wanted to sleep with me, a new rule was made: she isn't allowed to and now her sister also isn't allowed to, well, at least that's what was supposed to happen. Two nights since this talk, her sister is still sleeping with her bf and the mother keeps saying ""it's last time"" ""it's last time"", and my fiancee is being blamed for everything: Her sister is blaming her because she won't be able to sleep downstairs, her mother thinks what she is doing is fair and her younger sister says that my fiancee only tells me bad things and lies, saying that i hate her since i never treated her differently.

Her parents were always very controlling and a certain level of emotional abuse, but now this another level because i'm being blamed for stupid shit: ""I allowed your sister because her bf doesn't share sexual stuff on Facebook like him \[refearing to me, I literally only share funny memes, which some have some sexual context\]"" ""You need to settle down with him first"" We are already engaged. And finally, threatened to make me find a hotel room if my fiancee bring it up again. It's not the first time I'm blamed for things that don't make sense or that I didn't do, usually is her father that blames me for stuff though *(which I could give a lot of examples but don't think it's needed)*.

Hopefully it didn't get too confusing since i didn't want to say names.

Now, my fiancee is more than likely try to talk it out while I'm there, and who knows what kind of crap is gonna be said. I'm really tired of her parents being unfair but I'm also under their rules: **Should I help out on my fiancee's fight, talk her out of it or just let her fight by herself?**

289,"So we met abroad when we went to the same middle school for roughly 2 1/2 years. During that time I asked her out to a dance but nothing more as I chickened out any time afterwards to ask her to be my girlfriend. Later during our time a mutual friend went out with her and left her for someone with the same first name (which in middle school was like some of the most traitorous shit you could pull. That’s pretty much when we became best friends as I stayed with her and actually treated her well. However I had to leave at the end of the semester. 

She is the only one from that time I stayed in regular contact with and over time we’ve grown so close that we are practically twins. Two years ago (1 1/2 years after seperating) I told her that I am pretty sure I am in love with her. She had a boyfriend which I did not know about at the time and really wanted to stay best friends. Since she was still my best friend and I had not adjusted well to the new school she was also the one I dealt with about the rejection (weird dynamic I know). I think I got over her and we got even closer. 

Now about half a year ago I started feeling the same sorts of feelings I had then. We’ve met twice recently as she was in the area and, since she is planning to study at the same university we are planning to move in together. However our last meeting felt super awkward (at least to me) and I’ve been having anxiety the whole past weekend. This is all compounded by the fact that she adjusted way better to her new school and also made a second best friend who I now feel like I have to compete with despite him being a really nice guy. (She literally said that he’s angry at me for knowing her longer and so being close to her) I need some damn help because I am freaking out!",17Dec2018,1

I think it’s OK not to - im her maid of honor and we are planning her wedding together and I think she should not feel obligated.  I feel like it’s her day and she should be having the day she wants not the day she feel obligated to do.

Non union, more cash and more work. This particular position is supposed to be a mentored position so when one of the managers retire, this position is elevated to manager. I’m nervous because I just bought a house last year. I believe that I could rock the job, but am nervous because with a public transportation industry, if we get a new CEO he or she could re-structure. If we lose some funding I would be at the bottom of the manager list.

294,"My parent and I are similar in attitude, but couldn't be more dissimilar in worldview. I'm not a child, I'm a college student and while I still have a lot to learn I consider myself pretty well read in subjects I enjoy and major in, namely physics and chemistry. My parent has for years gotten into watching youtube videos and internet blogs about aliens and conspiracies treating them as fact. So when I am around and sit on the couch during visits she starts talking about them. Just tonight I listened to for about 3 hours about it (alien teleportation chairs, government coverups of Tesla's anti-gravity, the interaction of America in the child sex trade globally) and let her go on. Yet, if I try to speak when she takes a break during the 3 hours I am interrupting or she adamantly states I am wrong because I don't have as much ""life experience"" as her. She's right, I don't have as much experience being **ALIVE**, but I'm not stupid. I can't say that from what I've read it's impossible to harness free energy, or that its suspicious that she has this information with a small community but the world doesn't, because I'm less than 60 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is what I would really hope for advice with. **How do I engage with her in a discussion?** I love my parent, they are the reason I am who I am and nothing changes that. Still, I want to interact with them, but if I do it devolves into me being called an idiot child or their yelling that I'm a cocky shit, which I may just be.

Yesterday I found 2 socks wrapped in one under my bed. I did not recognize them. They are plain black small socks. I own a few black small socks but never wear them. I asked my boyfriend from who these are. He says he does not know. It were 2 different black socks wrapped in one. I was paranoid so I smelled it and it smelled like a flower ish that I don't recognize. However it was only one sock that had this smell, the other had no smell. I've thrown out my entire sock closet and smelled all of my (not used) socks to see if I could recognize the smell in my own, but did not found the smell again.

297,"So I'm a 22 year old. I'd say I have 3 main friend groups.  One of these groups are starting to annoy the crap out of me. 

Group 1) My clubbing mates - I pretty much exclusively do party/clubbing related things with these guys, they can all get girls and a few of them are extremely  popular

Group 2) My school friends - Catch up with them at least once a month, often have BBQs with them. These guys aren't exactly popular but they can get girls and are generally really fun to hang out with.

Group 3) My current main squad - All of them are a bit younger than me, they have similar interests and we have a lot in common. We hangout at least twice a week. I'll talk more about them soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first two groups treat me as their equal. We all respect each other perfectly fine. It's the third group that is giving me trouble. The first and second group are generally cool kids who I can have a laugh with, however I don't see them too often as everyone is busy at different times. I see the third group quite often and we all have fun together. I'd say I'm the most well known and most successful with women out of them, and also the least shy. Don't want to sound like a prick but I'm the ""alpha"" of the group (hate that term btw). They're a bit nerdy and all of them have something which makes them weird. Only myself and one other guy have been successful with women. I'm mentioning this because he is the only one who doesn't gang up on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

While out in public all of them are shy and reserved. They are scared to talk to girls and it's always me who communicates to strangers, workers, waitresses, etc. I'm always leading the group and whenever we are together I'm the decision maker. However, in our group chat on Messenger they are beginning to get annoying. They keep trying to piss me off by calling me names, they act childishly by posting their wins on 'Fortnite' then tagging me for no reason, they try to roast me all at once about shit that I can't change and the most infuriating part, whenever I do the same thing back to them they can't handle it. So they kick me out of our own group chat... 

&amp;#x200B;

It might sound stupid, but these acts get really annoying after a while. Can someone with a similar experience please explain why they're doing this? I find it odd because these are my nerdy friends, yet they are acting like a pack of wolves against their eldest member.

301,"So.  I have been a bit down the past few months for reasons not so important now. However, during my birthday I got no birthday wishes which made me a bit sad again and I updated my profile on a site where you can look for friends. Surprisingly a girl with a boyfriend contacted me in about me age and seemed a lot like me, she states that to me.

She had very few friends, but none of which were emotional or could speak about deeper stuff. Apparently she had one guy who was deep and stuff for two years but he left because his new girlfriend didn't allow him to speak to girls as friends.

Well the first day we emailed back and forth and it went extremely well, we both seemed a lot alike but at the same time not. We had an interest for each other(friendly). We then continued to chat on skype and it went very well there too. Eventually we figured out we could play minecraft the day after as we had that in common(liking to build, play and create). We played and spoke for 7 hours and had A LOT of fun. We both thanked each other for the time and enjoyed it.

The next day she was on straight away on the minecraftserver and messages me on skype and got back on right again. For two more days we did this for about 7 hours each day and she added me on instagram. Then one day she had to work she still texted me something on instagam, but not much more but I didn't expect too much at this stage.

The day after she worked but was eager to play when back home, we had fun and good conversations for many hours and she added me on facebook(I never asked for these things). We started typing there alot during the day and stuff.

The next day we played a lot aswell and had fun and stayed up late entering a very deep conversation about our lives, emotions and stuff. She told me she liked me and saw me as a friend already and she was afraid too get to know someoen since the last friend just left her all of a sudden. She was very nice and very happy about the conversation and thanked me for everything afterwards. She also thanked me for all the games and chats the days before.

Then shed had to work for two days late and she still wanted and said she was gonna write to me if I was still online. She texted me right when she woke up and wrote something nice sometimes and we had nice chats during late evenings. Although her messages now didn't seem to respond as much to my messages, but rather write a new one and less questions.(She stated several times she likes talking about deep stuff and really wanted to get to know me and know all the small and big stuff about me).

During saturday she had told me she should play as she finished working earlier, and wrote right away as usual when she was done working. Although it took 4-5 hours b4 we got to it, but we didn't play that much rather listening and talking about music and then she quit because I wanted to play I guess? and she was testing her make up. During this time I had to type a message about how I feel afraid of loosing her friendship every time we end a call as we had become such good friends quickly seemingly. She said I needn't to be afraid of that and it was okay to write that and stuff. She then said she could call me back up since she was just doing stuff on her computer, which I did. We spoke some until someone called her and she was away for an hour an I quit. Then we got back on two play during nighttime, but I was tired and needed to quit.

She said it was okay that I quit when I asked her and wished me good sleep and such. She also told me I seemed down(we spoke about this earlier this week) and I said i had been but mostly tired. I asked her if she was fine too, she said it was a bit of both at times. I then replied okay and said yes tomorrow will be a good day as she said. She only replied okay to me too after she asked so I didn't wanna overdo it.

She saw my message later that next morning(yesterday) and this day she didn't type to me though... So at about 1-2pm I DMed her on facebook and checked on her and everything seemed good. She answered me with many smileys and told me more than I asked for(which I see as a good sign of friendship), but she didn't really ask me anything this day. It also seemed before we went to sleep the day before she wanted to hear from me or play on this day. So she didn't say anything for like 1-2 hours so I asked her if she wanted to played tomorrow or today. She said it has to be today(yesterday) with a smiley since she was working late the next day. 

During this time I had a feeling something seemd different or off, like she had suddenly changed. I don't know why.. Even before the day started. So when I asked her that and she didn't say antyhing about playing for 2 hours which was unusual considering she was online and had the day off and seemingly not much scheduled. Then she replied, but I was feeling like something was different and afraid of loosing her I muted the conversation and got back 45 min later after her response. I then type ok :) wanna play now? She was online when I typed that but didn't answer for another  3 hours so I stated I was online and ready to play if she wanted too. Still no answer 13 hours later(not seen either). I also sent a gif about being sad since she didn't reply since I was going off to sleep. Waking up 6 hours later I tried on another social media texting asking if she was okay if I had done something wrong, 7 hours no answer. I got worried and saw her online on the gaming platform today(which means she is using her computer). I got no reply there either and she was online for more than an hour and usually reponds there within a few minutes of being online.

It really doesn't seem like the person she seemed to be from speaking and having fun with her. She cared a lot for me during these 9 days and spent many hours talking and stuff. She seemed extremely interested in me for all days except yestarday and today. Just like a switch went off with no reason.

Suddenly today I also find out the job I was probably gonna get which was perfect was given to someone else because of kind of a misunderstanding and I answered like 1 hour too late? 

In my whole life I had never met someone like her, and the feelings seemed to be reciprocated(she said so). Now I have nothing to live for. I got something amazing and it might be gone now. I think I'll be gone by friday, can someone explain what happened or what I should do?

311,"My cousin had a phone pouch that costs about RM130 which is expensive considering most phone pouchs cost about RM50. He got it because the online sellers sent have him the wrong colour and when he contacted them, the sellers just gave the right colour without asking for the return of the other.

He then gave to me because I said that I wanted to sell it and hopefully get some money and would split it with him. As I'm just 16 and still staying with my parents I just naturally brought it home and left it on a table. My father saw it before and already shown interest in it but I said that it was mine and I wanted to sell it and split the money with my cousin. He asked me to give it to him but I said no cause he wouldn't want to pay for it.

Maybe about 1 month later, my father picked me up from work during school holidays and I saw the phone sleeve just wrapped around his phone. I addressed it to him and told him that it's mine and he laughed and reply No, it's mine. We went on for awhile telling the other that it's our own and even though we kinda say it jokingly there was already tension and I knew that it was going to me a problem. I told him that he could have it if he paid RM80 and he said No, that it was his. He went on saying that what if I charge you for fetching you home right now or if I charge you for every dinner that I paid or every holiday. I quiet down knowing that he won't budge but was waiting until the time with my sisters so I won't be that afraid but I was curious on the inside.

During dinner I told my mum about it and he said that it was his. My sister defended me and my mum just kinda laugh about it thinking it was joke. As he walked up to pay for dinner I saw that he already wet the top half of the leather sleeve from leaving it by a cold drink. I was so angry that he didn't bother to even ask me before using it and already wet it and ruin my chances of ever selling it again. In the car, I told him to pay for it eyes about to water at the brink of crying he said no. I retaliated by saying I won't help the family plan vacations anymore while my voice was breaking (I know this sounds weird but I plan the family trip every year short or long I find hotels, flight tickets, places of attraction, restaurants all why trying to fit within the budget they gave me. Bear in mind I'm 16. I also help them with the almost everything needed to do on the computer even checking investments). My father shouted in hokkien that I'm crying for no reason and say that I'm good at asking him to spend money but not willing to give him the pouch (disregarding the point that the sleeve wasn't for me and that he didn't even ASK ME)

So here I am in bed writing this post while crying. I don't know what to do, I don't think I was the bad one in the situation and my dad doesn't feel any remorse at all and just angry that I cries over such a small thing.

313,"Hi. I shortly describe the situation: problem with pornography, drugs, gaming throught my 15 years of life. Dysfunctional family, wherein mother got divorce to my father, I was raised from my 8 years with only mother and grandmother care. My mother seem to be a bit of hypercaring and a bit of authorative. Grandmother more authorative, than mother, also tends to control everything in her life. My mother and grandmother are really anxious, the first one delves into obsessiveness about food, while the other one is dived into TV, like changing real life into the virtual one. I'm a bit of afraid of them, like they often want to know more about me, especially what I do. They see the world in the negative colors with fear. I tried to help them, but they don't need it and accept it, because they don't get it, like a strong thick wall in their consciousness. I tried to have lots of hobbies, but nothing reached in my 26-27 years. Like I live with them and if I try to move further — my will melts down to nothingness. Any wish to work is broken — I have no idea what I can do in my life at all and how to even earn money. Have problems with people, society, feeling like I'm an outcast. I have nowhere to go. Any try to get so money via job or some work tends to end quite fast. How can I quit this circle? I have a feeling that this family is cursed, like I can't get any further, if I don't leave them. How can I leave them, knowing that this vicious circle of earning money works quite bad? I have a feeling, that if I move from them forever — I will breathe with my whole lungs. But now it seems to be like I'm asphyxiating, like they poison me with their perdition flames or something like that (don't know how to describe it, so used some metaphores). As for me, it seems like going to the army can cure my problem. What do you think? Any advice? Maybe, it's quite radical, but severing ties is better, than just slowly rot, inhaling their fumes of their disintegrating lives, satiated in disgust, resentment and lack of any feeling that they live. Also, I'd add that throughout my childhood, up to 18 years I felt like it's not my house, like I'm not welcome here. They dry on their expressing of love and other emotions. I feel also lack of love — deep in myself I want their love, but I can't get it, because they can't express it. I tell them about this, but this thick wall saves them from my words. I ask also this because I know that someone dealt with this or still living with such problems, that's why I'm asking about something inspirational. Also, forgot to add, that have problems in intersexual relationships — occasional fear, like they will enslave me, making me suffer. All women told to me thought that I'm a weirdo or something like this, expressing it a bit of colloquially or via some insinuation, like women tend to do. I feel like I'm a slave to these people, not a son, grandson or something. I don't call them parents, almost often use only word ""you"", that's all. Hence, had a thought that if I forgot about them, like they nothing to me — I will be free, but it seems a bit delusional and fueled with pain. Sorry for my deplorable moaning, it's not that man's behavior should to be, but I'm weeping for help — sometimes I close myself in the bathroom to listen to some tracks, which fill me with a wish to release all pain, I kept inside. Also, had pictures in my mind that if I run away, quite away from them — I can start my new life, like cold Siberia or lands, covered with taiga, where you can show yourself a true image, freeing from stupid hyperanxious behaviors of my parents. They fear of love, life, etc. Like they are faint-hearted — they pretend to do good deeds, but inside they are helpless and weak, but wearing the masks of superiority. I'm quite confused about the fact, that they even don't understand what they are doing towards me. And when I tell them, they don't hear. What am I to do? I even have a bit of fear about logging in to social webs under my real name, knowing that some old women can find me, but also they granted me pain, so did I. Thanks for listening!",17Dec2018,1

I pulled up “Crab Rave” (the crab dancing song with ‘OBAMA IS GONE’ text over it) and we were dancing and when the beat dropped, I yelled (GF’s name) IS GONE! and took a video because it was funny as shit. 
Flash forward to last night, I broke up with my girlfriend and we’re good friends anyway. I show her the video because she’s best friends with MY best friend’s GF. I told her not to show anyone, but guess what she did.
She showed the GF. She called my best friend crying, saying shit like “how could you do that” and the like. Now my best friend is extremely mad at me and my female best friend is also mad at me and my ex won’t respond to my texts.
I know i fucked up big time, Please help.",17Dec2018,1
320,"Hi, i'm an 18; nearly 19, year old male from Australia, i was born with club foot in both feet and suffer from severe depression and Borderline Personality Disorder. As a result of this i have always struggled to maintain a job of any kind due to either the physical implications restricting my ability to even stand (E.g McDonald's) or my mental in-capacities forcing me to quit abruptly because being around happy people upsets me. I've been living out of home for some time now with my girlfriend, whom works in child care paying as much of the bills as i can with the money i get fortnightly from the government. Its reached a point where i genuinely need to find something to do, however the other issue is, i have quite literally 0 skills. None at all, i sit at home and play games such as league of legends or ARK all day because its all i have really other than the necessary cleaning or over-sleeping/ under sleeping. What do i do, or more likely, what could i do, I've looked into studying and even attempted courses in the past and pulled out of them all, at one point i even pulled out on the last day of one! I am stuck, genuinely stuck.   


Apologies if this isn't the right format for Reddit this is my first post ever. ",17Dec2018,1
321,"Reddit,
I found this platform in 2010, when I was 11 years old- I’ve been hooked ever since.  with varying degrees of involvement over the last 8 years (mostly, lurking), I’ve always been moved by the immense kindness of users in these communities. even moreso, overall astounded by the way this website has grown and flourished. 

Instead of lurking, though, i made this throwaway to post my story. I need any sort of advice and support I can get. (I have pretty thick skin, so I’m less than worried about comments that’ll get downvoted appropriately). 

but let’s get down to it. 

I’ve always known that i come from a broken home, and tried to remedy the effects it had on me to the best of my ability. there was severe domestic abuse (parent v parent), my brothers and I were manipulated into doing illegal actions on behalf of the other parent regularly. child endangerment, neglect, severe psychological abuse, etc. 

but I couldn’t ever shake the feeling that there was something more sinister than “two parents who just tried their best”.  

i was right. 

despite not participating in intercourse, or being  raped penetratively by my father- I am the victim of incest. careful with the associations, though-i by no means was a voluntary participant. 
I was certainly molested, possibly by extended family, also, not just my father. as far as I am aware my brothers have not been sexually abused. I was the target. 

as a child, I was always incredibly precocious. on top of that, i was also a “daddy’s girl”.  I was showered me with love, gifts, and affection throughout my childhood. Since he worked long hours, i was always thrilled to be able to spend time with him. 
As my parents marriage started to fail, they grew apart in all regards. My dad, frustrated with his sexless and loveless marriage used me as a surrogate wife.I became responsible for his needs for physical closeness, carried the burden of his emotional turmoil, and was subsequently triangulated into their relationship. 

my brothers were always taught to objectify from an insanely young age. my older brother would often participate in making lewd jokes about me alongside my father. he abhorred me for the attention and privileges I was given, but when we were young we had to team up to care for my little brother and ourselves, (even though we were constantly physically fighting and at each others throats). we were rightfully fearful that if we didn’t step in when needed, one of our parents would either kill the other. or would kill themselves. 

on top of that, my dad exploited his occupation as a doctor throughout my childhood and into my teenage years to continue this sort of abuse (my dad/mom were my primary caregivers, they “knew best” and didn’t trust anybody to misdiagnose or mistreat their precious little girl). it was not unusual when I had a medical concern, to have to bring it to my father. on many occasions, I had to strip down to be semi, or completely naked so he could “examine” me fully. because him, my mom, and few trusted coworkers were the only people I was allowed to talk with. I was trapped. oh, and HIPAA? yeah, there’s invasions of privacy/reading of our medical charts up the ass on my mother’s side. the few times we were allowed to see therapists, they were ones who my mother manipulated into sharing all of the kids most private/sensitive information. 

but I couldn’t make sense of this, i was too young, and it’s been locked away until now. 

despite being a bright kid, relatively accomplished, and always socially active I felt radically different from my peers.
I became increasingly defiant to authority figures across the board. teachers, my parents, athletic coaches, you name it. I’ve always been bit of a little shit, and that’s what everyone chalked it up to. honestly, so did I. 
but in reality, i developed a slew of somatic symptoms, body dysmorphia, depression, etc. I began to self harm, saved up my funds and had a plan to become a runaway, suicidal thoughts and ideation, and more all by my 11th birthday. 
In my teenage years, I danced with danger in any way I could to try to feel alive. I drowned myself in alcohol, illicit drugs, cut class, and became the best nomad I could while still being under my parents control. I’m currently a sophomore at one of the top universities in the country. I don’t know how I got to this point. I don’t feel like I deserve it. I should’ve died, or ended up in jail. I came close too many times to count. 

It wasn’t until just two days ago that I actually got to play connect the dots, despite them being lit brighter than canis major. my emotions are undoubtedly raw right now, and I’m in a bit of shock and denial still. 

For the moment, my mother is in control of all the finances, and my tuition is being covered by my parents. they’re still divorcing, and my little brother is in shared custody of them still. If I leave, I’m terrified of the kind of retaliation I’ll face. 

I’ll lose my older brother (22), because he only trusts my father after my moms abuse toward him. 
I’ll lose my little brother (15). I’ll have to cut contact with him and he won’t know why. but if we talk, I know my parents will try to manipulate him/use him to get to me. I can’t put him through that. He’s already been through so much. I’m looking for possible protective measures to put into place, and if I had the money I would absolutely lawyer up and petition to remove him from my parents custody. he does not deserve how horrendously he’s been mistreated. 

I feel like I’ve gone absolutely mad, and I don’t know if anybody will even believe me.  I can’t think of anyone to trust enough to speak with. the kind of abuse that my parents endured before raising us is multigenerational, and my extended family on both the maternal and fraternal side are inherently untrustworthy to go to with all of this. 

 I need to become completely financially independent, and I need to know what measures I can put into place to protect myself from retaliation on my parents end. I want to go quietly. 

Reddit, please help me figure out what to do next. I’ve never felt so lost, scared, and alone. ",17Dec2018,1
322,"These two girls sit next to me all period and talk about fucking each other for an hour and a half. Their behavior when they’re not doing that is cringeworthy. They both act like TV show characters and heavily dramatize everything thy say. They use weird tone of voice and shit and the way they say and do things is so fucking annoying. Think old Disney show like zach and Cody. What they say is funny in a show but in real life, nobody fucking talks like that. On top of that they’re incredibly loud I’m pretty sure most people in the classroom can hear them. I don’t want to hear these two girls talk about fucking each other all period and talk about their daddy issues. You would think for being 15 I wouldn’t mind at all but god it’s so unpleasant. Any advice on how to get them to stop?

323,"This is gonna require a ton of explanation, and I know both people in the story might see this but fuck it I need outside opinions for this.

I have two friends, we'll call them M and J. J has been my absolute best friend since I was 2 years old, and is more of a brother to me than my actual sister is a sister to me. I cannot imagine having grown up with anyone else in the role he played for me. Now M, who I live with, is a friend I met three years ago. I love her to death as a friend, but I know I've had feelings for her since the day I met her. M and I usually tell each other EVERYTHING. Like, jesus christ the word abbreviation TMI has no place in our relationship, we talk about everything. This includes sex down to the grittiest detail, and everything going on in our lives (including feelings). Now, J and M have known each other for almost a year, but a couple months ago the both of them WILL NOT stop telling me how into the other person they are. This is especially frustrating because during those two months I VIGOROUSLY stated how much I'd hate if they dated. Despite this they persisted telling me how hot they thought each other was, and despite me having feelings for M, I encouraged them talking alone and eventually hanging out, because I'm not gonna get in the way of them being so infatuated with each other. Frankly, M, who often stresses me the HELL out cause she often has issues (but I'm ok with it cause I care for her), has never been happier since she started seeing J. In the three years I've known her, through every time she was ditched on valentines day, to getting hurt (physically and emotionally) by exes, I've tried to be there for her because I care about her. I can easily say she's never been as happy as she is now.

Despite this, I'm fucking miserable. I feel unbelievably uncomfortable around J, who I can't imagine not being in my life. I just hate the idea that he is dating my best friend AND roommate, because I never feel like when he comes over to my place its to hang out with me. We would hang out maybe once a week or two cause we're constantly busy, but now he's been over atleast three times a week, and I know its ENTIRELY because of M. I know this is totally reasonable because he wants to see his girlfriend, but I can't help but feel frustrated because I feel like less than a second thought now. I totally get that he's not obligated to pay attention to me, and that's not what I want. I'm just infuriatingly sick and tired of feeling like a third wheel, because I can't feel like I'm friends with the only two people in my life that I see regularly. I just constantly feel uncomfortable around them ESPECIALLY because JESUS FUCK THE PDA. I GET IT YOURE DATING STOP MAKING OUT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PLAY SMASH BROS. 

Frankly I could've gotten over ALL these issues, and the THOUSAND others I'm dealing with, but last night (tonight? I'm writing this at 5 in the morning cause I couldn't sleep) it was the last straw. I spent ALL day with M, talking about how strange and frustrated I've been, kind of feeling consistently pissed when J is around (which is a feeling I hate and want to fix). Later, I kept offering to cook us dinner (its our dynamic I really like cooking ok?) but she kept refusing because she's ""going out with friends, not sure about the plans."" An hour passes and she says ""ok im going!"" and leaves. Two minutes later she walks back through the fucking front door with J behind her. 

I'm instantly absolutely goddamn livid at this point, even after I managed to put myself in a good mood most of the day. Obviously I don't say anything about that, I'm not just gonna blow up at them when my best friend just shows up out of the blue. I just went silent, and went and did my own thing.

I'm not mad they're dating. I'm not mad he showed up. I'm not mad my friend is more interested in seeing his girlfriend than me. I'm not mad M tried to cheer me up after she immediately noticed she upset me. 

I'm absolutely fucking furious because I'm such a goddamn afterthought to them, M thinks its 100% ok to lie straight to my face when telling me the truth would have made it ALL ok. I'm just perpetually angry, which is absolutely incredible because as a guy who struggles with mild Aspergers, I've spent my whole life teaching myself to calm myself down if I get worked up by something. I know what I've been feeling the past day is GENUINE RAGE at the only two people I care about in my life. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting ANYTHING to do with them now? Like, I'm debating packing my stuff and just staying at my parents home until I've calmed down or figured things out. I'd rather go live with my abusive parents than have to look my two best friends in the eyes because I'm just so furious. 

I feel like I'm leaving out a lot of important details**,** so if there's anything important I should add, ask away. I genuinely don't know what to do and how I should handle this emotionally. I haven't been genuinely angry like this in MANY years.",17Dec2018,1
324,"I have depression and anxiety. It's something I've been dealing with for over 5 years now, and it's the reason I haven't been able to keep a job. So because of that I've been sitting at home for at least over a year. I've known for a while that this wouldn't be sustainable forever, but I wasn't convinced I needed to change anything soon. Well for the past week or so I've been having pain. Flank pain, chest pain, lower back pain. I've had plenty of issues in the past. Gerd, infections, limb numbness/tingling. But those issues would come and go. This seems like it may be much  more serious.

I have been to doctors many times over the past few years, and every time I've gotten a single test it has cost my parents. We have insurance, but it never covers everything. I once got an endoscopy that was covered by insurance but my parents still had to pay $800. My dad works overtime every night to try and pay off the house. He's been doing it for over 25 years. I refuse to put another dent in their financial situation.

It has taken a lot of introspection to even get to this point. Depression has taken its toll on me. Most days my thoughts are foggy and aimless, but this pain has given me a moment of clarity-- this is serious, my situation isn't normal, and nobody in my family is in great mental health.

- My mother hates going to the doctor herself. If there's something wrong she reads health blogs and tries to come up with a natural way to fix it. Her treatment for most of my health issues usually involves essential oils, which I've realized do nothing.

- My dad doesn't seem like he actually feels much of anything. He does what he believes is right, but I don't think he has a sense of empathy like most people. I've never had a real conversation with him.

- My brother is in his 30s and lives at home too. Like me, he doesn't go out or socialize. Unlike me, he at least has a small online business and is able to afford his own food.

Going to the doctor doesn't bother me, but filling out the insurance information and seeing the look on my parents' faces when they get the bill does.

Lately though she spontaneously becomes a bit flirty and hyper friendly, when I walk by her shop she sometimes perks up and starts shouting and waving for me to have a good night, very out of character as far as I've seen.

329,"TL;DR : My brother got a dog, stopped taking care of it after 2 months and now plans on abandoning her. My mother who barely had anytime doesn't want to see the dog go to previous masters and plans on taking on her little free time to raise it.

&amp;#x200B;

6 months ago, my brother who's 21 asked my mother, with whom he lives, to adopt a dog. My mother accepted, but as a 61 years old lady that has barely any time for herself she told my brother that she wouldn't be able to help him raise the dog and thus that my brother would have to do everything by himself : feed it, walk it, play with it, etc ... 

My brother accepted those conditions and got a female border collie. The dog is really kind and loving, she however appears to have some kind of trauma that makes her afraid of everything, she can't cross the path of another dog without barking as hell. Due to that, my brother got discouraged (after 2 months !), and stopped caring about her, stopped feeding her and walking her. 

Since I just finished Uni and was looking for a job and a place to live, I had moved in with my mother prior to that story, and quickly the dog, that was left alone, started to ask me for attention, since my brother wouldn't give her any. She would come upstairs and scratch at my door so that I would come and play with her. Since I couldn't stand seeing this dog staying by herself all day, I started taking care of her ; she had to get her ovaries removed and I remained alongside her while she was recovering from her operation. My brother, during this time, left on vacation ... 

My mother, just like me, can't stand an animal being mistreated and took on her already little free time to help me take care of the dog, while we both were urging my brother to tell us what the heck he was doing, or planned to do with the dog. All we got were answer like ""do not tell me how to raise a dog"" or ""I'm busy right now I'll take care of her later"". 

This situation persisted for a bit more than 3 months. My mother would wake early to walk the dog and play with her and I would take care of her in the evening, sometime cancelling stuff so that she wouldn't be left alone. 

this brings us to yesterday. My brother announced that 1. He wouldn't take care of the dog, whatever we told him. That he had been fooled by his previous master not telling him how hard a dog it was to raise and that he didn't planned on spending any more money or time on her and that 2. He would call her previous masters for them to pick the dog up. 

Obviously my mother and I were crushed. We had taken a liking to this dog since we had been the ones raising her for 3 months. But this situation cannot carry on, I'm starting my new job next months and did not planned on staying at my mother's any longer. My mother on the other hand can't see herself abandoning the dog and told me she would keep it if my brother really plans on abandoning her. I know that she really doesn't have the energy or time to raise a dog that requires that much time for the next 15 years. She already falls asleep every evening in front of the TV, exhausted from her day. My brother, who doesn't study and is unemployed, already stated that he wanted nothing to do with the dog anymore. He's already a pain for my mother as he lives with her, is really messy and asks her, on top of food and a place to live, for 400€ a months for his own projects. 

I really don't know what to do. The dog will most likely get euthanized if we leave her go. But in the meantime knowing my brother, he will keeps avoiding his responsibilities...

333,"Long story short I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder and Anxiety and Panic Disorder - have done for 10 years. I take my meds, see my therapist/psychiatrist and mostly life is okay. 

However when I’m having an ‘episode’ or a really bad period in my life I confide in my mum and said best friend. But recently I have discovered she has started a blog about her own mental health issues (which in our 6 year friendship she has never mentioned or seemingly had issues with- we were roommates for 4 years and exceptionally close!). 

She makes a new post almost every time I confide in her and I really don’t even want to type this because I can’t bear this to be true - but her posts seem to mirror whatever my crisis is. If I’ve had a really bad day at work, a blog post goes up about her bad day at work. If I have a panic attack in a supermarket, the same thing happens to her and a blog post appears. 

At first I thought that I was a bad friend and too focused on myself that she felt she couldn’t confide in me. But then I realised when these posts went up she wasn’t always doing as her blog said, for example she hadn’t been shopping, she was having a movie marathon. She also once tried to get prescribed anxiety medication from the doctor who refused, referred her to a sort of over the phone counsellor but she didn’t want that, she said she wanted medication like me and that it was unfair.

We’re super close, we lived together for 4 years v. recently and apart from an odd bad day she doesn’t seem to have any mental health issues. We’re very open and discuss everything, she’s been on my BPD journey with me and she’s never expressed any kind of concern over her own health. 

I finally snapped a month ago when unfortunately I ended up in hospital following an overdose which thankfully wasn’t successful. It was an ordeal to be honest and I leant on close friends and family for the support I needed to recover. Almost a week later said best friend puts up a post about feeling suicidal and how she sometimes stares at a bottle of medicines and has the urge to overdose. It hit home when she posted a sentence which was exactly something I had said to her the day after my overdose. I think she may be using the things I tell hers as content for her blog.

The worst part? She sent me to link to this specific blogpost about an overdose, whilst I’m still laid in my hospital bed and asked for my opinion. It really messed with my head. I barely spoke to her after, it’s been a few weeks and I’ve avoided calls, left messages and texts unread and I really don’t want her in my life. But she’s my best friend, a girl I’ve been through thick and thin with. But I just can’t bring myself to talk to her. 

What the heck do I do? 

TLDR; Best friend seems to mimic my mental health issues on her blog, made a blogpost about overdose approx 6 days after I overdosed. Doesn’t suffer mental health. Can’t cope with speaking to her! Help! ",17Dec2018,1

336,"This may be a common thing here, I dunno. Really I stumbled onto this subreddit by Googling  “reddit I can’t help but feel I get overshadowed”. 

But hear me out for a while. 

It all started last year, when I joined a Discord server for a particular hobby. I was invested. Talked a whole lot in there, fucked around with mods/other regulars busting my balls yadi yadi yada, you know the drill. 

Then sometime later, meet-ups IRL happen, I made ~~a friend~~ an associate and suddenly I find myself getting into a spider-web of associates. 

Things were well until I managed to fuck everything up. 

How exactly? Well... I have this really bad habit of pranking people/pissing people off unknowingly. 

I somehow managed to paint myself as a xenophobic asshole that one time and got pretty much my entire web against my ass. 0-100 real quick.

I mean, did I deserve it? Totally. I’d punch that fucker myself. 

Well, if a silver lining exists, it’d be the fact that I barely managed to un-fuck myself outta that situation. 

Fast-forward like I dunno, 6+ months and I find myself being a walking dead. 

I just couldn’t be bothered by everything, so I started skipping classes but not enough to fuck me over (debarment from examinations) and I barely put in effort in all my projects. 

I always did the bare minimum for projects and I can’t be arsed to think of anything that could go the extra-mile. 

Then I realized that I really hate the course I went in. 

I went for Electronics Engineering because I genuinely thought I’d be doing something computer related on the hardware level but lo and behold, I had to learn C, C++ and Python. 

Fuck. Programming. 

I had to learn all the different sensors and stuff, what their specs are, their usage etc which just doesn’t interest me one bit. But hey, I’m here for 2 years, I’ve made my bed, now I sleep in it. 

So where does the inferiority complex start, you might ask. Here it is (sorry for the story of my life, I thought it’d bring context to my character). 

After all that, I went back to Discord and I found that pretty much everyone grew and specialized in something. 

2 guys were far ahead of everyone else in audiophillia. 

1 was pretty much the “it” guy for Fountain Pens. Hell, one of the stores call him “小第 (little bro/young lad, in Chinese)” because he’s been in that store ever since Primary. 

1 can dance, really, really well. 

1 bascially destroyed my Steam library with his. 

1 was pretty much a prodigy, in 2 months he knew the basic and advanced shit of any hobby, for him, it’s Fountain Pens, Audiophillia and Mech Keebs. While I still struggled with the basics. 

And the last guy? He has a girlfriend.

All of that basically potong’d my stim (cut my dick off in Malay) and now I scurried to find hobbies where I can be damn proficent in so that I can “earn” myself a seat on the round table but even then I get outgunned. I stupidly tried to go back to the hobbies that everyone has in common only to find myself outgunned even more. 

Fountain pens? 1 has a Kwaeco AL-Sport/some other pen, the other has the whole vintage shebang. 

Audiophillia? Pretty much everyone had a WM1A and at least $800 cans/in-ears in some point in their lives while I’m still rocking Monks and my phone.

Do I blame them? Hell no, I like these dudes. I blame myself for feeling this way and which is why I’m asking here for advice to stop feeling this way, at the risk of my associates reading this because all of them know my reddit handle. 


TL; DR: I feel like the MC in a show where the supporting cast absolutely outshines the MC.

337,"So basically, I'm a really shy 17 (almost 18 years old) guy and I've never been much of a ladies' man yknow? I seem to fuck it up somehow and as a result never had a girlfriend until about a year ago. Thing is, it's an online relationship. Now I know, I know, ""online relationships aren't the same"" and ""it's risky"" or whatever. I've met her like three times by now, and we both recognize it's not the same. Anyhow, she's just turned 17 in November, so both of us are thinking about college. She lives 8 hours from me, and I've already made it clear I'll go to whatever college as long as I'm with her because god damn it I love her yknow? Like, she's the only really good thing in my life right now and she's helped me through a lot. We haven't had sex, partially because we don't see each other regularly and also because she's a little bit religious. But the thing about her being religious is that she's super laid back about it, she doesn't mind that I'm not religious and doesn't hate gay people etc.

BUT

This is why I'm posting this here. Around Halloween time, I presented the idea of doing something for Halloween together where she is, but because of a slight miscommunication I ended up driving 8 hours only to find out she had to do a lot of studying and homework and such. (Or that's what she says, I'm taking her word for it.) Ever since then, it seems like any time I try to talk to her, she's got something to do. I feel real powerless because I can't do anything more, the ball is in her court but it seems like she's quitting the game y'know? I don't want to fuck up what I have with her, because she's the perfect girl for me in almost every single way. A few people have told me to break it off, but I'd never be able to do that, particularly because I just don't want to. But I don't know a lot about love or life, so I was thinking maybe someone on here does or can at least give a little insight.

339,"It's a bit of a long and complicated story so pls bare with me. I had known this person since about mid 2014 through mutual friends, but never really got to know them well until January of 2017. We talked almost everyday for about 3 months and that's when I thought I had developed a crush on said person. I've never really been the best with relationships or commitment so whenever I used to develop a crush, whether it was obvious to the crush that I liked them or not I would tend to be a bit pissy and push them away. Another thing that went along with the not being too good at commitment was that I would 'talk' to someone for a month or two, realize I didn't really like the person, but just the idea of them and because I wasn't good at communicating my feelings I would just end up ghosting them. \*I realize that's a shitty thing to do, and I've avoided all types of romance until I can get that figured out.\* Since this person was semi-flirty with me I thought I ended up catching feelings for them but kept it under wraps up until May of 2017 because I wasn't sure if they had a girlfriend or not even after asking some mutual friends of ours. I developed a fuck it attitude and finally told him I liked him (I later realized I didn't) in May of 2017 to which he said he wasn't really sure how he felt about things, which I respected but we still continued to talk. In late June he told me he liked me and we talked up until what I would say August considering how crappy Sept-Nov was for.....us? lmao. I knew in the back of my head that I didn't care for him in a romantic way but I grew super paranoid and weird and projected that onto him in a way. I always asked him if he was sure he liked me other stupid things etc etc. Throughout May-Nov there were things he said and did that also fueled my paranoia or whatever you wanna call it but that definitely doesn't excuse my constant badgering and doubtful comments. I had two best friends at the time who were also pretty close with this person and they always told me how weird they thought it was we had been talking for such a long time but nothing had really happened yet. I was told after we stopped talking in November that the reason nothing happened between us was because he was still in love with his ex (the girlfriend I wasn't sure about) and with her while telling me how much he liked me and how he only wanted me etc. I pitied myself for a little while after this but then realized that this was just a much more extended version of me liking the idea of a person and it was for the best that things ended, even if it was in a messy way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that's all over the place but it'd be much longer if I didn't try to summarize it the best I can, but I think that me saying I had feelings for this person when I really didn't messed things up for us and I can't help but think about them from time to time and what a cool friend they were to have around. I know people change and they could be nothing like they were before but I've been contemplating reaching out to them for a couple months now so we could talk again. They shot me a message on a platform they stopped using before I could respond but I have another way of contacting them. My big fat ego constantly has me unsure of whether or not it's worth messaging them or if I would look like a dummy and just move on. ",17Dec2018,1

349,"Not sure if it's the correct sub to ask about this but here it goes.

So I have a friend group of 4 people, including me. This one girl in our group, let's call her A, always makes a point of mentioning her other friends and what plans she has with these people. She will just randomly start talking about her other friends and what she will do with them (going to the cinema, to a cafe, etc) even though it has no relevance whatsoever to the conversation. Just now, I was asking her if she's available for a meet up during the Christmas holidays, and after we settled on a specific date, she absolutely had to specify that she was going to go to the cinema with her other friend that day as well. Stuff like this happens all the time. And it actually really hurts me/the 2 other girls in our friend group because we were always there for her when she went through depression and really shitty episodes, while her other friends never really helped out in the same degree. Yet, she always mentions them to us, as if to make it seem that we aren't really *that* important to her, and that she has many other friends that she can hang out with and have a good time. 

This is one of the many problematic things she has done in the past years, but this thing irks me particularly much for some reason. Am I wrong in reacting that way? Is it normal to mention your friends to your other friends all the time? I'm just basing my opinion on my own behaviour - e.g., I try not to tell about my plans with other people to my friends. Like if my friends ask me if we can hang out on a certain day and I already decided to hang out with someone else, I won't say ""oh sorry, I'm hanging out with X that day"". I'll just say that I have an appointment/something else to attend to. Idk, it just feels wrong to me because I feel that if I said that, my friend would feel left out and feel as if I prioritise other people above her/him. And I won't ever tell my friends about my specific plans with other people out of the blue, when not even being asked for it, e.g. ""I'm so excited for tomorrow! I'll go out with X and Y and we'll go to the bar and then watch a movie!"", especially when X and Y are people that my friends have never met and have no knowledge about. This is what A does quite often. Like what's the point? I feel like the only point of always mentioning your ""other friends"" is to make your actual friends jealous and create this image that you're independent and you don't need them. I feel like it's analogous to talking to your boyfriend/someone you fancy about all the hot and funny and cute dudes you're going to hang out with, in order to make your boyfriend jealous and seem like you aren't desperate or something. 

So yeah, am I wrong in interpreting my friend's behaviour that way? And if I'm not wrong, and if that is in fact a shitty behaviour, what can I do to make her stop?",17Dec2018,1

My dad pays for all my insurance stuff and they give us some money for food.

We believe in the separation of church and state (I won't get into the nitty gritty of politics). So with that said we believe marriage is not just a legal contract but a spiritual thing.

We want to say vows and make that commitment without the government or signing any official paperwork.  We want to do all that eventually but we feel we are ready to commit to each other now even though our finances are not in order.

So I have a few questions:

1) does this make sense?

2) what are your thoughts on it?

3) does anyone have any experience with this? Any advice?

361,"So to give you a little background I work for an events company, we work long shitty hours just as you’d expect, but everybody is salaried and overtime doesn’t exist. I’ve been there 12 months now, I’m the longest serving member of crew that’s not office based. 

So during the football (soccer) World Cup we were working 70-80 weeks for the whole World Cup, plus 2 weeks either side. During this time it worked out that I was earning around £4.99/hr, way below the minimum wage. My colleagues and I made our manager aware of this fact, but were met with “you’re contractually obliged to work when the business needs you”. This obviously went down well and ever since we have been taking note of our hoursVpay and making management aware. I wouldn’t say we have been awkward or disruptive in our conversations, but we have always stuck to our guns and made sure we’re heard. 

Fast forward to last Friday (14th) and we have a big company meeting (20 of us). The management are all happy and excited because they are giving us a 10% pay rise (good news!) but they are also bringing in a layer of management, team leaders. The guy they give the job to has been with us 2 months, no previous industry experience and is for want of another word an imbecile. 

Now they then take us in to 1-3 (director, manager, team leader) meetings to discuss the changes. Meeting goes well, appreciate the pay increase and introduction of the team leader. Right at the end of the meeting I’m told that I would have been given the job, had I not been in “a gang of disruption”. 

This annoyed me so much, I’ve worked myself to breaking point for this business and this is the thanks I get... had I not been pushing and campaigning for fair pay I wouldn’t have got a pay rise for my colleagues and I, had I just been quiet and got on I would have been promoted. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is should I just ride it out and wait for the team leader to sink out of incompetence, or should I leave and use my skills elsewhere?

369,"I thought about r/relationship advice but this seemed more broad.

Quite frankly. I have found an amazing individual. She is fantastic and is really all I could ask for and then some. Unfortunately. I am fixated on the past. Her past. My past. And I can’t accept that I deserve happiness like anyone else. It’s laying beside me every night. It kisses me good bye every morning. It makes sure my tummy is full. And it’s not enough.

I’ve come to the realization that it isn’t her. It’s completely me. Truthfully. And it pains me to think I could be the bringer of my own demise. I’ve felt love before. Or feelings, but this is genuine. On another level. I fear so much of losing what we have that I intentionally self sabotage and for some reason (I’m assuming because she obviously loves me) she sticks around. 

Neither of our lives are perfect, who’s is? But this is really my chance. We just signed a year lease together despite my multiple efforts to run off or break up for an hour or two. Only for me to go begging back. I’m just so afraid to put my best foot forward like I did in the past with other individuals who treated me awful and took me for granted and this woman, she never has. Never does.

It’s been almost a year now, that we’ve been together. I’m just hoping maybe someone’s been here before or just had that fear of taking a chance.

She told me I shouldn’t live in fear. And that I’m so used to things being bad that I can’t help myself and I find comfort in uncertainty and I can honestly say she’s right. For me that’s the norm and she told me it’s unhealthy. And again, she’s completely right. I always tried pointing the finger at her and came up with outrageous excuses or fights. And I’m done. I really want to stop.

I don’t want to be that person anymore. I want to grow and develop and become a better individual. For her. Myself and our little ones involved. I’m tired of not believeing I deserve happiness. I can honesty say I love myself and what I do. But I have the mindset that no one else should, which doesn’t make sense. 

I’m just terrified that. I’m not enough and that the other shoe will drop. Or she’ll just bolt on me, but god if she hasn’t yet. I am one lucky motherfudger. More importantly she’s told me if she wants happy or feeling it, she would’ve never signed the lease or let me get close to her kids and vice versa. It really is all on me.

Note. I’ve never cheated. She hasn’t. I just always ask things like, “are you sure you’re happy. Do you really wanna be with me. If you wanna leave it’s okay, we can make it mutual” and things like that. I always assume her ex’s are better than me even though I don’t even know them, but obviously she chose me and we’re here. And I cannot see thag for the life of me. 

I just fall into a pit of disappear. And she doesn’t deserve it. The kids don’t. And I want to believe I don’t. I love this individual. And I love myself. But when I’m with her I face a fear I’ve never experienced in my life, the thought of losing someone her. And My lack of acceptance is literally our downfall. And I know it’s not to late.

My mom has had a problem with this for almost as long as I can remember. She could be a poster child for the opioid epidemic. For a long time she was basically able to get as much as she wanted until she was at max dosage and asking for refills more frequently than they allow. Her doctors have obviously noticed after decades of her lies and games and have taken to restricting.
I know this is the right thing but it hasn't helped. It has culminated in fraud, theft, and more lies. I myself began to take xanax (as needed for panic) and she constantly stole them. She would replace them but inevitably always steal again. She has also done this with vicodin. Now I live alone (22, in college) and she is forced to at least ask me but when she visits she always raids my drawers and cabinets. It is also now a routine for her to finish her script over a week early and then beg our family and the pharmacy and her therapist (who she sees once per week) for more. The rest of my family doesn't care and believes her because they don't particularly believe in ""western medicine"" and have all fucking been addicts too.

Last week, my dad told me, she was unconscious on the couch, her pills everywhere on the floor. In a stoned haze she had tried to kill herself but passed out before she could and spilled them all. Shes lucky her dogs didnt eat them.
My dad is an alcoholic and also incredibly weak willed. He will not intervene. He doesnt know how and honestly isn't interested in finding out. And yes we have tried everything with him. (AA multiple times, individual and family therapy, intervention, fucking etc etc). 
But my mom is a whole different case. She knows it all. She was in the medical community for 25 years before she had to stop working because she is disabled. And I feel so helpless. She knows it all and still lies to herself. She has watched my father kill his liver all these years and cried with me over his addiction but she cant even see her own now. And she always always blames the doctors. She has checked herself in to rehab twice only to leave after a day or two because ""they're not helping me"" and I dont know what happens in there so I cant call her on it.
Please I just dont want to get a call soon that she OD'd. I'm working with my therapist as well but I didnt know it got this bad until I came home for the holidays a few days ago. She is in terrible condition. Shes without pills right now and cant drive or hold a conversation or be in public due to her severe panic disorder. But I'm scared for when she gets the pills again.
Any advice is deeply appreciated. I'm just a scared daughter right now.

373,"This will ramble a bit; please bear with me. 

I live in the US. This morning, I woke up with my heart racing. I’d just had a nightmare about guns. It was a dream within a dream. I was sleeping in the dream, and still in it, I woke up to my sister and brother-in-law having a discussion. They were talking about how a prominent sports celebrity “got shot in the head” with a gun and how “it’s ridiculous...”. I then woke up in a cold sweat. 

I feel this is a hint of my actual fear of guns. While I am lucky to live in a progressive, somewhat safe area of the US (as long as I stick to certain parts of town), I can’t help but wonder if this fear will follow me around forever. I know enough about war being from a war-torn country, but somehow, I’m more scared here than I was there. It’s like here in the US, you don’t know when an incident is going to happen. I’m not actively fearful of the daytime, and go on about my days, but this fear comes out at night, when I sleep. 

I don’t have money to afford therapy right now, if this is a solution. 

I did want to move from my current city. I feel I’d have peace of mind doing so just by moving somewhere where guns are outlawed. Sometimes I feel I live in a false sense of security, and want to get away front that to a real one. 

The thing is, other cities in the US that I’d consider moving to for other reasons, are more extreme and more likely to have more harsher views of guns and gun control. I’m currently in DC, but have considered VA as a decent alternative. Going back to my home country would mean I would have less freedom as a woman. I have considered Canada, but the long wait times at hospitals don’t make sense time to. My only option of a country I’d legally be able to move to and work in as a US citizen (on a working holiday visa), is Australia. But I don’t want to move for the wrong reasons ((see my other post on r/IWantOut about why I want to move also)[https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/a6lr1l/i_want_to_leave_my_city_but_i_dont_want_it_to_be/]). I want to know if it’s ok to be feeling this way. 

I feel like such a wussy sometimes but I do feel I have a reason to feel this way, especially with my background and the things I’ve witnessed in my occupied country. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? Is it alright to want to move for safety concerns and for this reason? And maybe even if you had suggestions on very safe cities I could move to for peace of mind, that would also have jobs, I’d appreciate it. ",17Dec2018,1

A bit of back story — I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis (uterus gang, woot woot), and had surgery to remove a cluster of cysts that were twisting my Fallopian tubes (I think?) a few years ago. 

Fast forward to now, my periods have gotten worse, and I believe I’m exhibiting signs of early stage breast cancer (nipple inversion, pain in vagina, weight loss, a lump in my breast that hasn’t gone away). 

I’ve been underemployed for the past three years, and in that underemployment, uninsured. I’ve had to pay tax and medical bills out of pocket, which has me living paycheck to paycheck. 

I was supposed to be getting a promotion to a FT position that would allow me to be covered under my company’s insurance, so I didn’t sign up during open enrolment, but in a cruel twist of fate, that promotion has been pushed back to January 1st, and I can’t put this off any longer. 

What should I do? Are there any clinics/hospitals that will see me and bill me post exam? Are there any insurance options available to me while I wait for my company?

376,"... I've started to get concerned.

I live in a very big city. Moved here 5 years ago with only a few bags.  Now I've just started at the perfect job for me: great location, benefits, and yes: the money. My relationship with my gf is going amazingly well.  Apartment is perfect. I finally ""fixed"" my emotional issues stemming from my childhood. My depression is almost non-existent. Why am complaining?

Because although I have this perfect job, I still feel as though I'm an imposter. This year, as a whole wasn't great.  And I have had a lot of loss over the years, so this year's losses didn't hit me as hard.  And software engineering can sometimes feel like an arena where studying all of the moves still somehow makes me feel like I don't know anything. I know what I know...but because I didn't go the traditional CS/great college route, I get a LOT of ""oh really"" looks.

If something happens with this job, then all of this may crumble...including the relationship that I want.

Any advice on how I can stay focused and keep all the things I have worked so hard for?  Thanks in advanced.

I worked in politics before going to law school and have been offered a great opportunity working for a member of Congress. The pay isnt the best of the best but for where I would be located it's a decent salary. 

If I left law school and took the job I'd probably have the opportunity to go back to law school if I decided later on I truly wanted law but there is no guarantee I'd get the same scholarship or get admitted the second time around. 

If I decided I didn't want law, I have no idea what I'd want to do after this job. Job security isn't the best with the job (only 2 years guaranteed because of elections).

381,"Hi all - I need a recommendation. My boyfriend (24M) has not been to the dentist in about 4 years. He brushes and flosses daily. He currently has insurance through the state and just went in this morning for a new patient appointment. When he came back this is what he told me:

1st they did not do any cleaning or treatment.

He was told that he needs to have all 4 of his wisdom teeth removed, due to overcrowding. He also chipped his top incisor tooth a couple months back. It hasn't been causing him pain, it's more cosmetic than anything. But with this they told him that he would need a root canal?? Next, they said that he's currently on track to develop gum disease and that they were currently around a 5 or 6, when healthy gums measure at a 2. Told him that a deep clean is necessary, but that his insurance will not cover this and it is $1000 and a 4 hour procedure spread across 2 appointments.

They didn't do a regular cleaning, which surprised me. Apparently they wouldn't do it because they are recommending a deep cleaning. They had him fill out paperwork, took x-rays, had someone look at his mouth and then sent him back up to the scheduling desk to get him on the calendar for all of these recommendations.

My question is: Is this normal? I've never gone to the dentist and walked out without getting a regular cleaning. It seems questionable to me and like they are trying to take advantage b/c he hasn't been to a dentist in a couple years and he has no clue what he is doing when it comes to medical appointments.",17Dec2018,1

383,"For the past couple years I've been traveling the world. I spent the majority of my time in Bulgaria. I'm an American. 

Bulgaria was the happiest time of my life because I had an amazing girlfriend, social circle, lifestyle, etc. 

Eventually they wouldn't let me stay any longer so I had to go (immigration rules). It was so painful and I was quite depressed. 

I kept traveling, then returned back to Bulgaria when I could several months later. Again I was so happy. Eventually me and my girlfriend broke up... she was my everything, so amazing. 

The relationship was incredible but unfortunate circumstances we weren't prepared for is what tore us apart. I desperately wish I could go back in time to prepare us for the dangers we were about to face so we could handle things differently and stay together. 

Now I'm back ""home"" in the USA. I feel so disconnected. I don't belong in this city anymore. I'm even slightly disconnected from my family and I feel like my friends &amp; ex-girlfriend in Bulgaria took better care of me when times were tough. 

I have an internet job so I can work anywhere in the world. That's great until you travel the whole world, trip out, feel like everything is a matrix simulation, and have no roots anywhere. 

A part of me considers moving to Bulgaria... like fully immigrating to be with my friends there. It was definitely the most ""at home"" I ever felt in my life. 

The other part of me is so shocked at the idea of it. I never thought I'd be considering leaving the USA at this age! The other part of me just wants to settle somewhere in the USA and hopes that if I put in the same amount of effort into building a life that I did into Bulgaria I'll be just as happy. 

I just can't tell whether *Sofia, Bulgaria* made me happy or I was happy because at the time I was there I had the best apartment, most money, best friends, and best girlfriend of my entire life. 

It feels like I lost everything. Back in Phoenix, even now, it all feels like a dream. Everything is so trippy. I need to leave Phoenix and settle in a home rather than this nomadic craziness that I've done for the past couple years.

393,"I've been battling this for a long time, and I just need to get it off my chest. I was in a relationship for 10 months ago, which ended almost 2 months ago and I feel like my self esteem has turned to nothing as a result of it. We first started out as friends with benefits (however he knew how I felt about him, and he'd told me he loved me despite not wanting an official relationship) in which my partner treated me incredibly poorly, and was obsessive about another girl. Essentially, despite telling me very sweet things, he treated me like a sex object and took no interest in my life outside of having sex with me all while constantly going on about how amazingly interested and talented this other girl was. 

We stopped seeing each other for a while, but eventually he got lonely and asked for me back. I stupidly took him back, being the pathetic fuck I was. Turns out he'd also exchanged nudes with quite a close friend of mine over that time.

As a boyfriend, he was okay. He was committed to me and didn't chase anyone else; in his defense, he had genuinely changed since getting with me. There were still problems though. I was sickeningly insecure and convinced he was gonna leave me for someone better. Everything I did, was to please him. I picked up his hobbies in an attempt to relate to him, changed so much about my lifestyle to make him think I was better. I constantly compared myself to the other girl, and felt so unattractive all the time. He never wanted to have sex with me once we got together (mainly a result of him feeling insecure about his own body and excessive masturbation/porn use), and that made me feel like total shit. I always felt like sex was a performance for him, and like I had to compare to all the girls on Reddit that he'd saved nudes of. Also he never made me orgasm, lol. No guy ever has. Another guy I dated before him would basically finish, and leave me in bed on my own while he cleaned up, and then come back and chuck my clothes at me telling me to get dressed.

Eventually the bubble burst, and I had a very severe depressive episode lasting around 2 months (self harm occurred), where we fought constantly about everything. I truly despise the person I was back then. I was a pathetic, neurotic mess. Eventually, I ended things with him because I couldn't bear the pain anymore. Sure, he'd given up porn and our sex life improved but the damage was done. I already felt like an unattractive blob, and I realized that the attention and good treatment he was giving me wouldn't make up for the past hurts and so I ended it. 

I feel so much pain and shame from the entire experience. The pain comes from hating my body and comparing myself to porn, and the shame comes from how I behaved in the final few months of the relationship. I was bordering on emotionally abusive to him. I'm better now that I'm out of that shitstorm of a relationship, but I fucking hate and resent the shit out of him for ruining my self esteem. We live in the same corridor (we're college students), so it made getting over him so much harder. I had a very severe episode of anxiety recently where I depended on him for help with work a lot, and I hate myself for that. I don't want to be dependent on him anymore.

 I know this other guy who I feel is so great and who I connect with so deeply, but I'm scared to do anything with him in the way of romance, because I'll fuck it up cause I'm so damaged. We're so similar in so many ways and helping him with his depression (albeit quite mild), makes me feel valued in a way that I never felt with my ex. I probably can't date him though, because I'm damaged goods and would screw everything up.

I wasn't allowed to leave the house throughout my youth so i never had social experiences until i turned 18, and finally started to build my own life from zero. I worked hard to understand my depression and anxiety, and never had a problem with them since... Until now.

So i'm going out with this girl, we've been friends for almost 2 years, but i only now started feeling for her and so i told her i like her more than as a friend. She appeared discomforted by that and barely got to say ""we should keep seeing each other"" and ""i'm not rejecting you"". To which i replied a simple ""ok"" and hopelessly set a date for this week.  
Now, i know nothing's going to happen between us (haven't mentioned it, but it's obvious) and i am completely fine with that, i just don't know what to do now because i keep thinking about her even though i know for a fact it's not mutual and to top that i get anxiously ill every time i do.

Due to this, I've started to think of how I would imagine life after death would be, and that was a great mistake. Everyone surely has their own interpretations of life after death, and as for me I came to the conclusion that is in the form of being asleep but not conscious at the same time. It seems peaceful, but thinking about dying itself (and the usual things one who's dying would worry about like things they'll leave behind, etc.), made me deathly scared of, well, death. 

&amp;#x200B;

At least once a day I get those thoughts and how scary it would be that I wish I never thought that way. Only then do I realize the importance of religion and how it helps people cope with such massive uncertainties. I've only got to think this way for a year and it got stronger recently.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to ask for advice on how I should approach this. My atheistic (or possibly some other way) of looking at life and existence itself is having conscious and unconscious repercussions to me. I don't know if I can blame it for me being demotivated to do anything in life (because what's the point, in my point of view), but at the same time wanting to do as much as I can before I die so I end up with no regrets. Should I consider believing again in a higher power? Thanks for any advice.",17Dec2018,1

I tend to base most of my social life off the tenant of treating others how you want to be treated. I'm afraid that I may be smothering my friends with attention but if I stop replying to their texts because I feel like I'm annoying I then worry that I'm ignoring or neglecting them.

405,"So I'm not really sure how to put everything in my head into words, but I will try my best. So my sister is 25 years old and as the title states I think she is dealing with some pretty severe anxiety. She's been out of college for 3 years now and has yet to even get a job. She's extremely intelligent, but just sits at home because she is afraid of the world. So I'll start by saying that whenever any big change comes up she almost completely shuts down and refuses to move on. For instance when she was moving onto high school from elementary school she was convinced it would be the worst thing ever and that she wouldn't be able to do it. When she came home from her first day in 7th grade though she had completely did a 180 and said it was amazing. A similar thing happened when she went to college. She was terrified to move (I know most people are nervous about going to college, but this was different.) Once she acclimated though she absolutely loved it. She rarely came home, and was super involved in things at school. I'd say it was one of the best times of her life. Me as well as my family are pretty certain something happened her senior year which I think broke the levy and her anxiety peaked. Currently we are at another big change in our lives. We just finished building a new house and are ready to  move. My sister however is refusing to even step foot in this house. She says it will never be a home to her and she has poured too much hatred into it to ever consider going through the doors. My parents have tried and tried again to compromise with her and she won't budge. My parents as well as myself are at a loss as to what to do. My mom over the summer tried to get her to go to therapy which she went every week, but to no avail. The therapist tried to get her to see a psychiatrist, but in turn she just walked out. She refuses to believe that there is anything wrong with her and that everyone else around her is in the wrong. She accuses my parents of building a new house just to destroy her childhood. My sister believes that she is completely normal and that everyone around her is basically out to get her. My mom thinks that my sister will twist conversations in her head to make them fit her beliefs. As I kind of stated earlier she won't do anything to help herself. She won't go on meds or any other form of treatment. I've been dealing with depression for years now and I recently went on meds. The change I've felt is absolutely incredible. My parents have tried telling my sister how much treatment has helped me and she doesn't believe people can change like that. She doesn't believe that I feel a million times better. This is really putting a lot of stress on my parents, and now that I'm back from university it's beginning to take a toll on me. I want to get her help and I wish she would accept that she needs help. She keeps coming up with crazy ideas like she is going to just leave. She doesn't have a job to support herself or even a car to go anywhere. My mom is concerned that she will do something crazy that will end up hurting herself. I'm afraid with all of this upcoming stress that she will eventually have a mental break and do something rash.  We all have no idea how to help her so I thought I would post here and see if any of you can offer some advice. ",17Dec2018,1

3. Told to shut up, stop asking questions and do something because someone said so, bend over and check the color of my socks, called 'A.D.D', and forced to hear other crude language.

4. Told to not talk to upper management without prior approval, despite them having an open door policy and being very thankful for what I'd brought to their attention, which could hurt the company if left unresolved.

5. Micromanaged by my actual manager (P.).

6. Given a Team Lead who has more time to micromanage me (C.).

7. Forced to spend two months trying to do (and then re-do) a single task which is literally impossible in a technical sense. To date I've written 28 pages of documentation, produced two Visio diagrams, four Excel spreadsheets and re-done this unreasonable task four or five times since 10/5. Last week (12/14) I was informed by Chad that Pete may make me work all through Christmas week if it isn't finished, despite it having been finished five times according to his specifications.

8. Repeatedly ignored by management, both in-person, via IM and e-mail.

9. Asked to come into the office and work while out sick.

10. Talked past and over on an hourly basis each work day.

11. Given tasks other than those tasks management prioritized, only to be asked why the prioritized task isn't done.

12. Given no time to complete company required training that I'm currently seven weeks past due on.

13. Worked two 20 hour days, only to be asked if I was in the office the following morning.

14. Interrogated about my father's terminal medical condition by P./J. and made to feel really uncomfortable.

15. Reprimanded for CCing stakeholders from another team relevant to the e-mail.

16. Refused the necessary information and/or access I need in order to do my job effectively.

17. Harassed for leaving the office after working in the office for eight hours with no meetings on my calendar or urgent tasks which required staying late on those days.

18. Laughed at for asking if a co-worker and I could attend a local Information Security event that cost \~$100 to attend because 'it cost money.'

19. Asked to keep a list of bi-weekly tasks, only to be later asked to keep a list of daily tasks.

411,"High school was too easy, I never studied but got good grades. I would wait until the absolute last minute to do any and all essays/ homework and would still get an A. 

I had an excellent memory. I skipped a grade and 2 years of math, and I finished most of my classes early and became dual enrolled. Even the college classes were a breeze. I graduated with the 3rd highest gpa without ever breaking a sweat or aiming for it. I spent most of my time playing video games wanting to go pro but never knowing how to work hard enough for it.

 I got a $200,000 scholarship to an Art school named SCAD and this is where everything fell apart. I had never taken an art class or attempted to do anything related to art. But my counselors and my Dad and my friends all told me it was a really great school and that I should go. So I went. 

This school completely beat me down. I was surrounded by so many artistic, creative and talented people. I felt like I didn't belong, my work looked like a 4 year old did it compared to everyone else's and it was embarrassing. I hated myself for it. I stayed up all night constantly working on something just to erase it and start over in frustration. 

I dropped out. My grades were fine and my professors we're understanding but my self image and confidence had been shattered. I ended up getting seriously depressed, contemplating suicide. I would just overdose on my ADHD medicine and it would be all over, easy. 

I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. I abandoned my job, and didn't tell my father until much later. My father, who raised me by himself and made so many sacrifices. I was ashamed and I hated myself. The only thing that saved me was my girlfriend who was with me through it all. She and I have been dating for 3 years and this is the first relationship for both of us.

I've never had many friends, I tend to push people away and try to do things alone, mostly because I have some need to do things correctly or not do them at all. I have 3 friends who have been slowly growing apart from me because they have school and work and we don't see each other much anymore.

I've been unemployed for almost a year since SCAD happened. I've looked at Jordan Peterson's lectures and purchased his books and I have thought and planned everything out. I know exactly how to succeed. I just can't take the first step. I can't seem to get hired. And I hate knowing I'll have to spend so much time at a job just to get paid and survive. I want to pursue my dreams and use the advantages I have to do something meaningful.

It's excruciating. I wish I had someone to blame, someome to hate, some rival to keep me motivated. But my only enemy is myself, and I'm too good at talking myself out of doing what I need to do. I hate it so much. I hate myself, I hate the world because I know in the end none of it matters. I'm scared of failure but I know it's the only way forward. I've talked to therapists and they couldn't help very much and they didn't seem to realize what my issue was. I told them everything. I'm very aware of my failures, I'm no longer aware at what I'm good at. I have no skills that seem useful. My memory has faded, I've gotten more out of shape, further feeding the vicious cycle.

I've talked with my father and my girlfriend and they both want to do what they can but neither can help. It's up to me and I can't convince myself to do anything. I've applied for jobs everywhere and visited in person. But because I abandoned my job no one wants to hire me. I'm in debt from SCAD, and I feel like a total failure.

TLDR; I've never faced failure until now. I can't pick myself up, and I've had literally every opportunity given to me on a silver platter. I've planned everything out meticulously and I know exactly how to move forward, but I'm paralyzed from fear of failing again, something that I don't feel I can recover from a second time.

414,"Okay, So I need advice... I feel like I already know it in my heart, but just need to hear it elsewhere I guess.

I recently re-kindled with a long, lost ex. We dated back in high school and briefly into college. We broke up because he wanted to experience other things. Understandable. We didn't talk for 10 years. Now we are in our thirties and met up again randomly when my work sent me to his current state on a business trip. We had dinner and had a good time. We went out again on the next night and also enjoyed ourselves. I ended up spending the night and falling asleep in his arms, but otherwise nothing happened. The next day I had to fly home. He took me to the airport and we said goodbyes. 

The past month we've texted non-stop. Not in an obsessive way, but just a nice way. Some days he'd initiate it, other days I'd initiate it. We called and talked on the phone a few times. We sent snap chats and pictures to each other. One night, I will admit I got pretty drunk and we sexted. We continued to talk afterwards. He admitted to me: ""I like you"". I said I liked him too. It seemed like we were building up some sort of relationship. He planned to come home for Christmas and we made plans to hang out and see a hockey game together. But then it just all stopped.

We sexted again on a Thursday night, had some fun, said goodnight and then he just disappeared.

The next morning I texted him ""good morning"" and never heard back. Assuming he was busy, I didn't want to bug him, so, I waited. 3 days went by with no response. I decided to text him a simple 'hey"". He did respond but it was very short lived conversation. Not the usual flirty conversation. He asked how many tickets I had to the hockey game, and disappeared again. Now it's been another 3 days with no contact. 

He is supposed to fly in on the 20th (in 4 days) and we are supposed to go to the hockey game on the 21st. Should I reach out again? Ask if I did something wrong, or if I came off too strong? Or should I just assume that he's no longer interested and move on? ",17Dec2018,1
415,"I'll keep this as to the point as I can.

I graduated university this year, and jumped into the first job that I was offered. It was okay, but I hated corporate sales and the 9-5 doesn't sit well with me - I make an average part time wage working on my own business for a couple of hours a day so when I was working full time it meant I never really had any time to myself, even when I got home. Seeing as I have savings which could feasibly support me being out of work for three-four years, I left a few weeks in to pursue other options.

My plan, suggested by my fiancée, is/was to get a part time job to subsidise my own work to make a liveable salary, thus giving me the security and consistency of contracted employment whilst still having time to work for myself (She's a trainee accountant and earns good money, relatively soon to be *great* money, so me earning below average isn't really an issue, as long as I can pay my share of the bills). 

Explaining the next bit would take some time so I'll bullet point.

* Grandmother died in September
* Parents moving into her old house
* Parents going to rent their current house to us at a very fair price PCM, then just give it to us outright after 20 years.

Okay, so here's the actual situation (so much for keeping to the point).

During the stretch where my only income is my own business, I'm not making money. I'm only dropping about £200-£250 a month from my savings, occasionally less, which isn't really doing any damage, but I don't know how long it would take me to find a part time job that ticks all my fussy boxes.

2 weeks ago, I took an interview for another 9-5 job in sales (ugh), because it was scored for me by a friend of my mother who heard I was looking for a new job, and I mainly attended out of a feeling of obligation. Today I've been offered the job. It pays well, and given that it's very close to my soon-to-be house there wouldn't be a commute, which would still give me time to work my own business and have a bit of free time in the evening. Thing is, it completely disrupts the life plan me and my fiancée had in place.

**What do?** 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Offered a job that completely derails the life plan me and my fiancée have in place. Can't just do it for a couple of months to top up my savings then flake out bc a family friend convinced their boss to give me the interview and I don't want to be a dick. Is it worth it for the money?

I do not think it is a good idea to have this baby. Seeing that I am self employed and was pretty much sick my entire last pregnancy and I am so unsure if I will make enough income to cover my rent and take care of my kids. 

Abortion is something I never said I would do but I am seriously considering it. When I think about my toddler I feel like I will be robbing her of a sibling but keeping it will also be robbing her of quality time with her parents.

430,"I have a history with ED and I have reason to believe he might be struggling as well. His friend once accidentally mentioned to me he hates eating in front of people, he has really sporadic eating habits (lots at one time, fasting the rest of the day). Its definitely worth mentioning that his BMI is 17. He eats so much sometimes he is in pain. Its hard to watch. 

I feel like I need to talk to him about it but our only communication tends to be texting or phone. He's also two years older than me, and we're also Long Distance right now due to my schooling. I'm going to be able to see him for ONE day at the end of december but I really don't want to fuck up our reunion by confronting him about eating. But I think it's important at least for me to talk to him in person.

I find this an extremely difficult topic to bring up and I don't really know how to talk about it without breaking down. I don't have a good relationship with his family so I can't talk to them about it either. I'm also worried that I might be wrong. Things like this are really difficult for me. The limited amount of time is an added level of difficulty. 

Basically I want to know how to bring this up in a way that won't... idk... generally fuck things up. He has no idea abt my eating disorder past because I just hate talking about it. However, I absolutely will not in good conscience let this slide. ",17Dec2018,1
431,"so i was classmates with this girl in high school and well, you could say that i liked her from the first time i saw her.(i was 16) (i didn’t realise that i liked her in more than a friend way until later tho). before i met her i had started to question my sexuality but i still thought i was mostly straight, so when i, a few months into my sophmore year, started to think that i had a crush on her, i denied it for quite a while. eventually tho, i realised that i had a huge crush on her &amp; couldn’t deny it anymore. however...she got into a relationship not long after i realised my feelings for her &amp; i was devastated but obviously i couldn’t do anything, and i didn’t. 
but, the thing that made everything so much harder was that she would be very affectionate towards me. she’d touch my shoulders, my cheeks, run her fingers through my hair to get my attention. she’d walk up to me and hug me from behind in school. she even did this when she saw me in public. she’d hold my hand/s while we sat in the classroom, she’d compliment me. let me sit on her lap and lots of other affectionate things. it drove me crazy because while i loved when she would be all cuddly with me, i knew that i couldn’t do anything. i couldn’t touch her cheeks or take her hand because she might interpret it as me liking her and find out about my feelings for her. &amp; i didn’t want that. i also knew that she wasn’t interested in me &amp; i would never ever try to flirt or anything with someone who’s taken, no matter how in love i am. so i just let her be affectionate with me whenever she wanted to but never begged her for it. 
she wasn’t always nice to me though. she’d lie &amp; ignore me and make me feel like shit. and then when she felt like it, she’d be affectionate again. i felt awful but i was so in love with her that i just wanted to be close to her. so even though she sometimes treated me like i didn’t exist, i’d still welcome her with open arms the times she actually paid attention to me. 
i haven’t seen her for over a year now and i haven’t kept in touch with her. i thought not seeing her would make it easier to get over her but it made everything worse. i think about her constantly, i still overthink it all and i’m just sad all the time. 
my friends know about my feelings for her but they don’t seem to really care anymore and i’m not out to my parents. 
so... i’m sorry for a long post but i’m wondering if anyone has any advice on how to get over her? how to get over all of my feelings for her?

So, I this very flamboyant friend. We have known each other for 2 years now. Last year during finals, he called me saying that i should bring him food to the library because he hasn’t eaten all day. When I said no to him. He went on a rant saying that he will never hang out with me and that he is done with me. Well we moved on from that. Well he did... He never apologized and I was an idiot for still trying to be a good friend. Now, he is always asking for rides and always trying to size me up. Anyways, I am a computer Science student.

439,"Hey guys, 

Just wondering if anyone has any advice or can relate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I have multiple hobbies and activities. Weightlifting, Jiu-Jitsu, Piano,Soccer,snowboarding,girlfriend, and taking over my families manufacturing company. Then TON of sub hobbies I will delve deep into. Music production,meditation, aquariums, camping hiking, boxing, board-games, video games,nutrition, etc...etc..

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, anything I like, I delve deep into and get obsessive.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I feel if I am not the absolute BEST at my hobbies/activities or if I'm not consistently training in all of them to be at the top of my game I get really stressed. Like, physically, mentally stressed. I feel as if I am falling behind, and If i'm not the best then there is no point in doing them.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend pretty much ALL my time practicing or training my activities. I absolutely can not just rest or not be doing something. I constantly feel like I'm wasting time. 

&amp;#x200B;

This becomes tough when my work day lasts from 8-6pm then jiu jitsu then im home at 9pm need to eat, shower, hang out with my girlfriend,practice piano and make the most of the rest of my time before bed 1.5-2hrs later. Rinse and repeat the next day, every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

I will often double down on tasks to use my time as efficiently as possible. I.E. Be practicing piano or soccer in between weightlifting sets. Practicing piano or sheet music during any free time say, waiting somewhere or going on road trips. Or looking up jiu jujitsu techniques.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend a huge, unhealthy chunk of my work hours researching/trying to refine my knowledge of my skills and hobbies. I obsess and need to use every single second doing something to refine my skills. Even walking from point A to point B at work I will be practicing foot work for soccer or something of that nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this obsession takes its toll on me. Everyday trying to squeeze every last second out of, and I am exhausting myself. I often don't feel like doing other activities that will steal my time away from getting better at hobbies.

It especially affects my work performance where i REALLY need to be focused. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is mentally and physically draining. And, having so many activities and wanting to be the best at all of them makes it impossible to really focus down and be the best at any of them.  However, my main hobbies I just love too much and cant see myself cutting them out of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is probably a super random issue, but its bugged me for a long time now. I wonder if anyone has experienced something similar to this? And if anything has helped?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks Guys!

444,"TL;DR: Brother-in-law currently facing sexual assault charges. My family don't believe anything happened as he's ""not capable of it"", but I know he is capable of it as he came very close to assaulting me a few years back.

Background: my brother-in-law is an, all around, horrible person. Since he and my sister got married nearly 18 months ago he has beaten my sister, assaulted a police officer and had his name put down at the father of his ex-wifes 3 month old child. He's currently 1 day into a 3 day court case where he is accused of sexually assaulting a female taxi driver.

My whole family, sister included, put down all of his faults to him having a drinking problem (He is currently doing court ordered AA meetings, due to him assaulting an officer). Not one of them believe he assaulted the taxi driver since she ""isn't even that good looking"" and ""He's never sexually assaulted anyone before"".

Here's where I come in. Two and a half years ago, when my sister and her now husband for engaged  they came to visit me in the place I was staying over summer. We all drank but, given I was only 19 and fairly new to drinking, drank far too much. I can't remember leaving the bar but I remember getting home. My sister went to bed fairly quickly but meme and her then fiance stayed up talking.

After a while he started getting flirty, putting his hand on my thigh, sliding it up and groping me. I pushed his hand away multiple times and in the end he pinned me and focfully kissed me. I managed to push him off and quickly went to bed. I've never said any of this to anyone. I felt awful and guilt about it and didn't want to loose my sister.

Now back to the current court case. Things aren't going well for either side of the argument. There is little evidence for either side, all of my BIL's witnesses have been proven unreliable so at this moment it's pretty much her word against his. When I saw him today a finally confronted him about what happened a couple years ago and he insists I was the one who made a move (proof that I didn't is I'm lesbian as hell). 

I'm not sure whether I should tell my family about what happened. I doubt it'll make a difference in the current court case but maybe it'll make them realise that has not the perfect person he all has them believe. I also know that my sister is in a really bad place right now, and I don't want to loose her because of this. And if my family think I'm lying (quite possible since I've kept my mouth shut for over 2 years) then I'll loose them too?

This is starting to eat me alive and is causing a lot of arguments with my family since they think he couldn't be capable of sexually assault, but I know he is. I just need advice on what to do next.

Thanks in advance",17Dec2018,1
445,"My husband and I (F) have been married for seven months, but we've been together since college. He's pretty normal and our relationship is very strong. He's always enjoyed drawing and is very good at it, but a few weeks ago I found some drawings while cleaning his office that sparked my interest while he was at work. It was of a buff turtle/man hybrid wearing a pair of briefs with hardly any room left for the imagination. At first I was amused, but I grew more concerned. ""Is he attracted to this?""
When he came home I thought I'd not grill him about it, but I noticed right after dinner he went straight to his office which is unusual. Normally we'd watch a movie or we would sit on the couch and he does work on his laptop and I go on my phone or something. I was upset that night, but forgot about it after a few days.
Now flash forward to last Wednesday. My husband left a notebook on the kitchen table and I opened it to check if it was for work so I could bring it to him. The first few pages was just some sketches of what he normally draws (trees, rooms, buildings) but after that it was MUCH more... explicit. I was shocked, immediately closed it, and set it back where it was before.
When he got home that night he saw the notebook laying there and looked really flustered. I pretended not to notice.
Later that night while I was getting ready for bed he said he wanted to talk to me. When I got out of the bathroom he was sitting on the bed and asked me if I looked in the notebook. I felt extremely sorry and bad for invading his privacy but I told him the truth. He went on to tell me it's just a ""hobby"" of his. He told me that he's in these online forums for people like him and that ""it's not sexual at all"". That really pissed me off though, how are you supposed to take THAT as not sexual. I tried to be understanding and nodding, but when he told me he had some sort of alter ego called Peego the turtle that was a county clerk (???) I was hysterically laughing. He became defensive and I apologized still trying to contain myself. I felt bad about it but how do you not laugh at something so bizarre?
He's been distant and neither of us have brought it up since.
See, I don't mind my husband being bisexual or even having some weird turtle fetish, but I'm scared for our marriage. Has anyone ever had something similar happen to them? And how do I confront him about this? Do I even confront him about this?",17Dec2018,1

I was expecting it to be a fun night out. But the night just made me feel awful and unsettled. 

One of his friends was a misogynist asshole. He talked about women as if they were disposable (including his girlfriend who was there part of the night), bragged about his penis, discussed cheating as if it weren’t a big deal. He was bragging about how he decided to not date this one woman because “she blew the fuck up” in size. No one thought this was disrespectful or strange, including my fiancé. lt feels for his colleagues it’s normal to think and to talk like this. (He works in a mostly male field with a lot of young men). 

l know that he can’t control who he works with. l don’t want to overstep boundaries and tell him how much this behavior really bothers me because what is he supposed to do about it? Change his occupation because of other people’s behavior? Not work well with other people because of how his fiancé feels?

This whole weekend, based on the overall dynamic of that night, l’ve been super insecure. 

lf that’s how his buddies feel, and they’re who he’s around all day, whats going to happen?
l usually don’t wear makeup and am heavy at 209 lbs. And, if my fiancé is constantly around the “leave her if she gets fat and ugly” misogynist rhetoric, what will happen to our relationship? l love and trust him. But that kind of attitude can’t be healthy for our future marriage 

As ridiculous as it sounds, l’m worried he’s going to wake up one day, think I’m not thin or beautiful enough, and leave or cheat. 

He reassured me that he finds me beautiful and attractive.

452,"Hello. This is probably going to be quite a long post so I'm sorry about that.

I've known this girl for quite a while now. We were best friends in elementary school (I also had a crush on said girl) and all that but we lost each other in middle school.

We're now in the 4th year of high school (age range 16-17), and 3 months ago we started chatting and talking again. It was cool and all but after a while I noticed something was off. 90% of the time she was the one talking. I made all the questions and there was no apparent interest in my life whatsoever, also without me reaching out first she just wouldn't talk to me.

This is where I decided to say ""I won't send the first message anymore, there's no point because... "". I tried explaining the problem to her (she said I meant a lot to her so I preferred this method) and all she said was ""this is normal, friends don't do this kind of stuff"".

I was pissed and frustrated and we stopped talking. This was one month ago. 

2 weeks ago I noticed that she looks at me in class. If you hated someone certainly you wouldn't look at them 3-4 times a day (or maybe you would?) especially if you need to turn around to look at him/her (also, I guess that after the first week you would stop, she hasn't yet).

Then a week ago something really fucking weird happens.

*Basically in class we have this rule of ""no phones allowed"", so we need to deposit them in a box near the teacher*

The teacher orders us to get our phones to do a web based quiz. Fair enough. We get the phone and do this quiz. For the first time in a while she talks to me and asks my score.

She then is ordered by the teacher to take all the phones and put them in the box, which she does.

After a while the bell rings, and the teacher goes away. She then stands up, grabs her phone and MINE and she brings it to me.
I didn't ask for it, like at all. She just did it spontaneously. Even more surprising is that I'm on the other side of the class, it wasn't just a quick thing to do.

A day later, we're in this conference and she is sitting behind me. She then joked and we talked a bit there too.

A day later (yes again -- this was friday btw), she spontaneously walked towards me and we started talking again.

Today we didn't talk much, and to be honest she seemed to be ignoring me.

Now, here is where the title starts to make sense. I want to send her a message, but I'm afraid that our 'argument' would become useless. I explicitly said that I wouldn't reach out and here we are. 

So, I can either reach out and send a message, thus implicitly saying ""hey you know what? I like being treated like a floormat as long as you message me"", or wait for her message, which might never come.

I don't know what to do, I am fucking confused and this is killing me. It's killing my focus, my motivation, my will to live. Everything is falling apart while I wait for this message that I'll never receive.

I am confused as she didn't just randomly bring my phone or talk to me (she is well known to ignore people), she definitely had some kind of reason. Now, whether this reason is ""I just want to be your friend"" or ""I want something more"" is unclear to me.

If it's the former, sending her a message will just prolong the pain which is a mistake I don't want to repeat. I don't know what to do. Like at all.

He mentioned to my partner that some time ago he was in trouble with the law but he had changed. I feel like he’s lied, 2016 isn’t “some time ago.”

She was a bit freaked out after her friend discovered all of this and asked my advice. I said let me sleep on it, after asking if she felt safe tonight. I said don’t confront him about it.

What advice would you have for my partner in this situation? 

I’m obviously worried that he has a violent side and no issue with attacking a woman. He has done it before.",17Dec2018,1
457,"Alright because I don't know what to do, so I've turned to you all. here I am, at your mercy. 

The story is that my fathers favorite game, hands down is Civilization 5. In fact, Civilization is his favorite series. We used to have a Dell tower(the family computer), which was separate from my gaming pc. He would play Civilization 5 on the family computer and although it would run slow, he still very much enjoyed it. Then that computer died and he was no longer able to play it. We got him Civilization for the Xbox but it was different and he said he didn't like it. Now the only way he can play it is on the Ipad or on my Nintendo Switch. Yes, it's mine I saved up my money from my job and I purchased it outright. 

There would be numerous problems from him playing it on the Switch, first is that he plays for long amounts of time and he would get mad at me if I wanted to use it. Second is that he does not know how to use the Switch at all. He would constantly ask me questions about how to do stuff and I know he will not listen to my answers which means I have to repeat myself multiple times. I know he will call me out to change the TV to the Switches' input at least 10 times. I know for a fact that he does not understand what a type-c charger is as he has tried to charge his s6 active(micro-USB) with my s8(type-c) charger. My father doesn't even know how to turn off his phone ringer. The third is that I'm afraid he will break it. He has also said numerous times that buying it was a waste of money and that I should have saved the money. if it is wasteful, then why the hell should he get to use it? 

The problem is that he put Civ 5 in his wish list and my grandmother bought it(she told us what she bought him), so now I have no choice but to share it with him, teach him how everything works and stop using it as frequently. I know that sharing it with his means I'm doing everything for him and that if he can't figure out how to do something, he just won't do it until I get home, which means all the time he could have had playing it will be wasted while he waits for me. Example: He forgets how to turn it on when he wants to play at 9:00 am. He waits until I get home at 3:30 pm to ask how the hell to turn it on. Instead of having 5+ hours of play time, he will just wait until I do it for him to start playing, and meaning I won't get to play on it. 

I know that it is mine and so do my parents, but when I ask him for it he is just going to get pissy at me. When my dad starts to use it, I'm afraid that the whole family is going to treat it as their own personal device. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Can you guys think of anything?
Is there anything I can do or do I have to just accept my fate?",17Dec2018,1
458,"I just had another fight with my mother and brother and I’m sick and tired of everything. If I wasn’t so scared to go to hell I’d throw myself off of my balcony window and kill my self just to teach them a lesson. I hate them so much right now. 

Today I had a fight with my mum as one of my driving school classmates invited me out for a drink but she denied me. I asked her why I couldn’t go and explained to her for the 100th time that I wasn’t 3 years old I was 18 and she was being unreasonable. I’ve graduated and I’m off to college abroad in a few months yet she continues to baby me. She told me that I wasn’t allowed to go because my classmate would “harvest my organs” if I did. When I then challenged her and told her I could just walk out of the house she said fine and I asked her for money. She gave it to me and I walked out (knowing full well I wasn’t going to go I just wanted her to trust me enough to let me go). When I returned 5 minutes later my mum laughed and said that I had cost my brother his subway. Apparently they had made a bet about wether or not I was going to return and when I did my brother got angry and called me a dumb idiot. He then said I shouldn’t talk to him. When I told my mum to defend me (which she never does) she said “no I’m not going to get in the middle of your silly fights”, however when I told my brother to apologize or I was going to smack him on his broken arm he continued to antagonize me so I got up and so did he. All of a sudden my mum jumps in telling me to leave him alone cause he’s “sick” (the little devil isn’t sick it’s just a minor injury). It’s only when I wanted to take matters into my own hands that she stepped in to defend my brother but not me.

She always does this, my brother will call me names and act super rude and entitled and she won’t say anything. Even when he’s just rude in general she never disciplines him. She lets him get away with being a little asshole and I’m sick of it. My father is the only one who defends me and takes my side when he sees that my brother is getting out of line. 

When I complained for the 50th time about how she never disciplines him she started playing the victim and saying that I was the problem because I was crazy. Even when she eventually told him to stop insulting me she said “stop insulting her because she’s crazy and she’s just gonna use that as an excuse to act out and act crazy, so leave her alone”. She never sees my side of things.

Of course I’m not perfect I also act like a bratty teenager at times but my mum is always saying that I’m the crazy one when I retaliate after she’s made me upset or angry. She continuously tells me that one day I’m going to walk around the street naked because I’m mentally unstable. I’m not a lunatic and I never act out when I’m around my friend or other people. It’s only when she’s mean and rude to me that I’m also mean and rude back. But she will never admit I’m in the wrong. All the fights we’ve ever had are apparently all my fault and she’s never to blame. She never takes responsibility for upsetting me or causing our fights. My little brother is perfect in her eyes and can do no wrong just cause he gives her hugs and kisses. Nevermind the fact that he watches lesbian porn on his iPad, plays PS4 all day and acts like an entitled asshole. 

She’s never even cared about the fact that I’m depressed. She jus brushes it off like I can make myself happy and she’s constantly commenting on my eating habits and saying and told me to go “gorge myself as usual” during this fight. I’ve have anorexia and bulimia for 4 years but she’s never even cared to notice that something’s wrong cause she’s too busy calling me crazy and playing victim. I’m sick and tired of all of their shit and if I wasn’t so scared of going to hell I would honestly have taken my life a months ago.

I just needed to vent. I mean am I the one in the wrong?",17Dec2018,1

As a man, I can go and have sex with a woman and the next day, go about my life. 

Its very rare that I've been in a situation where the woman was ""chill"" too. Usually, they're lovey dovey, etc. 


Also, I get this urge to have sex with women who   i shouldn't want to have sex with, like family of friends, an ex's 19 year old niece, etc.

One day a few years back she said that she loves her children (she has three adult ones), and even her cat, but she couldn't say that about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know previously she's dated women and she's said that I'm the last guy she'll ever date; does that mean she really wants to come out of the closet? We haven't had sex in ages, and she says that one day I'll find myself and say that I want children of my own and leave to find them, and that she's made peace with that.

I've even said that if she wanted to have a girlfriend on the side, she could. She says that's all good and well until it happens and then I'll want one and she's not for it.

I don't know if she's hinting that she's checked out a long while back but regardless of what I try to do, she seems unresponsive.

461,"I have a friend who I've known since high school. He is engaged and has serious commitments with his fiance, like a mortgage. Soon they will be putting money down on a venue and his fiance had expressed that she wants kids soon too, as she is almost in her 30s and has ambition to have kids before she's ""too old"". 

The issue with this situation is he works out of town. And that's an issue because she has had multiple moments where she has caught him cheating. To keep it vague, he had followed a lot of new girls from his work assignment city on social media as well as spending time on tinder. To make things worse, he's messaged a close friend of hers from her hometown across state to come ""visit him"" while away. She was honest and told his fiance/her friend.

She was able to forgive him, which I admire because honestly, I don't think I could if I were her. Anyways, in our friend group there's talk of continued cheating multiple times. However, the source isn't always credible and although he denies it, I think he feeds off of drama.

Supposedly, he even approached a female in our friend group to come ""visit him"" and ""see how things go"". She and previously mentioned Male friend both supposedly have been together when supposed cheating friend has texted her. There are no texts saved, because the female friend is afraid her boyfriend will become outraged towards him even if she denied him and told him it is inappropriate. So, I truly don't even have proof but with his history, I feel like I should at least tell her I have concerns. 

I've seen this play out before. You approach the fiance, the fiance is in denial and doesn't believe you. She thinks the person is lying (her and female that was approached already don't get along). I was really wishing there was text proof because even when some people see it with their own eyes, they still are in denial.

I know what I have to do, and it's stressing me out. I guess what I'm asking is, who has been through this and what is the best way to handle it? Of course the Male who told me doesnt want ""us"" to get involved because he doesn't want involved, nor does the approached female friend.

She's of course going to drill me and ask me for the sources, even if I tell her up front they don't want named. I can't say I'd blame her because I'd want to know as well.

At this point, I feel like this is on a ""let's just be a decent human being"" level. I hate to get involved but I am trying to prevent her further heartbreak by telling her to abort mission now instead of watching her wasting money on a wedding and having a kid to a guy who probably will never cheat on her. Unless she finds it in her heart to forgive him again, which is her issue.

I know I'm going to lose some, if not all friends in this situation. I am feeling more and more ready to take this on because what kind of friends do that to each other anyways. After all, the Male friend who I think likes drama supposedly cheated on his girlfriend with a ""cougar"" with kids and a family. I think he made the story up to seem cool. Don't ask me why, but I can't believe he'd even be willing to risk losing his long term girlfriend who has supported him through unemployment and moved away from home to live with him. But that's a story for another day and something I'm also not sure what to do about because I don't believe anyone deserves to be with a shitbag like that unless they, themselves, are a shitbag.

Drama king thinks that she was a rebound and the supposed cheater isn't happy, that he is settling yet trying to have the best of both worlds. He wants to have the family man image and single life too while he's away. I get that maybe he isn't happy, but I feel like he's also letting things go too far because whether or not i do something, she will find out eventually. 

I feel like I've already waited too long and my boyfriend says that waiting after the holidays will probably make it all the worse... adding further to my stress and anxiety. I know what I feel like I should do but dont know how to approach it. 
 
TLDR: Help. I have a friend cheating on his fiance and dont know how to break it to her. I feel like it's become ""my business"" by just knowing.

Things between him and I are getting better, but I still have a lot of hesitation. It’s hard for me to be happy about Christmas shopping for him and to have a good attitude towards him all the time.

467,"I feel I need to preface this with the disclaimer that I dearly love my sisters and we've been close since childhood. We're all adults now and we are all very different people, who don't always get along, but always love each other.

The issue is that I am the only child in my family who picked up the ""cleaning"" gene. I'm stressed when a space isn't clean and am embarrassed when people visit and the house is a mess.

I'm hosting a Christmas party for extended family in about a week and a half, which is great. It'll be my first time doing that and I look forward to seeing them.

However, before that happens, my two older sisters will visit. One will be here over Christmas and then the other a few days after that.

Again, this should be awesome and I should be looking forward to it and part of me is, but as the day draws closer, I find myself getting more and more anxious. When my sisters visit, they tend to leave the house in worse condition than when they came. They're not crazy messy, but definitely more messy than I am comfortable with.

They know this, but they think I'm too fussy. Maybe I am. I don't know. I'm just... I've had a rough year, health-wise, and cleaning takes a lot of energy out of me right now. The house is already not in the state that I want it in for the party and when I think about how much work I tend to end up putting in to clean after they leave, I don't know how I'll manage to get the house presentable in time for the party.

I feel terrible for even complaining about this because I should just be happy that I'll see my family for Christmas.

469," I live in a very Southern Baptisty place and most of my family is very typically Southern Baptisty.  I, myself, am not religious or conservative at all, so I usually don't participate in conversations about religion, politics, social issues, etc with the family just for the sake of keeping the peace. This hasn't been a problem at all. Until last week....

  A family member has asked me multiple times to donate to an organization through a FB fundraiser they set up. The organization is one of those anti-abortion pregnancy center type places, this particular one is known for being extremely predatory towards young pregnant women when it comes to adoption, among other shady things. I don't support it at all so obviously, I don't want to give them any of my money. 

   Well, this family member is getting very pushy about getting me to donate, sending me the link multiple times, re-inviting me to the fundraiser page over and over, I simply ignored it all. But then they sent me a message w/ the link again that said ""It's really easy, you can donate on Facebook just like you did for (Non Profit Foundation) on the same day [Mutual Friend] invited you to it 🤔"" That message seemed super pushy to me, as if the subtext + emoji was basically *You gave to that one charity already so stop being a stingy bitch to the one I support!* Am I wrong, or was that the implication of that remark?

 I really don't know how to approach this because this specific relative is the type who would argue with a brick wall about pro-life/pro-choice stuff til they're blue in the face...I haven't replied to the message, but they know I read it because it was on FB messenger. Should I reply? Would it be worse if I don't reply? If so, how do I firmly shut down the nagging without turning it into a pro-choice/pro-life argument? This person knows for a fact that I'm not broke and donated to another non-profit within the last week, so I really don't know how to shut this down without saying it's because I don't support the organization...I know if I just say ""no thanks"", they'll pry about why, or maybe even automatically assume why and it will end up blowing up in my face on Christmas.

TLDR: A relative *really, really* wants me to donate to an organization that I'm morally opposed to supporting and I don't know how to say no without it turning into a big fuss and ruining Christmas. Please help!

The first one isn’t a big deal, it’s just an extra strong ibuprofen that I take when my cramps are bothering me. I don’t feel scared about asking for my own prescription for this. But the other thing is a very low dose lorazepam that my mom lets me take when I’m feeling so anxious that I can’t sleep, the same thing she uses them for. I feel weird about telling my mom I’m anxious, so this doesn’t happen often.  They just ease me into going to sleep and calm me down. Maybe it’s even placebo affect, idk. 

This one I am scared to tell the doctor about. Will my mom get in trouble? Will thé doc think I’m a drug addict for asking for these pills?
Generally, I’m just nervous to be living in a new country so far away from everyone I know. What I’m most terrified for is the plane ride by myself. I’ve never flown alone before. I’m scared I’m going to have to bring myself down from a panic attack on a tiny plane with strangers next to me. 

I started having panic attacks after I was sexually assaulted a little over a year ago. I went to a therapist and really didn’t like it. My anxiety has persisted since then I mostly just deal with it. I know that I should probably go back again to a new therapist but I’ve hesitated with the excuse that I’m leaving. 
I havé always been anxious thought even before the assault and I have gotten better in small ways. I at least know how to identify when a panic attack is happening and I know how to breathe and calm myself down some. I can live with this but it’s still an issue and I am still very worried that I’m going to look visibly not okay on the plane when panicking (heavy breathing, shaking etc).

476," 

I am currently a 22 year old female. Went to a psychiatrist in 2013-2014. She never formally expressed her diagnosis, but I do believe it was something along the lines of 'identity disorder with depressive traits'. I was given the choice between weekly consultations without meds, or coming over once every two weeks with AD meds. I chose the first one. Anyway, that was quite a while ago, and apart from some backlashes, I felt a lot better. Well, until some months ago.

In September I came to Paris for an internship. As I loved Paris, I thought I would quickly make new friends and discover the city, falling in love with it even more. But of course, that was a little too optimistic. The internship I am doing is a 9-5 job. I feel like a brainless robot just THINKING about the fact that I am in a kind of job which I used to despise (still do). The internship itself is terrible. I literally spend my whole days on Reddit and Facebook because they don't have anything to do for me or to show me, despite me asking various times to become more involved. Because I waste so much time on the internet on my job, I come home with fried brains. All I can do is lay on the bed, exhausted. But when it's actual bedtime....well, I can't fall asleep. I mostly get to bed between 1-2 am and because that is quite late, that results in me being tired in the morning (or maybe just the thought of going to work gets me exhausted).

On top of that I have become OBSESSED about what I eat. No more fries, pasta, rice, pork, cow,.... Only chicken, fish, vegetables and fruit. I have lost about 4 kg since I got here. My grandmother, who has been over to visit, reported to my parents that I looked tired and lost my appetite.

Paris itself has been great though. Wish I didn't have to waste so much useless time in the office, so I could explore it more. And I wish my boyfriend was here. Exploring something on your own really sucks.

The lack of challenge completely made me lose interest in everything. There is nothing I enjoy, except for seeing my weight go down and visiting musea. But you can't make a living out of that, can you?

I am so afraid to enter the work life. If it's anything like this...I am afraid I am not made for capitalism. Is there anything I can do to make my situation any better? Still have to survive 6 months here....

EDIT : In the light of 'there is nothing I enjoy', I think it is (gross but) important to mention my lack of personal hygiene. I shower two/three times in a week, and while I used to put in curlers every night ( I HATE my hair without them), I just can't bring myself to do that anymore. Also, I can't remember the last time when I shaved or epilated my eyebrows, or used daycream. It all seems so 'exhaustive' to do.",17Dec2018,1

479,"I’ve been out as FTM for 3-4 years now. I am 17. I have always been sure in my identity. Now, I’m not.

 It started with realizing I wasn’t so sure about getting bottom surgery because the results aren’t always up to my expectations, and the process is long and difficult. Not to mention, sensation isn’t always the best (from what I hear) and part of me thinks that it’s almost better to have something that does what I want it (even if it isn’t right) to rather than have something that isn’t up to my expectations, which may make me even sadder. 

Another part is the fact that I’m not a super masculine person. I don’t consider myself extremely feminine either, but I sometimes the activities my female friends participate in more interesting than my guy friends, and I also find them easier to talk to. 

Another large factor is the fact that in my relationships I feel myself lean towards the more “feminine” side of it, or at least that’s what my gf thinks. Enjoying being the little spoon is an example. 

Finally, sometimes I think that it would be easier if I was just a cis girl. It would be easier to make friends, easier in relationships, and easier in the future. It’s to the point where sometimes I wish I never came out. To the point where I almost think it would be nice to take it all back and just live as a girl. 

This thought process makes me feel extremely guilty, and makes me question if I am even trans. Did I just make a big deal out of everything? Did 8th grade me make it all up? Was it all a lie? Did I put my family and friends through all of this for nothing? If I went back now I would forever feel guilty, and many people would just view me as nothing but an attention-seeker.

 That being said, I still have days where I feel confident in everything again. The problem is that a lot of stuff from my childhood had resurfaced lately, and now the days where I am unsure seem to outnumber the others. I have considered just going as non binary to both appease these doubts. Honestly, I am just completely lost.",17Dec2018,1
480,"I’ve been dating this guy for two months now. We’re still getting to know each other. But I REALLY like this guy, more than I’ve ever liked anyone. I feel goosebumps when I’m with him. I’m literally over the moon every time he calls me. And it’s VERY rare for me to even have a crush on someone. So this is big for me...

Unfortunately though I find myself sitting there and waiting for him to text me back. And then my mind starts to wander and when he doesn’t text me back for two or 3 hours. Is he talking to other girls? Does he not want to talk to me? And I know this is an unhealthy pattern of thinking.

And then he’ll text me back “hey, sorry I fell asleep” and then I feel stupid. 

Honestly it’s embarrassing because I’m a 24 year old woman. I’m not 17. I’m pretty confident about my looks and I’m an engineer. I know what I’m worth. So I don’t understand why this particular person makes me so obsessive and insecure.

Obviously when he doesn’t text back I don’t double text or scold him for taking too long to text me. And he really does make an effort to text me and call me every day.

How can I get out of my head and stop this pattern of obsessive thinking?  Sorry in advance for sounding super immature and crazy. I swear I’m not usually like this...",17Dec2018,1
482,"Okay.. I'm repeating this year of college - I really don't like it and I have no interest in finishing it out.

I had an exam last Friday and I'm pretty sure I failed.

I have another exam this Wednesday and the midterm (I joined late, this is a catch-up) on the Friday.

I'm pretty sure I'll fail that too.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting private lessons for the upcoming exam (€50 an hour).

So.. if I think I did terribly in the exam on Wednesday I don't want spend €150 on a 3 hour tutoring lesson for the midterm.

If I don't go to the tutor I'll 100% fail the mid term, it's different chapters that I've missed.

  
The exam is worth 60% and the mid term is worth 30% (10% is in assignments that don't count unless you passed the other two).

I'm in a better position as for other students the midterm and exam are worth less together (I think it's 75% for both the midterm and exam) and they're the most important parts, I need to pass both (35%) for the 10% to count..

&amp;#x200B;

I've sort of already told myself I'll probably get an apprenticeship with my uncle who's a carpenter (kitchens, cabinets, wardrobes etc) he's already offered.

I mentioned it to my parents (that if the exams go terribly I'll drop out and start working with my uncle) they just said 'well he must be making great money (his wife) isn't working!.. and then oh, but I hope the exams go well for you'

&amp;#x200B;

Am I stupid to not go to the tutoring and not sit the midterm if I think I failed the actual exam?  
My parents say 'we've already spent a lot of money on her, you may as well pay more and go through with it.'

  
I'm wondering if I could just book an hour, say I've got something on and just get the notes off her.

She tends to really milk the time, going off on tangents and just generally having a chat, she's lovely but I don't want to pay her €50 an hour for some economics help and a chat.

485,"My [25/F] friend [26/F] who I hang out with frequently is notorious for not responding to texts. I’ll often text her something, ranging from a positive quote to a question to a song to a paragraph recounting something stressful happening in my life, and without fail she does not respond. She then proceeds to text me something completely unrelated later that day and disregards my previous messages. Last night she ignored about 2 paragraphs of text I wrote to her regarding an issue I’m dealing with in my personal life. She texted me later that day about a gift she bought for her boyfriend. 

I gently confronted her last night via text and said “it’s hurtful when you don’t respond to my texts.” She defended herself and said she worked 70 hours that week and didn’t respond to multiple people’s messages. And gave a brief “sorry.” How the hell am I supposed to be a mind reader and know that you are busy working when you’re active on FB, even posting to FB, but don’t have the humanity to respond to ANY of my messages, and then find the energy to text me something different? 

This is the same person who will complain about her boyfriend to me and ask for advice, but never can give it back. I feel like her selfishness is so deeply ingrained that me trying to make her aware of how she hurts me is pretty useless. The “I was busy working” response really agitated me because it assumes I’m supposed to know and/or care what she is up to, and unconditionally understand why she is incapable of responding.

When the Americans entered Iraq and reached my home, I was only six or seven. Our house got hit by a mortar shell and later by a Helicopter.
I remember everything if it was yesterday, me being covered in dirt and dust crying in the corner, my mother falling to the ground due to the impact of the explosion, the scream everything.
And other horror I saw, bodies burned in the street and things I don’t want to remember.
This is only the start of my misery.
 Years after, our home got robbed by a woman I considered as a second mother to me, she tried to kill me and my mother because of my mother screams. Luckily my neighbours help us out.
After that shortly we began rebuilding our house when one of the workers tried to rape me I was lucky and old enough to know what he is doing. I was young and scared and didn’t tell anyone about what happened.
All of that made my mother super attached to me since I’m here last remaining son (she last two due to miscarriage).
I can’t live my life as everyone else she keeps looking after me as if I’m 10.
If I’m late from University for more than an hour she would start calling me.
Sometimes I keep my phone muted and don’t notice the calls I find her crying as if I were dead or missing.
I can’t leave my home at night nor I can meet my friends because she won’t allow me.
I really can’t disobey her because I really love her, And I know for sure that if I’m to leave and move on with my life she would either or lose her mind.
I’m very depressed and don’t know what to do in my life
I really want visit a doctor and get some help but my mother wouldn’t allow it because she is convincing herself that I’m fine and don’t need help.

496,"**TL;DR:** Met a cool writer online and added him on Discord. Started to look up to him after talking in private for a while and began to feel inferior to his other friends he'd mention occasionally. After he was added to a server I frequent, I left because I felt awful seeing all of his other friends whom I couldn't compete with.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello. I'm a 21yo student who should be studying for exams in January. This year, I met a hobbyist fiction writer on a forum and ended up adding him on Discord. Whereas I usually avoid any serious conversation and joke around/spam links on Discord, I approached this guy formally and got to know him like I would someone in real life. I was surprised to find out we had a bunch in common regarding what communities we'd frequented and which games we'd played. Even some of our obscure music tastes (which we'd been introduced to via one of the games we'd played).  


We talked for a few weeks almost everyday and I mainly asked him about his life and for tips on writing which I was interested in getting into. I ended up starting to write thanks to him and after that the conversation kinda died, which felt bad even though I saw it coming.  


Afterwards, I went ""Away"" on Discord and avoided talking to him in case he asked if I was writing because I never was. I also felt bad hearing about his other friends, especially an old friend he said he hadn't talked to for years and had run into by chance during an anonymous discussion recently. Other people included fan artists who drew stuff for him. He'd post their art at me and talk about how much he appreciated it. Sure it looked nice, but it also made me feel useless in comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

Several weeks after we'd stopped talking regularly a mutual friend whom I'd introduced the writer to added him to a server I frequent. So firstly I was worried about him seeing my shitposty side, and secondly I felt the need to ctrl+F all his messages in case I missed any. He isn't very active there so this was simple. I feel like I was on the look out for any instances of him giving appreciation to other people. Every time I saw any, I felt more and more inferior. I can't draw. I can't write. However, all of his friends seem like writers and artists. I even asked him: ""Would you say a large proportion of the people you talk to write or draw?"" and he replied that they were, at least on this account which he had created specifically for writing purposes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, as more and more people joined it turned out that he had more friends I hadn't heard of. Of course it shouldn't be surprising, but I felt like I wanted to remain ignorant because it hurt me to know that I was this one useless friend among all the others who had real skills to offer him. He told me once that I don't need to write to talk to him when I said I was worried he'd be disappointed that I wasn't writing (keep in mind I usually never reveal this stuff because I know it's cringy but I couldn't hold it in anymore). But I don't have any kind of life to talk about. The **only** connection I can have with this guy is if I write or draw. So after several days of comparing myself to all the other people on that server and witnessing him use someone's drawing for him as a profile picture I left. Now whenever I see the profile picture he's using I kinda wish that it could have been something I've drawn.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want my mood to be bound to what this guy thinks of me. How can I get over him? I mean, he's not a bad guy or anything so I don't want to avoid him forever but that's all I can think of doing now. I need to rejoin the server too because I said I'd be taking a short break because I felt ""bitter"". No one can link my departure to the writer since I never made any mention of these things in the server, I barely talk to the writer anyway, and everyone knows I'm kinda bitter about people who are good artists and have been for a while even before the writer joined.",17Dec2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm going through a state of confusion, and I'm really upset. To keep this letter somewhat short, I'll leave out some of the older details, but basically, here's the story. Two months ago, I stopped being friends with someone after they made a move on me, after a month of flirting. It wasn't because I wasn't interested -- in fact, we ""hooked up"" for two nights (all we did was cuddle and kiss, I was a virgin at the time). However, we stopped being friends because he texted me saying he didn't feel this was right, and we had a long heart-to-heart about what we wanted. He had told me that when we were hanging out that first night before we kissed, he thought he might have feelings for me, but now (at the time of this conversation) he doesn't, as they were ""still there for someone else"". We concluded we just wanted to stay friends. After that discussion, we just stopped talking for months. This upset me, because I really liked him as a friend, but I am someone who hates to be vulnerable, so I never contacted him because I didn't know if he hated me or something ridiculous like that. So whenever we would see each other (which was often, as we have mutual friends) he would just ignore me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to two nights ago, I'm on Tinder and I see his profile. I swipe right, curious, and we match. We talk for a little, and then he asks to hook up, for real. I was skeptical and wasn't sure if he really wanted to, but he expressed a numerous amount of times that he was interested. He seemed really confident too. So, last night, we hooked up, and it didn't go so well. I asked him so many times if he was sure he wanted to, and he kept saying yes, but he was extremely nervous and we only really ""did it"" for like, 10 seconds. He told me he was nervous since it was his first time in 9 months, which is understandable. Eventually, I just said that we could stop if he wanted, as he kept going soft and falling out. I asked if it had to do with me, and he assured me it didn't, so I believed him. He kept apologizing to me, saying that he didn't want me to think that he was bad in bed, and I told him it was fine, first times between anyone are always awkward. He kept saying he should go because I wasn't having a good time. I didn't want to tell him that I was actually just glad I was with him again, so I just let him leave, because he seemed really ashamed.

&amp;#x200B;

After he left, I texted him and told him that I didn't want him to feel embarrassed or judged and that we could try again if he wanted before he got with complete strangers, and if he didn't want to for any reason, thats okay too. I also told him that it was nice just seeing him again, as that was the first time we had talked since October. It's been 14 hours and he has yet to respond, and he's posted on Snapchat which he hardly ever does, so he's purposefully ignoring me. This makes me feel so bad and like it did have something to with me, like maybe he felt nervous because we had been such good friends and his feelings were coming back for me? I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I genuinely have feelings for him, I wasn't able to let him go during that whole time we were not talking, deep down I was so sad. But since he's such a confusing person, I don't feel comfortable telling him, especially now. I don't understand what his intentions were and why he's ignoring me, he was so ready to hookup and he promised he wasn't playing me and that he wanted to, but then he just got nervous? I'm afraid that if he doesn't answer my text, then if I ever see him again it will be even worse than before. I haven't told any friends what happened, and I don't know if I should. I know hooking up with him was a mistake in the first place, but I just missed him and wanted him any way I could get, as we were really close friends. I don't want to text him again, because that will seem clingy. Should I let this person go, and how? And is he ignoring me because he feels that embarrassed, or could it have actually been me? I feel so attached to him, I really just don't know what to do or how to feel about this whole situation.",17Dec2018,1

509,"TL:DR: Child in my class travelling to Nigeria. Concerned she may be going for FGM. Police and child services won’t do anything. 

I’m an early years teacher. 

One of my students is from a Nigerian family. Her mum is taking her back to Nigeria in December “for Christmas”. They aren’t going until 28th. I have concerns that she might be going to have an FGM procedure. 

Mum has been into school asking us to provide a letter as evidence for whole host of information on her daughter. We were only able to give her a letter confirming her daughter was a student and nothing else. 

Some of the things she wanted us to say in the letter included:
Confirming mum was the birth mother
That dad isn’t on the scene
Her address
Daughters Birthday.

As her teacher, I cannot put my name to any of the information- how would I know it was true? And dad is on the scene. A man she introduced to me as Dad, who daughter also calls dad comes to pick up the daughter from school. Might not be biological dad but he’s not her brother as she has claimed recently. She couldn’t tell us who wanted the information either

Mum was not happy. She claimed it was for a passport. She told us her daughter has a British passport but that she wouldn’t be able to get into Nigeria with a British passport. This isn’t true.
What is true however, is a) the procedure won’t happen to children with British passports because it’s illegal in this country and b) that parents won’t be prosecuted if the child has a Nigerian passport. 

Daughter is four years old. 

We (school) have contacted Child Services. 
They agreed the whole situation seemed very unusual. Their advice was to speak to the mum about FGM. No way- I’m not qualified to have conversations like that. They didn’t want to send an experienced member of staff as it was only a hunch of ours. 
We also contacted the police who said that there isn’t enough evidence and they could take it further when she returns. 

Basically the official line is nothing to be done until the deed is done. 

It may well be innocent enough but the whole way mum dealt with it was so strange that is made me worry about the daughter. I’ve had other families travel gone to see family in their countries of origin but none of them have gone about it shadily as this.

511,"Soulmate, A rather interesting hope.  I once had the best girlfriend ever at 19 (her 15).  We were quite the thing then and I always thought she was the ONE.  However she also had the opportunity to go to University at an Ivy League school.  I had to let go lest she hate me later in life for staying in my city which I knew she hated.  It was amicable and we stayed friends for years.  She mastered in a science degree and did work at NASA.

Flash forward 3 decades.  I was depressed on a recent holiday and started thinking about her.  Not 5 minutes later she texted me.  I AM NOT EVEN LYING!  I hadn't heard from her for 3 decades.  Since then we have spent countless hours on the phone (about 4 hours a day).  It seems like it would be a rekindling of our relationship.  I am single, she is divorces now with a teen boy.  I was going to go see her as she lives about a days drive away in a coastal city I really love for Christmas.  It would be worth it to see if we had the same chemistry because judging the phone calls it seemed we still did.  

I was a little concerned about her relationship with her boy as he seemed a bit immature for his age.  And she kept coming up with ""reasons"" he was that way.  I was very mature at that age so I gave a lot of leeway as I have never dated a woman with a son.  So, hey, who was I to judge.  

She called this morning to talk like we do every day and told me she had slept with her dog and he took up most of the bed.  Then she told me her son was being crowded out.  I thought I heard wrong so I said what?  She then told me her son sometimes sleeps WITH her in HER bed sometimes.  I am shocked!  WTF?

512,"Ive always had crushes. Even major ones. But I always end up finding something about the person that I don't like and I push them away. 

I know I'll never be able to ask a guy out. I can't even think of it but I don't even go on dates with guys that had actually asked me out. 

I've never been in a relationship and I really want that experience. It seems so nice to actually be loved by someone, the affection,the attention it seems good. 

I don't know. I'm told my standards are too high. But I'm not gonna settle for less that's for sure. 

I really don't know I'm just ranting here and it's frustrating and I feel like I won't be able to find anyone this way.

For example there was this guy I liked. And he was into me too but I know for sure I pushed him away. He way wilder than i am. He done stuff I can never even think of. We don't even have much in common. When we talk on the phone it's just him going on and on because the stuff I talk about are kinda boring to him and I know that too. I don't feel like it can ever work out and he tries alot to hangout with me more and talk to me more but i just get annoyed.

I'm really fucked up right now.

As the night progressed and I got more drunk, it got more intense (which I was not opposed to) and ended in us making out at the afterparty. I have an extremely low tolerance to alcohol and blackout easily so I’m a bit fuzzy on the details, but I do remember establishing that this absolutely needed to stay between us.

514,"My friend (this isn't me depite similar industries, for anyone curious) works in an marketing/advertising place and they recently announced they want to get to get to 50% women leaders by 2020. The percentage of women in leadership is currently in the high 30s and they are hoping to promote and hire from within, but admittedly that's going to be a lot of shift in the next 2 years. Furthermore, from his anedotal evidence, a disproportionate majority of the awards at work have been going to women.

Now, he says he considers himself a progressive, fair person, but he sees this as an overstep and I somewhat agree. He has been looking for a promotion (and certainly has the experience level to get one) and is concerned that if the company is trying to promote women, to a quota, it will hinder his own chances as a man. Furthermore he feels that if he speaks out at work about this policy in any way, he will automatically be labeled a misogynist.

I figure while women historically have had it harder due to various factors, and it would be ideal to have a fair, representative leadership, it is indeed a tricky situation. I told him to take the path of least resistance and pursue opportunities elsewhere, but how might he be able to handle the situation at his current work?

515,"So my family is all up in arms on if it's a ghost, my landlord, or my creepy neighbor Pibbles (name change obviously)

Some things to know: I live in a gorgeous apartment that is a remodeled orphanage. Theres four apartments in the building. Imagine the house split in half on each floor and the length of the building is one apartment each. The middle is a giant spiral staircase. My neighbor Pibbles has his own entrance. Weve met twice in the two and a half years I've lived there. My landlord is an elderly man that I adore and hes so sweet to me. We go out for lunch sometimes. I know this sounds weird but when we met he said I reminded him of his daughter who shares my name. She passed away suddenly and he started taking me to lunch at the restaurant she owned. Hes a good man and I dont picture him doing anything weirdy but I guess anything is possible. So here are the events:

1. I asked my ex to tidy up and make the bed before work. I came home and the house is clean, bed made, and a large pile of toenails are on the bed. I'm full on grossed out. I wait till my ex gets home and is barefoot. Then half joking/half serious I grab his foot and go AHA except there is no aha...his toe nails arent clipped and he tells me it's probably from a long time ago even though it was on top of the freshly made bed. 

2.I find a new really expensive mouse toy for my cat that is motion sensored and makes noise. Nobody I know bought it for her and I never saw anyone give it to her.

3. My ex has moved out and my friend is on the way over. My ex and I are arguing on the phone and I am listening quietly. I see the doorknob in my living room start to turn and I respond to my ex. It stops turning and footsteps walk away. I think it's my friend just not wanting to intrude so I wrap up the conversation and call her. ""You can come in!"" She says ""oh I'm still 9 minutes away""

4.Countless times I wake up and hear footsteps in my kitchen. I put jingle bells on the front doorknob and heard them early in the morning. I thought it was my cat and then realized she was curled next to me. I heard the footsteps and layed in bed and quietly cried.

The day after that I called my landlord. He says Pibbles used to have a master key but doesnt anymore because the locks have all been changed and he will have mine changed again. 

All is quiet for months

5. My best friend and I are at my house and go to leave for a Christmas party. We drive for about 10 min. And realize we forgot her food to bring. We turn around. I toss her the key and she runs out. She comes back to the car and we go to the party. When I got back all of my house decorations from outside of my door are in a pile on the couch. I call my best friend and ask if she put them there when she went in and she said ""no but I saw them when I went in. I assumed you mustve put them there before we left for some reason and I just didnt notice.""

517,"Hello all, I am 23, a recovering addict, and I love my job.

My boss is a great man. He is funny and he makes sure everyone is taken care of, however, he has a temper. Everyone is aware of it. Everyone has experienced it. 

I am 3 months new, and at one point maybe a month in, he decided I would be his new stress reliever. Apparently he singles one person out at a time and they get it worse. 

He treats me like a child. I will admit I make stupid mistakes but it is not nearly bad enough to warrant how he treats me.

Examples: yesterday was extremely busy and I was filling orders all day(I am the only employee who does this). I didnt wrap every item in paper in order to save time to get the job done. He approached me this morning and threw all the boxes down in front of me and asked “WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU” and just kept yelling and threatening to fire me. This happens EVERY DAY.

Today I was doing stock and I was ripping the tags off the items as I always do before i scanned them in, he comes over and says “let me show you how to do this AGAIN” I dont need him to show me how to do it ive been doing it for months. He like gently pulls each tag off and starts scanning them and drops the whole pile and tells me to pick it up and finish it.

I put a rack back where it used to be and he came and started yelling saying he put it in the back last week not where I put it and I wasnt listening.

Ugh. I know I make mistakes, I try hard every day and I come in with a good attitude. Idk what to do. I broke down crying in the bathroom today because I was so... I dont even know. I feel awful every time he is around.

519,"(Sorry if I used the wrong tag, I wasn't sure which one to use). 

For privacy, we'll call my friend ""Z"". 

Z is transgender (ftm). He often mentions how he is dissatisfied with life, and I don't blame him for that. His parents aren't the greatest, and they're usually fighting or yelling at him. Recently, he came out to his parents, and they were pretty confused, since they didn't know much about gender identity. They wanted to learn more about it. 

On a discord server I'm in, Z sent an alarming message and I immediately private messaged him to see what happened. He said nothing happened, and that he just wants to die. He told me how he doesn't want to face his future, because he doesn't think it's going to be good and it's just going to be miserable from here onwards. 

I tried to speak with him for around a hour, and recommended that he told his parents so he could seek professional help, however, I am yet to receive a response. He mentioned that he doesn't want to tell his parents or girlfriend, as they'll think he's just being a narcissist and ""making everything about him"". 

He doesn't see a point in getting professional help. 

I know this is a complicated situation, but I really don't know what could convince him or motivate him to tell somebody and find some help. He's one of my closest friends and I really hate seeing him say these things.

520,"So my mother is an alcoholic, she has had a very hard life. She’s currently working two jobs because money is very tight right now. She works hard, and I love her dearly, but sometimes she can get so angry it’s overwhelming. 


Everything I do is somehow never enough. I feel like the more I try to help her, the worse it gets.


At the beginning of november she went to a party and I was at home playing video games with a friend. I told her to text me when she would be on her way home, so I could tell my friend to leave because I knew she would be very drunk. At around 12am I got worried because I had not heard from her, so I wanted to go out for a smoke. I live in an apartment building, and when I was walking down the stairs I found her lying dead-drunk on the stairs. My friend and I carried her up and I helped her take off her shoes and such. 


I told her that I am so tired of this. She had another glass of wine and then proceeded to tell me that I’m the worst, that I probably slept with my friend in her house, that I’m a whore, that I should just leave, and not come back.


I left with my friend to a party that I didn’t even want to be in. I got very drunk, and relapsed on drugs. She continued to send me messages throughout the night telling me awful things. I walked around downtown all night sobbing. I then slept over at a friends house. 


After that I went to the hospital and got put into a mental hospital. I didn’t know where else to go. My mother then apologized and told me that she loved me. I told her where I was and she was very sad. After being at the hospital for one week, I moved in with my grandmother, who lives in an apartment building on the same street.


My grandmother is also an alcoholic but she is always very kind to me, just not to herself.


My mother continued to apologize and tell me sweet things until I eventually moved back to her apartment building because all of my belongings are there.


Yesterday she got very drunk and I was a bit tipsy when we had the conversation about how abusive she can be. She completely denied it until she was sobbing about how she wanted to die and that everything is my fault. She got very angry with me. It’s so hard to write down exactly what she says because I usually dissociate when she attacks me like this.


After a lot of crying, I left and stayed over at my grandmothers. I cried all night. She also sent me cruel messages, apologizing for giving birth to me.


I cannot live with my father, who lives on a farm very far away, because the man who sexually abused me when I was 5 is around there sometimes. I am not welcome there.


My grandmother will soon be put into a home and therefore lose her apartment. I also feel like if I live there, my mother will have no one to help her. I wish I could just fix everything. My mother has told me often that I am the only one who she cares about in her life. Would it not be selfish of me to leave, after all of the good things she has done for me? She can be cruel, but she is my mother and she can also be very kind to me.


I feel like I am not welcome to stay anywhere. I am only 18 and renting an apartment in Iceland is very expencive, I can’t afford it. I only have one semester of college left. I work on the weekends. But where can I go? I am so tired of getting fucked up downtown just so I can forget about going home with a stranger to have a place to sleep. I just want it all to stop.",17Dec2018,1
521,"I'm at wits end with both of my male dogs. Oldest is almost 7yrs and the youngest is a bit over 2yrs old. I raised both since they were puppies. Oldest is always attacking my young one and lately it has been constant- blood gets drawn- including mine. At first my youngest wouldn't defend himself but now that he's bigger it's an all-out brawl.

I seriously don't know what to do, and I hate the thought of re-homing because I love them both so much. They are great dogs but they never learned to get along, my oldest never accepted him. 

I do have a muzzle that I use on the oldest and it seems to avoid fights- but I don't know if I'm doing the right thing on keeping it on him for almost the entire day.

Lately the fights have been inevitable, for instance today was the most recent. I had finished feeding them and I was opening the door to let them out and by half a second a brawl broke out. I freaked out because as I was holding the young one away blood was running down my arm, I thought one of them got badly injured. Turns out it was me who was bleeding from my index finger- which gave me relief. 

It huts me as a dog mom and I failed them tremendously.

524,"TL;DR  My ex-friend threatened to kill me because I had to stop talking to him after he was emotionally abusive, tried to rape me and so in love with me that he wanted to kill me and then him so we could die together. I am afraid if i sue him for all the things he has done he will do something bad. Also he told me he was going to do something “bad” to the world (kill someone) and it will be all over the news, but it would be for me (???)

I met this guy two years ago and he seemed very nice and funny, we were very good friends for a year. It was a very abusive friendship, he was in love with me (I had a boyfriend then, now we’re engaged) and he wanted to kill me and then kill himself just so we could die together. One night we were drunk and he was going to rape me but  later he told me that he didn’t just because 
1. other people were sleeping in the same room
2. I was on my period (I told him, i’m very open to everyone) But he touched me while I slept and dryhumped me while I slept.
A few weeks later we were again with friends and he took my hand and asked me if I could touch his thing and I said no, he forced me to do it but I always took my hand back. 
He became super attached and disgusting around me irl and online. He used to tell me he was going to kill himself often and manipulate me so often. He wanted to die because he couldn’t have me. He has schizophrenia and it scared me a lot, the things he said. I told him I  couldn’t talk to him anymore because he was such a bad influence for me and I couldn’t take it, I told him that for weeks but still kept talking to him because he manipulated me into doing it, or he would kill himself. I was so scared. After weeks/months I finally blocked him. He always found new ways to contact me and threaten me because I “bailed” on him. He made at least 3 new facebook accounts, spoke to me via mutual friends, instagram, steam, email, twitter, snapchat etc. Always found a way. I always panic when I hear the email notification because Im afraid its him. Once he wanted to “apologize” to me by doing something “bad” to the world (kill someone) and it would be all over the news, when I was mad and asked him what the fuck was wrong with him he was so surprised and asked “I am doing this for you, is this not what you want?”

Now the worst part. He contacted my now fiance and told him I “jerked him off” when he fucking sexually abused me and almost raped me. I am so mad. He also told all of our mutual friends + so many people that we had sex (and “multiple times”) while I was with my bf. He told his friends to  shittalk me online because of “what I did” and that I was a slut. I had no fucking idea what his friends were talking about because then I didn’t know about the things he was saying. Many of his friends believe this but some of our mutual friends say they know he’s lying because he used to change the stories. I have PTSD because of this and whenever I go outside I look at ALL the people around me because i’m afraid he’s there. I have seen him two times since and I freaked out. I contacted the police and they told me I should go to some place and tell them about this.

I’m afraid if i sue him he will hurt me or worse, he has threatened me before. Please help

526,"hello. throwaway for several reasons. probably going to be a long one since i never really talked to anyone about this because i dont know how tonhandle this, tldr at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

**background info**: my parents are divorced. they got married to other people after and got divorced again. in this case mum had an alcoholic abusive husband and they lived in another city being isolated asf with my 10 year old half-brother. i got accepted into a uni in a whole different city. and i asked myself why live alone when i could help my mum get away from that abusive walky talky penis by asking her to move in with me in this city. she accepted and after, they got divorced etc. we now live in a one bedroom tiny ass flat and we are also broke as shit. the first month she moved in, she found a turkish van cat outside that was covered in everything bad and teeth problems. we took that cat in cleaned her, took her to a vet with the last money we had and she started living with us with my mum REAAALLY wanting her. fast forward couple months, the cat starts running about at night breaking shit and going through the drawers and opening the balcony doors and all that and it pissed my mum off and she locked the cat in the balcony for a week. thankfully someone walking past outside saw the cat, gave me a git gut speech and found the cat another home and took her that night. shes almost a functioning person at this point with no internet shenanigans, knitting at home and watching dumb tv shows and being a fine mum. 

&amp;#x200B;

later she found a slightly better job with a better paycheck and started buying shit to the point where we would be broke as fuck couple days after her payday. she got herself a shit laptop for way above its worth and started playing an online mmorpg game and made friends online. she would go on teamspeak with the people she met, and would tell me and my brother to ""dont call me mum, well dont speak at all"" and would tell people that shes 25-26ish when shes 46 with two children. im 24 and my brother is 10. now i dont like going through peoples private stuff like their phones, their messages, mails or anything at all and its really disrespectful. buuuuut one day her charger went blink blink as if it wasnt connected properly and the screen lit up, one message she received caught my eye and it was someone named ""my love"" calling her ""my love"" and asking her about the bruises on her knees and thighs. i couldnt help myself and unlocked it, scrolled like 5 messages up and saw them actually sexting. she tells us about this dude occasionally and i know that hes 25. so she flirts with her and thats obvious. but this and that somehow i find out she also flirts with two other young dudes at the same time and causes one of them to cheat on their fiancee and even tells us about it without context.

&amp;#x200B;

at this point she completely forgot that shes a mum. she doesnt cook anymore, doesnt clean at all(ill be honest maybe hoovers once a month) and doesnt even hear us calling for her when shes playing the game. im now a mum to my brother and my own mum. she is still going strong acting like a 25 year old with overly edited young ass looking selfies with fake makeup on them.

&amp;#x200B;

rant here: she constantly bitches at stuff, swears loudly and DEEPLY on the streets at random people and constantly whines about shit thats happened because of her but she just never admits it was because of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

today early in the morning, we were trying to see why the radiators werent working, pull the couch over and see my cat peed behind it and she stepped on it accidentally(this cats another cat, she insisted we take care of it even tho i told her ""no  you will get rid of it after a year anyway and i dont want to go thru that sadness again""). now that cat has peeing problems thats randomly but not so randomly started and pees around AND in his litterbox. i am thinking that hes got some illness going on that causes him to pee about, but never got to check it out because we just didnt ever have any money to take him to a vet. she just kept throwing money on this dumbass game. sometimes we just have cheese and bread for dinner for a week straight because theres nothing else to eat. 

&amp;#x200B;

**back to the eventful morning, she sees the piss and flips her shit. starts beating the poor cat with a long ass umbrella and when he started running around being scared, she locked him in the bathroom and kept beating him and yelling at him and swearing at him, did this for half an hour straight and wouldnt let me do anything(she also threw him out once for the same reason and i took him back inside and told her to have mercy).  now she says she is going to throw him outside tomorrow morning, to a picnic place thats 20 mins away from here.** 

&amp;#x200B;

the deal is, i dont know what to do. i dont know how to deal with her. i dont have the balls to confront her and i realised im a real patient person. everytime i try to argue with her, shes like, some kind of olive oil always going up with ""yeah but...""s. so this also puts me off real bad. but i also dont want her to throw him outside because we were too poor to take him to a vet. we also live in turkey so its no cheap at all. just a general examination is 100 liras and our rent is 550, do the math. the cat is locked in the balcony now and has been for more than 12 hours. she wont let me let him in.

&amp;#x200B;

**soooo... what do you think i can do? is there a way to get to this psycho?** im not at all bothered with her fucking off to live somewhere else but i also know shes got nowhere else to go. you all have a decent background now and enough info to judge her actions and give me some advice on how to tackle this entire situation. **not just the cat but also her not being a mum to spend all her time online flirting with younger men.** i need more experienced, greater minds. *p l e a s e.*

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr**; mums stopped being a mum because she plays an online game and flirts with dudes half her age lying about her own age. throws all 3 cats of mine out for similiar reasons and wants to always adopt another cat even tho i say no and now shes about to kick mine outside(tomorrow morning). we broke asf to find out why our cat does the things he does. she beats the cat for peeing around. and is again, a generally bad mum. **how to confront her without making her flip her shit?**",17Dec2018,1

529,"Background: I am a senior (M) in high school. I have good grades, good relationships with a majority of the faculty and staff at my high school, and I have never had any disciplinary issues before. I have twice attended two voluntary Christian service retreats that my school offers, as well as a reflection-based retreat. Everyone would say I’m a good kid victim of a bad situation. 

 Last Saturday I was involved in a physical altercation during my sports practice (with a school-based team). It happened during a game of ultimate frisbee, and what began with typical sports banter (from both me and the other guy) resulted in first me being shoved, and then me punching back in self defense. The moderator of our practice (our coach recently resigned so we don’t have an actual coach at this time) was present to witness what happened, as well as the entire team. All my teammates can attest that I did not initiate the fight. Our moderator did nothing to stop the altercation, nor did he speak with either of us about what ensued that day. 

Over the weekend, I agreed with the teammate with whom I had fought to not tell the school about it. 

However, today at practice the moderator for our practice told us both that he himself had already contacted the school about what had happened without speaking to either of us first. Long story short, I told the moderator that the teammate and I had sorted out our differences, and the moderator responded that he’d send a letter to the administration requesting that no further action be taken regarding the incident. 

However, my mom, who works at the school, was approached by the head disciplinary member at the school and was told that the fight, regardless of whether my punch was in self defense, is still “an offense worth of suspension”. 

My fear at this point is that the moderator’s request to the school to drop the incident will be disregarded, and ultimately I’ll be suspended my senior year. Whichever colleges accept me initially will most likely recall the acceptance when they receive my transcript, which is a shame because I’m a very solid student and many have said I have a bright future. 

What are my options at this point? Should I try and persuade the administration using my grades, good relationships with teachers, history of no discipline, and the self defense argument to have them drop the suspension? Should I let things pan out? Should I begin the job hunt now?

I acknowledge I shouldn’t have punched the kid, but when I was shoved, hitting back was the natural reaction, as this particular kid is sometimes unpredictable.

533,"Hi r/advice, I’m having a serious moral dilemma. When I was ten, I attended my grandfather’s funeral/wake service, where I was sexually assaulted by my great uncle. He grabbed me by the balls and squeezed extremely hard, and pretended that it was a joke and that he was teaching me to be a “man”. He has since passed, but it bothers me greatly, as I didn’t have many memories of my grandfather, and the memories I do have were tainted by this experience. While it may not seem like much, it has greatly impacted my life, causing serious emotional damage. Anyways, I had been seeing a therapist over the course of three or four months, who I believe may have been grooming me, after attending a sexual assault/abuse seminar (I’m a minor, btw). The therapist would comment on my body, as I’m a swimmer and workout extremely frequently and often, which I took as a compliment, until his comments became increasingly more creepy. He insisted on taking me for walks in the park (trail surrounding a lake basin that was usually abandoned), which I reluctantly went on. I eventually told him I didn’t want to go on the walks and that they made me uncomfortable, and he apologized and began giving me food, comic books, and other various things I enjoy. My mom thought this was creepy, but I didn’t mind getting free stuff (I’ve come to realize how unprofessional giving things like that is). Eventually, he insisted on me doing meditation sessions, where he would blindfold me (I usually fell asleep) and force me to meditate. One session, I caught him with an obvious erection, that he was massaging with his hand (over his pants) after I had abruptly woken up. I didn’t comment on this, but told him I refused to meditate during the next session. He took personal offense to this, and began freaking out, claiming I didn’t know what I was talking about and that the meditation was helpful. I have anger issues, and began to wind up to punch him after getting in his face and yelling, but I stopped myself just before my swing, instead hitting the wall behind him instead. I stormed out of his office and asked my mom to come pick me up, as I sat on a crowded, busy street bawling my eyes out. Ever since, my issues have gotten worse, despite taking medication and seeing another therapist. I feel I may be permanently scarred from the trauma, and feel extremely angry towards him. I know where his practice is, as well as a vague idea of where he lives, and I desperately want to wear a mask and take a baseball bat and beat the shit out of this awful human being. I know this isn’t a good way to get justice, but I feel like it’s the only way. I’m sure I’ll change my opinion and not go through with it, but I just can’t express the deep anger I resent towards this man.",17Dec2018,1

I haven‘t had any friends the past years, so when someone‘s nice to me, I don‘t dare to talk with them as much as I would like to because I fear that they might not like me anymore if I say something wrong and I go back to having no friends. I‘ve had some bad experiences earlier in life, so maybe that‘s one reason why that is, but I don‘t know exactly

And this seems to be the case in the internet, too. 2 years ago, I registered in a Pokemon forum where I thought I would find some friends. That kinda was the case, with some people I still write very often to this day!! But here‘s my problem: before I write on someone‘s profile or answer someone on my profile, I often know something I could write, but don‘t dare to post it... Again because I fear I write something wrong and the person whom I write now thinks something bad about me. And when I write something and I don‘t get any likes on it, I often get really sad and blame myself on being unfunny or something like that

And even with the friends I mentioned above this is the case: I can‘t write like I would like to because I‘m scared they don‘t like me anymore or think I’m unfunny. This is especially a big problem when writing with them, because they‘re really important to me and I don‘t want to lose them...

So that‘s why I wanted to ask for advice on how to „be myself“ more, I really hope someone can help me!!

Thank you in advance for every answer :]

I only got six points off my test, but it’s still scary.  I live in a state where lots of accidents happen.  I’ve had friends die from car accidents and one long term friend is currently recovering from a terrible accident.  My biggest fear is dying in a car accident.  Or being in one in general.

I feared my insurance rate would go up too much and didn't want to claim it on the insurance. I asked and he agreed. This happened on work property and I see him frequently because of this. 

I coughed up $300 for an issue that arose with his (I believe) alternator, $70 for his radiator hose that I broke and then $100 for alignment. 
Now he's asking $450 for a paint job. I CAN give him the money, but this has been far more expensive than I initially thought and was informed that my insurance would've only gone up like 20 dollars a month at most ( I had feared it going up by like $200). 

Should I call my insurance at this point and tell them what happened? Would they compensate me for my previous spending? Will it really only go up like 20, 30 bucks a month? 

More bg info:
I'm under my mom's insurance, I just turned 21 and when I got into the accident, I asked her for advice and told her I was worried the insurance would go up. She suggested I ask to pay out of pocket to which, he agreed. So we're here now.. don't roast me for not knowing. Me and my mom over here don't know much about car insurance. I know that if I were to pay for insurance alone it would've cost around $435 (geico quote) under my mom it came out to a total of $160 something (again Geico, my mom is 62).

542,"Okay, this might sound like a weird problem to have, but please hear me out.

I’m a young guy, and I haven’t been driving on my own for very long - not even a year yet. I have a clean driving record, and the only accident I’ve ever been involved in was a minor bump during the summer that we took care of without insurance. In short, I know I’m a good driver, and that most of my fears are irrational.

But driving still stresses me the hell out. Just being out on the road during even moderate traffic makes me tense up to an uncomfortable degree. I make a conscious effort to brake early when stopping because I’m paranoid that I might cause an accident. I avoid tricky turns and busy roads because I’m paranoid that I might cause an accident. I’m always thinking of things that I might do to cause an accident. Truthfully, I’m much more trusting of other drivers than myself, even if I am just as good at - if not better - at driving safely compared to those around me. The only time I’m really comfortable driving is on the highway, just because there aren’t as many variables to think about.

The anxiety is really starting to bug me. Every week I fixate on things that I do or don’t do on the road and wonder if I did anything illegal, which leads to me Googling different scenarios to find out if I did anything wrong and fearing that I’ll get a ticket in the mail or police visiting my house. Of course I have never gotten a ticket or been pulled over by police for any reason, but I keep thinking that it will happen eventually and it scares the hell out of me.

I don’t know what to do. I just want to go one week without fearing that I may have broken the law, or just be able to drive anywhere without worrying about causing an accident. In short, I just want to be able to trust myself. I really, really hope that this is just a new driver thing and that in a few years time, these problems won’t matter anymore - because I don’t know how long I can go on living knowing that such a simple and necessary task causes me this much stress.

TL;DR: I’ve been driving on my own for almost a year and it still causes me a great deal of stress and anxiety, to the point that I routinely worry about breaking the law or causing an accident despite no real reason to ever worry about such things.

544,"Hey guys! During the past few months, I began going to a psychiatric facility to finally diagnose whatever is going on with me. I went in blind, because I have no clue what type of place I should go to, or who is the right person to seek about my mental help. Anyway, after attending a few appointments, I was diagnosed Bipolar II and was given Lamictal as a prescription. Everything was going okay, but now I feel forced to pay for unnecessary things within this facility. I am going off on a trip in a few days, and called them to notify that I’m out of pills and that I need a refill. The receptionist told me that it would be a $25 fee for outside of facility prescription refill (which can be understandable, because when I meet with the nurse practitioner I pay for $20 for an appointment). Then she tells me that she will notify my nurse practitioner about my refill, but then proceeds to tell me that my N.P. will not refill my prescription UNLESS I set up an appointment after my trip. I feel that they truly don’t care about me (surprise, surprise) and will just stop going to that facility. 

Now my new issue is I need to seek someone for a prescription again. I was mentally unstable before, but with my recent dosage, I’m afraid that I’m more short-tempered and suicidal lately. I really just want to seek a medical professional about my mental issues, and receive a prescription that I don’t have to pay $25 for each time I need a refill. Someone who won’t force me to see them every two weeks. Not necessarily someone who cares, just someone that will give me the damn medication and let me live my life. 

Tldr: Need advice on who to appropriately see about medically diagnosing my mental issues. Someone who will give me a test, give me a prescription, and let me experiment with my dosage/medicine until I need something different. ",17Dec2018,1
545,"Last night my husband plugged his cellphone on my laptop to charge it. Since I had installed this new photo software that automatically opens when it detects a new device, I accidentally looked at a screen capture with sexting between him and a another woman when I went to plug my own cellphone. We were next to each other laying on the bed and he did not notice I saw this since he was resting with his eyes closed. I immediately felt my stomach hurt and my heart go wild. I admit I scrolled to see more. I needed to know this was not just a mistake. I found texts that were at least three months old. I did not read them in detail. Everything happened in two minutes.  I saw screen whatsapp captures with erotic texts between them. I could have given it time to think how to address this, but my emotions were overpowering. I asked him if he was seeing someone. He said no. I asked him what about (girl's name) ? He asked who told you? What happened? So, when he confirmed by asking who told me, I collapsed. I told hin he was a lier and that I never wanted to see him again. That I wanted a divorce. He said this was just a form of masturbation , that it was not important to him, and that he was stupid for doing so, that he knew he was wrong but that it was really not a big deal, and he proceeded to delete the girls contact and block her from whatsapp. He told me he had met her on a chat, and that he had added her, that she did not even live in our city and that he was not planning to meet her anyway.
Some details you should know: 
We've been married for five years. We have no children. 
He has always supported me emotionally in my professional projects and also , financially since he is the one with a stable income.
I left my country to start a life next to him. In my country, I obviously had friends, family and a career that I had to restart when I decided to come with him.
A year ago, I started with some depression issues. One of my closest friends had committed suicide, my niece was born with a fatal disease, and I started to wonder if I would ever be able to do something professionally in the country I am in now. 
Sex began to be less frequent, like once every two weeks. A month ago, however, I developed eczema close to my genitals (yes , the year has been tough) and we stopped having sex for a month. I am almost fully healed now. 
He had told me before he missed our sex life and frequently tried to initiate it. I rejected him but mostly because I felt sad. 
To be honest, we both have much work and projects, and we both met at the end of the day tired. The relationship just seems to be the last thing in our schedule.
We do spend time together on the weekends, but mostly we rest and watch netflix. We dont have a special time to share as a couple.
I don't mind him watching porn. I watch it myself. But I am very hurt that he kept an erotic relationship for so long. I'm hurt that he gave her his number. I'm hurt that he did it while he was next to me. 
I have not been a very loving wife lately and I have not been thankful for the sacrifices he makes to support our home. I do love him. But I have not been very successful in loving myself. I am 34 years old. My passion is working in a very unstable field and things have not been running smoothly lately.
He had kept innocent stuff from me before , small secrets that would become bigger when I discovered them. He says he is afraid to be a failure before my eyes. 
He said repeatedly that he did not want me to leave. That we should try therapy before. 
I want this to work badly and I know I made mistakes, but right now I just feel so hurt. He tried to initiate sex this morning and I accepted. Flashes from the texts he wrote to that woman appear in my head and leave me with doubts. I just don't want to wake up in five years and discover a new lie, or infidelity. I would love to receive some advice and get some perspective. Thank you.

549,"So you know how on TV, houses are always impeccably clean and tidy? How realistic is that? I’m living at home while in school, and I’m always nervous about having people over because I think they’ll judge me for not having a perfectly clean house. Our house, while I don’t consider it super messy, could use some deep cleaning. It’s also getting a bit worn down as it’s approaching 20 years old. It gets a bit dusty, and we have some spiders in the house. 

I have this friend, who also lives at home; her parents are semi-retired and their house is *impeccable*. I think that’s what is making me paranoid, because I think our house should be that clean. 

I know this is a ridiculous question, but I thought it would be nice to get some different perspectives. So I guess I have a couple of questions: 

How dirty would a person’s house have to be before you would judge them for it? 

Do you think having lots of books and trinkets (all of which have a place; not like a hoarding situation) looks messy? 

It’s okay for a house to not be impeccable all of the time, right?

552,"I didn’t know he was a conman when I first met him.  He’s the family friend of a friend (let’s call him Dave) and said friend is in business with us too.  Dave didn’t know either until I found out via a separate friend.  Conman is an old friend of Dave’s father.  He recently popped up in their lives after a prolonged absence and some “legal trouble”.  Dave had never met him until a year or two ago.  Apparently he has changed and put his past behind him.  We now know that he served about 3 years in prison for money laundering in 2012.  

After making a long list of very extravagant promises and demands back in October if we worked for him, he has now become very hard to reach and has missed multiple appointments to talk on the phone (which he organised).  He previously invested in an old project and did pay up, albeit in chunks and in a staggered manner.  He blamed the last part of the payment not coming earlier on some hotel messing with him.  He now owes us money in the low 4 figures and has claimed that he never agreed on a budget; although earlier he constantly reassured me that the budgets in question were fine and he would pay soon (he did this over the course of a few months).  He suddenly changed his mind midway through a project and claimed never to have agreed anything.  I have WhatsApp messages from him to verify everything I’ve said.  He is constantly “away” and in “areas with bad signal” he also claims never to have received any of the emails I sent him (which I showed him had been sent).  The emails contained the budget breakdowns so he can’t have disapproved of the budgets if he never read them.

Today he missed the 5th attempt to contact him in keeping with a time he arranged.  I have tried to contact him 20+ times outside of that.  He has never once returned a call or given an explanation as to why he missed it beyond saying “I’m busy” or “I’m away” once or twice.  He reads my WhatsApp messages and doesn’t reply to them (as he does Dave’s).  

The only real bargaining chip we have is that Dave’s dad allegedly has mountains of dirt on him from their past and they’re very close friends.  Dave’s dad has gotten involved but conman has assured him that everything would be sorted out “in a few days”, that was last week.  After that time had passed me and conman had an argument via WhatsApp where I proved to him that what he said didn’t add up, he then went on a tip about me not being accountable when in fact the evidence showed that I had been keeping him up to date throughout the project.  I have not received a penny from conman.  He said he would call me today but I got nothing.

564,"Let me start this off with a week ago I left for vacation to visit the husband while he was stationed in Hawaii. MIL moved in the week before that.... bringing half her belongings with her. 



We don’t have a small house but it’s definitely a tight living space. 


She had promised before vacation that all of her stuff would have “found a home” in the bedroom she is staying in. It also has a deep closet that goes under the staircase so she could easily store stuff way back there. 



Well, it’s the day after we got home and I start doing some basic house chores.. nothing is where I left it and all the things are in the wrong spot. 

I know I can be picky for instance something I knew I had to let go was - some of our plates / bowls were switched on shelves and none of the bowls were stacked with their matching pairs. 

Okay, I can get over that.. kind of 


But then there are cups in the bowl/plate cabinet and there is a FUCKING STRAINER WITH THE CUPS WHAT IS THIS 



I would say there is still a quarter of her stuff in our upstairs living room and kitchen. It’s all just laying on the floor. 


She did my laundry, something that while I get it was meant to be nice I really don’t appreciate that. 


Our downstairs bathroom is covered in her things. The walls have so many of those sticky hooks and all the things are on the wall. Clothes, hairdryer, more clothes, random blanket? And more random clothes. 



There is a downstairs kitchen that is half taken as it is my “craft room” I moved a bunch of stuff out of where it was so she could have space in the cabinets plus the fridge and yet I still find her kitchen shit upstairs in our kitchen. 


I have only been cleaning for a couple hours and I could go on and on on the random shit that is misplaced or just absolutely not okay. 



I don’t know how to approach this situation as I know to some people these are just “little things” but these are things that have always seriously bothered me.

567,"I live in an old garden apartment building. The noise levels are minimal except for the neighbor above or, in my case, below you. It's so easy to overhear that I sometimes catch parts of normal volume conversations happening. A new tenant moved in below me ~2 months ago. He immediately introduced himself and shared a lot about his situation, including that he was pursuing custody of his two children (9 and 6 years old) because his ex wife is physically abusive to them. He also informed me that his son has ADD, ADHD, and has seizures regularly. His son has a ""service dog"" that lives here full time. I have several reasons to believe that this isn't a legitimate service dog. Anyway, time passes, we don't speak again but I can tell from noise levels that he has his children 1 night a week. On a couple occasions I have heard him yelling and verbally abusing the 9 year old by name including use of obscenities. Specifically calling him a ""fucking retard."" This was appalling to me for ANY child, but even moreso since this child is special needs. I can hear the man screaming at this child as late as midnight while the child cries. Through a weird set of circumstances I also found out that his ex wife is 25 years old (twice his age). Meaning he got her pregnant when she was 15. Not exactly related but imo speaks to his character. I want to speak up for these children but im also afraid that the mother is genuinely abusive as well. Should I call CPS?

568,"Sophomore in college.

&amp;#x200B;

It's devastating. I had an embarrassing accident my freshman year and didn't react to it well and ended up falling out with everyone I had left, pretty much. I had a good group of people I associated with after high school (and some from hs, too) and felt like I was changing and becoming more confident. The idea of college was exciting. This accident changed me, though, and its lasting effects on me left its mark on my personality, way of thinking, outlook on life, and self-image.

&amp;#x200B;

To add more details to the situation, the accident involved blows to the head and face. I noticed lots of facial changes over the next 7-8 months that I suspect, after doing some research, might be the result of bones healing improperly. I am still 'me' with MUCH uglier features, and I can't get over it. My fucking dental treatment was reversed and I have an overbite again (that can't be treated apparently since my molars still line up) that makes it difficult to enunciate certain syllables and my speech sounds much weaker and monotone than before. My whole mouth just feels awkward because I feel like I'm sticking out my upper lip at all times. My nose also formed a dorsal hump and my forehead became flatter with more prominent brow bones. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, I just look like a straight fuck, honestly. I lost alot of weight before graduation and my babyfat on my face melted away and I thought I was decently attractive for the first time in my life. I was given so many comments after the summer before college from my old high school colleagues saying I looked different. I was being treated differently, too. But after the incident, it's like night and fucking day. I get treated by random cashiers and employees like I did before I started looking older as high school ended. It's absolutely painful.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's embarrassing to admit, and I make it sound like I was a fucking supermodel turned ogre in the above, but my confidence took a massive hit from it. Honestly, I went from pretty fucking ugly like, ""Damn, this dude's hopeless,"" to, ""Hey, I'll at least give him a chance."" People were actually approaching me. Not anymore. Back to high school.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The incident taught me alot, too. Alot of bad things about myself. After tons of self-reflection in isolation, I sit here at the end of 2018 with no appetite, no sex drive, no willingness to do anything. I achieved academic success, however, in the midst of this chaos, and I did not give a fuck. I have not had friends who respect me in over a year. I realized all my friends from high school were not good friends because I just hung out with whoever tolerated me. I filled my head with so many delusions that it drives me insane. I don't trust myself anymore, and self-doubt is a prime component of myself. My entire life is embarrassing to me now; I tried so hard to stay in denial about the person I am, but I can't keep pride in myself knowing the things I've done and now that I've realized how people have actually seen or see me. My personality has molded into what I have been suppressing all these years with delusions of self-improvement. I feel sorry for myself and want people to feel sorry for me. I no longer do what I want; I do what I think pleases other people. I can't handle stress. The best 4 years of my life will be filled with regret. The last 15 years were filled with embarrassment and time-wasting.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not excited about anything. I just don't feel like I'm cut out for this life anymore. Yes, my looks were a crutch (again, not a supermodel), but the optimistic and excited person I was doesn't exist. If he ever even did. I question everything about myself nowadays.

570,"So the other night my boyfriend and I got into a heated debate about racism, we are from different races, I won't disclose our races cause that's not the point. Anyway, he has a guy friend who he grew up with who says is like his brother but who I suspect of being a flat out racist, granted his friend has never said anything racist, but in conversation his friend defends political racists and chooses to not place himself in diverse settings (all his friends and community are of the same social class and race). So naturally I told my boyfriend that his friend is a bit of a racist and that his views and way of life are insulting to other social groups. I know everything around race and culture is real tense right now so naturally our argument escalated and very personal and deep things were said about me and my family and I just lost it and I punched my boyfriend in the face. I meant it more like a slap but it was harder than a slap and regardless a slap or a punch doesn't matter both are just as inappropriate and wrong. I honestly was so hurt by him defending his friend and putting me and my family down that I just didn't see him as my boyfriend in that moment. Granted I said things about his friend but I'm his girlfriend and I just wanted to feel protected and I didn't. I guess I just wanted to feel secure about my boyfriend (even though he is from another race) would still protect and validate my perspective against his friend's. I don't know guys, I feel really really shitty about the whole thing, I feel so much remorse, I even made an immediate therapy appointment today for anger management because I shouldn't have gotten that upset and now I don't even care about what my boyfriend and I were fighting about because I'm obviously not any better than a racist if I'm hitting people because of verbal things they say.

We are in our last year right now and I found out a few months ago that she likes me and has for a while. So we agreed that after we finished our semester cause we were both having a tough time with classes, that we would go out. I’m really good friends with one of her friends who tells me all the stuff she says about me. She always brought up about us going to the movies and how we should go.

573,"Hello,

I am approved off certain weekdays and this is done more than two weeks when the schedule change takes affect. I was scheduled on a day approved off and, when this is mentioned, also told I am responsible to find a cover. Is there anything I can do about this? ",17Dec2018,1
575,"Preface: it looks like this is the place to post something like this, but if there's a better sub for it then I'm happy to be directed in the right direction.   


Background: so I have this group of friends, and every week we get together for a friendly card game. We're all in our 20s and 30s, except one guy who is in his late 60s; we call him ""the Old Man"" because, well, we're not creative with our nicknames. We're always welcoming of new people, or ""new blood"" as we joke; lately, because of people moving away and/or just getting busy with life and family, we've been having a hard time making sure we have enough players per game, so ""new blood"" has become a focus for us.   


Situation, part 1: With that in mind, a couple weeks ago I invited this dude from one of my classes out to play. He made our fifth, the game went great, and everyone had a good time. Unlike other ""new blood"", he actually came back again the following week! Again, we had a great time and he got to meet even more of the usual guys. Absolutely nothing wrong...until I get a message today on our group chat. The Old Man won't play anymore if the new guy stays, because he's Korean. Yup, it's a race issue.   


Further background: Now to be fair to the Old Man, he did serve like 18 months on the DMZ. Everyone in the group knows he's a little racist, but we give him a little lee-way because...well, here's how I put it to the new guy before the first game: ""He can get a little racist, but not in a \*mean\* way. If he says something you don't like, tell him to fuck-off and we'll all just laugh it away."" And to be honest, I don't live in the most progressive area...it's not 1950s around here, but maybe 1980s still. Point is, the new guy wasn't fazed by the warning and knew just how to defuse a situation should one arise. But remember, it didn't. In the two games he played with the Old Man, not a single issue was raised about race.   


Situation, part 2: So the Old Man throws his temper tantrum and says he won't play if the new guy does. I'm honestly fine with that, he's doing it to himself if he wants to stay home, but the other guys are a little more sympathetic toward him and out-voted me. \*\*No one else has a problem with my Korean friend, and we'd all prefer to just keep playing cards.\*\* However, taking seniority into account, the Old Man's been with us since the beginning (almost a decade ago); the new guy's only played two games. Even though we all agree he's being a racist old bastard (it'd have been different if like the first time he saw the new guy he'd freaked out; the fact that he sat for \*two games\* before making an issue out of it means it wasn't some gut-reaction or PTSD, but a conscious decision), it fell on me to dis-invite our new player from the card game.   
Honestly, it was one of the most distasteful things I've ever done, and my stomach is still churning over it. He took it in stride, accepted all my apologies and assurances that we'll have games and hangouts he can come to in the future, but I just can't shake the feeling that he \*shouldn't have to.\* I'm the one who invited him out, I should have foreseen this. I suppose I just underestimated the fact that just because \*I\* don't see/care about race doesn't mean others don't or won't.   


Conclusion: At this point, it's almost all blown-over. My friend and I have plans to hangout later in the week, and the card group is good to go for our weekly game. A couple of the other guys are planning on talking to the Old Man, but I honestly still feel livid. I had the \*audacity\* to bring-out someone who the ""wrong"" shaped eyes or whatever, and he acts like a petulant child until the ""scary"" Korean goes away. I honestly just want to go punch him in the face, or at the least scream into it. It's like....this is someone I've considered a friend for a decade now, and here he is making me betray one of my basic principles, namely that we're \*\*all\*\* human fucking beings and \*\*all\*\* deserve to be treated as such.   


Idk if I'm actually looking for advice or if I just need to rant, but I'd welcome any if someone has it to offer. Yes, I know I could just walk away from the group; the goal here, however, is to keep the group intact, and me walking away would be just as much of a death-knoll as the Old Man doing the same. The other guys don't deserve that, so I do plan on staying. But how do I sit across the table from this guy from now on? How do I let it ""go back to normal"" and still make him feel like there were consequences to his actions? I don't know if there even is an answer to that, or if I'm just going to have to sit with this feeling for good. Idk. Shit sucks, man.

So this year I decided to go all out and buy my friend this really cute necklace she's wanted, and although it was a budget stretch of over 100$ (We are both college students, that's a good chunk of change) I thought it would be a great gift. When I went to purchase it online, before checkout there was the option to add a note and personalize the gift which I thought was nice, and I went ahead and wrote what I wanted the card to say. Fast forward three weeks when I received the package and make sure to see the card is in there, and find a card that looks like it has been written by an eight year old. I'm not sure what to do because it quite frankly makes the gift look cheap and shitty with this cat scratch writing, but I feel like it's such a stupid thing to complain about. The whole concept of the company is very sleek and chic, and this minor issue just doesn't fit their image. I was thinking of asking the company to send another card so I could re-write it, but also theres a part of me that thinks they should know that their personalized messages are being sent out looking like a letter to santa from a child. 

Any advice would be welcome, or you can call me flat out stupid for caring so much, but I just wanted to see what others thought!

So, the house across the way from me sold recently, and after the new neighbors settled in,  I decided to introduce myself and get to know them.

i don’t like my parents’ rules but i know as long as i am dependent on them i have to oblige. my parents don’t want me working unless it will further my career (so no starter jobs) but i want to start so that i can save up to buy a cheapo car so i don’t have to inconvenience them anymore. my dad is acting really weird about it and saying that he will give my boyfriend gas money (which would embarrass me ngl) and let him sleep on our couch (i would not be allowed to be with him though) just so i don’t have to go to his house and run up the car mileage.

it’s confusing me that they don’t seem to like me using their car yet don’t want me to work toward my goal of having my own car. does anyone have any tips on what’s going on or how to talk about this with my parents? any advice would be appreciated",17Dec2018,1

I am sick and tired of being depressed and I feel that as time goes by I am becoming more sad and mentally unstable. Therefore I want to change the way I act and grow up and be more responsible. Desperately so. I am willing to put in the work because otherwise I fear I will become insane.

599,"My friend and I have been friends since we were in our early teens (we’re both adults now) Not continously, there was a couple years in there, during high school where, things happen people grow apart from a bit but then everything went back to normal. She usually refers to me as her best friend, and I the same about her. However many times, particularly since we graduated high school and we both left for universities in different countries (we live in Europe), it’s come to my attention more and more that I don’t feel like she treats me the way a friend should.

I have always been there for her whenever anything has happened. If she’s mad or sad and needs a rant, I’m always there to listen. I always offer her a should to cry on, and try to give advice when I can. I feel that I do everything that a friend should, especially a best friend. However I feel that when the roles are reversed, I don’t get treated the same way. I find that my problems get brushed aside, usually acknowledged for a few minutes and then the conversation goes back to her. Our conversations in general seem to be this way too. Whenever we’re catching up, I never really seem to be asked how things are on my end, and when I am, I get to talk for a very short period before I get interupted and things go back to being about her. I don’t mind hearing other people’s stories, I really don’t, but it does get frustrating when I feel like all I’m listening to is the other person’s voice when maybe I’d have something I’d want to share too. It’s gotten to the point where I literally feel like she doesn’t even really know me anymore (how my likes and dislikes have changed over the years). I’ve noticed this through presents in recent years; I’ll get something for my birthday I haven’t been interested in for about a year but she doesn’t know that because she never takes an interest in me. 

I feel like I’m making all the effort in this friendship and I’m being neglected. The problem is, I’ve felt like this a lot throughout our years of being friends, and I don’t know if I should finally do something or just...keep dealing with it.

She was born in America, so were both her parents, AND her grandmother (couldn't find anything about her grandfather.) So she really has no immediate Italian family, and neither of her parents are even from Italy, giving her no reason to be going around saying she IS Italian. Don't get me wrong I like her and here music, but hearing her talk about being Italian all the time when she isn't just gets a bit annoying, people need to stop claiming their great great grand parents and even *ancestors* as their own.

605,"So I‘m in need of some advice. 

While out recently, I met/hit it off with - who I *thought* was - an amazing, single guy and ended up hooking up with him. But as we were making plans the next day, I began to notice ‘female touches’  in his apartment that I didn’t catch before (Chrissy Teigen book on the bedside table, a decorative frame that said ‘Me and You’). As alarm bells started going off in my head, I casually asked him if the Chrissy Tiegen book was his. He went quiet and finally said no. So with bile coming up my throat, I followed up with the inevitable question of, “Do you have a girlfriend?” To which he responded that he did. I immediately got up and left without a word, dinner plans long forgotten.

Even though I had **no** idea (and he had given **NO** prior inclination that he had a girlfriend...he acted super into me, never touched his phone besides to get my number, etc)., I can’t help but feel super guilty for - even *unwittingly* - helping someone cheat on his girlfriend. I’ve felt sick over it. I’ve never knowingly played in a role in someone’s cheating and never would. And honestly, I’m pissed on behalf of his poor girlfriend. From woman to woman, I kind of feel that she needs to know her boyfriend is going around behind her back...and proceeding to ask said girl(s) out for a second ‘date.’

What I need advice on is whether I should do anything to alleviate that guilt and expose the bastard for who he is...or just let it go. I easily found him on Facebook but, while I’ve found photos of who all signs point to being his girlfriend, I don’t know her name/identity (his friend list isn’t viewable and she isn’t tagged in the photos). I can continue to enlist all of my friends with sleuth skills to try and find out, and I even have ‘proof’ I could provide her (photos of him and me from that night, along with a screenshot of my Uber ride from his place after I stormed out). 

Do I keep looking for her so I can ease my guilt/apologize for my role in it? I don’t want to be creepy or overstep - and I really don’t wanna go ‘scorched earth’ on this guy (I wholeheartedly believe in karma) - but it also doesn’t sit well with me that his girlfriend probably has no idea. (I mean...we were making dinner plans for God’s sake? Thank God for Chrissy Teigen). I just know that I’d want to know if it were me- but I also recognize that she may not. And it may be none of my business. 

So do I tell her? Or do I just let it go? Appreciate any insight!

619,"Note: This account was created specifically for this post, as I don’t want anyone to discover that I posted this.

First, let me say a few things about myself. I’m a 15 year old male, have been a 4.0 honor roll student through JH and HS, am in my school’s honors society, and haven’t done any major wrongs against anyone. Obviously I’ve messed up and done some bad things, but I haven’t had any serious problems with anyone. I’m also relatively active in my church and do quite a bit around there and school.

My parents are similar. They were both very smart and successful students, both went to college and got PHD’s, and both teach at the local university. They had high standards for me from the beginning, and I have for the most part met them. Until now, and it’s begun to feel like no matter what I do, I will never be enough for them.

It started in my freshman year of HS, about a year ago. I started to lose the will to work as hard as usual on school assignments and was just sick of how my entire life was taken up my school. I still got my 4.0 and still did well, but I was losing motivation. My parents blamed it on me joining the basketball team, saying I was no longer fun to be around and had a bad attitude. I worked really hard to have a better attitude, but they never mentioned anything about it again. Then this year came around, and it started off rough. I had absolutely 0 will to put any effort in, but I forced myself to at least try. My grades weren’t as good as usual, so I put more effort in. Then school got harder. The assignments got longer, the material became harder to remember, and no matter how much effort I put in, even if I put in as much as I did before, I couldn’t do it. I went back to focusing my entire life on school, and it didn’t help one bit. I couldn’t keep up and I was not meeting the standards my parents had set. Then my dad talked to me about it, saying I needed to work harder and study harder. And he brought up basketball again, saying that it was distracting me and that I had never been the same since I joined the team last year. I told him that basketball didn’t change anything, and I wasn’t being distracted by it, but he wouldn’t hear it. He told me off, and we pushed it away till later. But recently, he’s been going at me, and I don’t know how to handle it. He is constantly negative toward me, saying my attitude is terrible and I never put any effort into anything. I can’t remember him saying a single positive or uplifting thing all semester, aside from the seemingly fake comments made when he felt bad about going off at me. Nothing I ever do seems to be enough for him or my mom, and I never meet their impossibly high standards. I know I will end up being a disappointment to them, as it has basically become clear to me that they expect me to do very well in school and go to the local university so I can stay at home with them, but my plans are to leave home after I finish HS. I understand their frustrations, but I feel like their standards they’ve set for me are too high and that it’s not fair that they put me down and make it very clear to me that I am not considered a success in the family. They have also made it very clear to me that they really don’t enjoy having me around, as my attitude is “terrible” and I am always “negative” and no longer the lighthearted and fun person I supposedly used to be. They tell me to act like part of the family and to pull my weight, yet shut me out and treat me as an outsider that was never part of the family in the first place. They show an extreme bias towards my sister (7), and they favor my brother (13) over me and don’t really try to hide it yet still sent it. It has become clear to me that they don’t really care what I do but still complain and get mad when I am not as successful as they wish I was. To be honest, I don’t want to be here as much as they don’t want me here. I cannot stand being constantly complained about and punished in ways such as refusing to take me to practices and taking my phone (that I paid for) away, and I have no interest in talking to them as I always end up being the bad guy and getting in trouble. I want to solve the problem, but I have no idea what to do and how I should do it.

TL;DR my parents have very high expectations of me and I have previously met them, but recently I haven’t been able to and they have been complaining about it and punishing me and making me feel like I am not wanted and that they are disappointed in me. I don’t know what to do about it, but I want to handle the situation as best I can.",17Dec2018,1

622,"Hello Reddit,

I’m going to write a full story because I need to write this off of me, Incase you want to give some advice but don’t feel like reading there’s a recap at the bottom. Thank you so much.

So about a year and a half ago I started a new study. In my class was this girl that immediately caught my eye. I was bullied a lot at my previous study so I didn’t have a lot of courage to talk to her but over the next month we finally got in a conversation. We talked, a lot, because we find out we both had depression we were dealing with and hadn’t told anybody. From there it took off. We talked constantly, both irl as texting. We got along great and it wasn’t long until I caught feelings for her. Only problem was, she has a boyfriend. 

I thought I might had a chance with her anyway and I really really enjoyed talking to her. When we had our Christmas break we were constantly texting, from “good morning” until “goodnight”, but not long after I decided to drop it. She was in a relationship and seemed happy so I gave her some space, stopped texting all that much and talked less to her. Mind you we were still getting along great, we were just talking less. 

All seemed fine again and I had a feeling my feelings for her were disappearing. However, in summer break a friend of us had a party and once again we got along great, really great. From there on out we were once again constantly texting and talking however this time my feelings doubled and we started to do more things, just the two of us. 

Not that long ago we went to see a movie together and we are constantly planning and doing other stuff. 

Our talks got even deeper (if possible) and we really know each other now. She knows everything about me and she even said “You know me better and know more about me than my boyfriend”. 

We play a sort of game where we just ask each other the deepest questions we can think of and when I asked what are the things you want to change in your life her relationship was her first point. She felt like he was immature and awkward, even after so long. Eventually she took action on this and sort of broke up but not really, they are still doing things together and she still has a heart with his name on her instagram and such. They are just spending less time together. 

I’m still single and never really had a girlfriend, I don’t have a lot of friends and been very lonely for quite some time now so we were talking about that situation one day. 

She was talking about how I should find a girlfriend which I just shrugged off and said that I wouldn’t know where to find one, to which she said: She could come from anywhere, maybe your closest friend? Being the idiot i am I didn’t ask any further. 

So anyways, right now it’s reached its peak. I really want to be with her, she is always the first thing on my mind, but also value her friendship and really don’t want to lose her. However I’m also feeling bad for keeping such a secret from her. So yeah. I’m completely lost. 

Coming Saturday we have a Christmas dinner with some friends and she will obviously also be attending. I’m really thinking about telling her. So dear people of Reddit, what do you think? Should I tell her? How should I tell her? Or should I just wait until her relationship is over and be here friend until then? 

So a recap:
Im single, depressed and lonely. I met a depressed girl with whom I had a great click and we talked and texted constantly however she had a boyfriend.  We get along great, text and talk constantly, from “good morning” to “good night” and she sent me a lot of mixed signals. We even do a lot of things just the two of us now. She is unhappy in her current relationship and I’m thinking about telling her I like her, however I don’t want to lose a friendship with her because she is so amazing and she is the first person in a long time that I trust, because of bullying. Been going over this in my head for over a year and a half and it’s driving me mad. Please help! I’m seeing her coming Saturday, should i tell her? How should I tell her?

624,"This is gonna sound like the most melodramatic ting ever but I need to vent.

I’m 17, I’m getting ready to go off to college.  Things are fine now.  I’m not super social but I have a tight knit group of friends I love.  I have social anxiety and opening up to new people is... HARD for me.  I don’t know how to go from casual buddies to hanging out and being friends.

The answer is probably just to ask... but I just lock up and I can’t talk or be funny like I can with my friends.  I turn... Boring.

Plus I’m 17, never been kissed, never been on a date, definitely a virgin.  I know I’m young but I thought SOMETHING would’ve happened by now.  I just really want a relationship and I feel like it’s not going to happen for me because of how anxious I am around new people :(

I’m hoping everything will be different in college.  I want to go somewhere with a great student life.  Everyone already knows me in high school and that makes me nervous, but in college I can reinvent myself.  Sometimes that makes me more confident.

Did any of you make a 180 in college?  I’m just super nervous I’m not gonna make any new friends let alone a relationship :(",17Dec2018,1

I've always been a shy kinda kid, I'm only 13 and feel like I got anxiousness around July of this year and felt super bad from watching a movie and seeing myself doing something from that movie, and got scared. My stomach started to hurt directly from that.

This year I've really tried to come out of my shell, if I wasn't already out of it, but I wanted to start talking to people I haven't talked to, mostly girls and boys I don't talk to much.

But after a pretty bad heartbreak I got kinda depressed since thanksgiving of this year, 26 days I've been sad about it, and I want to put old stuff behind us and be friends again, but I'm scared I can get arrested (I'm not going into it for privacy reasons) that's why I haven't told my therapist yet, next session is my second one, but I can't give this girl my gift that I wanted to give her since I haven't talked to her since I blocked her for my own mental health, I don't want to go crazy over a girl that made me so happy.

I can't go crazy over someone I don't talk to, this girl made me so happy and I fucked up so hard, and I've been a heartbreak solider since September (2018) been in my feelings about not being able to say sorry properly, but I feel like she hates me even more than she already does. I didn't have any harmful intentions and things got blown out of proportion, and I feel even worse, I can't stop thinking about her, it's everyday that she comes up, classmates are starting to say I made new accounts to talk to her, when I haven't done a single thing to her in TWENTY SIX DAYS, I've been going crazy over her, and every time I've seen her at my school (since she's a grade above, im 8th she 9th) I get so nervous, and don't want to mess up, I can't get arrested, and thats why I'm scared, I need to face my demons, but I'm afraid my demons can expel me or get me arrested, what should I do?

TL:DR I'm too scared to come out and face my demons about a very serious situation, but I'm too scared, what should I do?

After talking to her a bit, we decided it was best for her to go to therapy. She says that right now she’s been feeling okay, but she doesn’t want to feel like she used to. I asked her if she wanted me to make a Reddit post (seeing as I’ve never been to therapy before) about what happens, and what she should expect. One of her main concerns is whether or not to tell the therapist about her smoking in the past (she is underage, and has moved from 7+ cigarette to vaping), and worries about what stuff will be told to her host parents.

631,"I am a parent of an 11 year old girl who is by all accounts a great student, well behaved, never had issues with her. Her teacher is happy with her in all aspects as all her other teachers have been throughout the years. 

On Friday, my daughter broke her finger on a field trip. The school called me and I said that was fine I would being her to the emergency room after school. Her teacher told her to call me after school. So she walked to just inside the school gates ten minutes after school was released and called me. All of the sudden, I hear some teacher screaming at her to hang up the phone. She and all the other students have used their phones after school for many years. i have had three older children use their phones after school with no problem. This has never been an issue. My daughter started trying to explain to the teacher that it was her mother and she had broken her finger. The teacher screamed ‘I don’t care! You hang up that phone right now!’ So I told my daughter to give the phone to her. Immediately her voice changed. I told her it was now after school hours, there was never a rule about not using phones on school property and I was very angry at the way she spoke to my child. I then told her to give the phone back to my daughter who by this point was sobbing hysterically. I phoned the principal who apologized and promised to handle it. 

Cut to today, again my daughter calls me in tears. While the principal had a chat with the teacher who has yelled at Mary and told her it was unacceptable, one of that teacher’s friends stopped my daughter today and shouted at her to turn her phone off. Again this was after school. And my daughter wasn’t even on the phone, just had it in her hand which is not against school policy. I again called the school because this teacher is a known bully. The principal again apologized, but I am concerned about sending my child back as there is obviously retaliation for a mistake by a teacher, not for anything my daughter has done wrong, 

Any advice would be appreciated, I’m not a person who babies my children. And normally I side with teachers, but this is just ridiculous behavior. And it’s not on any of the phone policies the school has issued as far as I know. ",17Dec2018,1

633,"I met with my boss last week for my annual performance and salary review. She gave me a sheet of paper with my current year salary and the new salary for next year. She told me I was getting a 4% raise, that the 4% raise was based on her discretion, and that she wanted to reward me for a job well done. I was very happy, went home that night and told my family.

Then I looked at the paper. I did the calculation in my head and immediately thought something was wrong. I then went to my computer and did the calculations. It wasn't a 4% raise, but exactly a 3% raise. 3% is the raise my company gave this year if you are merely getting by in your job.

I emailed my boss the next day wondering what the truth was, explaining that she made it quite clear to me in our meeting that she was rewarding me with the 4% raise. She emailed by the end of the day to say that it was her mistake, that she had too many salary review meetings that day, and that I did not get the 4% like she said.

Needless to say, I am ***very*** pissed off.

635," Warning: this is gonna be pretty long-winded in order to explain everything without looking like I’m whining, so if you read through it all, props to you and thank you very much.

Okay, so to set the scene, I work at a little convenience store/pharmacy with a small store mentality. The hours are kind of weirdly organized and my manager will hire people to work just one shift for one day if people are consistently needing that day off. Or at least that's what she has done since I've worked there. I work on Mondays and used to work Saturdays from 8:45am-12:45. Recently she changed the Saturday schedule because ""too many people were wanting that day off"", so she hired another person to work my morning Saturday shift, and now I work every second Saturday (sort of).   
Apart from the brand new lady, there are 3 people (including me) who work that day in rotating shifts per week. One was hired around last month, we'll call her A- she only works Saturdays, and another who we'll call M. I'm not sure when M was hired, I've worked here since August and M works more days than me, so it's likely she's at a year my senior, max (though I'm thinking it's a few months or so). Anyways, up until the schedule change, I had never worked with A, and (thank god) only interacted with M in the 5 minutes before my shift ended, after which I was OUT of there.   
Let's just say, from the very beginning M hasn't been...the most pleasant to me. I thought she was alright at first, and I was hoping we could even be friends, since she seems to be around my age (I'm 18). The first Saturday in which I actually interacted with her however was not too good. I had done nothing to her, she would have absolutely no grudge to hold towards me or anything, she wouldn't have heard a thing about me from other coworkers either; my slate was clean, basically.   
The first Saturday, I was looking at candy expiration dates, as that was one of the tasks for the shift and I assigned myself the project to research them all and decode the expiry formats. I had several I wasn’t sure on and was full of questions. I asked M a few, and found her to be impatient and frequently seemed to misinterpret my questions (ie: Me: “So yeah we have to call the companies to figure out the format or to find out the day they go off?” M: “I just told you, yes we have to call the companies. The manager will have to do it”- I had to ask a few times to get the answer I wanted). She would act like I was acting stupid questions which in turn made me hesitate to ask her anything, so I didn’t really after that. Not really good when you’re still fairly new to the job and trying to learn things. But I shrugged it off and just assumed she was having a bad day, and would hide that when dealing with customers, which she acted pleasant to. The next weeks did not improve her attitude. On my birthday I got texts that someone caught the flu, bla bla bla, and M was going on about how C (the one who caught the flu, ironic since we get free flu vaccinations here), was looking pale as a ghost and faint etc, basically trying to guilt trip me into coming to work. I had plans to go out with my family later that day so I wouldn’t be able to work the full shift. They sorted it out 5 mins after I didn’t reply because I was discussing what to do.   
Then another bad interaction came again on another Saturday when I took my phone out for a small moment to quickly respond to a text from family. Phones aren’t allowed at work, but I’ve seen other workers have them for family issues and such. Even times when I’ve had my phone on me, I never ever use it, or abuse it (which is why they’re not allowed in the first place), and at the time there was literally no one in the store and I was walking back to my till. I took it out for like 10 seconds max. Saturdays aren’t busy days, especially in the morning. Yet M proceeds to try to tell me off, like a parent telling off a child, and says that the manager watches security camera footage back and I could get fired, etc. This is total bullshit because on Sundays there’s a guy that’s worked here for years and he will just sit on the stool and watch videos on his phone without hiding it, because Sundays are just that dead. I told her it was from family and could be an emergency which is why I checked and she’s like “I get messages all the time and I don’t reply to them” k cool, not the same thing though is it. I know I’m not 100% in the right for that situation, but honestly it’s not the end of the world and people do it all the time in any sort of work. It doesn’t hinder work in any way shape or form to just take 10 seconds to quickly type something then not use it for the whole rest of the shift.  
She often would try to exclude me from conversations with other coworkers. I'm used to exclusion and it's common here as most have worked here with each other for years, so they have all their inside jokes and whatnot. I don't really care. But it became apparent later when I thought about it that she just tried to change the subject while I was talking to a coworker so it would focus on her.  
Anyways went a bit off-topic. The point is she’s told me shit like this before that turned out to be baseless and completely untrue, and literally just used as threats. Now that I’ve been here a bit longer and know what I can and can’t get away with (no one is perfect, especially not me; this is my first “real” job and I’m grateful to my manager for being patient with some of the worse mistakes I’ve made), I recognize when M is just spouting bullshit.  
So back to the main topic: this Saturday, I worked with A for the first time. I have always been wondering if M has some personal grudge against just me or if she’s like that in general, because she acts all nice and buddy-buddy with the manager and senior coworkers, but turns out she is like this to anyone newer than her, it seems. Poor A has been working nearly every Saturday with M from 3-7, and she’s a sweet, polite girl who comes off as very shy and not a lot of confidence. The type that’s easy to push around. After talking for a while, I asked her how M had been to her, and mentioned how she acted a bit condescending to me and that I was wondering if she was that way towards everyone. A said “oh, I thought she was just being a bit rough with me because I was newer...”. From then, A confided to me that M had been talking to her condescendingly too.   
Not only this, but apparently she had been making lists of tasks every week for A to do on her shift, often giving A the harder ones like taking out the garbage, sweeping/mopping, cleaning the ice cream cooler, etc, while giving herself tasks like dusting the till. I hope this was just a misguided assumption from C (who is a senior coworker I’ve trained with, and also makes lists, but evenly tasked ones), but it looks to me like she is bullying A. Even more so when A said that she didn’t finish a task because M gave her so many, and M got mad at her, or that M often comes over and makes A answer her “surprise quizzes” while she is busy trying to do her tasks.  
I really really want to bring this up to my manager, because I don’t want A getting pushed around any more by M. But I'm not sure how to without looking unprofessional or like I'm complaining about nothing, and most of all I don't want to get A in trouble. However she told me some very important and key information that I wouldn't have ever known without her. I also don't know how believable I would be, since M seems to act nice as possible to senior workers, or anything about her past history that could influence her attitude or that people have complained about it before.M isn't nearly as perfect as she acts either. I distinctly remember my manager noticing that someone was selling people international stamps (which is in a clearly labelled bag in the stamp basket) as Canadian ones, and it was narrowed down to her being the cause.  
Additionally, I have to work with her this Saturday from 3-7, which I'm not looking forward to. I've never worked that shift so I'm not familiar with what tasks are normally done then, and I still wish to do my job, but not in M's way. I'm pretty good at keeping a calm mask and demeanor on in provoking or stressful situations, but when it comes to responding with words I always fail to say or explain something in the right way at the right time. I get nervous thinking of conflict which I absolutely hate, but if I know what situation I'm heading into and what I should do according to it, I'm a lot more sure of myself. I can trust myself to not respond to her if she does try to provoke me, and I'll make sure to be on my best behavior and be as professional as possible so M has nothing reasonable to complain about and to avoid conflict as much as possible during those 4 hours. Though the country music she listens to may just drive me insane...  
What should I do on Saturday if I come in and she's made a list for me like she has for A? How should I respond if she tries to order me around with tasks? Should I try to do my own thing, and/or ask someone else at work what tasks I should do for that shift? Should I mention the list thing to my manager and say I'd like our tasks to be picked beforehand equally by the manager, or something like that? What would you guys recommend?  
Thank you so much to anyone who read through this, I know it's super long-winded and a lot to take in, I just had to get my thoughts together and worries out of my system. Would really appreciate some advice on how exactly to deal with this situation.

I found out today that in my country, you can get a big chunk of your student loan if you have been sick, or if mental illness have inhabited your ability to study. 

I have never been diagnosed, but I definitely have problems with stress and other things that have given me study issues. To be clear it's nothing serious. The thing is, is that this program is really easy to take advantage of. To the point that you don't even need to specify your illness. This means that you can get up to 80% of your student loans deleted.

It should be quite obvious why this is interesting to me. And I am wondering if I should do it or not. Or at least try and talk to my doctor about it.
