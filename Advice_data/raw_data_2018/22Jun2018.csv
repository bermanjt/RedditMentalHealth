0,I found out that awhile ago a family member threw out my pet’s  ashes that were being stored at my mom’s house after I moved out. My mom told me this but she’s losing her memory and I’m not sure why my family member would do this? It upsets me and I would like to know the truth but I’m not sure if it’s worth asking the family member and potentially starting an argument.  Anybody have any thoughts or advice on what I should do?,22Jun2018,1
1,"I find it incredibly hard to move on from past grievances and trauma. I have admittedly had some quite bad shit happen to me, but I also have lapsed into being a victim rather than a survivor of those events. 

I have tried years of therapy, I’ve tried picking myself up and trying again, I’ve tried making peace with my abusers, I’ve tried forgiving them, I’ve tried cutting them out. I’ve tried changing my life in positive ways, focusing on me etc. And none of it seems to work for very long. I still hold deep and burdensome pain from everything that has happened to me. It’s making me bitter, resentful and is eroding me from the inside out. 

I don’t want to be like this. It’s holding me back and causing problems only for myself. How do I just let go of the past and focus on making myself happy now?

2,About two years ago I cut off one of my friends for being quite derisive and scornful. Especially when we were around his other friends. I tried talking to him to no avail and eventually made the hard decision to cut him off. However instead of being mad he seemed generally hurt by it. We've talked about three times since then and I've explained to him why I did it and he seemed to understand. Then today out of the blue he asked me to meet up with him and his brother for a few beers. I'm just torn between telling him no because I've been happier without him or going to meet him because we have a long history. What would you do in my situation and do you think it would be a bad idea to meet him? Thanks in advance for any help.,22Jun2018,1
3,"I have an odd problem, and I’ve never seen anyone personally that deals with this. No matter what I do, what kind of shoe or insert I buy, my shoes are rubbing the skin off my feet. 

If I wear flip flops, sandals, or any shoe with a strap along the bridge, the top of my foot will usually scar and blisters will form near my toes if I wear the shoe for more than one hour. 

If I wear sneakers, loafers, flats, anything else, the backs of my ankles are rubbed raw until my skin is peeling and I’m bleeding every time, and it never takes more that an hour, just like with the other shoes. 

I have tried

-Bandaids [sometimes I’ve layered a whole pack on my foot until it barely fits in the shoe and I still blister, just a little slower], medical tape and thick cotton gauze pads, sports tape, expensive socks and doubling up on socks. Nothing helps. 

-Body glide, lotion and anti rub. The chafing makes my feet peel and rash faster rather than blister, which makes showering painful. 

-Stretching and oiling my shoes. Trying sized up and down and shoes of different width. 

At this point I’d rather go around barefoot or in just socks if I could without it being weird. Does anyone else have tips for this? I’m almost running out of ideas!",22Jun2018,1
4,"My job is pretty independent - I am a merchandiser. But of course part of my job relies on things that get sent to me so I can do my job. 

So ... In March I planned ahead for Ice Cream season and went ahead and placed a large order for trays. These were never received. 

In April I placed two orders for displays, one was received, one wasn’t. 

In May, I placed a large order for displays to set up in stores ahead of Memorial Day sales. I had pre-sold a number of displays, needed to replace a good number, and knew I would need to order more once I got through those. It’s been over a month and they haven’t been received.

Typical turnaround is 1-2 weeks depending on which distribution center the product is coming from. 

The other products that get sent to me directly from 3-rd party companies have no problem getting to me. 

I place orders by emailing my supervisor the quantities of what I want, and what store it’s for.... and then pray it shows up. I’ve sent him half a dozen emails, tried to contact the distribution center directly, but have no idea what to do. My supervisor says the regional manager is “aware” of the issue. 

I’m months behind on stuff, my credibility has been shot in stores because half the time I try to order things they end up never being delivered or out of stock, and my entire bonus and like 40-60% of my performance review is based on meeting a set number of displays placed this year.  

I have absolutely no idea what to do. 

Tl;Dr- I need packages to do my job which my company seems to somehow be incapable of sending me and I’m not sure what to do. Performance review and annual bonus rely on displays placed. ",22Jun2018,1
5,"Hey Reddit.  Im having some issues with one of my best friends of about 10 years.  We have been close the entire time and recently we got into an altercation (over nothing really, we were intoxicated).  During the fight we were yelling more than we ever have before and he decided to take both of his balled up fists and push me in the chest hard enough to later leave a bruise.  So I hit him.  Not really hard about 60&amp;#37; with a right hook to the cheek. i felt threatened enough by his actions to fire back.  Im totally ok with the fact that i hit him, he deserved it for putting hands on me first and what did he expect i was also intoxicated.  Right after i hit him not only did i apologize i gave him the chance to hit me back to make it even.  He declined to hit me.  This post is about what is happening after.  this happened about 3 weeks ago and we have since made up.  So i  thought.  Now hes acting all shady trying to do things behind my back, im almost positive he has stolen things from my house.  I know that i need to get away from him.  And  stay away at least for a very long time.  The question is how.  He has a bit of a drug habit and it tends to alter his state of mind in a very aggressive way and is now beginning to alter his judgment even when he is not using.  They say that your best friend is also your worst enemy, which is what im worried about here.  He knows all about me my habbits my house, how to know when im not home (i live in an apartment building but still).  so how do i make this dude realize I dont want to talk to him without any hard feelings? is that possible? If youve made it this far thanks for reading anything you have to say is much appreciated.",22Jun2018,1
6,"First of all, I want to say, I really am not trying to self promote myself, I just genuinely want to know if this is a good or a bad idea. I flip my own opinion constantly and would like some outside opinion to help me weigh in. If this is a bad idea, I want to know before I sink any more time into it. 

I created a Youtube channel where I take videos and edit them in such a way that it only leaves in the silent/breathing parts and cuts out all the dialogue. 

[It’s called Silenced. Here's a link if you want to see what I'm talking about.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv1WSXbckPWRbWu1sSj4qAg/videos)


I can’t tell if this is a decent idea for a Youtube Channel or not. Part of me is saying yes as it is simple, predictable-ish content that should be funny and that I can make regularly and people could watch regularly. The other part of me is saying no and that no one is interested in watching content like this. Also maybe it isn't even that funny?

Also, does this fall under fair use? I think so but I would like to know what other people think.  Will I have constant problems with Youtube?

Would you watch videos like these? Multiple videos like these? Would you come back to see your favorite show get “Silenced” or is a Youtube channel without a “personality” behind it deemed to fail?   ",22Jun2018,1
7,"My friends and I have been talking for 6 months about talking to our friend about his girlfriend we hate. She doesn't take the effort to get to know his friends other than his roommates, when she does hang out with us she doesn't engage or get to know us. That isn't really what set us off, but its the fact she is crazy, we've heard stories from him about her that he just seems to look the other way about the craziness. My non mutual friend I was talking about her with, and he said without knowing the 2 of them personally, but said "" she is bat shit insane"" from the stories I told of her. We want to talk to him before its too late and he makes up his mind about her and taking the next step. We've talked for a while but never really know what to say but mostly how to begin the conversation. We are 5 best friends since we were all in the same 1st grade class in 1999. We have done everything together for almost 20 years and so thats what make this conversation tough to bring up. He is our best friend and we know we have to do it next weekend on our annual Fort Lauderdale trip when its just the guys. But as I said before we don't know where to begin or what to even say. Its tough telling your best friend that the rest of his best friends don't like the girl he's ""in love"" with and he can do better and not fall for all that crazy. Maybe someone has been in a situation like this and can offer some advice?

Please don't give us the "" if he's happy let him be happy"" that doesnt help anyone.",22Jun2018,1
8,"I was a loner in high school with not many friends. I didn't do much either other than jerking off and playing video games and never leaving the house. I got a part time job after high school and started attending CC. I finished my first year very well academically but didn't meet new people or do anything outside of work and school. School ended a month and a half ago, and I've spent nearly every single day this summer just inside the house. I never leave the house other than work. I've thought about my life alot and it's been killing me. Alot of the anxiety I've been giving myself stems from not knowing what other people my age do and what I should be doing as well.

9,"First of all English is not my first language so you'll have to excuse my bad grammar. So I'm 18 and my sister is 22, we've had a shared bedroom since we were little so it was always difficult for me to find the proper moment to masturbate, so I usually do it when she's out with her friends. Tonight she wasn't home so, like always, I laid on my bed and started doing it... problem is, I had a really long day and felt very tired, so I passed out without even noticing. Next thing I know I woke up to my sister pausing my video (I apparently picked a long video) and then going to bed saying she was sorry she woke me up and nothing else, she didn't mention in the slightest the fact that I was masturbating. Now, I'm not really ashamed about it, we've always had the kind of relationship where we'd see each other naked like it was normal, but rather it just feels very awkward and I don't know what to do. Should I just ignore it like she did and never bring it up again? Or should I confront her about it? I'm just worried this might make our relationship as siblings too awkward. ",22Jun2018,0

11,"How do I tell our friend to stop coming over without being invited and not respecting our time by staying at our apartment for 6-10 hours any time they come over? I'm willing spend time studying and play DnD with him, but any time he comes over he stays forever and my gf gets annoyed because she can't focus, or upset because she gets excluded inadvertently (death or plot-wise) from our campaigns.

Background:

My gf and I have a friend that comes over to study a lot, and they often show up unnanounced and way past their welcome. They need a lot of help since they have moderately severe ADHD, and can't follow along with the long lecture very well. We can't tell them to leave easily since they have to get their mom pick them up or we drive them home. We all are in the same math class, and since there is a midterm tomorrow and a lot of homework, I told our friend after class that we can study tonight, but I'm going to be busy after class so I didn't give them a time or place. While I was out, our friend showed up at our apartment without asking me or my gf, and I specifically did not tell them to go to our apartment since the gf was feeling sick today and I didn't want him to bother her.

I get home about 3 hours after class, and I walk in to see the two playing video games. I was pretty annoyed and nagged her for gaming instead of working on any of the homework or studying while I was gone. If it had been just her at the house, I wouldn't have been upset since she was feeling sick and didn't seem to have much energy this morning. But since our friend was there, and he needs a lot of time to understand anything and get things done, I was hoping that she would've gone over what she missed in class today and done some homework at least. She said she was waiting for me to get home since she didn't know when I would get back (I was working on my bike so I didn't know either, but she was texting me and calling me a bunch). I told her that since I already know the material from the last time I took the class, I don't need to study as much, and even if I did I wouldn't have been mad about studying without me since they could literally just go back over it when I got back. 

Now my gf is studying separate from us, while I'm too upset to focus and our friend sits in the living room blasting audio and probably needing me to help with a problem but not asking me since I've been mad since I got home.

TL;DR:

My gf and I's mutual friend comes over uninvited to study with us, but today I was busy and out for a while. I come back and my gf and friend are playing videogames instead of studying while I was gone for 3 hours. He is a major distraction to her studying and we can't get him to leave quickly since he needs driven home. We have a midterm and lots of homework due tomorrow, but now my gf left to a library because I nagged her for not studying while I was gone. I don't want to just kick him out since he needs a lot of help because he has ADHD and is our DM, but I'm getting really annoyed about him not respecting our time.",22Jun2018,1
12,"Hi!

My terrible sleep schedule is messing up a lot of aspects in my life. I keep sleeping at 6 am and then when I try to set an alarm around 12-1 pm, I always just snooze it (even if the alarm is far away) and sleep till like 3-4 pm.

I'm not sure how to approach this problem anymore because I've tried doing an all-nighter but no matter how sleepy I feel in the evening, my mind just can't help it but feel like I'm losing time to be productive and I sleep past 12 am. (Even if I stay awake, it's even worse because most of the time I don't do anything productive because I'm too ""tired"")

I feel like I CAN'T sleep before 12 am, I'm a super night person and not a morning person. This could totally be fine if I ACTUALLY SLEPT AT 12, and WAKE UP at like 7-8 am... or even 1-2am to 9-10 am since I still get my good ol' recommended 8 hours of sleep. (but 7-8 is probably the best since many classes I get tend to start early morning)

Another problem that adds up on it is that after a long day and coming home in the evening, I accidentally nap and wake up 10-12 pm. I really wish I could incorporate an afternoon nap into my schedule because I feel like that'll help so much but classes are always at those times.

So, morning classes would be like 8/9 am... meaning I would have to wake up at least 7/8 am... I'd stay up, get very little sleep, wake up, go to class, come home, stay up even though I didn't get sleep, oversleep the next day, and continue sleeping late, waking up late till the next class where I get no sleep again and possibly run late. *Cycle continues/worsens.*

**TL;DR \^ This last paragraph \^ is actually a pretty good summary.**

14,"There’s this woman I work with (fast food). Over the last two years, we became good friends. Last Christmas, she told me about a few difficult things she was going through so I got her this big gift to cheer her up. She loved it and kept saying how much she appreciated me. Over the next few weeks, we were doing things together like going for night time drives and coming over to each other’s house to watch movies. During this time, she revealed that she was in a very abusive relationship a few years ago where she was beaten and raped during it. I feel like this is relevant to the story.

One day, she asked to kiss me and one thing led to another and we got together. She told me to keep the relationship a secret since she’s a manager at our workplace and it might cause some drama so I did. Everything was going great for two weeks and I was the happiest I’d ever been in years but one day she just stopped talking to me. She wouldn’t answer my messages very often unless it was something important. I waited a week and finally asked her about us and she told me that we should just be friends and that her reason was that she’s scared of commitment and hates relationships. This was about two months ago.

After it ended, I started going through some hard times. A bunch of stuff hit me at once and I tried to commit suicide. When I was up on that bridge with the police, I told her what had happened and that I’d be in the hospital for a few days and wouldn’t be able to work.  She felt awful and believed it was her fault but I’ve told her multiple times that it was family issues that caused it (which is true).

All of this happened in the span of two months. Everything has settled now and we’re both still good friends but I’m having lots of trouble moving on. I just want to go back to when we were sitting in my room watching movies together but I can’t. I’ve never met someone like her before, even before we got together she was the closest friend I’ve ever had and seemed like the only one that cared about me at the time. I understand why she doesn’t want to date but I don’t know how to get over having such a good friend. She was the only person that checked in on me when I was in the hospital. Nobody else bothered to call or message me to see if I was alright.

15,"I was offered a promotion with a raise this week and am prepping to make a counter offer. I’m really bad in situations like this and I want to make sure I don’t counter too high or too low. 

Here is some background info. I work for a private company in the healthcare industry. I would be shifting from the team lead to department supervisor. I’ve been with the company for over 2 years. I started in an entry level position and this will be my 2nd promotion.    Prior to this job I had no background in healthcare. 

The details: The initial offer they made is for 18.50 an hour. I am currently making 17.28. For the prior promotion I was bumped from 16.00 an hour to 17.28. At the time, I didn’t make a counter (I was promoted in under a year and was not expecting it).  Based off the research I’ve done the range for similar titles in my area is 56-37k a year. 

My boss was a little taken back when I mentioned I had been doing research and that the low end of the spectrum would be 40-44k. I let her know I would like to think about it and would get back to her Friday. My gut is telling me that I should ask for around 42k a year. I’ve got limited experience and there is plenty of room for continued growth. Previously we had discussed and created a job description for Manager of my department. After all the internal HR discussion happened it was adjusted to supervisor as an intermediary step. During the job offer my boss made it clear that their intention is for me to be the manager but that upper management wanted me to get more experience first. 

TLDR; I’m getting a promotion and don’t know how much to ask for in a counter offer. Please help. ",22Jun2018,1

24,"So, it's my first post in here. I'm usually not very social (because of reasons?) so I basically am here on reddit to read some interesting stuff from people. But this time I feel like I really could need some advices about getting new (possible) LGBT friends (plus I'm really wanted to talk about it).

So long story short, I work in a telemarketing center by the 11am turn, but times from times I change turns with people from the afternoon (01 pm - 03 pm) turns when they (or I) need to (I'm actually one of the only ones who do that with them). The people from the night are very cool and they seems to like me as much as I liked them.

One time when I changed turns, I met this girl who was very extroverted (quite the opposite of me) and I became very relaxed around her. She was always asking me to her friends and go out with them to gay bars parties around my city (she even where pointing some tips that she knows that I'm gay, since she didn't stop talking a friend of her she would like to present to me). 

Well, the thing is: I have a lot of issues around my social skills (it taked at least 17 years to bring friends to my place). On top of that, I'm also not that party monster type of guy (as I stated to her, I prefer nice and calm places like the movies or the bookstore) and I was told once (a few times) that my attitudes was pretty party killer (like don't drinking alcohol because of some or how I don't know how to interact with new people).

But yet, I liked her and I really want to know her friends. By this view, it's the chance to do what I always wanted (I can even find some nice guy to hook up with), but I feel like my social awkwardness will rotten the moment.

Also, I was taught in the christian traditional way, some part of me still are very guilty about whish to go in the ""wrong way"" by going into wildly parties in the night and enjoy my youth when I still have time (I know this sounds like bullshit, but I couldn't help but feel like that).

25,"I have a friend I have known since high school. Let's call him Joe. This will be a long post, but please read to the end.

Joe and I don't live in the same the same state, so we don't hang out much. We occasionally talk to each other on the phone, but mainly communicate through Facebook messenger. We tend to give each other a hard time on a variety of things, but we agree that it's all in fun and nothing serious is to be taken from it.

This past Sunday, I had a family dinner event to attend. Joe wasn't doing much that day other than watching a particular TV show and running errands. I arrived a bit early for the dinner event so I went to a local bar for a couple of beers. Joe tends to quiz me on this particular TV show that airs every Sunday from like 11am until 11pm just to see if I'm watching it.

This past Sunday was no different. I was asked a question about the show that I would have been able to answer had I watched the show or googled the answer. In hind sight, I wish I had just googled the answer. Anyway, I said I would have to ask someone to how to make something that pertained to the quiz question. Joe replied back saying that I didn't need to ask someone how to make something had I watched the TV show that Joe was watching. He also said that I thought my dinner event was more important than watching the TV show. I replied back saying that the dinner event was important.

Joe then replied back saying ""see why I don't come to visit, I have more important things to do."" I said ""yeah, you don't want to come because you want to watch the TV show. You can watch it here."" Joe replied back with some very inaccurate statements saying I was doing something else all morning and up to the time of the dinner event. There was no factual basis to support this, but again it was presumably all in fun as mentioned earlier.

Later that evening, I was watching the TV show in question and it was a new episode. Much like Joe quizzes me, I quizzed him to see if he was watching. This was done via messenger but there was no response. I kiddingly gave him a hard time about not watching the show and he seemingly got all defensive about it. 

M: I made it back to watch the new episode of the show
J: what's your point
M: simply that you give me a hard time about not watching it and you appeared to not have watched the show.
J: you were giving me a hard time about not watching it all day yesterday
M: I don't think so
J: look back at what you said yesterday
M: I just did. I didn't say anything that would be considered giving you a hard time
J: you said I don't want to come because I watch (TV show)
M: you're mixing things up. I was simply saying that you can come here and we can watch (TV show).
J: I'm done with you

This was followed by abruptly resigning from two games of Words with Friends that were in progress and then unfriended me from that app. Joe unfriended me from a social beer app. He then went to Facebook and unfriended me. I didn't immediately know that this happened. On Wednesday,I was able to send Joe a message on messenger asking what's up. I know he saw my message, but then he proceeded to block me on messenger. I've since sent to emails asking him to call so we can discuss this and make things right, but he's giving me the silent treatment. I recently initiated a Words with Friends game with him. It took less than 10 minutes for him to choose to decline playing.

27,"I want to make an apology to a friend that I cared about, and need help in how I should go about it. Context for full scope of the situation: I made a pretty big mistake about two to three  months ago in asking out a pretty good friend of mine that I had a quite possibly mutual romantic interest in out on a date. I had these feelings for her for a very long time and they just sort of all came out at once and in the heat of the moment I just felt like I had to say something about it. When all these complex emotions were running through me, I hastily sent her a text to ask for a date. She said no now in hindsight pretty expectantly. In the begininning I was satisfied, I got the yes or no I had wanted for so long, and I was no longer feeling so stressed out about it reading all these maybe signs and maybe hints that she was interested. The next day I look back to the conversation and realized what I said could only have been interpreted as me asking her out to be in a full on relationship, not at all what I wanted. Things are further complicated when I (uncharacteristically) completely forgot that she was going through a very rough time, being told that she may have cancer. Good news is she did not have cancer, getting the results back the day after the text occurred, and same day I read back what I had said. I felt extremely shitty about what I did for several weeks, not being able to get over that I had messed up so spectacularly. So much so that I was losing sleep and lost a lot of motivation to do any work outside of school. In that time I had so many more different emotions swelling about inside that I decided it was best to not apologize and potentially make an even grander fuck up that we will both awkwardly acknowledge happened without saying specifics. Now that time has passed, we both talk to each other like we used to and I don't have such powerful emotions brewing up, ready to burst, I feel ready to go back to that moment and apologize for any grievances I may have caused her and explain what happened. 

So how should I go about getting my message across that I am sorry for what I did? Like do I do it in person, where would be an appropriate place to do it if so, do I go for a full on apology with explanation, do I ask for forgiveness/ do you accept my apology, and should I even do one to begin with. Details like that would be helpful because I think she is a good person that I did care about and I want to make what feels wrong, right without making another unfortunate mistake.",22Jun2018,2
28," I'm 23 and have been living at home with my parents for about a year since graduating from college. I currently work as a teacher and commute 45-60 minutes to work. I can't afford rent for a 1-bedroom apartment on my own right now (unless I use a big chunk of my savings), but I've been looking for a roommate as another option so that I can move out of my parents' house. I have a boyfriend who is also living at home while he finishes school. I intend to find an apartment with him in about a year when he's finished with his degree. 

This may be a very obvious choice but as I'm very emotionally wrapped up in it and having a very hard time making a decision, I figured I'd ask for advice. I basically have two options:

1. My parents have offered to allow me to continue living at home for another year, rent-free. I would be doing some housework, paying for gas/food, and I would have to continue putting money into my savings account. Pro: my parents are pretty chill and generally don't have many ""rules""; they're fine with my boyfriend coming over and staying the night, etc. Con: I'd feel like kind of a loser for still living at home while I can reasonably afford moving out and living with a roommate.
2. I move out, find a roommate, and pay less rent than I would be if I were renting on my own. Pro: I'd feel like less of a loser and would have more independence. Con: I don't know anyone looking to live in the area where I work, so any roommate would essentially be a stranger.  I'm very introverted and had a few bad ""random"" roommate experiences in college, which makes me hesitant to live with someone I don't know well. 

Thank you for your advice! :)  ",22Jun2018,1

Recently I’ve considered alternative employment and then came across a non traditional method of making a living, basically figuring out how to be a professional dungeon master (I LOVE dungeons and dragons). It won’t be as much money but I don’t have any bills currently anyways. I just think I would be much happier doing my own thing than working a standard job.

30,"To keep it short, I failed one class for my graduate program last fall when I was laid off from work. This put me below a cumulative GPA of 3.0. I switched to part time for the winter quarter in order to find a new job and to allow me to refocus on my school work. In both the winter (3 credits) and spring (back to 6 credits) i achieved a 3.33 GPA, but my cumulative ended up as a 2.87....I have been dismissed, but am appealing. Below is a copy of my appeal, I am not sure how to improve it or what my chances are. Anyone have experience with this that can help or any advice on how to improve my appeal? I am 7 classes short of my MBA and have been attending this school since 2014, earned 2 bachelors and have paid in full and on time every time. This is the only class I have gotten below a C and it is really getting my down. My adviser informed me this has to go through her, her boss and the graduate college and must be approved by all.

To Whom it May Concern,

I am writing this letter to appeal my dismissal from X University’s MBA program due to the failure to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0.

Last December I submitted an SAP appeal, which addressed the circumstances of how I ended up on academic probation. I do not believe I could provide a better summary so I have quoted it below:

“During the last fall quarter, 2017, I received a F in X. This grade lowered my cumulative GPA below a 3.0. I received this grade because I failed to receive satisfactory grades on the assignments. On August 25, 2017 I was unexpectedly fired from my job as a X for X, a pharmaceutical supply company. The loss of my job was sudden and I was completely unprepared for it. I am the sole wage earner for a family of six, four children my spouse and myself. At the time that I was let go I was offered no severance, no continued health care (the cost of Cobra was \~$2100 per month) and had not been actively looking for other employment. My wife and I were suddenly faced with no way to continue to care for our family and the horrible feeling and worry of not having health care for four children. As a father, I knew my priority was to care and provide for our family and immediately concentrated all of my time on finding new employment and negotiating a severance package with my former employer. Luckily, some close friends were able to help me secure a temporary position as a laborer with a small local contractor. Unfortunately, between this temporary work, which averaged 10-12 hours per day, my job search and dealing with my former employer I ended up losing track and not prioritizing my academic work.”

For the winter quarter of 2017, I only registered to take one class. I decided to keep this part time schedule in order to allow me to be able to regain my focus on school, while also continuing my search for new employment. During the winter quarter I succeeded in both finding a new career as a X with X and achieving my highest quarterly GPA since starting the MBA program. Unfortunately, since I was only taking 3 credits this was not enough to raise my cumulative GPA above a 3.0. During the spring quarter, I returned to full time status and was able to establish a new balance between school, work and family. I again achieved my highest quarterly GPA since starting the MBA program. At the end of the spring 2017 quarter, my cumulative GPA still fell short of a 3.0 by .13. 

This news was devastating to me. I have been attending X University since 2014, earned two undergraduate degrees from X and have only failed this one class. Currently I am seven classes away from obtaining my MBA. I have no greater desire than to finish my MBA at X University by the end of the winter quarter of 2018.

In order to achieve this goal I will continue to improve on the school/work/family balance that I have achieved. There is room to improve by using better time management tools, specifically my digital calendar, for scheduling class work time, especially before and during mid-term and final exam periods. This will ensure I have set aside the appropriate amount of time for assignments and studying without interference from work. Another improvement that I will implement is to more often take advantage of the on campus resources that Drexel provides, including tutoring, the writing center and when appropriate meeting with my professors in person to discuss progress in my courses. I will also schedule a face-to-face meeting with my advisor and re-evaluate my plan of study, adjusting it to meet my graduation goal and using it as a pathway to success. 

Since my employment issues have been resolved, I have had the time and peace of mind to be able to concentrate on my studies and make them a priority again. I do not foresee any additional issues with my family or my employment that will interfere with my course work.

I wish to also take this opportunity to express my willingness to meet in person to further discuss my status, the circumstances that led to this current situation and the improvements that will be implemented. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime at X for any clarification or additional information.",22Jun2018,1

32,"I’ve been interning for nearly 7 months. There is a senior manager who clearly favors the other interns (4 male and I’m the only girl) over me. 

He doesn’t supervise us but sits near us. It’s obvious that he’s more comfortable with talking to them than to me. During the few times we sat next to each other at meetings, he’d lean away from me (I DON’T smell or wear perfume) and appear uncomfortable. He’d also jump and flinch whenever we nearly run into each other as I round the corner. Whenever he acknowledges me and the other interns, he’d say my name last. 

I’ve tried making conversation with him, but he’s very aloof around me. It’s gotten to the point where I deliberately avoid walking past his desk. I can’t believe I used to have a slight crush on him - he’s become my least favorite person at work. 

Im confused because other managers/coworkers are very friendly towards me - most of whom are older women.

35,"I referred my friend to this company and we both started working there. She kind of acts like she knows it all and seems like she’s interrogating me sometimes. She was a good friend but now seriously getting on my nerves. It could be because of my own insecurities too.

We’re both entry level/interns so a lot of the stuff we do is grunt work with an occasional project. In the beginning my friend did all the grunt work and I got the special projects, but now the roles have switched.

Today my manager assigned us both a project that was just data entry/grunt work. We didn’t have a deadline and it could be done whenever. However, my boss assigned her a special project and she comes up to me and says “you have to do my part too since I have something else to do” in a rude way. Since the grunt work project had no deadline, there is no reason she couldn’t have done it when she was done with her special project. And our boss assigned the data entry to both of us so she had no right to assign he her work.

Even though my boss did assign me some special projects in the past, I get super jealous when my friend gets new work and she rubs it in my face. For some reason I feel like she thinks she’s better than me and gets super competitive which I don’t like. 

I don’t want to ruin our friendship because we’re super close, however I’m getting sick working with her

It isn't too bad but it looks like I had butt acne. I dont mind it because it is so much better than dealing with staph infection but the scars make me self-conscious of what my FWB would say if he saw it.

40,"Tl;Dr: Roommate got fired over sexual harassment towards a minor. Has no recollection of doing so. We think his account was hacked. How do we clear his name and get his job back?

Today my roommate got fired from MalWart as soon as he clocked in. Apparently, a girl (minor) he had a falling out with a couple of years back in high school as friends claims that he sent her sexual messages and even a dick pic.

My roommate was confused when told about it and has no record of the conversation because he hasn't spoken to this girl in years. But the manager of the store had a print out of the messages. 

My issue is from the way they were described, my roommate doesn't talk like the messages do. He's either very formal or silly in his messages. He talks like an old person on messenger. The messages the girl received say something about him ""being too big"" to find anyone, despite that he's engaged to my other roommate who...well quite frankly loves their sex life.

The girl apparently asked ""What about your boo?"" And whoever responded didn't use my other roommate's name. He always uses her name, especially if it her people don't call her by it.

This is just all to suspicious because he hasn't spoken to this girl or even seen her at work that often. Plus, we think that this may be havking done by someone we all know who likes my roommate and wants to fuck him, but can't cause 1) he's straight and 2) he's engaged. This guy doesn't like me or my roommate's fiancee and has been known to have other people's Facebooks, phones, email, and has even driven someone to suicide before.

My question is, what do we do? We've tried looking up how to handle it on Facebook, went to the cops, tried seeing if there was another account in his name and none of that helped.

So where do we go from here?",22Jun2018,1

I’ve spoken to our landlords, who have said that it’s just him up there. And while I’ve never heard anything get physical up there or heard another voice or anything resembling physical abuse, there are days when I hear our building’s outer doors slam, the hallway stairs creak, the upstairs door slam, and within seconds it’s shouting and screaming and cursing, “fuck you” this and “bitch” that and I know that I’ve heard “you stupid cunt” at least twice since living here.

I have no reason to believe there’s anyone being abused inside the apartment since I’ve never heard anyone else up there. But it’s such a recurring thing that I can’t help but worry something is going on that’s hurting someone. Is he just ranting and raving over the phone (or at no one because he’s possibly slightly unhinged, which is a separate problem), or is he ranting and raving and hurling verbal abuse at someone who doesn’t ever show any resistance at all?

47,"Last grasp here - given our circumstances would you elope or have a wedding?

We   are 35 f/m got engaged last August and were so excited about having a   wedding (we booked our venue before being officially engaged). Budgeted  around 10k but the costs are slowly creeping upwards  to 14k.  We own a  home, have a dog, and would be using the majority of our savings to pay  for the actual wedding.

At this point,  we're about 100 days out, have not sent save the  dates or invites yet,  and we're considering eloping to save money and go on a  honeymoon we  can't afford if we pay for the whole wedding. We have already spent  4k  in non refundable expenses and have told out of town guests/friends  the  date.  There is some anxiety on behalf of the bride about having a   wedding that doesn't measure up to her other friends' weddings or   expectations.  Crazy family dynamics are also involved - two sets of   divorced parents, no invitations to aunts/uncles/cousins and family   pressure there.  Groom also changes mind regularly about wanting a  ""party"" and eloping.

Eloping and having a  party later is not an option - the ""party"" is the 13K of our expenses.  The wedding itself would be the marriage license and maybe a bottle of  champagne to celebrate after.  We don't have to pay for our officiant if  we have a wedding.

We know this - we want to get married to each other. We want to have photography of our ceremony and an awesome honeymoon.

48,"I'm from the South. On my dad's side of the family my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and (to a lesser extent) cousins are all a bunch of racist idiots.

I've been dating a non-white girl for about six months. I don't wanna say her ethnicity, cause she occasionally reddits. They all know that she isn't white, and like don't seem to care. They keep bugging the shit out of me to bring her over. I straight up told them that I'm not bringing her over until I go at least five visits without them saying something racist. I've been keeping a log too. Needless to say they've been failing miserably.

It's mostly my grandma and grandpa. I'm pretty sure the rest of them have IQs just high enough to hold back any racist remarks they would make if she wasn't present.

I don't want it to sound like they're like KKK members or something. They aren't that type of racist if that means anything. They're the type that when they see a news story about a black guy committing whatever crime, they'll feed the need to drop the n-word. Or a story about immigration will be on the news and they'll feel the need to comment about how the ""Mexicans need to go back where they came from"". We're Italian, so every time they say this I tell them they need to go back where they came from also. I don't know, maybe that does make them as bad as hate groups. 

Like I've told her all this, and why I won't bring her over. But I don't know how to explain to her not to take it seriously if they were to saying something. Like I tried telling her that that town we're from has been deeply racist since the beginning of time, so the people like my family that have lived there their entire lives have never had to interact with people that are different from them. But like I don't even buy that because it's not an excuse. They're the ones that are wrong. Theres no getting around that. So like who am I to tell her not to take it seriously. That's completely ridiculous thing to say, so I don't even know why I typed it. I really do hate this aspect of my life. It's making me crazy.

Anyway, I told her that if she doesn't want to have to deal with this situation and not meet them, that I would understand 1000%. But her being the sweetest person on the planet said that she wants to meet them because it's an important part of our relationship. I also ensured her that if we are visiting and they say something racist, I'm always going to be on her side, and I'm going to tell them off and leave. 

I just don't know how to best approach this, or if what I've done so far is correct.

So this all started when I left home to go find some work in another city. It was the first time I left home to live somewhere else so my mom kept in contact with me a lot. I told my friend that I was leaving for a bit and he was pretty shocked. I felt pretty bad cause we used to hangout a lot and had a good friendship. So I left and after a month or so I started to feel like something was off. My friend would randomly text me (which isn’t that weird for him cause he’s kinda anti social) and ask me if I was coming home soon or where is was. But never what I was doing or if I was having any luck with anything. I would occasionally call my mom to have a chat and a couple times she sounded weird (tone of voice) like there was someone else there with her. I would ask and she’d say no. So fast forward another couple months and I’m back home. Showed up at my moms work to surprise her and she was ecstatic. But for some reason I felt like I could sense something underneath her happiness for me. Like there was someone else in her life now. At this time I didn’t think it was my best friend and just thought she started dating. That night we have a huge feast and a couple drinks, get chatting having a great time catching up. She started asking me things that were completely normal like have I ever seen South Park etc. After we’re done I got to catch up with my friend that night. We’re chatting like usual he asks me if I’ve ever seen South Park... i tell him the same thing I told my mom. No not really, seen and episode or so. But since I’m pretty tired from driving all day I don’t ask why with either of them (which I regret now). From there on I still didn’t really think anything of it, was just like oh that’s funny there both asking if I’d seen that show. Then after that night something changed between me and my friend, he started joking around with me a lot more then he did before I left, which was fine i was happy for him he seemed like he had changed and got a lot of confidence since I was away. (He started a new job, lost some weight) But after awhile of some banter back and forth I once again got this feeling that something on a deeper level was going on, like he was actually trying to disrespect me in a chill, joking way. 

We talk about girls we’d been with since I was away. We were both doing decent, but one thing he said in particular that bothered me was that he was seeing a single mother. I ended up getting a job at the same place as my friend and things got weird, I guess he was saying some stuff behind my back that wasn’t so great. I would ask the other guys and they wouldn’t tell me stated that they didn’t want to start something between two friends, which really pissed me off. Also he kept asking questions about what I was doing cause my mom was selling the house and moving away, he would ask where we were moving, what my mom was doing, if I was going to pay her back for the money she loaned me. After a week or so the job didn’t end up working out for me and he got fired a week later. 

Some time goes by and one night my mom says she’s not feeling good so she’s going to the clinic. Again something inside my gut said there was something going on. I knew where she was going so after she left I went for a drive to see if she was actually there. This is were things get really confusing for me. She wasn’t at the clinic when I drove up so I went to drive by my friends place and I see what I thought was his car parked a bit away from his house. In idle with one headlight burnt out I drive by trying not to be too suspicious (it could just be some random person) and I see a lady in a pink coat in the passenger seat leaning over to grab something out of the back seats. No one in the driver (road head) which really pains me to say that. My friends car isn’t by his house and I start freaking out. I didn’t want to believe what I just say and wasn’t risking going up to the car cause it could just be someone random (complete regret that now) but at the moment a lot was happening. So I drive around a bit to see if maybe there somewhere else, nope. But I go back to the clinic and now my mom is sitting in there waiting (could have been maybe 5-10 minutes after seeing the car) which is doable from his house to the clinic but idk. She could have just been across the street getting food while she had to wait. But I snapped I could comprehend what has happening our not happening. (This was a really bad time for my mental health). 

After a couple days I asked them both separately. My mom denied at and got very defensive and angry which I thought was odd, so I kept pushing the subject eventually she got so mad she hit me and threatened to call the cops. I asked my friend in a vague way about the night I saw someone in the same car as his (turned out he had a burnt headlight as well) he told me he was out that night but came home and his brother took his car out with his girlfriend. (His brother as far as I’m sure has his own car now that I think of it). He also told me it could have been him and his friend hanging out. Wasn’t his friend though I also know her. Another couple thing I noticed from gut feelings and my senses. 
-my mom smelled like weed and his car when I hugged her (could possibly be from her friend though who she smokes with occasionally)
-my friend was talking about how honey bee farms make a lot of money and my mom randomly told me that this guy has a bee farm that we drove by one night and she thought it was cool. 
-they both recommend me to go see an employment centre multiple times, days apart sometimes same day. As and my friend are both  searching for jobs. 

Don’t get me wrong I’m totally fine with her dating and getting out there to meet people she deserves it raising me as a single parent and giving up everything. But if it’s with my “best friend” it’s not cool at all. Idc what anyone else says I’m not ok with it. Maybe if they both told me like responsible adults I’d try to comprehend it. 

Please help me guys idk where else to get advice for something like this. I’m really not doing good here my head feels like it’s constantly spinning because idk if I can trust my (gut) feelings anymore. All my relationships have crumbled now because I can’t figure out what’s going on. I feel like I’m going crazy I just want to get on with my life. If you really want to help and need more info or got questions feel free to ask. Thanks for reading. Anything helps:) ",22Jun2018,2

65,"My husband and I have 2 young children, the oldest is 6 years old. He has been curious about death and dying. Asking random questions, nothing abnormal, but I am unsure how to answer them or how much to share at his age. I realize all kids are different and it’s very subjective.

Background- My maternal extended family is very close, and I grew up with all of my cousins and spent a lot of time with them. I was particularly close to one, “Alan”. We were the same age, and both were only children so we we very much felt like the siblings we never had to each other. 

Long story short he died 4 years ago unexpectedly of a drug overdose. He was only 26. It crushed our family and we still are mourning the loss, but we have done some healing since then. 

My son was 2 at the time so I don’t think he remembers this time in our life, or if he does he hasn’t mentioned it. At the time I tried to protect him from the sadness and had him be with my in laws while we attended the funeral and things of that nature. It was a very difficult time for me, I had lost my brother and my best friend and I was absolutely devastated. I fell into a deep depression, overwhelmed with grief. It was a dark time. Years have passed, and while the pain is still there, obviously life has continued. In a much better place now although I still miss him every day and always will. I’ve not really discussed this with my son as it seemed inappropriate and awkward. I have pictures of him up and he sometimes will ask me who is in the photo, I usually just respond that it is a friend of mine, and he is satisfied with that response.

Anyway, more recently my son had asked my Aunt if anyone in our family has died. When she responded yes, he got very wide eyed and sad. Then when she asked why he asked he simply said he wanted to take flowers to their grave. 

My aunt told me this story and it has me wondering if he is old enough to talk to about my cousin. I was thinking of taking a photo of him and flowers out to his grave with my son and explaining who he was and that I miss him very much, but I don’t want to freak him out. Is this a terrible idea? Obviously I won’t go into graphic detail, but it would feel good to share this huge loss in my life with my son, and keep his memory alive. I am conflicted, just seems so uncomfortable, and I do not want to be inappropriate. On the other hand we will all deal with death in our life and I would like to start a good foundation for preparing him emotionally for these things in life. He has aging family members and obviously we never know what tomorrow will bring.

TL;DR- 6 year old son curious about death and dying. Want to share personal experience and talk to him, but don’t want to freak him out. Best way or age to go about this?",22Jun2018,2
66,"So my sister is currently learning that it's really hard to get a job related to animal care or animal behavior, even after her first four years of formal education. Her plan is to start her master's in the fall but she is thinking about taking time off and working for a while instead. She's been researching jobs she's qualified for and is having a hard time finding something that she is qualified for and is open to applications.

The two avenues she is aware of and has researched the most are positions as a zoo employee or park ranger, or interning, but you basically can't get a job at a zoo without a master's and all the park ranger positions in a 100-mile radius are filled and interns have to be available 6.5 days a week without pay.

70,"I’ve been friends with this girl since my freshman year and i loved being her friend because she was fun and had a huge personality but during senior year she got more close to this girl she was already friends with in junior year ill call her A. i didn’t care that she  became more close with A than me what i cared about was the fact that she was being sorta bitchy towards me. 

if we all where hanging out together then A and my friend would always exclude me from the conversation. even if i didn’t know what they where talking about i still would try and include myself in the conversation but they would still exclude me and not let me talk. they would also sometimes whisper to each other about stuff that i most likely wouldn’t care about and i would just think to myself whats the point of hanging out with them if they’re going to share secrets and not let me join their conversations. 

also i never hanged out with her outside of school not because i didn’t want to but because she would make excuses as to why she couldn’t hang out with me and i figured they where excuses because she would hang out with A and other people outside of school and i know that because she would post it on her social media. i never confronted her about it because i don’t like drama but i thought it was rude of her to do that because she would always tell people that I’m one of her closest friends and I’m just like if thats the case then why can’t we hang out outside of school?

lastly during senior year i felt like she only hanged out with me if A wasn’t available for example once we hit senior year she stopped hanging out with me at lunch and started hanging with A but if A was absent or there was one time where she was gone for a 2 week trip then my friend would come and hang out with me. i feel like she used me but at the same time she was a really great friend to me throughout high school. She would always help me with my work be there for me whenever i was going through something buy me gifts for my birthday or christmas but once senior year came around she started to act differently.

 we graduated 3 weeks ago and for these past few weeks we haven’t talked to each other. i texted her last week about hanging out but she never texted back until today i randomly got a text from her saying “i never got this text is it new?” I’m debating whether i should text her back or not because she’s a great friend but for some reason senior year she decided to be sorta shitty towards me and idk if i wanna deal with that anymore. should i text her back and see if i can try to hang out with her or should i ignore her text and move on?",22Jun2018,1
71,"So for the 21 years I've been on this earth so far, I have never been self reliant or considered myself independent or secure. I'm an insecure mess who relies on other people for his own happiness, which always ends up with me heartbroken, crying on the floor, praying life will get better. I always seek out a boys approval or my friends approval. Never my own.

My boyfriend basically just broke up with me because I wasn't ready to move in with him. My emotional abuser screwed me over for the third year in a row (I finally blocked him, which is a step in the right direction). I failed my most recent semester of college because I suffered with depression and anxiety the whole semester (and I still do unfortunately).

74,"I’m a new manager. I’ve noticed that since I started, one of my employees, who has been with the company for years and who is well-liked by the rest of the team, has had trouble with punctuality, communication, and remembering appointments, but only with me. 

With other employees, he is on-time and responsive, but with me, he has been late for almost every meeting, and forgot a very important one completely, and when I called about it and left a message asking where he was, said he never got it and that it’s really better if I text him. 
I was worried because he never told me he was coming in late that day and he had a work event scheduled that afternoon, and I did not know if he would make it until 30 minutes before the event was to begin.

I do want to be understanding and I realize he has had a heavier-than-usual workload since before I started, about 5-8 hours extra a week, though still less than 40/wk. We are in the process of hiring extra help so his hours will go back down soon. I am sympathetic to the fact that he has taken on more than his usual lately, but is that a valid excuse to be late or no-show to important engagements?

When he finally came in that afternoon, I made the mistake of asking where if he got my message and saying that he missed an important meeting in front of other staff. I could have kicked myself like 20 minutes later when I realized I should have waited to talk about it in private. But I had been trying to get a hold of him for hours and scrabbling to make a back-up plan just in case he no-showed again, Im afraid I spoke too soon. I’m also afraid I now made things worse and made a bad leadership impression and that I really started on the wrong foot completely.

79,"I know this is a question that I should ultimately answer myself, however I would definitely value some outside perspective in the matter.

Last year I took leave from university in my fourth and final year (sounds insane, I know). Reason being, I started an internet marketing business that I became very busy with and had to choose between it and school. I decided to take the rest of the year off to get things up and running, with the intention to go back this coming September.

Since then, my business has been very successful and I am on track to make a good amount of money this year -- well over 100k. I have become accustomed to this lifestyle and really have no desire of going back to school  and finishing.

In addition to not really having a desire to finish, I would have to sideline my business, or hire someone else to run it an forgo a lot of money in opportunity cost (not to mention the extra 10k another year of uni will cost). I am wondering if getting a simple business administration degree is worth it? The only thing that worries me is the possibility my business fails and I am stuck jobless without a degree. Yet on the other hand, I feel confident I could always manage to run a fairly profitable e-commerce business with the skill set I have acquired. I really am torn.

My mom has an ongoing list of health issues including bipolar, dementia, diabetes (the list can go on.) She is pretty much like a child. Throws fits in public when she doesn’t get her way. Has no boundaries, patience, and is clearly selfish. She begs for things she can’t have and won’t stop asking for things even when told no. She has wasteful tendencies like going through a pack of 12 roll ct paper napkins in a week, buying expensive food and cooking for hours and then throwing it all away. She has to go to church four times a week or she cries for hours.

I’ve tried reaching out to my siblings and other family members and they will not take her in. She’s too much to handle for them.

To my surprise, the agent introduced me to some consultant positions at the Big Four (DTT, EY, PwC, KPMG) and Accenture. The pay is very high and very alluring.

All I heard about Big Four from my friend is the works are tough but pay is high. If you do good, they give your more work but pay stays the same. I have a wife and a son (2mo. ) to take care of, I need the pay, but I cannot afford to sacrifice my family time, not when my kid is still 2mo. old.

A few weeks ago I met a guy, lets call him John, online. We talked for a few weeks, beginning on an app called Party In My Dorm, moving to Snapchat, then exchanging numbers. 

We exchanged photos and talked everyday, and usually when we needed to sleep we would say ""ttyt gn xx"". So we decided to meet up, in a public place, for a movie and some lunch. We ended up deciding to make it a date. 

It was amazing. And he was incredible, funny, smart, gorgeous, the perfect height (I like shorter guys) and his smell was incredible. All in all I really enjoyed our time and am incredibly attracted to him. 

What worries me though is that despite him saying he enjoyed it and even saying ""we'll remember that next time"" he has become quite distant. And on the date the only time we really touched was 2 hugs and when we had to share an arm rest during the movie. Also before when I would compliment him he would reciprocate them whereas on and after the date I compliment him and he just says thanks or something similar (not that I care either way its just an observation)

And when we say goodnight now all he says is ""okay bye"". Also before we met up he would respond to my texts quite quickly. Now I am constantly left on read for up to 8 hrs at a time. And yes I am discounting the times he is at work or with friends ect.

85,"Look I get it. Cigarettes smell terrible. They're filthy, disgusting things that offend everyone around the person smoking. I have been a smoker for roughly 14 years. I started when I was a dumb teenager and had no idea what I was getting myself into. Fast forward 14 years and I've tried patches, gum, groups, 4 medications, vaping and lozenges. Nothing has ever seemed to stick. I'm still smoking.

My last apartment, I just smoked in my room with the doors and windows closed. I hate the idea of offending my neighbors with the smell and the dangers of second hand smoke. I chose this path, so I should have to be the one who suffers the consequences. Even with how rancid my room and clothes smelled and how terrible the lingering smoke would bother me, I felt like ""at least I'm not bothering anyone else with my addiction"". 

A few days ago though, I had to move after rent went up again and I couldn't renew my lease. I moved in with my brother in a very nice neighborhood. He won't let me smoke in my room (which I totally understand and wouldn't want to either as it would make his whole house stink). I instead have to smoke outside in the backyard. 

Within the first day being here I tried to go as long as I could without one, but had to smoke. Within 3 mins into the cigarette I heard the neighbors slam their windows closed and I heard the other neighbor say something about ""smoking"". I felt so terrible. Nothing people love more than the delicious stench of cigarettes infecting their homes as they're trying to relax after a long day of work. I decided to try smoking in the front yard next to the street to be as far away from people's houses as possible. I then got a really dirty glare from the neighbor. 

So I ask you Reddit, what can I do to minimize the offensiveness of my smoking? Does anyone know any tricks to smoke without bothering the neighbors? I bought some patches and am gonna try to just quit again since I really hate the fact I bother so many people with my disgusting addiction. ",22Jun2018,3

89,"My best friend has always been the very happy and jolly fellow. He was the one in the group who we could laugh with. He's witty, does improv and theatre and he's always been the funny one.
He started to show signs of unhappiness around when he got his first girlfriend. He spoke to me about how he realized because he's the funny one, nobody will take him seriously, people think his problems are jokes and even close friends will just laugh. He told me this because I was one of the two people who will actually understand him and take him seriously (the other being his ex-girlfriend).
My best friend has always been a bit chub. Not to the point of obesity, not even close. But he's been a bit chub and he used to use it in his comedy. He'd chub and tuck and when we'd crack a joke about it he would say that it's fine, and we all believed him. Half a year later, he began to lose weight very quickly. He would talk to me about how little he's eaten, almost in a bragging way. I would constantly tell him that he needs to eat more or else it's going to effect his growth. He also vomited a lot, sometimes from hitting his head or for some other reasons. Keep in mind, he's in the highschool and I'm back in middle school so I don't know the exact reasons for the vomiting. Maybe two weeks later, he confesses that he's been eating less and vomiting on purpose to lose weight. I was very worried but I came up with a point system to help him eat more. The point system is complicated, but basically for the food he eats, he gains 1 point. Healthy food is more and a full meal with healthy food is a lot. Causing himself to vomit is -3. It seems to be working, he'll send me a picture of the food he eats and I'll give him points respectively.
Maybe a week ago he broke up with his ex-girlfriend and he seems to have been taking it weirdly. There is no crying that I know of, but after he did, he called me right after and we were able to quickly regain footing and play games together. His girlfriend kept talking to him and she really started to mess with him, so I told her to never talk to her again and blocked her. She didn't listen and continued to talk to him anyway.
Today, my best friend told me to unblock her because there was something very important she needed to tell me. His ex-girlfriend and I would keep in touch, and she would tell me things about my best friend that worried her, so it wasn't too surprising when she needed to tell me something ""important"". When she and I began talking, I first assumed she would lecture me about how I should unblock her or whatever, I wasn't taking it seriously. But then she told me that my best friend cuts himself. We don't know how long he's been cutting himself but he certainly does, on his leg. I was in a call with him when his ex-girlfriend was texting me and I brought it up to him. I said ""Okay _____, we need to get serious. I don't want to believe this is true, but do you cut yourself?"" He responds with a weak ""Yeah."" I ask ""How long have you been doing this?"" Pause. He quickly says, ""I'm going to bed, I'll talk to you tomorrow.""
I'm not sure what to do, but I have some options.
1. Don't make him uncomfortable and don't speak about it again. If he wanted me to know, he would have told me. I shouldn't have been given this information so I shouldn't do anything about it.
2. Keep it secret, but try my best to stop it myself. I've helped him with his eating disorder, maybe I could help him with this. Telling anyone outside of the 3 of us isn't a good idea, they shouldn't know.
3. I have his mother's number and I could text her about all of this and convince her to take him into therapy or some other treatment. His mother is a therapist herself so I believe she could  be of some help. This is a secret too big to keep and a trusted adult needs to know about this.

92,"Questions I have:
Are there any free, reliable and safe websites I could use to help narrow my search?
What subtle warning signs should I be wary of that suggest I'm being scammed?
What precautions should I take?
I am also open to, and very appreciative of any advice you can give me, that might not answer the questions listed, but that you feel will be helpful. 

Background info:
I am a minor trying to regain contact with the estranged half of my family. Basically, my mother and her brother have issues. She has told me a lot of things about him, but because my mother tends to ""embellish"" conversations and events to hurt people who she dislikes, I want to come to my own conclusions about him, from a safe distance. I am 16 and fairly internet (and street) savvy, but I don't have a great laptop. In fact. I'm currently writing this on a chromebook(!!!) that my dad got from work. 

Goals:
Goal number 1: Find my uncle's social media
Goal number 2: Find his ex wives' social media (I have their names, but not enough info to narrow it down)
Goal number 3: Find my many, many cousins' social media
Goal number 4: Open the door for companionship. My plan for interacting with my cousins once I find their social media, is to explain my situation and how I am related to them. Explain that I know SOME about their father, but not enough to form an opinion, as well as express to them that though I will not assume the state of their relationship with their father, if they are concerned, that at that time I will not be in contact with him yet. 
I am not even fully sure how many cousins I have. Of my estranged cousins, I have found the names of two boys, as well as their mother. 
Somewhere, there are at least three more boys, one of which he fathered, the second he adopted, and the third he ""refused to adopt because he didn't like him.""
Interesting, but I'm not certain how accurate any of this ""he said, she said"" is, because of my mother's habit.
Goal number 5: (when I am 18) Reach out to my uncle and hear his side of things. Ask about his mental health (I have been diagnosed with several mental illnesses that are hereditary.) My uncle had drug problems, according to my mother. (which is suspicious since she doesn't know what weed smells like, but can distinctly identify different types of tobacco odors because of how often my grandfather smoked.) I have been studying psychology for 2 years in my high school, and though I am no therapist, I have a lot of personal experience. It would be nice to meet the other black sheep of the family, as sad as that is to say. 

Conclusion:
As always. I remain cautious. 
As a minor, it is important that I do remain cautious when I reach out to people, and I also cannot use paid services, as my family has complete financial control over me. 

Thank you, to any and all who interact with this thread at all. Even just upvoting or downvoting allows this to reach a larger audience. I need all the help I can get. My small extended family ostracized me, and my nuclear family can, like most, be very toxic at times. I need support from more family, and I feel I have a right to know my family, regardless of the drama. At the very least, I want to know that I tried to be involved in their lives, I want to know that I opened my arms to my family, despite the estrangement.
Thanks again. ",22Jun2018,1

I'm an intern this summer. During the day, when I'm at the internship, I'm stressed; at night, when I'm home, I'm depressed. It's worse than being at school, because there I get to be *just* stressed, but here I go through this jarring transition every day. 

I'm riddled with mental disorders. I take medicine for depression &amp; BPD &amp; OCD.

I had a very stressful but successful semester after returning during which I wasn't really suicidal, but now I'm starting to crumble again.

113,"Hi,

Quick backstory. My mother is an amazing Woman. Not long after my Dad left her 10 years ago, she became her mother's full-time carer after she (her mother, my nan),  was diagnosed with lung disease (I can't recall the name of the condition). 

On top of that, last year my mother was diagnosed with bowel cancer. It was a horrible time and she had to undergo chemo, but thankfully the treatment was successful, and for now all looks to be well. In saying that, I am increasingly worried about the amount of stress my mother is placed under caring for my Nan (her mother) full-time. 

Fast forward to today, my Nan is still alive, however yesterday the doctor has given her until about August this year to live. 

To say my mum has had a tough run is an understatement. She is genuinely one of the most beautiful people I have ever met, she puts others first, even at her own detriment, and it saddens me to see such a beautiful human beat down again and again, even if she doesn't show it.

Unfortunately we're not in all that great of a financial position, so when Nan goes, Mum is probably going to have to get work. She used to be an aged care nurse, but it's too labor intensive, and doesn't pay well enough. In an ideal world, I'd make enough to support us both, (i'm still hoping to within the decade), however the reality is she's going to have to work. FYI we're based in Australia. 

So I kind of have two questions. She's looking at becoming a medical receptionist as it's an extension from what she already did, but I was looking into it and it doesn't pay that well. Does anyone have any recommendations for a job a 54-year old woman could take up that pays well, involves people, and isn't too intensive, (she's willing to study). Just a quick sell, my mother is AMAZING with people, caring, and willing to go above and beyond her job role. She'd be a total asset for anyone willing to take her on.

Question two. How can I help her in this situation? Currently I'm just spending as much time with her and Nan as possible and just hanging out. I know how good that makes her feel. What I would love is for her to catch a big break and something amazing to happen to her, like win the lotto so we can get her a house, but short of that, what would you do in my situation? How can I help improve my mum's mental health, and help her so that she can go into her 60's and 70's stress free and relaxed. She's sure as hell earned it, and the last thing I'd ever want to see is for her to get sick again because she's over worked / stressed.

Can you help? Do you have any advice? I'm not sure to ask and at this point all I want is for my mum to be happy and have  some security in her life.

122,"Hey, the title is kind of a mouthful, so I’ll break it down. Quick disclaimer though: I’m here to learn how to deal with the above, not to be told what a horrible sad person I am. 

Background: boyfriend and I have been dating for over three years, and apart from a Snapchat incident where he asked some girls for nudes, he’s always been faithful to my knowledge, as have I. However, when he drinks or hangs out with people he deems “cool” he changes. He acts as though he’s embarrassed of me, tries to give off the impression he’s single and “cool”, flirts more and acts more confident even smokes (even though he hates smoking). So basically he changes persona, and this is not just me saying this. We talked about it where I explained how hurtful it was that he would act as though I didn’t exist. He knows he does it, but has a hard time stopping. 

The issue: he’s going to a one week festival, which he’s done for the past 3 years, and every time it has been a nightmare for me. I went once but it really just wasn’t for me, I enjoy traveling instead. Basically, I get these images and thoughts in my head, where I imagine him flirting, kissing and maybe more with others, smoking and being that “masculine dipshit” type of person where he deliberately acts as though I don’t exist or matter. This in turn makes me jealous of him having fun while I am hurting, and makes me anxious that I can’t get a hold of him, which in turn just enforces these thoughts and images. I’ve gotten physically ill before due to this. I trust the people he’s camping with, which helps, but not enough. 

My question is, how can I deal with these feelings, so my entire week isn’t ruined? Anything from books to read, videos to watch, to exercises to make is appreciated. Also if anyone can relate or has a personal story similar to this, I’d love to hear how you dealt with it. I’m already trying to plan something with some friends, but most of them are unavailable during that week, so it’s going to be difficult staying busy.

123,"Note: This post may contain grammar errors. I apologize in advance for having errors.

Before I ask for advice, I just wanna share my story so I can give you details of what happened years ago. 

There's this one girl from my high school that I can never forget and I really regret from what I did to our friendship.

6 years ago, I met this girl from high school and we were both taking ESL (English as a Second Language) classes. The first time I saw her, I thought she was pretty even without make up. So, I was like ""yeah she looks pretty but she doesn't catch my interest"" Then few days later, I started to get annoyed by her because I didn't expect that she was talking too much ( in broken English) and kept interrupting the class. Apparently, I hated talkative people because I was quiet and shy during that time because I barely spoke English (at least she was trying). 

A few weeks later, my thoughts had change about her. We had a group project, so my teacher assigned the students who's in the group. Each group has 3 members, except me and this girl. The whole time, we all did was the project and we were the first one to finish. Apparently, she got bored so she started talking and asked me questions like ""where are you from?"", ""how are you today?"", and so on. As we were having a conversation, I didn't realize I got hooked up because I was asking questions as well and giggling (I forgot what we were giggling about). Then after that, we became friends and that made my day. After that happened, I thought that she was just too friendly and sweet.

Then, a month before the school ended, I realized that I am falling for her. I fell for her because not only she was pretty and sweet, her smile always made my day. She had an angelic smile and it made me having butterflies in my stomach (do not know if I used the words right). I was having trouble to make an eye contact with her during conversation because I felt like I was melting. I used to hate school, but because of her I was motivated to go to school because I liked seeing her and her angelic smile everyday. 

I didn't know how to tell what I really felt for her.  I was so scared that if I confessed to her, she might rejected me and stopped talking to me. What can I say about my teenager years? Well, I was a foolish kid and afraid of negative outcomes.

This friendship continues until 4 years ago. I fucked it up, our friendship. So, this dumbass me decided to not talk to her. And why did I do that? It's because I was having a conflict inside me. The other side of me said that I should stop talking to her because this friendship leads to nothing and it can hurt your feelings because she only sees me as a friend. The other me said that I should still be friends with her because she always makes my day. Of course, I chose the ""no talking"" side because it was very convincing and it was for my own good.

A week later, I couldn't handle not talking to her, so I tried to talk to her and apologized from what I did. It was too late to fixed everything. She had also stopped talking to me. I tried to talk to her several times in several ways and all her response was nothing, until one time she said ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"". I was devastated and had teary eyes when she said that. I really regretted this so bad, that it made me depressed.

So, most of my senior year, I was back from being quiet. My grades were affected and I thought school was just a miserable facility. I didn't even realize my 19th birthday had come. My parents said ""Happy Birthday"" and I said nothing (I got scolded after that and I deserved it). Basically, everything was colored gray and a sad year. 

As of right now, I still cannot move on from what I did to her. It still bothers me to the point that she also appears to my dreams. I had dreams about her for 3-4 days a week. The dreams were mostly about her hating me so much, having a friendly conversation, and her and I were dating. I had move on with my other past problems like break-ups, sibling fights, forgotten homework, failed classes, financial problems, and many more except this terrible past I still carry. 

I need any advice you can give me. I wanna do something but I can't because to be honest with you, it would be creepy if I try to reach her. Sorry for a long post. Thanks.",22Jun2018,1

***tl;dr*** *included at the end*

I'm a young adult having trouble deciding which hobbies I want to pursue in my free time. I find it particularly difficult as I am interested in many things and I keep having reasons for pursuing every one of these potential hobbies. However, in the end I don't really pursue one that deeply because as soon as I venture on that path, other hobbies become more interesting. It's not that my current activity doesn't interest me, it's that I keep wondering what it would be like if I did ""hobby B"" instead of ""hobby A"".  Eventually I kind of go full circle through the alphabet and end up at ""hobby A"" again.

I'm searching for advice on how to handle my inability to stay dedicated, or maybe put a focus on my hyper-fascination for all sorts of cool stuff in world. Perhaps I will decide that in the end I prefer jumping from one hobby to the next, but lately this has been bothering me a bit. I will list the main hobbies that I spend (or have spent) my time on below. Any advice on how to handle my current situation  is welcome, as well any experience on any of these hobbies (or even non-listed ones). My main problem right now is that some hobbies involve going to school or a certain physical location, and these hobbies overlap, forcing me to make a choice.

  
*\*compressed\** list of my (past or current) hobbies:

* **Science:** after having my science university degree, i love all things science. Engineering, biology, physics, geography, botany in particular,... I like reading magazines and articles related to new findings, methods, and random cool stuff. Spent 1/4 of my life at university studying sciences so I find it important to keep learning. I have become a bit burnt out doing research myself, and is something I no longer pursue. University kept me away from most of my hobbies listed below, as my entire life shifted for a while during this period of my life.  

* **Music:** before university I went to music school (quit during uni for time and commuting reasons). This is definitely something I wanted to pick up again. I still get to play my instruments in my free time, but I'm really a big believer in having a great teacher in any aspect in life. Music is what drives me to do most things in life, it ignites that inner flame inside me that gets my brain rolling. Ideas start popping out, images start rolling in, and everything is just cool. Before I go to sleep, I always listen to music. My favorite songs allow me to lucid dream, however this only happens when I listen to music before going to sleep (not during sleep!). I always wanted to create such beautiful music for myself, but haven't reached that level yet.  

* **Martial arts:** I have done martial arts for multiple years and this was my number one physical activity. I like the philosophy behind it, the workout I get, and over the years I became more calm, polite, and respectful. Martial arts reinforces this behaviour, and I value those morals highly. Definitely something I wanted to pick up again after university. Going to a school is definitely required for martial arts in my opinion, it's not something I'd want to pursue on my own.  

* **Automation:** I like all things automated. This goes from factories having automated production lines, to my stupid watering system that I hooked up to my plants so they water themselves and get light from lamps when the sun is down. I sadly don't have an engineering degree (perhaps a wrong choice by me), but I love automating things. My job is also related to automation, although this is more software programming and handling data rather than stuff in the physical world, which is what I like most. I have been thinking about going back to university and getting an engineering degree, but I'm not sure about this. It's a big step back, and I'm not sure if I would want it to be my job. Creating these automated systems is cool for my free time, but I have never made a hobby into a job yet. It's definitely staying as a hobby though! (just like everything else...)  

* **Programming:** after learning multiple languages over the years, and being interested in automation, programming plays a huge part in this. It's the largest part of my job as well. I always want to keep learning more and learning new techniques, more efficient ways to handle things, etc... I also have quite a few projects noted down that I want to work on, such as some specific sites, or creating a bigger system for automating many things in my home -- such as connecting the plant watering system, to a weather station, to a site, and a few robots lying around at my place ('leftovers' from past projects).  

* **Electronics:** I know little about electronics and this is something I consider a serious setback. I am heavily against throwing something away that ""doesn't work"" without knowing the reason, or without even trying to fix it. However, when my guitar amplifier broke down, I realised I didn't know electronics. I've spent the last half year reading books and self-studying electronics to be able to do these repairs, but this world is as big as any other aspect I want to learn more about (engineering, programming, ...).  

* **Business:** Ideas constantly pop into my head, and some of those are connected to starting a business. Or I think how I can potentially turn an idea into a product. I have yet to do this, but the thought is always there. It keeps coming back. However, if I can't find the time to keep busy with one hobby, how in the world will I keep myself dedicated to a business?  I have learned a lot about investing as well, but this couldn't keep my interest. Investing isn't something I spend too much time on anymore (but I still think it's very important). I wonder how this would affect running a business itself.

  
Those are the main things that interest me and I just can't choose. Some days I do get a little bit crazy about it, but in the end I like all of these things. I love the world we live in and that it allows me to pursue so many awesome things that make me happy. I just find it hard to make a hard decision on some of them, as they are connect to schooling or evening activities that overlap other hobbies. I realise that trying to do all of these will make me not progress as fast as I would like, but it's so fun to combine all of these as well. 

Eventually, I like figuring out how the world works. When playing music, I can see the electric circuit in my mind processing the audio signals, which is put into the software on my computer, and I know the code handling the input and transforming it into a sound file. Knowing how to create sites I know what lies behind them when uploading my music.  
I like figuring all of these things out. It's amazing what humans have created these past decades, and I appreciate all of these things. But maybe I appreciate too many things at once.  


Have a great day!  


**TL;DR:** I have around 20 hobbies I like a lot and thus I switch between what I'm doing frequently. How can I streamline my behaviour into a few hobbies? How do I make a hard decision on some of them as they overlap and require to be at a physical location? Having finished university and having a job, I finally have the time to heavily pursue a few hobbies, but not all of them (at once).",22Jun2018,1
125," I (24F) am prone to UTIs, and I had three of them in one year last year. I can count on one or two hands the number of times I've had sex with my boyfriend of 2 years since the last one cleared up. 

They were extremely painful, and one of them took three rounds of antibiotics to go away. One of the medications made me so sick that I had to miss work. I then went back to switch antibiotics, and then the next one didn't kill the infection, so I had to go back for a third round.

After that, I was referred to a urologist who barely helped me and made cruel and presumptuous comments about my weight (""You're not a tiny woman""/""Sex might get better if you lose weight). I reported him for his poor bedside manner, and wrote a letter to the hospital about how this is the last thing you should do to help someone lose weight. The kicker? The hypocritical doctor was bigger than me. Anyway, this was a long, drawn-out, and traumatic experience...pain from UTIs, medications not working, and rude doctors. 

And yes, I am insecure about my body. This was the case before I gained weight in college and grad school after developing severe depression and an eating disorder, but it is admittedly worse now that I'm fat. I'm working on losing weight now after finally kicking my binge eating habits, and it feels great. Now I just have to keep going and wait patiently for it to come off. Despite that, I'm fairly certain that the body image issues will still be there in a couple of years once all of the weight is off...they seem very deep-rooted. 

The body image thing is rough for sure, but the number one fear is undoubtedly the UTIs. 

Every time I try to have sex with my boyfriend, I wince and remember that whole experience last year, and then my body gets tense and my arousal is instantly killed. UTIs are even scarier than an accidental pregnancy (I always use at least a condom, but if I still got pregnant, I'd get an abortion) because of how painful they are.

It was also very traumatic for me to put myself in the care of doctors who couldn't seem to figure out how to cure it, and then after all that, I was fat-shamed. I don't like not having control over how doctors respond to me, and the fear of all this was enough to really mess up my sex life.

I can still masturbate, have oral sex, etc. but I no longer want sex because of what happened. I kinda wish I could just not have it anymore since I don't even climax from it anyway, and all  sex is to me now is just a massive risk for infection and pregnancy.

...but try telling that to most people. I don't want to lose my boyfriend over this and then never be able to date again because my fear of UTIs and rude doctors overrides my desire for sex.

Any advice would be helpful...I just want to enjoy it without fear again, but UTIs are awful and antibiotic resistance is a scary thought.

126,"Its weird, since about three weeks I am hearing two people open this door next to my house.   


Always at around 1 a clock, never later or earlier, same time and every night.   


I hear them talk (but can't understand) like 5 minutes, they open the door and close it again. My house is the first floor of a ""bank"" so I have no neighbors under my apartment or above. Next to the ""Bank"" I live in this one house is going to be torn apart and the other house which I mean is the ""townhall"" where the mayor of my small town works, other things get done like passport etc. but every day at night I hear those sounds coming from that building.  


Should I call the cops? I wanted to ask my next neighbor (two houses away) but I am afraid its him. I don't want anyone to notice that I am hearing everything. I even turn my light off at 1 AM cause I am scared I am they don't know that someone lives above the ""Bank""",22Jun2018,0

Now, I have this really active bud, a great guy, who's really popular.

That's the only things they do and talk about, I really fucking hate that. My parents keep pushing me to go, even though they very well know the situation I'm in. I enjoy nice conversations with educated people, I enjoy to play a boardgame and crack jokes rather than smoke 3 cig packs a day and chug vodka. I don't know what to do.

136,"i want to share a situation i was in tonight. i’m curious if you all think i did the right thing/what you would’ve done instead.

backstory: i was asked to babysit for a family (their 5 year old girl) that i’ve been in contact with for several months but had not yet worked for. during that time, i recommended that my boyfriend tutor their 17 year old son with high functioning autism. that part is only related because the family knows both me and my boyfriend. they were going to a concert and asked me to babysit for 6 hours, 6pm to midnight.

here’s what happened: i was babysitting for this little girl for the first time. everything went great at first. i got there around 6pm. i got to know the dad, he filled in some details about their new puppy, the girl’s bedtime, etc. parents left, the girl and i did a little bead project, watched some tv, and had a good time overall. while watching tv, her older brother came home from a party with his grandma, who dropped him off and came in briefly to say hello to the cat who had been quarantined in a room because he was ill. grandma left, son helped the girl fill up her water bottle, i told him that my boyfriend says hey (my boyfriend tutors him), he said “cool, thanks!” and then he went to his room. the girl and i finished watching tv, i read a story to her in her bedroom and she went to bed. i played with their new puppy and then hung out on the couch, charging my phone and getting ready to read a book i brought.

around 10pm, her older brother, who’s 17 (who i’m not babysitting), started pacing back and forth in the dark in the downstairs area (in plain view from my seat). this was just outside his bedroom. he was mumbling under his breath and turning light switches on and off. he has autism so i thought maybe it’s a thing he does or he has OCD or idk what. just thought it was “behaviors.” it became unsettling when he had literally been going back and forth for 10 mins in the dark, turning on and off light switches (that didn’t actually affect the light - i just heard the noise). at some point, the mumbling started getting louder but still under his breath/whispering. it was angry and i heard “i’m going to shoot...” and “i’m going to kill...” very clearly amidst other angry mumbles and freaked out and ran outside briefly to call my boyfriend to ask him to come over (idk if they have a gun or what...he’s way taller than me, the family knows my boyfriend so i didn’t think it would be weird). 

boyfriend came over immediately but somewhat reluctantly, asking me if i’m sure i heard what i heard and if he’s on the phone (he wasn’t, his hands were down while he was pacing) or listening to music and rapping along (he does wear headphones often so this could’ve been possible but he definitely sounded like he was upset and not just rapping rhythmically along to music). my boyfriend got here and we walked in together. the kid heard a car pull up and came out to say hi. he barely looked at me when we came in (he has great eye contact otherwise). we talked briefly with my boyfriend there and i kept my cool, although i had a feeling that he knew why my boyfriend showed up. maybe i was projecting.

the kid went back to his room and two of us sat for a while on the couch i was on before. the kid kept pacing in the dark and doing the light switch thing but didn’t talk to himself or say any scary words. i’m glad he didn’t but wished my boyfriend would’ve heard so he’d know i was serious.

my boyfriend stayed with me til the parents got home at midnight. during that time, i texted the dad (the mom’s phone died) and said: “Hi (dad’s name), it’s (my name). I invited (my boyfriend’s name) to come over to sit with me while it’s quiet in the house. I hope that’s okay with you two. Just wanted to give you a heads up in case you saw his car when you got back.” i did this because i didn’t want to overreact and have them come home immediately but literally i went numb when i heard those two words (shoot and kill). i got legit scared for my life. but i wasn’t sure if this was a “thing” he did secondary to his autism or whatever other reason. i figured they would’ve told me if that was a thing. the dad texted me “no problem.”

the kid stayed in his room for the most part but came out to do the light switch thing over the next 2 hours (sometimes it sounded like he was just standing there, clicking the switch, even if we couldn’t see him in the dark), once came up to get something out of the fridge, and once came out for literally no reason at all, stood there awkwardly, and went back to his room. my heart was racing and my hands were frozen and numb the whole time. i was trying to stay calm in case i was overreacting. it was the longest 2 hours of my life. my boyfriend kept falling asleep. 

around midnight, the parents’ car pulled up. my boyfriend said he was leaving and that he feels awkward and that it’s unnecessary that he came over (that pissed me the fuck off, regardless of whether or not i was “overreacting”). i told him he didn’t have to leave awkwardly because they knew he was over. i had a casual convo with him and the mom when she came in and as she walked us out, my boyfriend went to his car and i asked her if i could talk to her outside. when i did that, she closed the front door, seemingly knowing what was about to happen. 

i said to her, “i just wanted to talk to you about the real reason i invited my boyfriend over.” her immediate response was something along the lines of “is it something that happened with (son’s name)?” i said “well nothing happened but i just want to tell you what i saw.” i told her everything (very diplomatically, not frantic or anything, just matter of fact). the pacing, the light switch, told her that was fine with me, but that the words “shoot” and “kill” were the reasons i called my boyfriend but didn’t want to worry her in case this was typical for him. she rolled her eyes as if this has happened many times before and reassured me that she understood that hearing those words warrant me feeling uncomfortable. as the dad passed by (he’s the father of the little girl i was babysitting but the stepdad of the 17 year old), he walked past slowly and curiously, knowing we were having a serious conversation. she looked over at him and said “he had some behaviors again.” AGAIN? she couldn’t have told me in advance that this is normal for him? leaving a young woman alone in a house until midnight with a teenager bigger than she is without telling her that this is typical behavior?

i got home and received this text from the mom: “Hey, I am really sorry for putting you in that situation with (son) tonight. I assure you that if I ask you to take care of (daughter) again he will not be at the house. I hope that everything else (that didn’t have to do with (son)’s behavior)went well.  Please let me know. I hope you have a good weekend.”

my adrenalin has been pumping all night. it’s now 2:30am and i still can’t sleep. it seems like not a big deal and “resolved” but i legitimately feared for my life today. i didn’t know whether he had a gun in his room or in the house somewhere he could’ve had access to, if he’s had violent or aggressive behaviors in the past, if he wanted to kill me or his sister or the puppy...

what would you have done? what would you reply to the mom? 

tl;dr: i was babysitting for a 5 year old girl when her 17 year old brother with autism started pacing back and forth, turning light switches off and on, and cursing under his breath. i heard the words “shoot” and “kill” and asked my boyfriend to come over immediately. i told the mom what happened when she got home and she was apologetic but acted as if this was normal for him. she texted me when i got home and said he will never be home if i babysit for her again. what would you have done differently? what would you respond to the mom?",22Jun2018,2

I'm not even one of those coast through school without studying kids too, I usually get straight Cs on my tests, and I couldn't do multiplication until 5th grade while everyone else was on long division, and when I finally got to long division, everyone else understood everything. Now that I realise the only reason I passed half of my classes was because of homework grades, and I just failed my first class.

It's fun, I'm just really bad at it. I can't really wrap my head around all the concepts. Heck, when I was learning algebra, I didn't realise that you could subtract variables, so when given equations like 50-x=0, I didn't realise I could add x to both sides to get x=50. I spent 12 hours, literally, trying to figure out how to solve that. Idk, it's the same way with all the math stuff I'm learning now. It's fun, but my head doesn't wrap around the concepts, and idk, my grades just fall one test after the other. I just want to pass math. Passing science would be nice too but I just want to pass math. Nothing makes sense, I can do the math but not the whole concepts and new stuff. There's so much stuff in math, and it's fun, but I always just can't understand what the stuff is.

142,"I’m a little bit desperate and I’m a little bit freaking out. This past Saturday night I got a phone call from my family saying that my grandmother, a person I am very close to, was being rushed to the hospital. We had understood that she had confusion, family members called 911, ambulance got to her house and she has a massive seizure. She’s never had one before. Since then, she was basically in a comatose state except that it wasn’t a coma. Just sleeping, groaning and experiencing a lot of discomfort. 

Now I live out of state-it take a day to drive to them. Family calls me and says “the situation is bad, you should come to tell her you love her. Maybe even say goodbye” I drive home-missing 4 days pay to do so. Work has been great about me leaving-I’m okay here in this aspect. 

While taking turns staying with my grandmother-who is confused and talking nonsense CONSTANTLY, we’ve been under strict orders, no food or drink administered to her. Period. If anything gets into her lungs, we may end up adding pneumonia to the mix of altered mental status. 

Well, I walked into hospital room 3 different times to see one family member giving her soda and chocolate. I told them that I didn’t think they should, they laughed and ignored me. So I walked out and told the nurse who went in and set things straight. 

Now this family member is furious. This person is my grandmother’s  primary care giver but also very much the reason my grandmother is in such a bad place. They bring her all the junk food and soda she wants although she’s a terrible diabetic and has severe hypertension. All of her vitals and “numbers” are always out of wack and it’s very much contributed to her diet and poorly managed meds.

So I know this sneaking food is an issue and has been for years. But I couldn’t take it anymore. My grandmother is in too poor condition to be given these things. The family is non compliant with any orders-nearly refusing much needed tests because “the doctors don’t know what they are doing”. 

I cannot express my frustration enough. Along with this, the main stressor is my grandmothers condition. She is constantly groaning, arms moving, and asking random questions and making bizarre comments every 10-20 seconds. “Who’s that in the corner?” “Let’s get into the boat.” “I need 3 coffee pots.” 

HOW DO WE COMFORT HER!!!!?!??????   

Also, how do we deal with non compliant and difficult family members who, in their mind, feel they are offering her compassion and comfort by giving her things she doesn’t need?

tldr: thanks for looking at my post. Here’s the run down: 1-grandmother is hospitalized Bc of altered mental status-no diagnosis yet-but much confusion, agitation, and nonsensical sentences. Constant questions. How to handle this? 2-how to deal with non complaint children of hers (aunts and uncles of mine) who decide to give her soft drinks and candy behind everyone’s back? I’ve already told a nurse and that pissed them off. 3-did I do the right thing by “telling on them” to the nurse? 

Also, please hug your loved ones tightly. For me at least.

I'm attracted to law because I think it offers good career prospects, financial stability, a social impact, and (potential) self-mamagement. I'm cautious, however, because I hear law grads often end up working absurd hours and under great stress at rigid firms.

I'm attracted to academia because I like writing, and I like research. I don't know if I'm interested in teaching, though. I am very worried about the precarity of academia as well. I don't want to have career instability for years and years. 

Another consideration of mine: I want to have work involving Russia. As in, I'd like to be able to work, at least for some period of time, in the Russian Federation. 

So, I'll break down the dilemma. 

If I choose Cambridge, the Master's program is one year. It's a dream of mine to go to Cambridge, but the tuition + residency costs are extreme. I'd have to take out considerable loans, as I doubt I'd receive funding. I might be committed to academia if I choose Cambridge, as well. I think Cambridge could potentially really help me with my career prospects in general, though. I am also attracted to Cambridge because I think I would really enjoy the program - I'd be studying an area of political economy I'm very interested in.

If I choose University of Saskatchewan, the law program is three years. It seems like a safe, relatively cheap option. But I'm worried that a) my degree wouldn't be very specialized (especially in regards to international law), and b) it would make my Russia aspirations more distant. At the moment, it feels like I'd only choose this option because it's fairly cheap and would end in a law degree.

Moscow State Institute is another option. But it is a bit of a rogue option. Two years, not greatly expensive, but I'm not sure how well regarded my degree would be. My family doesn't like this option, but I'm attracted to it as it would give the chance to immerse in Russia. It's another politics master's/PhD program, though, so it might only prove useful for academia or consultancy.

As you can tell, this is quite the conundrum for me. I want to make a wise decision that can accommodate my personal, professional and financial considerations.

Any advice would be appreciated, especially if you have any direct knowledge/experience of the schools or career paths I have mentioned.

What do you think I should do?

147,"I’m 19 going on 20 next month and I’m not really doing anything with my life at the moment. I live with two roommates in the house I grew up in, my dad let’s us rent it out for dirt cheap after he moved when I graduated Highschool. It’s been dawning on me that I’m not really doing anything with my life because of my own immaturity and how much freedom I’ve been given straight out of school. The idea has been in my head for awhile that I move with my parents (who want me to move in with them) and go to school as well as experience new things. I will admit it is a more happening place and my parents will help with school but I hate living with them. My moms a borderline alcoholic who does a lot of BS that makes my dad snap. They constantly argue even in my presence and that toxicity makes me hate being around them and just puts me in a bad mood. I love them separately but not together. 

I feel like it would be good for me to move here. It would set me back for awhile until I finish school or do what I want to do. Any suggestions?",22Jun2018,1
148,"*this post is not ment to offend and is a real issue I need help with* (please ask any questions)

I am 16 my brother turns 19 next week. 

Some of the things he beleives in:
Hates pretty much all races (his main issue is with blacks and muslims, talks a lot about it)
Praises Hitler
Beleives in white supremacy
Belevies whites are above everyone else
Homophobic
Anti - womans rights

These are some of the things he wont stop talking about (meaning everyday). If I disagree we argue about it. He can beleive whatever he wants its just that it has gotten to the point where our relationship is being affected. 

An example of how bad it is: today I was playing The Sims 4  and I asked him if he liked the new household I created. He said something like 'all of them but the black one'. He got angry that I was making black sims! He then said my town should only consist of only white people... I was shocked and though he was joking, but he wasnt.

I keep asking if he can stop talking about these things so much but he doesnt listen. How do I stop all this arguing? We hardly ever used to argue.

149,"I need advice. I just turned 22 and tonight I was sitting on the couch with my step dad (my mum and younger half brother were out) and my step dad comes over and asks if we’re still friends and I told him that we were.

He then leans in and gives me lots of hugs and kisses on the check and then leaves to go out. What is important to know is that:
1. This is one of the least affection people I know. Like we don’t talk a whole lot nor do we ever hug let alone anything else.
2. He did this last year when my mum and brother were overseas and I honestly felt like he was hitting on me. I felt very uncomfortable but ultimately didn’t tell anyone about it and until tonight, nothing similar has ever happened so I’ve always thought that I was reading way to much into it.

So yeah, he went off and I was at the house by myself and everything was okay. Then he comes back home and we were chatting and he sits down next to me and I could smell cigarette smoke on him so I told him to go brush his teeth otherwise my mum would know that he’s been smoking. Anyway he goes off and does that and then comes and stands behind me and gives me a hug. 

As he’s doing this, he starts putting his hands on my boobs and starts to rub them. He then starts to go to my bra and he asked if he could and all I did was shake my head. He kept asking me and all I could do was shake my head no. He then eventually stops and tells me not to tell my mum (which he did last time) and then tells me that he would love to spend the night with me and asks if he can. All I can do is shake my head no and he clarifies that he would only want to cuddle. 

He then said “okay well you’re mum will be home soon like so we better stop. Are we friends?” 

All I can do is nod my head yes. I sat still on that couch until my mum got home and I went straight to my room. I feel disgusting and dirty and I don’t want to be here. I want to go to my partners house but I know that if I leave here now my mother will ask where I’m going and will see me in my current state.

I want to tell my mum what happened. She doesn’t deserve to be with a man like that, my brother (who is 7) shouldn’t have that as a role model and I can’t be around him, but I can’t risk loosing my mother. She is my best friend and if she doesn’t believe me I’d be lost without her but I have to say something to her. But how? How do I tell her? What do I say? When do I say it?

151,"**It. just. happened. Quarter-life crisis is real.**

I have just graduated college last April. And finally, I can say that: I'm SO done with all of those exams and projects. I can't believe I made it after these years. But, there's also a cold catch in here. 

It also means that the journey where me and my friends used to belong together, is now starting to break apart and everyone needs to follow their own paths. Some of them have started doing their own things, you know, moving places, going back to their hometown, establishing their career life by looking for jobs, maybe some of them are planning to start a family on their own. 

I can really see it right before my eyes, that everyone has been doing their own choices and I'm just stuck in a phase, where I don't know what is my purpose anymore.

I have been warned about the ""life after college - expectations vs. reality"" and the ""real world"". It's like a major reset button. 

I've had a lot of breakdowns and realizations along the way. It felt disconnected to everyone, down to the rock bottom. Plus, the pressure is all around the corner. Employment, bills, future goals in life, you name it.

As of now, I'm still trying to figure this out.

154,"Pretty soon I will be turning 18 in about 6 months. I recently house sitted for some family. I decided to just sleep there and live there on my own and I loved every second of it. It was a fantastic experience and I learned alot about myself and that I have matured really well.

Most people, when they move out are trying to get away from their parents. However for me I feel this isn't the case. I feel like I'm trying to get away from being dependent. My parents have done a fantastic job raising me. I am as clean as a whistle by my own choice, I am in good physical shape, I have a healthy social life, etc. 

This is what makes it hard for me to tell them I want to move out, as soon as I turn 18. Sure it'll be a change in how I live and what I do but I am ready for that challenge. I would be on my own for 6 months before I leave for a religious mission that I plan on serving. Also I am their youngest child, so I'll be the last to be leaving the nest and I'm worried that they will feel sad that their last kid is ""running off""

What I need help with is telling them my plan. Should I still ask them? I'll be 18, so I don't think I need to, because I'll be an adult (well legally an adult. I don't think I am an actual adult for quite some time until after 18, let alone I just started growing belly button hair a few months ago 😂) 
How should I break the news to them? I want to let them know this isn't about me running away from them and I will see them every Sunday, we go to the same church. I was thinking maybe taking them out to dinner around October-ish, as I still need a lot of time to think about all of this. Any positive advice is wanted!

155,"I honestly don't know where to start with this.

He dropped the news to me today. While he has every right to do what he wants and I genuinely want him to be happy, I can't say that I am exactly thrilled with the woman he is choosing to make this commitment to. In fact, I am devastated.

Why I am devastated is not because she's not my mother, it's just that she's a terrible person.  Apologies, but I have to give a rather long backstory to tell you why. 

You see, I met (let's call her F) F around 3 years ago. I was introduced to her by both of my parents as a family friend, or so me and my mother thought. 

My parents' relationship with each other was always on and off, rocky and overall unhealthy ever since I could remember. My mother was constantly battling against her addiction, while my father wasn't really there for in her times of need. 

To start, F took advantage of my mother's fragility to addiction to take my father. It was during a vacation in Las Vegas. My mom was around 6 months sober, and at some point she was given pills by F who said they were just aspirin, but it was really something else. My mother relapsed, and my dad was not having it. Fast forward a couple months, my father and F are dating and he asked my mother to move out of the house. I decided to go with my mom to move back to my grandmother's, since I didn't want to be around F and my dad knowing what had happened.

The year to come was pure hell. My mother went insane. She drank herself nearly to death,  and was always questioning her own worth to everybody. She was completely broken and it broke me too. At some point, F had sent an email to my mom talking shit about her and myself, stating that I will be an addict just like her.
I did not talk to my father during this time. I didn't want anything to do with it. 

Fast forward another year, summary:
My parents eventually reconcile, mom is sober again and moves back in. Dad gives me a sincere apology, and told me that he never wants mine and his relationship to be cut like that, and that he will make sure to always communicate his feelings from now on. I forgive my father, but decided to stay at grandma's, because in the back of my mind I knew what was going to eventually happen.

3 months later: Dad tells me he's going to ask my mom to move out, as he realizes things won't work out between them, which I agree to. I felt a sense of relief that it's all over, but then I was in for a surprise. He tells me he's flying to Florida to see his friends and F. I obviously wasn't happy about that. I told him I will never like her because of what she did, but whatever. She was in Florida and we were on the other side of the country, I figured this was a one time thing.

Nope.

I find out yesterday that they are once again in a relationship via Facebook under suggested friends. It was her and my father together in her profile pic. When I clicked on it, it suddenly wasn't there anymore. I tried finding F's profile by typing her name, nothing. She had blocked me. 
 
I decided I wasn't going to bring it up until I saw my dad the following day, then today he drops the marriage bomb. I told him that I already knew, that I had found out on Facebook, and he expressed disappointment because he wanted to be the first to inform me, which I understand since it sucks to find out from a different source. I also expressed that I didn't like how F was trying to hide the facebook shit from me, like I'm your fiancee's daughter, wtf are you hiding from?

I told him that his happiness matters to me. I had spend 24 years of my life witnessing my parents be miserable, and if that's what he wants, then whatever.  

I did tell him that it will affect me though, since I have a right to feel resentment and no sense of trust towards F, based on what she has done. He was in agreement with me. I also demanded since I have to accept the marriage, that she should have to accept that me and my mother will always be in his life, and a great start to coming with that acceptance would be an apology. I also said that I would try my best to be civil. He listened to what I had to say and respected my wishes and concerns, and told me he would tell F how I feel.

I honestly thought I was going to be okay when I got home, but I'm not. I'm fucking broken. I just don't understand why he wants to be with a person who disrespected me and my mother, and constantly talked shit about us. I know that things between my parents were far from perfect, but you know, things could have been handled much more differently and maturely. 
If he were to marry anyone with any class in them, I would be thrilled.

I'm hurt, disgusted, and once again I feel betrayed. I don't want to be angry or cling on to any hatred that I feel. 
I'm also very worried that this marriage will negatively impact mine and my father's relationship. We just barely patched things up. The last thing that I want to do is cut him off again, I know he loves me and I love him too, even though I don't agree with the decisions he makes. 


I just don't know what to do. There are a million things going through my mind. How am I even going to have the strength to attend this wedding? How am I going to deal with this woman? How is this going to affect my mentality? It's already working against me. I haven't slept. 

Just, if you took the time to read this, thank you. Any advice is appreciated. I feel so lost.

156,"So i have just found out that my best friends sister has been in star ship hospital for the past few weeks over cutting up her arm, which i thought that was depression and her being a bit of a stupid teen. But  I've come to find that she does have depression and that there were 3 guys (one of them were an older friends brother) who said that she should go up the arm instead as that is better. Anyways it must of got stuck in her head and she done it.

But the thing that really gets me is that the parents and the principal thinks they done nothing wrong. Basically the principal says they were telling her the 'benefits' of going up the arm, which I find is complete bullshit and the parents who think it's her own damn fault for doing it, I think the principal took the parents side as they are both teachers there as well but so is her mother.

So I'm now on the fence that when the next time i am in that town I may be confronting him, finding out who those people other two were and attacking them as well.",22Jun2018,2
157,"Hello everyone, I've been thinking for about half a year now and I think I want to go to law school. I got accepted into a program that allows me to do 2 years of my Bachelor's locally and then, with a good GPA, go to the UK for law school. After finishing law school in the UK, I would return to finish my Bachelor's. The program itself takes 6 years but you also have to add the equivalency exam and the year you spend as an articling student as well. So, in total ~8 years . Plus it's going to cost ~$30,000.

I'm a 25 year old woman who has a stable full-time job as a law clerk. I'm very happy now and I love my job and the legal field. Salary could be a bit better but I've only done this job for two years.

I am not working this summer as I had a lot of trips planned for this summer and no one is going to hire me for a month, and I saved money for school beforehand so I’m right on track money wise this summer.

Last night I heard my parents talking in their room and my dad said “we have the right to know” and after my mom replied said “do you want me to talk to her?” This is how they operate, they talk about me and then act very nice the next day and then ambush me together and tear me down. It’s a pattern that they have operated on for years. I think it either has to do with me moving in with my boyfriend or the fact I’m not working this summer even though we both agreed on the amount I pay for school and I already made and paid that amount in preparation for my trips this summer.

163,"Hi, so this is a very specific question and I'm not entirely sure it's the right thread (new to reddit) but...

One of my very good friends from school is incredibly insecure and while obviously it affects her life, it has got to the point where it has become difficult for me to hang out with her. I am pretty social, but cannot really take her to any events/parties etc, because she does not talk, and makes it very awkward (she literally just stands/sits there). Because she does not do anything, I feel I cannot talk to her about my life and bond about boys/friends/going out/normal 20-something events.

So that's the selfish part and what's affecting me, but I am also just worried about her:

In the last two years of high school she got very skinny and basically had an eating disorder. I was at a different school and then went to uni far away so could not be there all the time. Her family refused, and still do, to acknowledge she has/had a problem, even when I spoke to them. She is no longer scarily skinny, and eats more, but has never gone to a specialist/therapist. I have gently advised her and she agrees, however her family make it difficult for her to see someone (her mother is against it). I know that therapy is one of the main solutions to this, but her family is so overbearing and so unsupportive right now no matter what I say she won't do it, and I don't want to be forceful about it, especially because I have been away from her for so long.

I am really worried about her as well because she is now applying for jobs and getting rejected because she literally has no confidence and cannot talk to people like the intelligent, funny girl she is! 

I love and want to help her - she is not in a dire situation: she has friends, she is not noticeably skinny anymore, and she is intelligent. 

But I just want to know if/can I help her? Or any advice in general!
 I didn't put this in the eating disorders thread because there are many different factors going on here.

170,"Hello everyone.

Longtime lurker here, looking for some life advice. The thing is, in the last few months I often feel lost, almost as if I had no purpose in life right now. I've spent quite some time on this subreddit, and I do know that the community here is very helpful and friendly - so let me give you a brief summary on my life so far, and then I'll ask you a few questions that you can(hopefully) able to help me with.

I was born in a small town in a certain third-world country, shortly after the USSR has collapsed. My family was quite poor, we had to save money on literally anything, and the city itself was very depressing, with very few good places to work at. On top of that, I also got into a lot of fights at school, my grades were terrible, and I was regularly beaten up at home. All these events gave me a lot of ambition and determination, just to do anything to get away from that hellhole(along with a good amount of self-hate and minor suicidal thoughts). So it was just natural that a year or two before I graduated high school, I decided that I really don't want to spend the rest of my life there, so I moved to a nearby city to enter an university, and change my life for the better. 

A few years have passed, and here I am, a few years after graduating from my university. I've spent the last two last years working almost non-stop, for 10-12 hours per day, with no proper vacations, and now I have finally managed to get a very well-paid remote job, with the wage that is more than enough to live as a king(in my home country, at least). But the problem is, I don't feel very happy about it - I almost feel like I have lost so many years working and studying, while the other guys were partying 24/7 and enjoying their carefree life. I also have a feeling that for me, it is just a very unhealthy way to overcompensate for my almost complete lack of personal life, my mediocre appearance and all the personal problems I have. All that hate and resentment that has incubated inside of me for all these years is still there, and it is not going to go away just like that, no matter how much I make or where I live. I do understand that the situation is not that bad, my physical shape is not that bad, and there are a lot of good points about me, but still, it is extremely difficult to admit that sometimes.

So, questions:

1)How do I find myself, and come to peace with myself? I would really like to learn to love myself and become more confident - and while I do have a few things planned in my head, maybe you guys can recommend something.
2)What do you guys can recommend me on a personal development topic? I've been really neglecting most of the books/movies, and wasn't thinking about myself in general, but right now, I would really like to become a better person and change myself, both physically and mentally. My mind is open to nearly anything - so feel free to recommend me anything you like(imagine that you have a younger brother that asks you about interesting stuff). Maybe there was a book that has changed the way you live and think?
3)Is this a topic I should approach a good psychiatrist with? I am a little afraid to open up to someone in real life like that, but I will do it if that can help.
4)And finally - which country would you move to if you had a remote job? I can't leave the country for the next few months due to legal reasons, but I will do so at the very first opportunity. Can you give me an advice on that?

Thank you.

Has anyone taken a job like this and realized it payed off in the end? Just need some help thinking it over

174,"My Dad owns his own home improvement business which he runs almost entirely by himself. Since I was 10 I’ve had no choice but to help him with the work, usually during the summer it’s been another job for me. I’m 18 now, headed for college locally in September. I’ve always disliked the work, but a few months back he gave me a sales pitch about the pros of owning your own business, being your own boss, good pay, etc.. Reluctantly I agreed to eventually become his business partner. 

However, having started to work with him again I’ve realized what a nightmare of a situation this will become for me. You see, my dad and I have had a shaky relationship for most of my life. Although we have our share of good times, he is extremely verbally abusive. In anger, he has said horrible things to me which if I told anybody would horrify them. He is easily set off, and since I’m his son, he feels he can say whatever he wants to me on the job site. I’m super sensitive, so his commentary easily affects me and I can’t concentrate at work. 

Yesterday, I had a very intense emotional breakdown. Throughout the work day, which can span anywhere from 8-10 hours, I have to listen to his directions, which puts immense pressure on me. If I don’t do it right, which happens often because of my inexperience and how unclear his descriptions are, he gets angry. This can escalate into him shouting at me, asking me why “I can’t do anything fucking right”, “what the fuck’s up with you?”, etc. This gives me great anxiety, making the whole situation worse. 

I felt nothing but doom yesterday. My friends have part time jobs and work hard, but they have the free time to go out and enjoy themselves, and have some independence. Meanwhile, I’m stuck here doing a job that I hate  with somebody that makes me feel miserable. I have had to turn down many social opportunities because I knew he would give me a hard time about not putting my job with him first. Call me immature, but I’m not ready to grow up this quickly. I have a part time job  at a grocery store that I enjoy but have had to put on hiatus for this, and I wish I had it back. These things, and the idea of going through the anxiety every single day drove me to a breaking point. I went to my brothers apartment and broke down sobbing to his girlfriend. 

Basically, I want to quit, but I don’t know how to break it to him. While he’s told me he can hire someone else, albeit in a very bitter tone of disappointment, I know he needs help. He’s running a business single handedly and has been through hell keeping it afloat through the recession, although things are decent now. He thinks I’m invested, talking about my future in the company, being a partner, and he thinks I’m all in. 

But at some point, I need to put my interests (and my health) first. I have decent money saved, but I know I can make more. I want to return to my old job and work nearly full time. I want to enjoy my young years before taking on a burden of a company. He wants me to work full time for him during the day, and take classes at night, which I know will break me. Basically, I want to enjoy life and be happy, and working for him will do the opposite. I need to figure out how to tell him this, but he’s not a very understanding person. He’s the kind of person that he feels if he doesn’t understand it, than it most not make any sense. He will argue his point till the cows come home and I fear he’ll threaten to kick me out of my house. 

Thanks for reading this, it turned out to be pretty long. Feel free to say whatever of course. I need your guy’s advice on how to handle this.

175,"I just graduated from college in May and am currently looking for a job. My parents are pressuring me a lot to get a job, but as I apply to things I don't really want it, it makes it an even harder task. Theres even more pressure because my brother who is 3 years younger than me did not go to college, has a great job he likes, and makes a good amount of money with potential for a lot more. I always was caught between the advice of go where the money is and do something you love. Very few people get to do both I feel like (make money by doing something they truly love). The things I happen to enjoy most don't include viable pay options for myself (and if they do, the time to create the opportunity would be pay-less for too long. example: love video games - good luck being a streamer and pulling in enough profit in a timely manner). Anyways, my heart is not set on a career path right now like other people that I know which is making it very difficult to push myself to find a job, tbh. I just can't see myself working a normal job that is 9-5 m-f and being happy. Last summer I worked a paid internship from 8:30 to 5p (and it wasn't difficult work), but I remember thinking and still thinking that I'm living out my nightmare right now. I really don't know what to do. I see my parents go to their 9-5 jobs that I know they do not like, but do it because they have to. They have a family to take care of, bills, etc. I don't give them enough credit in person but I always think to myself ""I have no idea how you have the strength to wake up and do this everyday, because I can't"". On the same note i wonder if they are just desensitized by now to their own misery enough just to keep going. If I was them I'd be miserable with my life career wise. I'd feel like a failure. Maybe I am just a big baby and should accept the fact that people going to 9-5s for decent money everyday to own whatever they have (house, car, etc) is better than what a lot of people around the world have. The problem is those things don't motivate me at all. I don't care about cars (the piece of crap I drive now is great as long as its working) and I don't want to own a house. I understand these things can change over time as you get a family, wife, blah blah blah. I just need some advice from maybe someone who has gone through something similar who can't/couldn't see them self working a dumb job to be another slave to society. Thanks",22Jun2018,1

177,"Our almost 2 year old has had medical issues almost her whole existence, we went to the doctors and the doctor took a swab of her vagina to do some tests then a nurse came in and placed a bag over her vagina to try and get some urine with no luck with us waiting for over an hr. The doctor came back in and gave us a sterile pee test cup for us to collect pee out of her portable micky mouse potty she is beginning to use. I was able to collect some later that day but the sample never got to the doctors office due to both of our hectic work schedules and we thought the swab test would be enough information they needed. My wife gets a call 2 days later and says that they found an abnormality in the test and we need to come first thing the next morning so we did. I was at work when I got a call from my wife saying that the swab they took was fine but the urine they got was positive for an STD. My wife explained that they never received her urine and that they are wrong but the doctor said someone dropped off urine at the front desk and it was my daughters. (Bullshit) so I come home from work that night and walk into the house with two sheriffs and a DCF agent grilling my wife over abuse.

178,"I had never had a female friend. Over my whole high school career I had probably talked to less than ten girls, being close to none of them. 
This year in college, I met a girl through a group project who I ended up really liking. Being as inexperienced as I am, I did a number of really stupid things. I’m going to list them and hopefully other people can learn from my mistakes, I feel like my chance with this girl is over. 

Here’s the list of idiotic things I did

Midway through the project I told her I liked her over text (wow how can you be that dumb?!). She said she has a boyfriend but wanted to stay good friends. I found this kinda weird because at most I would say we were friends not good friends but whatever.

I asked her to do something and she said “if you want to”. Instead of taking this as no like a normal person would, I deluded myself into thinking that she actually wanted to if I wanted to. This resulted in me spazzing out and making a whole plan only for her to not follow through.

I ranted to her about someone who we both know and got mad over nothing.

I would always try to say witty things in texts and it was embarrassing.

I feel like I was an idiot and missed any chance I would’ve had with this girl. ",22Jun2018,0

180,"First time post. When I get uncomfortable, I tend to isolate myself away from the group, and I feel like I am killing the vibe, or making it more awkward. I shut in and stay on my phone, not really paying attention to what the group is doing. I feel like I come off as an incredibly bitchy person, and I don’t know how to get over this attitude. For example: when I was younger and had sleepover birthday parties, at a certain point, I would literally leave the room and take a couple friends to just talk to and be away from everything happening. I’m not great at parties because after a couple hours, I just want to be alone. I do have generalized anxiety, and I don’t know if that’s what’s causing me to overthink the situation.

181,"I’m home from university, and I was in my parents computer room when a paper dated 9/25/17 that was a medical report of my mom’s caught my eye. It was right there in the open, so I read part of it and it was from a radiologist. Under Impressions it said “findings suggesting bilateral chronic renal disease”. Under this report was one from 9/19/17 where she had kidney stone pain. I remember her calling me about that when I was away, she even went to the ER for it. I looked up chronic renal disease and it sounds like it can be terminal as it can lead to kidney failure. She quit her job recently, and the other day she had a doctors appointment and afterward cried on the phone outside for a while. I don’t know who she was talking to, but she has also been telling me “this is yours when I die” and stuff like that.  She also complains of her kidneys hurting all the time and says it’s just stones, but she’s had this pain for a couple of months now.

190,"Hi, I'm from Czech Republic. The life is pretty good here, it's hard to find any differences between life in Germany and life in here. I come from lower uppper middle class (huh) family. Let's just say we are wealthier than average (thanks to my father, but mother is paid well too), but it's still not upper class Bilzerian-thing. The thing is, our family geneticaly comes from Germany, Sweden and Denmark. It's getting pretty hot here, 30°C (80°F) is too hot for me. I'm naturally very pale. But it's not about only about heat and sun. Since 10 years old, I always loved the north. For the past few years, I've been going with my father to northern countries in the free time to do some hikes and climb some mountains. Spend a lot of time in Canadian nature, loved every second of it. Of course obsession with the nordic history is there, but I have no fantasies about being a Viking and stuff. I don't like the series anyway. And I'm fascinated by the Iron Age mostly. My plans for the future are (I'm 18 years old, last year of high school) - go to the college and become a programmer. I more or less decided that I want to study in Czechia, because we own some apartment house (around 12 apartmens there) in a distant city (the most polluted and most ""hardcore"", probably the only eastern-Europe-like, Ostrava city) which I don't like. I want to move to study in that city and manage the building, collect the money, get the money from not paying tenants etc. My father is tired and getting old, has a lot of work and also wishes me to do that. I do the same, he is not controlling me about it. I have two siblings, but let's be realistic, I'm the oldest and if I administrate the building and live in the damned polluted and ugly city, he will probably pass it on me, which would be awesome later in life. I would live there while studying, means no rent paid and privacy. Would love to emigrate to Norway very much though. It's strange to see not an economic migrant these days, right? Ironically, I don't like the migration policy of other nordic states, so I would want to live in Norway more than in Sweden, because there is not so much immigrants from ""the south"", if you know what I mean. Problem is, I have to live and work 40 years in Norway to get pension, which would make me work to my 64 +-, if I emigrated from Czechia *right* after college. All I want is to live good nordic programmer's life, get married and have children, when young live in some suburb, make good living, get married and raise children and later move to some small city or village. What life should I choose? I have less than one year to do the choice. Staying in Czechia would give me much more starting money and influence, I know the country, people, language(Norwegian language is no problem for me either)... Oh yeah, did I forgot to mention my parents own shit tons of properties in Czech Republic (several family houses, three small houses in the forested mountains - save place to escape to if something like Nuclear war or anything happens,)? I did. That's huge factor too. Now you see how much I am maybe willing to pay just for living closer to my roots and heart. Forests, mild weather, streams and mountains and the whole north sounds much better to me than no forests, cold winter but hot summer and spring, low lands and low mountains, Ostrava... I see two more, less likely options. Study in Norway, but that would be too much yolo considering all the things and money I could have in Czechia. Emigrate to Norway *later* in life, possibly with family while first child being 2 years old or something, but that would mean no pension money, unless the human life expectancy rises to 120 years and I will be able to work much longer. But perhaps no money from the state will be needed and I will be ok. Sorry for making this so long and complicated.",22Jun2018,1

197,"Ok, first let me start by saying that i live in a country with HUGE unemployment rates. It's terribly hard to find a job, even if you are specialized, and even then you get minimum wage most of the time, which is barely enough to finance a normal life. My boyfriend has two college degrees. He has been searching for a job in his field for about two years now, but with no luck. What usually happens is that employers in this field hire you for a ''trial, a couple of unpaid months so we can test you'', and then they kick you out finding some kind of excuse. Then they hire the next desperate person who is willing to work unpaid, until they also kick them out. So it has nothing to do with laziness or pickiness. He gets excited everytime someone hires him, and then they kick him out for no particular reason apart from his demand to finally get paid after three months of working 8 hours a day for free. It's like a roller coaster and it's ruining him emotionally. 

The second problem is that he also hasn't fulfilled his military duties yet, because he postponed them in order to keep studying. Inevitably, he has to do it this year, but he sometimes mentions that he thinks about committing suicide there. He's sick of the situation and scared that when he's out he will be a 28 year old man with no work experience and no money at all. He thinks he has failed in his career and now its too late to try.

I am really baffled and worried. He is not a depressed person at all, but the unemployment has worn him off and it's making him worse and worse every day. It's not something a therapist can help with imo.

201,"Hej, 

I did not know how exactly write the title, so it might be little misleading. 
To start of, I'm really happy with my boyfriend. We have been together for 3 years and he is very kind and just perfect in every aspect. We talk together about issues and don't have any secrets or anything. The problem is me. My boyfriend likes to have beer on friday and weekend, he doesn't get drunk, just around 5, max 7 and during week 1 or 2 with dinner. I know that it is not a bad amount and he never gets drunk, as they often are not even a high alcohol ones. The problem is that I can not stand it. I hate the smell of alcohol and hate when I can smell it in his breath and since his speech changes when he drinks I get more irritated by it. But I don't want him to stop drinking beer as I know that it is not a bad thing that he wants to have some beer just for the favor or that he simply enjoys it. But I don't know how to not get angry/irritated and automatically distance myself when he drinks. 
Just a little backstory, when I was small my mom used to be an alcoholic and it definitely affected the way how I look at drinking. My boyfriend knows about it. And he did say he would not drink if I really hated it that much but I personally don't want him to do it. As what happened in the past does not bother me and I don't want it to affect me in the present. 
So I would be very grateful for any advice you could have, how not to think about alcohol as just waste of money. I personally don't mind drinking a glass of wine with dinner time to time, but definitely not on a weekly basis. 

And the second thing is that I'm a big introvert. I enjoy spending time with my boyfriend like nothing else but I don't enjoy the company of other people as it is quite hard for me to find an interest in someone. My boyfriend is also more on the introvert side but he can be very sociable and wants to spend some holiday with his friends. Which I don't have a problem with it at all. I'm glad that he wants to be with his friends. But I don't want to spend it with anyone, but as we both want to celebrate it with each other as well, we usually end up going together. Which leads to me not having much of a fun. As his other friends like to have a drink, as a normal person on a party likes to, but I dont enjoy it particularly. So even though I end up having something to drink and try to be as sociable as I can, which most of the time goes well, as I get along with people pretty easily, I don't know how to enjoy these events. 

I feel like I am missing a part of my boyfriends live. The same goes with his family. I know them very well but as my family is not very close I can't stand being together for a longer time and just talk about stuff that I am not particularly interested it. But i am very happy my boyfriend loves his family and wants to spend time with them. I support him with it and don't try to make him to be away from them and we celebrate stuff together. I just want to enjoy these activities and try to be better as I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

To start, for the past two months or so I've been living out of my 1992 Toyota Pickup. It isn't glamorous, but I've been managing. Gym membership for hygiene, laundromats, two jobs and the library to keep busy. It took a little getting used to, but it isnt a terrible way of life, for now anyway. If we're being honest, there are a lot of things I genuinely enjoy about it, and could see myself living this type of life by choice (i.e. /r/vandwellers) at some point in the future. 

The biggest perk of living out of your vehicle is just how much money you can save up, not having to pay for rent, bills, and such. In the last two months I've managed to save up about $2,800. Not a lot of money by any stretch, but the most I've been able to save on my own thus far. To be honest I'm proud to say it. It's a combination of less bills and achieving a level of discipline I didnt have before. 

For the time being, I've let go of the notion of getting a place to live. I'm ok with that, that isnt what this post is about. See, initially, my plan was to pay off my credit card (2k limit/balance). While I could do that now, It would pretty much wipe my money out, and I've grown to really appreciate the peace of mind of having that comfort blanket. 

Unfortunately, my truck is on its last leg. I knew going into it that it wasnt in fantastic shape, my plan was to fix it up (when I had a place I was living where I could work on it), but I neglected to notice just *how bad* the rust was on the underside when I purchased it. The frame is essentially swiss cheese in some places, holding on by a thread. To be blunt, if someone were to hit me in the wrong way, I have a worry that the truck would basically split. In addition, the rust is so bad in other places that most shops arent even willing to work on it for fear of breaking the truck and their own safety. I get it. I had to plead with the shop near me just to bleed and replace the brakes, and when I convinced them, they couldnt even do the job fully because it was so bad. Suffice it to say, the truck is just going to run until it dies. Because of this I've lost an interest in maintenance, because it feels like I'm just throwing money away. 

However in the last two days, the truck has begun to overheat badly. I mean within ten minutes of driving, the temperature gauge will be halfway to red with the coolant resovior boiling and steaming. I had this problem once before, ended in a cracked radiator, which I replaced myself and it seemed to solve the issue. This time around I cant seem to find any such leak, save for the mess created by the boiling coolant. I checked my oil and its ok (it was low, since the truck burns oil like nobodies business, but I topped it off). By the way, could a bad filter cause this? I'm going to take it somewhere to replace that later today. I just hate to spend the money and have it not solve the issue. 

Anyway. The problems in this truck are so many that I need to start thinking of its replacement. If I can squeeze another month out of this baby I could have about 4k to spend, I think. I dont want to buy another cheap craigslist car, I'm tired of this nonsense. I've been doing a lot of looking around, and theres a pristine 2001 Honda Prelude (a car I used to own and am very familiar with, not to mention fond of). It's going for $5,800 with 108k on the odo, and zero issues. I've test driven it a handful of times over the last few months, taken it to autozone for codes. It's bone stock. I havent tested this yet, but I even think it would be spacious enough for me to sleep in. It certainly would afford me more space and comfort than the truck I've got now. 

Would this be foolish? I can rationalize it, but I need some outside perspective. Of course I'm still looking at other options, but this one seems like the best just because I know its in good shape and I'm familiar with it. It would wipe me, but if I walk in with 3 or 4k, I'd only have about 2k to have to pay off. Easy peasy, right?

My credit is alright, about 650, so I think I'd get approved pretty easily. I do want to pay off my credit card, but with this whole truck thing lately I wouldnt feel comfortable draining my money in case the truck did bite the dust. I mean, what then?

As a side note, I have a potentially great job opportunity that has presented itself. I'm trying not to count on it too much, because its still only a possibility, but if I do get it I could expect 45k/yr, which is more than I make at both my jobs now. I have an employee reference and they're heavily hiring, so I'm cautiously optimistic. Honestly it's just a relief to know its *possible*. But I'm not counting it into my plans for all this yet. I just wanted to mention it. 

**tl;dr** Living out of my truck which is likely about to die. Do I take what little savings I have and buy a car I'm very familiar with and know is in very good shape, or should I wait and see what happens..? Mostly just looking for advice or ideas. Getting an apartment is not an option right now, which I'm ok with. That's just down the road a little. Vehicle is more important at the moment. 

Thanks for your time guys! I'm about to head into work so replies may be spotty at first, but I'll be back in later. Please ask me as many questions as you want, I'l answer 'em all.

209,"Last year, I moved to the DC area with a friend to find a job in my field (writing/editing). I ended up getting having some trouble finding a job in my field, so I took two retail jobs. I still had problems paying rent, so I moved back home to the boonies in April.

Now, I'm living with my dad again despite being in my mid-20's. I started working part-time at a small hobby store in the area. My uncle's girlfriend also works at this store, and I simply cannot stand her.

She treats me like a child, talks down to me, and won't shut up about her own ""superior"" travel and work experience. She also treats me like an idiot because I struggled to remember some things when I first started, like how to do returns on the cash register.

Anyway, I feel obligated to work in this position because I know (and like) the owner of the store and because she went out of her way to hire me. I also don't want to cause any trouble for my uncle.

The owner has been operating her store for about 20 years and apparently hasn't had any vacation time until she hired me. Only 4 people work at the store including her.

I don't make much money (about $200 a week), but there aren't really any full-time jobs I could take in the area. It's all retail stuff.

Anyway. I want to find a better job in an urban area so I can move out, but I'm really not sure how to apply to jobs if I'm not living in the area.

Anyway, I'd appreciate any advice on how to deal with an awful co-worker, and advice on how to find a job in a different part of the country.",22Jun2018,3

212,"So long story short, my 17 year old brother broke my ps4 pro, headset, controller, tv and my bedroom door. Which comes close to $1200. He did this because he said i ‘provoked’ him and he got mad so it’s ‘my fault’. My parents tell me to let it go and protect him and they will give me the money while he can happily live his life (which means not doing anything, not even going to school). He has severe anger issues and probably some mental issues as well (we dont know yet) and basically terrorizes our home. Dont know what to do as my parents wont stand up to him and take his stuff away (he has the latest samsung phone, ps4, laptop, tv and plays games all night and sleeps during the day, then wakes up at 6 or so pm and repeat). It makes me extremely mad that he can just do whatever he wants because its not fair at all. No idea what to do. When i talk to my parents about it they get mad at me and tell me to stop talking about it as i ‘dont know anything’ and they will ‘take care of it’. They enable him in everything he does. He hits me, punches me in the face, kicks me, yells at me, pushes me into whatever is close to me. When i tell my parents about the abuse they tell him to ‘stop’ once and thats it while im in pain, crying on the floor and they tell me to stop making him mad. Everything triggers him to get mad and he destroys whatever he wants and my parents just pay for it to get new stuff. 

Meanwhile he cant even talk to people, he has gotten extremely awkward as he locks himself in his room 24/7 and feels like everyone and everything is against him. He says everything is someone elses fault. When family comes over, he doesn’t even come downstairs to say hi and he sneaks around the house so no one sees him/talks to him. He lives in a fantasy world on his ps4 playing videogames 24/7.

216,"So my boyfriend and I have been wanting to move once our lease is up for several months now. The state we live in it gets extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter. (-19 is the lowest I saw and I moved here in February, but it gets colder than that)
I can't drive for some personal reasons, so I bike everywhere. I have 2 jobs but I don't make very much money and I've been scraping by for almost 2 months now. It's difficult for me to bike to work now because I'm fairly malnourished and so I lack the energy. 
In the winter in this state, not only would I not be able to bike (the sidewalks get absolutely covered in snow and ice and aren't shovelled regularly enough) I wouldn't be able to walk either, considering it already takes me nearly an hour to bike there. My boyfriend can't drive me because his work is an hour away and I work opposite shifts to him. I don't have many friends that are able to give me a ride either. 
Because of this and the fact that my boyfriend wants to go back to school, we've decided our best options is to move. However, we can't find an affordable apartment in most states we have been looking (the school he wants to go to is in Portland, Oregon, and rent for even the smallest apartments there is ridiculous.) This is also assuming we would both be able to get jobs right away. 
We can't stay here because when winter comes, I legitimately will not be able to get to work, and my boyfriend can't support both of us. 
He's also had the idea of moving to Oregon and tenting there in the woods for a few months (up to a year) until we have jobs and the money to get a place, but as I have said I can't bike very far at all, nor walk, and presumably we would be pretty far out so I have no clue how I would be able to get to work. 
On top of that, I wouldn't feel safe living out of a tent, especially if I had to stay there for hours on my own without my boyfriend while he worked or something. 
When it comes to jobs, he has far more experience than I do, and I had difficulty getting a job where I am now. I tried working at a fast food place but I didn't last a week because I couldn't keep up with the pace and found the environment to be very overstimulating, and my coworkers were disrespectful towards me because I am openly transgender. After I got home and had a complete meltdown, I just stopped showing up because I couldn't handle it anymore. 
I personally cannot move back in with my family. It is 100% out of the question. 
We also genuinely cannot stay where we are, because when winter comes I'm fucked. 
I don't know what to do. I'm stressed out of my mind, and our lease ends on the 31st of August. I don't know how a move would be possible right now in a way that would not be severely detrimental to my mental health. I want to move and I know we need to so we can survive, but I just don't know what to do. ",22Jun2018,1

218,"This is my first time trying a site that’s basically a third-party that bypasses border restrictions by ordering items on your behalf and send it to you afterwards, and frankly this is not going down well.

I did a background check on this site. Even though it’s still a startup, it’s positively cited in reputable news sites and the owner even did interviews there, so I went ahead and ordered from them. I paid with a credit card and after that the site said that I would receive the item within a month.

The tracking number has markers whether the order is being processed, on its way to the third-party, received by the third-party, or on its way to me. A week after the order, my order’s still stuck on processing. Two weeks, still the same. Considering most shipping to here takes 2-3 weeks, the item would barely reach me on the estimated date, so I tried to contact them.

Their customer support is *shitty*. 5+ attempts to contact them through the week, and they only replied *one* time, even though they’re online every time. They said that “we have yet to receive a confirmation from the store (that sells the item)”. Instantly when they replied, I replied back to ask them to ask the store for clarification. And they went silent again. Each day after that, I wrote to ask about the follow-up, but they won’t reply. I thought I’m being way too pushy so I held back for some time.

Now, literally *a month* from the order date, the order’s still in processing. At this point I said eff it and made my mind to confront them through every way I can. And frustratingly every way is a dead end. So far I:

- Tried to call a phone number used for inquiries, no one picked up  
- Found the office address on the page, turns out that they have moved without a new  address posted there; and the most frustrating,  
- Blasted my inquiries via direct messages of their social media accounts. They left it on READ, while still POSTING PROMOS there.

219,"So I'm an 18 year old Indian guy. I've never had a girlfriend (too busy with academics and sports in high school) and I'm still a virgin (waiting for the right person). When I started university this year, I was introduced to the idea of casual sex, where you have sex with a stranger or just a friend. It's not something I would ever consider doing because I want to share that type of intimacy with a girlfriend/wife. Before any of you say ""You've never had sex, you can't say that!"", please don't try to convince me to have casual sex. I will do no such thing because it goes against who I am and my values (personal, not religious). Nothing wrong with casual sex, it's just not something I will ever do.

One night, I came out of my bedroom high (I've stopped smoking marijuana for good now). I went into the kitchen of our suite for a glass of water. My three roommates and two girls were sitting in the living room of the suite. When they saw me, they started pressuring me to have sex with one of the girls. I politely declined as I wasn't physically or emotionally attracted to the girl and had no interest in her. They all started saying things like ""A beautiful girl wants to have sex with you, you should just do it."", ""Don't be a pussy, just do it"" and ""Do it! It's now or never!"". I kept declining saying I was intoxicated on weed and couldn't consent (Canadian law). They blew it off and kept trying to sway me. The girl was trying to open my bedroom door and kept saying ""Let's do it"". Let me give some background on this girl. Throughout the year, she tried to kiss me, grind on me, and try to hookup with me (during parties), but I declined every single time (she would be very drunk).

Now back to the story. Eventually, they left me alone and I went back to my room. I felt kinda shitty. Like I wasn't good enough a virgin and that I wasn't cool enough to hang around. This all happened last night and I haven't really spoken to any of them since. What should I do? Do you think I did the right thing?

Whenever someone has told me about anxiety I always thought people were over exaggerated simple because I didn’t understand it. But let me tell you if you have never had a serious anxiety attack it is no joke. 

I had just arrived home from work about two weeks ago. As I’m walking into my house I begin to feel a tight clench on my left chest. It gets tighter and feels like someone is squeezing my heart with all there strength. All of the sudden I get these surreal feeling of impending doom as if I am going to die and there is nothing I can do. My legs begin to feel numb. I get inside and panic-kingly tell my mom I need to go to the hospital right now. Since I’ve never had any anxiety problems I thought I was honestly having a heart attack at the age of 20. My mom was worried and rushed me to the hospital. When I get there they run all sorts of test and after a few hours they let me know that there is NOTHING WRONG. I couldn’t believe it but I did feel like nothing was wrong anymore as it had died down.

English is not a problem (I scored 28/30 in the real test and in 2 demos), verbal comprehension can be a problem (it depends on the given essay, in the real test I scored 3/5 while in the demos I did 1/5 and 2/5).

Well, my feelings grew a little stronger final year in high school. This year to be honest. 

She and I talked a sometimes about our advances outside of school. Romantic advances that is, or more our sexual ones. Snogging at the club with strangers and the like. She being very pretty get a lot of attention from men. I, being somewhat average by look but charming or carefree when drunk, don't get a lot of attention from ladies but I get lucky with them. 

So we both kinda are synced when it comes to our pursuits in the lovelife.

It was bad enough seeing her as she went and started kissing some random guy that looked better than me. For some reason I got over it once I got some tongue by a girl the same night. The next day my feelings for her are back- 

Not confusing at all, right? 

My female friend (and crush) get easily drunk. When she does she also gets seductive, as in touchy-feely, as in I don't want to know what happens if I leave the room. Never with me though. Never with me. 

It's torture. Having her as a friend is torture. 

I don't like feeling this way. I don't like having to see her get with a dude every once in a while. I know that she doesn't like me the same way. I also am pretty darn sure that even if we worked together we probably wouldn't be so good together. I sometimes say that I fell for her charms but who am I to say it wasn't just her awesome rack and cute face? I hate the fact that I seem to repeat the same process of being jealous, geting over her, then thinking I have a shot only for her to get with another. But the worst of all is that I see her as a friend I really don't want to lose. 

And apparently I'm pathetic enough to ask strangers online for advice",22Jun2018,1

I was finishing my associates degree, gonna transfer to a 4 year, no clue what I wanted to do still. She was going to culinary school. I had recently gotten interested in home cooking. So I made the mistake of transferring to her school, convincing myself that I was doing it for myself, when 95% of the reason was to just be with her. Well, it went ok for a few months, then we had issues and she dropped me. I was heartbroken and fled back home before the semester ended. 

I kind of liked culinary school. Not sure if I could see myself being in the field, but then again I can't see myself doing anything, I'm kind of lost. Now the time is well past upon me. I have to decide whether to transfer back home and just finish up here, up go back to culinary school and finish what I started, risking seeing her, reliving all the memories, etc.

238,"Hello everyone,

To preface, this isn't for myself but for family. John (he) 19, got into a really nice school, coming from poverty and he started dating this girl about a year ago. He was still in highschool and they do sports together in the region. In any case, his girlfriend's (Jane's) mother is **batshit**. Recently Jane's mother has become overprotective of her daughter because she plans on leaving as soon as she turns 18 which is now less than a month away. John helped her get through some tough medical complications she's had, as well as helped her graduate from highschool because she was falling behind on a lot of her work due to sheer laziness. Jane's mother took her frustrated out on John and quite literally has been harassing him for over a month now with her brother, both being over double his age.

John coaches at a nearby boys and girl's club, and has been for 3 years now. Jane recently decided to start going here, even though she's not from the area. Jane's mother became infuriated and had her brother come down to the boys and girls club, pull John aside, and try to scare him claiming he's been both a cop and criminal (an adult delinquent). In light of this, John walked this off and continued going about his daily life. Between John and our family, he resolved to **not** be in contact with this girl until she's 18 to ward off any other attacks.

 He had friends he did sports with graduating from the same highschool as Jane, so he went to attend their graduation ceremony. In light of this, Jane's mother quite literally began walking around the venue letting everyone know the young man (John) sitting by the back was a ""*piece of shit*"" verbatum. Not only embarrassing John, but Jane. John and his mother then went to Jane's home, where they had planned to hash the situation out because it was getting out of hand where Jane's mom had apologized and assured him it wasn't a problem. 

Jane's mother, has since then continued harassing him in spite of not having contact with Jane. To throw fuel into the fire, Jane keeps attempting to contact John, which seems to be getting her even more angry. **Fastforward** to today, Jane let John know her mother was heading to court with some screencapped arguments they had over Facebook where he had gone off on her for standing him up multiple times. She's planning on getting a child protective retraining order (though her daughter will be 18 in a month), which will apparently show on John's record. She's **hellbent** on ruining his life. What course of actions can we take at this point? This women has an actual mental health issue and we just want to be done with it. ",22Jun2018,3
240,"I turned 15 this year. Young, I know, but I already feel as if I’ve wasted my life. I ended up skipping sixth grade, and if all goes according to plan I’ll be going to a college that accepts children after they have finished 11th grade, meaning I’ll have skipped two grades and I’ll be leaving the house at the age of 16. I honestly don’t even know what I want to do in life, I’ve always just wanted to get enough money so I could do the things I wanted when I figured out what I want. I’ve worked so hard at school and at sports that I’ve completely neglected any sort of social interaction outside of school. I live in a very small town and my tenth grade class only has three kids in it including myself. I feel lonely and depressed a lot and sometimes I wonder if I’m doing the right thing. There’s nothing saying that I won’t go into college and experience the exact same problems. There’s nothing saying I won’t just feel the same after getting a job. Am I just wasting my days trying to perfect my school marks and my possible resume for something that might not make me happy? Maybe I’m being cynical but seeing as I have only one year left in my high school career before I leave out into the world and have to be an adult, I feel concerned that I might have wasted the only days where I can enjoy having free time before I’m forced to work. Over the past year I’ve struck up talking online with other people through social media. They all seem to have fun and they live lives I can’t even imagine. They go out and hang with friends after dark and they can go wherever they want and they don’t care about marks or anything. I’ve always said that I’m working hard now to ensure my future but I’m just worried it’s gonna be a future where I’m not any happier than I am now. Sorry, I find this really conflicting. I’m also afraid that I can’t switch my path now that I’m onto it. I got student of the year, I’m basically a “perfect” child and I’m afraid that I’m gonna ruin my reputation. I don’t have friends but at least everyone likes me and I’m afraid to lose that. This whole paragraph is so disorganized and my thoughts are everywhere, my apologies for the horrible formatting.

243,"A friend of a friend breeds dogs, and back in late December they had two liters of puppies. By April there were still a few that hadn’t found homes, so my mom told me I could have one. I was super excited because, while we’ve had family dogs, I never had one that was MINE, and I was always too young to really help much with the tasks of walking and training and such. 

Only a few hours later, she comes back to me and said I can have one, but I have to share ownership with my younger brother. A little about him: he’s 17, and has some sort of mental issues due to the fact that he was dead when he was born (I think the cord was wrapped around his neck or something), and his brain got a little messed up from being without oxygen. 

Now, all growing up I never got along with him because he just wasn’t nice. He would always throw rocks at birds and squirrels and stuff, would physically attack me (and I was never much bigger than he was) and had a bad temper. Knowing this, I was a little unsure of the idea, but I went against my better judgment because I wanted a dog so badly. 

At first things weren’t so bad, but after a while he began being sort of possessive of her, spending a lot of time with her in his bedroom where I obviously am not supposed to go. Then he would complain to my mom that I didn’t spend my share of time watching her, and she would complain to me. 

That was bearable. But lately, my other siblings have come to me quite concerned because they have seen him shoving her, smacking her, grabbing her by grabbing her skin rather than her collar. My sister said he told her, “If she’s being bad just grab her ears and pull them really hard. That’s what I do.” Two siblings even said they saw him, for no apparent reason, suddenly just pin her to the ground and hold her there for several minutes as she whined softly. I immediately reported this to my mom, and asked her to make him stop. And do you know what she said? She accused me of lying, and my siblings as well, and said I was “just being mean.” She said, “Until I see it with my own eyes, I won’t believe it.”

Now, he knows better than to do these things in front of me, or of her I guess. But just earlier today he didn’t know I was in the other room. He was putting her in the crate, and as I walked up silently behind him, I could see that she was fully in the crate, had already laid down and everything. Then I see him reach into the crate, put both hands on her rib cage, and just push her up against the side of the crate, really hard, twice. 

Tears are streaming down my face as I type at this point. I can’t take this. I just want my sweet babygirl to be safe, but I don’t know what to do. Please, if any of you can think of any advice for me, I would really, really appreciate it. Thanks so much for reading. ",22Jun2018,2
244,"TL/DR located at the end of the post. 

Last night I was on a sub where someone misspelled a word, a bot pointed out that the word was misspelled. A redditor argued with the bot and someone else posted to make sure the person knew he was commenting to a bot. The bot fighting redditor started arguing with a handful of people about logical fallacies, examples of words that deviated from spelling patterns etc. I posted in an effort to help the others that the word was misspelled and the bot was correct and that there are no absolutes and the users argument was moot.

The bot fighter posted a reply to me this morning basically saying that my Reddit persona was warm and that I shouldn’t have stuck my nose into their business- and that they were prepared to verbally/mentally destroy me if I continued, then they noted my age, where I live and my first name. I responded back to them by saying that I didn’t appreciate him posting personal information about me and that I found it threatening. He responded by first laughing at me and then listing all of the things he was able to learn about me by reading my post history- health issues I have, businesses my family owns and even my history of childhood sexual abuse. 

I get that we all participate in subs and post information about ourselves...but he knew my name and to my knowledge, I have never shared my name on here. He further said I could respond to him but that he doesn’t care what I have to say and that he was blocking me. (In the same thread he revealed another persons name and what road they lived on and then bragged in another post that he doxxed her b/c he knew she was lying about something completely banal.)

I sent only the 2 messages to them in total which were less than 2-3 sentences each and I did not say anything negative about them in either post. 

I reported the posts that were directed to me but I have this awful feeling in my gut. Part of it is anger because I think that posting a laundry list of personal information is an awful thing to do, especially bringing up my childhood trauma- which I only shared on subs where abuse survivors share and support one another. I also feel really scared that someone who can respond so disproportionately and has spent the time to dig through my history and search for my name is capable of anything. 

Please tell me if there is anything more that I can do to safeguard myself without limiting my participation in other subs, which I have found helpful. I don’t care that this person thinks I am dumb and not worth his time...I was just very surprised to see my experiences weaponized against me and then their threatening me  directly by using my name. 

Does my name appear in my about me? When I look at my profile it shows as empty. 

Is this something that happens often? I feel like this is different than a typical troll. 

Any tips on how I can shake this feeling off? 

Should I delete my account? I am not ashamed of my past or present and up until this point have been comfortable being transparent with my posts. I have found people to be kind and fascinating on Reddit and would really miss participating on here in the future. 

TL/DR: stupid post about a misspelled word led to a redditor sharing personal information about me and now I feel both angry and scared. Is this a normal occurrence on Reddit? Looking for advice on what I can do beyond reporting the user to safeguard myself in the future. ",22Jun2018,4
246,"Hi guys, so I’m unsure whether I should give uni another crack. I’m 20 btw

I dropped out of uni in January because a number of reasons, although the main ones were; not liking the course/city, family troubles and relationship stress. Since I’ve come back I’ve had a few temp jobs and have recently started working at a rapidly expanding law firm doing general admin work and floor support. There is opportunity for promotion and working my way up through the ranks there but without a degree I would worry there is a limit to how high in the company in could get without a degree. 

If I decide to go back to uni I would be doing an economics BSc at Sussex uni, id be aiming for a first and my goal would be to get internships at finance companies during the summer to get experience in the industry. I feel like this would give me a chance to get a higher paid job and generally lead to a higher job ceiling if I really worked hard. 

So really just sorta looking for advice on it all. Is it worth the extra 3 years? Is it worth the debt? Should I work or is uni gonna be a better choice for me?

249,"So I'm an 18 year old Indian guy. I've never had a girlfriend (too busy with academics and sports in high school) and I'm still a virgin (waiting for the right person). When I started university this year, I was introduced to the idea of casual sex, where you have sex with a stranger or just a friend. It's not something I would ever consider doing because I want to share that type of intimacy with a girlfriend/wife. Before any of you say ""You've never had sex, you can't say that!"", please don't try to convince me to have casual sex. I will do no such thing because it goes against who I am and my values (personal, not religious). Nothing wrong with casual sex, it's just not something I will ever do.

One night, I came out of my bedroom high (I've stopped smoking marijuana for good now). I went into the kitchen of our suite for a glass of water. My three roommates and two girls were sitting in the living room of the suite. When they saw me, they started pressuring me to have sex with one of the girls. I politely declined as I wasn't physically or emotionally attracted to the girl and had no interest in her. They all started saying things like ""A beautiful girl wants to have sex with you, you should just do it."", ""Don't be a pussy, just do it"" and ""Do it! It's now or never!"". I kept declining saying I was intoxicated on weed and couldn't consent (Canadian law). They blew it off and kept trying to sway me. The girl was trying to open my bedroom door and kept saying ""Let's do it"". Let me give some background on this girl. Throughout the year, she tried to kiss me, grind on me, and try to hookup with me (during parties), but I declined every single time (she would be very drunk).

Now back to the story. Eventually, they left me alone and I went back to my room. I felt kinda shitty. Like I wasn't good enough a virgin and that I wasn't cool enough to hang around. This all happened last night and I haven't really spoken to any of them since. What should I do? Do you think I did the right thing?

TL;DR - Got high one night, bunch of people pressured me to lose my v-card, I did not.",22Jun2018,1
250,I've known this guy since the 7th grade of middle school and we would hangout untill high school. Apparently we fell apart and stopped hanging out. Apparently what he tells me he had work and he had to cut people off. But the thing was I would always see him talking to friends and I would walk by him and try to talk to him and he would just say hi and kept on talking to his friends or sometimes he wouldn't notice me in the hall. We would also used to have lunch together and he would not not talk to me he would do the same thing like he would do just like in the hall. And he wouldn't message me like normal friends do on social media hasn't talked to me on it for about 2 years. Untill one day he decided to start hanging out with me again. So we are hanging out again and I decide to get my brother a job through him. So they work together and all and he would ask me to hangout alone all the time or with me and my brother. And now it's just him and my brother hanging out mostly he doesn't say hi to me when he walks in or asks to hangout anymore. And ive talked to my brother about it he's saying I'm being childish about it . Let you know my friend likes him so I really think he picked someone he likes and to hangout with rather then me his friend for about 7 years. So my brother says he thinks like a lady and just because he's gay that's not wrong and doesn't agree with me I've asked my dad for advice on it my mom and her friend had also seen that those two became closer and told me that my brother is stealing my friend  that he did before  and was telling me it isn't right because he knew me longer and didn't want my feelings to be hurt. And my girlfriend even agrees with me and she supports lbgt that him being gay isn't the issue. So let me know on your thoughts and opinions.

251,"Hey all, me here.

I have been a goddamn wreck for the past 4 months or so.

I didn't like college. Did a year of it, was frustrated with how classes felt like high school but were so expensive, I don't really identify with ""young people culture,"" and the two classes that actually challenged me were German and Computer Science. I was ok at the former and not great at the latter. Copying code from Stack Overflow and molding it to work in my code and all that. Seems like that's the norm, but I can't help but be reminded of how badly using online calculators fucked my friends over in online math classes.

I'm also deeply afraid of debt. Student loans are no joke, and I avoided them for one year. After this, it's go-time, but whenever I think about them, I can't help but be reminded of all the millennials (I think I'm gen Z?) who took on so much debt just to see wages stagnate while Uncle Sam's debt collectors didn't. I'm not good at computer science and couldn't cut it in healthcare, so I have no idea what to major in to minimize this as much as possible.

I also just plain don't like academia. It annoys me. Grades, papers, worksheets, assignments... I don't know if it's a greater disdain for bureaucracy or what.

So I thought about dropping out and joining the military. Air Force, probably, because I hear that it has the lowest chance for me to see combat and the first episode of Twilight Zone has a dude from the Air Force in it and I like that show. But I'm not really patriotic, not sure I really want to donate my life for the minimum 4 years or whatever, and I'm pretty sure if I'm not 100% in it, I shouldn't do it. I also would hate to regret not having a ""college experience,"" as college seems, to me, the last time in my life that being a kid is an acceptable thing. College kids talk a lot of shit about ""adulting,"" but my school at least is definitely enabling us to be a bunch of teenagers until we're 21. Also, I'm having a strangely hard time contacting my local recruiter. Kind of annoying actually.

I can do ROTC, but then I don't know what to major in again. And I don't know if I can wholeheartedly serve again.

Depending on the day, I'll flip-flop between the different options. Post-fap clarity doesn't help either, in case anyone thought to mention it.

254,"Okay so just some context. I'm a 3rd Year university student and I've been battling my anxiety (particularly exam anxiety) for 4 years. It started in my final year in high school. I had panic attacks before every exam but I didn't say anything to anyone. Luckily I passed and made it to university. My first year was a breeze and I managed to get through it without any panic attacks. Last year I had a really rough year at university. I failed 4/8 units and I had panic attacks in 4/8 of the exams that I wrote. My semester marks were great but I failed the exams causing me to fail the units. My parents were furious and told me I was a disappointment to my family and I was a failure. So going into this semester I was quite anxious and I was broken emotionally.   


This semester was a rollercoaster for me. I started the semester emotionally broken and still reeling from the worst panic attack I'd had so far (I had trouble breathing, I couldn't stand and I was an emotional breakdown). I decided to visit the campus psychologist and he helped me recenter myself and focus on passing the semester. I then managed to come out with a semester average of around 68&amp;#37; for all four of my units. This meant that all I had to do left to do was pass my exams. I started studying for my exams and I felt that the exams were great except for one of them. My results are going to be released on the 9th of July and as the days get closer my anxiety is picking up again and I'm starting to feel as if I failed all my exams. I try to brush the thought aside but it always returns and I find myself struggling to think of anything else but the thought of my university kicking me out because of my poor academics...   


I don't know what to do or how I can even prepare for my marks to release. I want nothing more than to graduate from this university and to make my parents proud but my anxiety is making me think otherwise. Do I prepare for the worst or do I just believe in myself.

258,"I hope you guys like the title it took me a solid 5 minutes to come up with

Anyways, I’m a rising junior and the school I currently attend is reputed as one of the best in the state but last year a tyrannical principal took over and is making sweeping changes without approval as well as intimidating teachers. Understandably, this has led to lots of backlash and several counselors and teachers along with 2 assistant principals leaving.

I was already questioning staying here, but on Tuesday she fired our top german teacher, who is one of the best in the nation, simply because she didn’t like him and due to the lack of a teacher union in our state, there’s not much that can be done about it. This affected me a fair amount as I am planning on continuing german and studying in Germany in college and I don’t see any teacher they bring in as being capable of matching his ability.

The county has however decided that they don’t want to fire our principal despite all the uproar and obvious dictatorship that has formed, likely due to some agenda as our county is VERY corrupt.

I do however have the opportunity to attend another school in a much better county as my mom works there. This however has several potential drawbacks of its own:
1) A 45 minute commute everyday which would be problematic with afterschool activities and tutoring I do outside of school
2) Lack of a german program, however I am in contact with my past teacher and he is on board with potentially continuing my learning
3) Leaving all my friends in exchange for ~3000 new people
4) Potentially not getting into all the classes I had been signed up for

I’m currently leaning towards staying, it’s just the situation at the current school is so fucked up that I really have no clue what the best move is. Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.

I try to do everything I can do help, between making her load light, being patient, suggesting random pleasant walks, etc. I just can't seem to help. She's confirmed to me recently that she has been feeling depressed. 

I've lightly attempted to suggest seeing a doctor since this has been nearly a year, though when I mention it, it's usually shut down pretty quickly.

I work a 11 day period with one day off after the 6th day. And it's the day our store is closed. Our hours technically reset on Sundays, so it worked out that this is my schedule 
(Work)Wednesday, (W)Thursday, (W)Friday, (W)Saturday, (W)Sunday, (W)Monday, then I'm off Tuesday when our store is closed, (W) Wednesday (W) Thursday (W) Friday (W) Saturday. 

I know people work more hours than me, I know this isn't a huge issue, but I feel taken advantage of. I also work on commission, I have to average out to $200 for every hour I work, and this basically screws me over for commission. There's no way I'm going to meet my hourly goal. I'm the newest to the store and I feel like everyone requested off the whole week of fourth of July, and now they're having me pick up the slack of everyone. 
Am I over reacting? Should I ask her about it? 



TLDR: my boss gave me hella hours, I took the job because it was part time and didn't have many hours, she knew this, I think I'm picking up everyone's slack, and I'm getting screwed out of commission. ",22Jun2018,3
261,"Hello first time posting here.

So I was a community college kid who finally got into a school (Indiana Tech) but I feel like I could have done better. I saw all my peers from high school (I went to a very good high school) getting into these amazing school and I didn't.  Do you think I could still get a good job even with not going to a prestigious school or should I try again for a better one? What would you do in this situation?

262,"So I bought some bottled beer.  I opened three of them throughout the week without issue.  I opened the fourth one night, cap popped off, landed on my counter and I raised the bottle to my mouth to take a swig.  I immediately noticed something was wrong and felt a jagged piece against my lip.  I realized the top of the bottle was broken and part of the top had actually come off in the top.  I tasted blood in my mouth and discovered that I had suffered a very minor cut that healed in a few days.  

My question is what do I do in this situation?  I've contacted the company and they have asked me to call a general 1-800 number.  I wrote them asking for a refund but want to make sure I am protecting myself.  Are they liable for anything?  I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.  I am not out for a payday (and realize nothing really bad happened) but I want to make sure I follow up properly with the company i.e. refund my money plus send me a gift certificate for a new six pack and a free tee shirt?

Looking forward to your advice.  Let me recap; I am not hurt, just annoyed, and I am not looking to sue them.  All I want is my money back and make sure I do it in the proper way as this has never happened to me in over 20 years of drinking.

264,"i’m new to reddit and this may seem lame but i recently had a falling out with a guy i was extremely close to. i’ll give a little backstory on my situation. 

so i knew this guy since middle school. we weren’t close then but we talked every once in a while. around freshman year we began to become closer friends. i helped him through a breakup he was going through and was there for him through it all. sophomore year, we were best friends. we talked constantly, we hung out as much as possible and everything was great. 

around the end of sophomore year (now) we decided to try for a relationship. i knew that there was this other girl who he was in love with but he told me he was over her and that he had always had feelings for me. we were together for a while, but he began to be distant. we ended up ending our relationship because of this, but we still talked. he told me that he was going back to the other girl and he wanted to focus on her. i was ok with that, but i knew we wouldn’t be as close as we used to be. recently he has blocked me on almost every social media site (other than facebook) and i have no way to contact him. i know he wants to focus on her, but we’ve been through so much and it hurts that he could just throw me away so easily without an explanation.

anyway, i just need advice on how to get over him and to move on. he was such a huge part of my life for years, and now he’s gone. anything will help and i totally appreciate any comments!",22Jun2018,1

267,"Hello! I'm a 23F college student, starting my final year of undergrad in the fall (FINALLY). I made some mistakes in the beginning of my college career that ended up costing me quite a lot in student loans. I ended up transferring to a school that was in-state, a lot cheaper, and living at home, but the damage was done. By the time I graduate, I will have about $120k in student loans, all with wildly varying interest rates. And I chose to be a music major, so it's not like I chose an especially lucrative field to get into. (Please no suggestions about switching majors, figuring out how to switch careers, etc. I have no desire to abandon music.)

One option I have is to go directly into grad school and pursue a masters in either vocal performance and/or vocal pedagogy. I want to ultimately get my DMA/PhD/doctorate, but I'm not concerned about that step just yet. Having a masters certainly will open up more opportunities for me and make it a lot easier to make money (charge more for services, get jobs at universities, more skilled to get into professional ensembles, etc). But to do that means that I will continue to accrue interest and further the amount of debt that I have. I am very concerned that my debt will reach a point (if it hasn't already) where I won't be able to afford the monthly payments. I'm not sure if waiting is the best career decision, though, as I'm already ""behind"" for what I perceive as industry standards. I could apply to programs and defer enrollment for a year, as well. Thoughts? TIA",22Jun2018,1
268,"They’ve been together on and off for about a year and a half. The relationship started off pretty well and then all of a sudden he became extremely controlling and possessive and emotionally abusive. I wasn’t her friend when they first started speaking otherwise I would’ve advised her not to be with him, as I know the guy and I know he’s bad news. Since we became friends, every time they broke up I begged her not to get back together with him and she never listened. 

Recently, she’s met someone else who treats her well and is a very nice guy. I approve. Instead of cheating, she did the decent thing and broke up with her boyfriend first, with the intention of waiting a while before dating the new guy and not mentioning him in the breakup at all. It’s not like she needed to, though, because he treats her terribly and that’s reason enough. 

He’s extremely pissed off and is threatening to leak her nudes. We’re both teenagers with strict parents, and hers would kill her if this got out, and we don’t live in the states so the laws aren’t necessarily on our side here. We’re desperate for help.

271,"Before I begin this, i want to clarify that I am fully aware that being a white blonde girl makes me extremely privileged, I know I am not of a minority group. That being said, my problems might seem minimal but at the moment they are weighing on me.

By my username, you can probably assume that I am in fact blonde. I have realized growing up that there are a lot of stereotypes for women in general, but especially for blonde women in particular. I have had dumb blonde jokes thrown my way since I was 7 year old.

The idea that my hair color has something to do with my intelligence or ability to function normally in society has always bothered me, but I have always beeb reassured by the fact that my beautiful mother, who also has blonde hair, has moved up in her career and become extremely successful. Her peers view her as professional and very well-educated, which was promising.

I have always been an outspoken person, I am now in college, and I have found that I receive a lot more backlash for my commentary or opinions than some of my other friends do. Especially from men. 

I am not aggressive, or rude, but I am very honest and that seems to be a problem. I am involved in an organization that is co-ed, and at every step of the way I have found that guys and girls alike have been all too comfortable jumping down my throat as soon as I open it.

I believe that it’s because I tend to start out quieter in social situations, but once I’m comfortable I will open up. I know that there is a stereotype of blonde girls being quiet and backing down easily in an argument, or girls in general. But when I know what I’m talking about I will fully stand my ground in a debate.

As far as I can tell, my less than soft personality seems to be very likely to label me as a white entitled bitch in my professional future. Is this something I’ll just have to accept if I want to be honest? Or should I decidedly become quiet and agreeable and keep my opinions to myself?

TL;DR: continue on the path of being perceived as a bitch for being honest, or censor myself to save face?

272,"I've known my best Friend, let's call her Becky, since High School - so about 10 years now. We've always been pretty close, we've traveled to Asia, Europe, done the whole shabang together. We were almost like sisters at some points. After we both graduated college, I went off to another state and got involved with a guy, lets call him John. I still stayed in contact with Becky, she came to visit, it was all great. She liked John, he thought she was cool, we were all chill. After about three years out of state, John and I wanted to move back to our home state to be closer with family. We reached out to Becky and asked her if she wanted to be roommates. John wanted to go back to school, money was tight and we needed a third person to help with rent. She was down and we all moved into a two bedroom apartment. Everything was cool, we all got a long, and partied together - couldn't be happier. Of course, we had small hiccups, but nothing we didn't have a civil house meeting about. 

After a year at this one apartment, we moved to a much bigger, 4 bedroom house. Then everything started to go down hill. Becky became unhappy with her job, commute and then started to get jealous and depressed. After a lot of hard work, I got into the entertainment industry (think movies) in a great position - something Becky wanted forever, John transferred into a top school and things were on the up and up for both of us. Becky wasn't happy with how things were going with us and began to lash out. It started small, with off-hand comments, and micro-aggression and then it grew into full blown (and I hate saying this) hard-line SJW rhetoric. She'd say right in front of of John that ""all men should die"" or ""kill all white people"" (even though Becky is white). We took it as a joke at first, since she had gotten new hard-line anti-men lesbian friends, but then it became something she'd say daily. 

Becky began to manipulate and pit John and I against one another (I wish I was making this up, she admitted to it in one of the arguments I had with her - I had no idea) in her goal to make John move out so just her and I could live there. She began to make snarky comments to put both me and John down, she'd threaten to move out and self harm. I chalked it up to her depression and hard time that she was going through. I would always try to talk her down or talk her through her issues. She always would promise she'd get therapy and get back on medication. I offered to try and get her into the company I was working at, four times. Each time she made it to the final round of interviews, and didn't get it. She blamed me. She told me that she felt inferior to me since I had a great title at a good company and she was working as a contractor. 

The sh\*t hit the wall about 3 months ago, when she found out her cat (or in her words ""the only thing she has left living for"") was diagnosed with cancer. Since then she's been threading drastic things, like moving to china, OD'ing on drugs, moving out. I have since ceased helping her look for jobs and talking about her mental health with her. She'll just come home, make some off hand aggressive comment, go to her room and close the door. After a previous blow out with John, she doesn't even acknowledge his presence. 

A this point, all her antics are severely impacting my mental health as well as John's. Funny thing is, she only acts out when John and I are around. If anyone else is there, she acts like she's happy, and nothing's wrong - her old normal self. I've talked to my therapist and she advised to to Becky out ASAP - as she's become toxic for everyone. But I feel so guilty since she's been my friend for so long and is in such a dark place in her life. I know friendships end, but I am unsure of how to proceed with this. 

TL;DR: My roommate/oldest friend's life is spiraling out and she's taking everyone out else with her. What do I do? Do I kick her out? Where does my mental health start and her's begin? ",22Jun2018,2
273,"So I live with my best friend and we live in a row of apartments in Arizona (maybe this affects things, not sure how legal things work) and this guy has a thing for my friend who over the last few months has proven to not understand hints that she’s not interested and she didn’t feel comfortable telling him because of how guys can sometimes act. Things he did: see’s her standing outside smoking a cigarette, comes over and asks for one almost constantly. Knocks on door to ask for cigarettes. Knocked on her car door when she was inside her car cleaning it, don’t remember what he wanted, maybe to chat, maybe for a cigarette, I’m not 100% what. Asks her out to hang out/grab drinks/things that appear date like but not 100% asking hey want to do on a date. Also yesterday they were on the same bus and he was with friends and told them she was his girl. That was her final straw. I told her I would politely ask him to cut it off next time I see him. I saw him today and said “hey you’re coming across a little strong with my friend, she’s not interested.” He then flipped out and gets extremely defensive and starts trying to gaslight me I don’t fully remember verbatim what he said because I started dissociating slightly because of my own gaslighting from my dad, so I can see it a mile away. He accused me of being delusional because he just walked her to our door the one time and essentially accused us of being lesbians because he was a psychologist. I told him if he was a psychologist he would know what gaslighting was and I walked away. After speaking to a friend about it she said to tell him to back off or you’ll call the cops. Which I guess would mean a restraining order but if we live in the same apartment strip what would that mean? And are they even really enforced? Is it worth it? Because now I don’t feel safe knowing there’s a delusional guy in our complex and neither does my friend. ",22Jun2018,1
274,"I graduated college years ago and haven't done much since. I have a couple hobbies, they help to pass the time, but sometimes it's hard to make myself get up and start/go/clean up the mess from last time/prepare for this time.  

Financially things are fine, we don't have much extra and live modestly but we're saving for retirement. We fly across the country a couple times a year to go here or there. We don't want kids and we manage to find the disposible income for our hobbies. Sometimes I make a little money here and there doing this and that.  

I just really... don't WANT anything. I mean there are some things that seem ""nice"" in an abstract sort of way but things rarely feel like they're worth the work/effort/cost. I've had jobs before and over the years I've taken one now and again just out of boredom or to save up for some special thing, but they don't hold my interest.  

I feel like the immediate and obvious thoughts are 1. you're probably depressed and 2. go to therapy. I am depressed and I have gone to therapy, twice. I found it to be kind of helpful the first time but both times I had the same problem; even in therapy your therapist expects you to have a goal. Expects you to have something you're trying to accomplish. I always felt like they had this attitude of ""what do you want to do boss?"" and it's like... that's the thing.

My first semester of college, I was diagnosed with Crohn's.  Cue beginning of problems completing schoolwork.

Throughout the years, my motivation has waned.  I've failed an entire semester and even had to appeal to continue at my university.

This summer, I was motivated after two somewhat successful semesters to enroll in a summer course.

My university doesn't offer the first half of this two part course, since the local community college does and they can't ""compete.""

My options were: enroll in the community college and sign consortium agreement or take the first half online...So I chose option 2.

Well I failed...Miserably.  Turns out, I cannot work, have Crohn's, go to school, and have a social life.

I also was promoted last year which...Yay...I make slightly more than I used to for a lot more work!

I keep feeling like a major failure, especially when I see others who already have their degree or who get good grades while working full time.

I know now I cannot take any more online classes, nor can I do summer courses, which likely means I won't graduate until like 2022 or some craziness.

Ultimately, what should I do?  Take the turtle route, drop the college thing for a bit to think, go part time at work, etc.?

Towards the middle of freshman year, we started talking again and even though we technically weren’t “dating,” we liked each other and were exclusive to one another. She ended up cheating on me with her ex, so we broke up. I was heartbroken because up to that point, she had never done anything to put our relationship in danger.

Idk if i should try to just get over her and move on or chase the feeling that we could make it work, as we’re still friends.

Long story short, I got caught smoking weed by my strict, overbearing Asian mother. Yeah, yikes. I'm basically under lock down until I can earn her trust, and even then she won't let me go out with friends or do anything besides work. She even told me that I can't go to university for my second year AND I also had my keys taken away.

Now, I'm turning 19 in September, and I'm just sick and tired of having no control over my life. After having a short life crisis and crying myself to sleep, I had a lot to think about and found it to be a good time to reevaluate my life. I realized, after having everything taken away, the thing that hurts the most is the lack of freedom and nonexistent social life.

Frankly, university or school itself was never for me, and it would've taken me years to get a degree at the pace I was going. I don't even think I liked the path I was heading towards either. So, I wanted to focus on finding another job and moving out.

291,I have Tinder Gold because I hate the waiting game of swiping right on someone and just waiting to see who swiped back.

293,"My self-esteem has cratered badly after being single almost all of my adult life (I dated a wonderful girl briefly in 2017 before she ended it. This was my only real relationship.)

I’m generally successful/unremarkable in all other areas of life. I have friends, a college degree, a decent work resume. I’m in better-than-average physical shape, I’m a military veteran, and I have interesting hobbies. But I cannot find a girlfriend, and I’ve begun to believe I am undateable. 


I’m not fishing for dating advice. What I’m concerned about is how low my self-esteem has become as a result of this prolonged state of involuntary solitude. It’s emasculating, and I’ve become to believe that somehow “deserve” this unhappiness. It’s gotten so bad that I’m seriously concerned that- if I ever were to meet a woman who is interested in me- I might rebuff her for *her own* sake. As in “trust me: I’m garbage. I want to spare you the trouble.”

295,"I have this total first world problem and I don't even know why, I have plenty of other things to worry about...

Today I had my first oral examination in university ever (masters degree). I'm usually a A or B student. I was grouped with two other, very good students. Each one of us had to prepare a topic, on which we would be questioned on. When it was my turn, after a few questions regarding my topic, the teacher started to ask very specific questions that weren't really related to my topic (only by a far strech and far out of the scope of this course). Some of those answers I totally couldn't answer. 

End of the story I got a C+ while my other group members got an A and B+ (totally deserved). 

Sure the grade bugs me big time. But the way the teacher delivered his feedback was worse. He told me he originally wanted to give me a C and only gave me C+ because he was being nice. But I shouldn't not expect that in the future from him. And the look he gave me when I couldn't answer some questions. Tbh I am crushed. 

Sure I had bad grades before, but they were totally deserved (not studied enough...), but this time I was totally floored by his questions. Even my group members later told me that they thought his questions were unfair and they felt really sorry for me. I feel so humiliated in front of my class. It's quiet possible that I got the worst grade in this course.

I know it sounds so stupid but I feel like I can't show my face in university again. And that I can't face the other students anymore. I have issues with depression and this only adds to that. 

My group members adviced me to never take a class with this teacher again because he is known to base his grades on how much he likes the student. I have plenty of other courses to choose from, but I still feel it limits my independence. On the other hand I can't imagen myself to ever want to see him again. I truly dread the moment I see him in an elevator. 

So I guess my question is, do you have any advice on how to recover from a bad grade that took you totally by surprise. And how to deal with the 'humiliation'? Should I avoid his classes in the future or 'stand my ground'?

Thanks in advance :)",22Jun2018,2

298,"So trying to move with my fiancee.

We found a house we both instantly liked.  I guess it wasn't the best part of the city but wasn't too bad.  Granted the whole city is pretty rough. Anyways we both found the house and liked it. Kept hearing how houses were selling fast and the neighborhood looked fine, older people, people with kids. Didnt seem bad.

I waited a day and during work decided I'd be upset if I didn't get the house so I decided to put down an offer.

Anyways they took our offer but we've ran into some bumps. Like potiental lead paint. We've asked about it but guess the answer to that was it's been painted over a lot so should be fine? Idk, to be honest my fiance was covering that. I work 3rd shift so she took care of it. Just that seems like the answer to the nonsense. We waited a week for that answer too since seller moved and guess wasn't answering.

Well now my mother tells me multiple friends and coworkers she knows stated the neighborhood is in fact fine. But across the street is really bad. Some Mexican restaurant where gangs hang out. A lot of reports of break ins and what not. Again my side is fine...but to be honest. Too close to comfort for me.

The whole lead thing has me already doubting the house. But now the whole bad side across from us has me wanting out. Issue is idk if we really can...? I mean we can back out but fear ill have to give up the good faith money. The house inspection came out fine. Moisture built up in areas of the basement but that was really it

I just dont know if theres anything I can really so and we have no faith in the realtor. Found the hose on a website and fiance used their sites feature to state we were interested.

I've always had a rather rocky history with them.. from second grade to sixth I've been suffering from bullying, which they partook in, due to fear of backlash from the popular kids, which ruined my self esteem and confidence. However, we patched things up, and moved along. Recently, a new guy joined the group.. kinda popular, however, really likes to pick on me. He's tough and very charismatic, so the group loves him. He pits my friends against me, when I make joke it's wrong but when he makes some abhorent jokes it's ok, all that great stuff...
I tried to get along with him, I really did, but he just *hates* me. Don't know what to do. I'm having this weird Deja Vu, like stuff from elementary school are happening all over again.

303,"There's this guy (we'll call him John) i go to college with, i've known him from about September 2016,  and we belonged to the same club. At first i felt kinda sorry for John because i had him in a class before i actually talked to him, and he seemed shy and really lonely, so when i met him at our school club i talked to him about the class we had. 6 months into knowing him there weren't any problems, we'd talk about sports sometimes, but that was it on my end. 

He'd hang out on campus all the time and when i had time between classes i'd run into him and talk to pass the time. Then from about January 2017 onwards he started to be a real douche, i know John thinks we're friends but it wasn't ok. If i made a mistake he'd go on about it to everyone and made me into a joke in our club, people started to talk to me less, and he isn't really well liked, so being associated with him really killed my social connections in our club. Then i transferred to Uni the same year, didn't see him for about 6 months, and during my winter break i went to see how our club was doing and see some of the people i knew . At first i was told he didn't go to the meetings anymore, then lo and behold when i went he so happened to go too, and he acted like i never left, not even asking me how things were going just went back to being a dick. I ignored him, i guess he kinda figured and tried being nice

I'm taking a summer class at the same college, i ran into John last week, i guess we had parked near each other and he tried making conversation but i told him to F off, he kinda laughed it off and tried making conversation again. I'm going back to our club later, they hold summer meetings and i'm still kinda invested. He might go and if he talks to me i want to tell him we're not friends, you're a dick, stop talking trash about me and leave me alone, but saying all that in front of people i don't wanna make a scene. i'm also afraid he'll laugh it off",22Jun2018,1

307,"Hi,

I've just got my first graduate job so have moved out of my parents house. My temp rental period on a house share I've been living in is up on the 30th, so I've been looking for a place to live. I wanna live alone, and there aren't too many options feasible for where I live. I've found a few places to look at, but the first and only one I've seen is one of the more expensive ones. It's pretty much exactly what I'm looking for in every way, except one... The new job I've started is with a huge company and thousands of people work in the same large area. Anyway, the guy was showing me around the place and as we were leaving I tell him where I'm working and he says ""oh, I work at \[same company\] too!"" To make things a little more awkward, it turns out he's friends with a high-up person in the recruitment agency that got me this job and who I've talked to a lot in the week I've been at this job. The reason this is potentially awkward is I smoke weed - not much, like, 2 small joints between the time I get home from work and the time I go to sleep. I've got a tiny little personal cubicle of garden with a tiny fence and part of me worries that my neighbours might complain to the landlord who works at the same company, who might tell my recruiter, and word might get out about me smoking weed and put me in a bad light when I've only recently started my graduate career. However, I don't know if I'm overthinking it... I've got another viewing lined up in the next few days but it's for a comparatively less nice place in not such a nice area. I really like this place I just saw, but don't know what to think...

308,"Hello, my name is Ethan and I live in the US. I've scoured reddit for a long time now though this is my first time making an account posting. I need advice on how to deal with my situation.

I currently live with my dad and older brother. My dad works in a printing press or some sort and my older brother is currently finishing up college. I myself is in high school. I very rarely meet my mother. My parents divorced when I was I was around 4 when my dad realized that he was gay. My older brother has also came out as gay during his teens. Needless to say, my dad and my older brother is very supportive of each other.

Before I go on, I just want to say that I am in full support of the LGBTQ+ community. Many of my friends consists of LGBTQ+ people as well. I've attended many of the pride ceremonies and festivals together with my dad and brother and since the legalization of same-sex marriage back in 2015 and I am extremely happy for everyone in that community. Since then, my father has begun dating another guy from work, and my brother is also dating someone, though I remember him meeting his (ex?) boyfriend(s?) ever since middle school.

Here's the thing though, I'm not gay. As you can see, living with my dad and brother, there is a very gay atmosphere (?, not sure if it's the right word) around the house. Ever since I was in primary school. Not to mention that the neighborhood I live is very populated with people from the LGBTQ+ community as well. Since I was in middle school, both my dad and my brother has always wooed me into being in a relationship, as all teenagers and their parents always do in that age. The thing is, they always press me into dating another guy, my friends, and stuff. While I do enjoy the company of another boy my age, it's never in a romantic way. There was a time where my brother's friend/boyfriend had a younger brother that was wooed into dating with me by them. He was also not gay and I could remember how uncomfortable it was to both of us being pushed by them into romance. This happened more than once, both by my brother and my dad.

A few months ago, I had a 'man-talk' together with my dad and brother, and while discussing the topic of relationships. I said ""What if I'm into girls?"". Their faces suddenly changed and my dad sort of dismisses me in a manner of somewhat discontent. I remember his face not being so pleased, with a hint of anger(?) in his voice. He then goes on bla-bla-bla about his relationships with other men and what I should seek. My brother was also somewhat displeased when the talk was over, still wooing me into dating other guys while dismissing the fact that I might be straight, which I am, though he was more calm about it, somewhat joking. There was a time in middle school where I was close to a girl that I really liked, but my dad wasn't so pleased about it back then as well, saying something along the lines of ""Just leave the girl"" and ""be like your pops""

I brought up the ""I'm into girls."" thing a few times again in the past few and every time I do so, my dad always had the same reaction as before, displeased, and a bit of anger. But it was not until a few days ago during the car ride where I brought it up again and he got super angry, almost raising his hand at me (not really, but I could see his hand almost about to) and told me if I bring it up again, I would get in trouble.

So the question is how do I deal with this situation? How do I deal with that I'm straight in a very gay family? I'm not sure how to convince them...",22Jun2018,1

I do nothing but go back and forth to work and only see my life coach for social time once a week. I try reaching out to people but no one seems to want to talk or socialize with me. I go into an extremely bad depression quite often from loneliness. I feel like a ghost to everybody. My family, because of my diagnosis rarely gives me any freedom and I feel interrogated for leaving the house, even if I text someone they start asking endless questions. They never trust anyone I do talk to except the people who are children of their friends. I just feel I have no independence and I’m being controlled. I just don’t feel I have anything benefitting me here other then my life coach and the seniors I take care of. Also the health care for mental health is very poor here and I’ve been neglected quite a bit in my treatment, as has many others where I live. 

I do have a friend that lives a few provinces away though. They talk to me regularly and care a lot about me. They see how I’ve been struggling recently with my illness, finances, and everything. So they offered me to go up there and live with them in a year or so. They would help me get everything planned out and I would have somewhere to live.

I followed a lot of the guidelines set out in canada when caring for my baby, such as breastfeeding, feeding on demand, babies sleep on their backs, etc. His belief system for babies goes against everything the doctors here in canada say, and he says the doctors here are stupid and incompetent. I am currently pregnant with his third child and I have tried to show him the evidence, studies, and reasons why they breastfeed on demand, sleep on their back etc. And he doesn't care to read, research, or even acknowledge that he is wrong.

Now today he made a comment to me about how he is older, and has more miles on the vehicle, and only out of respect agrees with what I am saying 89% of the time, even though I'm wrong. So basically I asked him wtf that meant, and he said that in his country people respected people who were older, like respect your elders kind of saying. This comment was made amidst an argument we were having about sexual compatibility. It makes sense now to me why he doesn't give a shit to hear my point of view or opinion, he thinks I am young and stupid, I also know that he has very misogynistic views about women. 

I could give a million examples of this as well in other aspects. What should I even do about this?

325,"I have a very difficult decision to make, but some backstory is required.

I got accepted into medical school out of high school, and just coasted through undergrad doing the bare minimum to maintain my scholarship. Once I started medical school last fall I had to take a leave of absence due to my depression becoming overwhelming. I have just started to get a grasp on it, and develop the tools to deal with things. I also just started working to pay debts I accumulated due to my depression. 


Because I have only now gotten back to a functional level I requested an extension on my leave of absence for one more year. They denied this request, but gave me an amazing offer where I will be taking the first year spread out over two instead so as to not be overwhelming me. 

However, I really feel I need to have time to get my feet solidly under me. I am worried I'm not going to be able to succeed if I go back now, but the other option is to withdraw, and then I would have to reapply. Which would mean taking the MCAT, and probably some grad program to improve my GPA since I just kept the minimum requirements for my scholarship... If I go back now and I am not well enough to succeed then I would have garnered a massive amount more debt, and a mark against me for any future attempts at medical school. I won't get a third chance from the school.

As it is I have steady work with good pay using my undergrad degree. I finally am financially independent and that is such a huge stress reliever. I can actually do things I want, and buy things that interest me. I am living with my family, which is okay overall, and it means I have next to no expenses. I would rather I had my own place, but overall finally getting to the point where I'm not getting constant overdue on bills is such a great feeling. Paying off my debts. I really feel like having a year with a normal schedule and stability would be massively beneficial for me. 

I don't know if I'm ready to go back to medical school. I don't want to ruin my chance to fulfill my dreams of becoming a doctor either though... If I go back I might not be able to succeed. I fear I will struggle every step of the way. Even with the easier schedule. If I don't go back I might not even get the chance to try. 

On top of that two of my brothers, who are at home with me, will be going back to/leaving for school in the fall. I will basically be isolated with my youngest brother (who's schedule is opposite of mine) and my parents. I love my family dearly, but my parents and I frequently butt heads. This means if I do keep working, which I think is what I need to do, I will largely be alone. That is not ideal.

I really am at a loss. I'm struggling to make any decision. I spent my entire break at work typing this cause I am so distracted by it. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose the stability I currently have, and risk having a repeat of the last year. I may not survive that TBH. I also don't want to risk not being able to go to medical school at all. Plus the offer they have provided is certainly generous. I am hoping some voices from you guys might help.


Tl:dr-Go back to medical school with modified schedule even though mental health issues might resurface and destroy everything; or stay home and stable to improve mental health and enjoy myself for once, but risk ruining my dream of becoming a doctor.",22Jun2018,1
326,"This is a really specific and low stakes situation but I just can't make a decision. 

I have been going to college on the east coast for a year. The school is alright, I have met some cool people and I have a good job in the area. However it is a pretty small school and I recall often feeling isolated from the ""real world"" I also don't feel super understood by my peers at this school, and often feel lonely. I may have a last minute opportunity to go to a similar institution but it is slightly larger and is on the west coast where I grew up. Two of my close friends who I really love will be going there next year. They both make me laugh and goof around in a way that I haven't found with anyone at my school on the East. I also have a concern because one of those friends and I have been on and off romantically involved for a long time. We are very close and stay in pretty regular contact but I feel sometimes like I treat them unfairly and in order for them to move on I may need to leave the picture. However they have never said this to me, but I don't want to be getting in the way of them to be able to fully explore their own love life in college. But as much as I hate to say this I am emotionally attached to them and would have a very hard time losing them regardless of my decision.  I also don't want to abandon the life I have already started building here and have to start all over. At the same time I don't feel like I fully fit in here? But I do remember feeling a similar way to this when I first began high school. I do feel like I will find my people better at the other school, but am scared I am falling for a case of the grass is always greener and will be throwing away the opportunity and community I have on the east. To those who take the time to read this I appreciate your input and time regarding my VERY petty problem haha. ",22Jun2018,1

328,"I am a young woman fresh out of college who caught a lucky break with a career in my field of study right away. I work at a small business, so I am able to gain a little experience in a lot of areas quickly. My company makes most of their money overseas in a country that is not desirable for Americans, and especially women (at least according to mainstream American media). Most Americans would probably consider it a terrorist country. After a few months of employment, my managers are now discussing the idea of sending me there for a month to test the waters. It would be a great opportunity for me to get some experience in my field, make great money, and add international experience to my resume. My student loans are hefty, and this would help me pay them off much sooner than expected. I can leave before my rotation is over if I want, and i can choose to never go back with no consequences or judgment from my managers. Everyone I work with that has gone before said that it is safe, I wouldn’t be the only woman, and it isn’t as bad as the media would have us believe. The company takes care of us, and we stick together while working overseas. Some of my coworkers actually really enjoy working there. The problem is that my whole family is appalled that I would even consider going. My parents cry every time I mention it and get upset to the point that they vomit. I haven’t been officially invited yet, but I think it’s coming soon. They honestly believe that if I go, I will not be coming back alive. They do not believe anything good I have to say about it, and I fear that they might have a heart attack or something if/when I go. I realize the dangers of the country I’d be going to, but I trust my company to take care of me. Am I being selfish/naive or are they overreacting?

329,"So throughout the whole school year, I've been trying to avoid to catch feelings for this girl... But finally, my treacherous heart has caught feelings for her. She has shown slight interest too, such as being really close to me unneededly, texting and initiating conversations on the most random topics e.t.c.

Problem I have a male friend, who liked her before and has been friendzoned by her twice. But she is now also showing slight interest in him, while they both deny any feelings for each other. The final point that has lead me to believe they unknowingly like each other is that she willingly pecked him today while we were playing truth of dare... twice because the first only I saw it. 

So should I try to set them up, or try to go for her myself? ",22Jun2018,1
331,"Soooo, this girl means a hell of a lot to me. She helped me to get out of the deep slope i was in at the beginning of my time in college. She may not have meant for that, but through my attraction towards her i gained the confidence to do more and more. And soon enough i overcame a lot of my self-confidence issues in an attempt to present myself better around her.

Long story short, she's pretty alone at school as all her friends left to go to a different college, she was friends with some exchange students from germany but they left. Now all she has is me, during the time the students were there, we went out with a couple of them to town and that was pretty fun. I bought her a box of chocolates and a card for valentines day. it'd been 3 months of knowing and talking to her on a daily basis and i was pretty set on this girl. This other guy, the exchange student also liked her supposedly, he asked her out but she said no. Yet she'll still text him even now that he's moved back to germany. She tells me how alone she feels, but i don't know what i can do to help her, i dont mean much to her, she's pretty much established that and i sometimes feel like she's only around me just so she's not alone. It kinda sucks. 

Anyhow, i received an anonymous valentines card too, with dotted writing and a question mark. I found this completely odd cause this girl was the only person i talked to and i had just hoped in my mind it really was from her, this could be the sign that she feels the same way! 

2 months after, i couldn't hide how i felt from her anymore, it was kinda eating me up inside, i would always compliment on how well she looked and stay behind school with her everyday as she would worry about exams coming up and things. 

Prior to this, i walked her to the bus stop every evening, and she would always say to text her once i got home. Anyway, this one fateful night i made the conscious decision to phone her, upon her giving me her number one night, with the intention of admitting to her how i felt. Doing so, it turns out, she didn't feel the same way and would go on to say how this is 'normal' and how she just wants to focus on her studies. And i completely understood, from that day onwards though, since the exchange students left, she seriously doesn't really have a proper friend to hang out with and talk to in school. And im just this sad awkward middle man, tryna help, but also wanting to kind move on too yaknow. But i can't just move on now, cause she'll be alone again. She hangs out with me and my friends in this separate room during break and lunch but she'll be on her phone on Instagram or texting that guy still, even though she has said she has no romantic feelings towards him. I just feel like its kinda a big mess right now, and idk what she wants now or why she's still choosing to be around me and my friends. She'll actively avoid me if she just sees me somewhere and that doesn't really make me feel too good. She'll cut conversations short when im tryna talk to her to help her feel a lil less out of place and she chooses not to open up to me or ever really tell me what's going on somedays. She'll say she's been busy or she's feeling really sad and when i ask follow up questions, she just kind of dismisses them. 

Anyway, in a week or so i was thinking of just buying these flowers, and a card, going into the lesson and handing them to her infront of everyone so i straight up let her know i continue to feel this way, but i also want her to feel more welcomed and loved i guess, just by everyone yaknow. 

sorry to ramble on so much, but i've never been in this kinda situation before and every time i encounter her, the way she behaves always leaves me so confused as to how she feels or whether she wants me to talk to her or walk her to class or sit by her or whatever. ahh, but yeahhh, any advice would be greatly appreciated, many thanks!

tldr: boy likes girl, girl more concerned about school, wont open up yet continues to say how school is making her upset or how she feels so alone. Boy makes any effort to make girl feel a lil less alone, and girl responds by dismissing conversations, staring at phone, putting in earphones, any kinda anti-social behaviour. Girl has told boy she doesn't feel the same way and boy wants to move on but girl asks to sit next to boy during classes and break/lunch. Boy is left heartbroken and confused most days, probably cause he's just really dumb

336,"I just graduated college in May and I was offered a full-time position at my internship in the city where I currently live and attended school. I don't love the job, but it is in my field and I could benefit from staying there and gaining more experience. I was given until July to make a decision about whether I want to accept this full-time position or find a new job. I have been applying to jobs out of state (in areas like LA and Denver where I've always had an interest in living) before I even graduated. I feel part of the reason I'm not getting many responses to the applications is because I don't currently live in the cities I'm applying to, but I'm afraid to take a risk and move without a job. I have a sure thing here and would be giving it up in the hopes of finding work quickly after I move. I've had places say to get in touch once I've settled in the city I applied to. Due to the fact that I just graduated and have hardly any money saved up, I'm not sure if it's the smart choice. Soon I'll be paying student loans and I had to take out a lot to afford college. 

But I really don't want to stay in the area I've lived in my whole life anymore. I feel like if I stay even one more year, I'll never leave. I get too comfortable in doing what's easy and I feel like I need to take a risk. I wouldn't be moving on my own- my boyfriend will be moving too. He is also in the process of looking for new jobs, but he has more saved up then I do and an easier field to find work in. So he originally said we would move where ever I got a job, but that's proving to be impossible with a zip code on the other side of the country.

337,"Hello,

So, I am currently living with my boyfriend during my summer break (college student) and his son happens to be living with us during what is essentially the same time frame. The past few days, I have been watching his son, who is almost 3, and the past few days, the son, while relatively well-behaved, has told me things like ""I don't like you"", and ""I already have a mom"". Obviously he is three, so he's not necessarily totally autonomous lol, but today in particular, it became clear that he doesn't really respect me, nor like me, and is only cute and cuddly when he wants things. Due to this obvious rift, I don't really want to play with him or interact with him all that much while his father is home. In contrast, the father calls him ""our son"" and says that I'm being a bad partner and ""mom"" because of the disconnect me and the boy seem to share. In addition, he thinks I'm being immature because I'm ""blaming"" the 3-year-old, even though there is just clearly a disconnect on both sides and if it weren't for the kid being the child of my partner, I wouldn't really care. I've tried to make the relationship deeper, but the child, again, clearly doesn't like me, and it's understandable due to the situation; however, the father really wants me to be part of raising this child while he's here, even though he already has a mother and that kind of relationship doesn't seem possible. Tonight, because I was being pretty distant to the child and have openly expressed my feelings to my partner, he has said that I am immature, when I really don't think I am, just realistic.

So, I was wondering what you guys thought:

Am I being immature in being apathetic to the child while his father is home? Or in thinking that I am not his mother, so I realistically will not be part of his development? Am I a bad partner for not trying to care more? Again, I have tried to ""mom"" him and care for him more than a babysitter would, but his repeated ""I don't like you's"" and nasty behavior makes me not want to bother. In addition, how do you think me and my partner should handle this?",22Jun2018,1

Both of my parents have poor relationships with their own parents, with my Mum's parents earning bonus points in that they stayed together despite my Grandad being abusive with Grandma earlier in their relationship.

The plan thus far has been clench our buttholes and hope the reaction is quick. None of us have any ideas outside of just sitting down with them and telling them.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.

342,"Hey guys,

First year, first generation student here. I started my first year of CC, and fell in love with it. On September 30th (mid 1st semester) I was in a semi severe car accident that left a small financial burden on me. Luckily insurance covered a fair amount, and I even called my mom to take me to the hospital because ambulances were expensive. Well I lost my job because of the incident, so medical costs were handled by my savings. The injury kept me out of class for 3 weeks, and with no internet/computer I had no options of viewing online lecture slides. I dropped 2 of my 4 classes because I knew I fell too far behind. I have a documented email to one of my professors detailing the injury, and my struggle to make up for lost work. 

Second semester rolled around and I had no money, and no job. I enrolled for classes because I was too prideful to take a semester off to find work and save up, and it killed me. I couldn't pay for books and again, I dropped classes stupidly, not knowing I was on probation. 

That leads us to now. I plan on appealing it. I am motivated and love school. There is one problem though. Obtaining my medical records will take up to 30 days. My registration date is the 26th, and would love to get the classes that offer me the most success. So I come to you reddit. Do appeals ever even work? I have billing info of only my physical therapy, an email detailing the injury, photos from the scene, and my notes and essays (showing I am an engaged student). Should I go now, and inform them of that any awaiting medical information can be provided, or do I wait until I get it? I want nothing more to succeed in my college career and it breaks my heart knowing I may have to take a semester off to work, when that's practically what I did this semester.

My college has a 200 word limit on appeals.

""Following a car accident on September 30th, I was physically, financially, and mentally burdened. While insurance lowered costs, I was responsible for medication, physical therapy/emergency visit(s), co-pays, and immediately unable to work temporarily. I was embarrassingly unable to buy books for my second semester classes, aside from English 120. I could have taken a semester off because of my financial situation, however I was too prideful and embarrassed to realize that. Education is important to me, and I will prove it through my actions. I have dropped any hobbies that may distract me from school. I have paid off the medical debt, and have been holding a steady part time job with school friendly flexibility, to prepare for any further financial burdens. I pride myself on being a first generation college student, and plan on graduating. I plan on attending office hours for each of my classes once per week, and taking advantage of COLLEGE’s excellent resources(tutoring, study rooms). I will continue being an active and engaging student. I want to prove I can succeed to you and myself. I beg you allow me to continue on academic probation in the Fall 2018 semester.""

343,"I apologize for my English, I'm not a native English speaker.

I am a group leader in a small company: I have three small teams under my supervision, two of them have managers whom I manage and the third team is very new and consists of only one person who I manage directly. I'm pretty young for the job, I started working for this company when it was tiny and advanced in positions as the company grew. I have an excellent manager who helped me a lot and trusts me, and I proved my value by working my ass off during the last few years. I love this job, and one of the best things about it is that most of the people are extremly nice and smart.

A situation came up a few days ago and I've been obsessing over it: my colleague, a team leader of a team that is similar but more thechnological than my one-person team, let me know that his team had a meeting during which the team members suddently burst with frustration and anger towards me and my single employee. They said we don't do anything, and that I keep getting promoted with no good reason, and complained about some of the tasks that they received and said that we should do them. My colleague, who is also a good friend one mine, was shocked at their outburst and told them that he disagrees with them. He told me about it because he's going on vacation this upcoming week and he wanted me to be more visible about the tasks done by my team, so that the situation with his team won't get any worse.

To be clear - I'm not concerned about my position. I have a lot of trust in my manager and the other team leaders. We know each other well, and they know how hard I work and my contribution. I am also aware that I'm very bad at the ""politics"" side of work - I never bother advertising my work and my accomplishments. This is the first thing I will address in the upcoming week - making my work much more visible, to the point of sticking a success story down their throats (I will take a task that they didn't want to take and make it work, it's a good task and I know it has value, I'll just make the most of it and then make a big deal out of it, which is something very unlike me). 

What I am concerned about is the relationship with the team members I mentioned. I am pissed, and offended, and pissed again. I thought we had a good, friendly relationship. I helped a lot of these guys, I gave them good feedback when I saw good work, and defended some of them during their less than stellar times.

I want to keep the professional relationship intact - they work directly with the person I manage directly, and indirectly with my other teams. They are the most technological and sometimes I need their help. But on the other hand, I need to make a point - they don't get to talk shit about me in public meetings (the product manager was also present in the meeting). Also - I want to cut off our friendly side of the relationship but keep the professional side intact (though I guess it will suffer a little damage).

I am deeply dissapointed and offended. I think the fact that I am young, a little inexperienced and a woman (they are all men, mostly a little older than me) might have helped nurse a frustration I was just unaware of. I need to stand my ground, but also keep things professional. And honestly - I want them to suffer a little bit. I want them to know that their reckless actions have consequesnces, and that in our professional dynamics I am not the person who will suffer for it.",22Jun2018,1

346,"I work as a pharmacist manager for a large chain for the past few years. About a year ago, I was moved from my store to a flagship store, as they needed someone to come in there and get things moving, and I was given the chance. It was a huge move and I had to make a lot of adjustments, but things have been going well, and I've really hit my stride. Prescriptions are up, our reviews are great, and new patients are coming in at a steady clip.

And then 2 days ago I get a phone call: we're transferring you to a different store. I was shocked. Doing some research, it seems another pharmacist just a few more years at the company is moving into my store. My district manager is telling me that it's improper that I'm serving at a flagship store, any requests for further information are replied to with corporate drivel.

The other pharmacist isn't getting as good numbers at his store, his metrics aren't as good as mine, and yet this move is happening, which I can only assume is some sort of power grab. Our mutual colleagues are giving me the cold shoulder, telling me ""i know you're upset, but you can transform this into a positive experience."" Basically telling me to eat this shit and ask for seconds when I'm done.

The past few days haven't been very good ones, and in 2 weeks this will all transpire. Is there anything I can do? I'm thinking of going over my current superior's heads, but that's a risky move.

Are there certain rights I'm not aware of that are being violated? Is legal action a possibility? I just want to know where I stand. Thanks in advance.",22Jun2018,1
347,"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit, if not, I’d really appreciate someone pointing me in the right direction! 

I currently work at a coffee shop. Recently, one of my managers (we’ll call him Bill) was reported and fired for sexual harassment in the workplace. He was close to another manager (we’ll call her Karen).  They’re good friends outside of work, and Karen is really upset about Bill getting fired. Since she is apart of management, she knows who reported him (multiple women) but does not know that he also did this at another store. Her justification is “sexual harassment was way worse at [location] store, he shouldn’t have gotten fired.”

Karen has now told multiple team members why Bill was fired and is trying to justify his behavior. “It was a misunderstanding” and “he didn’t think he was harassing” “at the old store you could act like that” etc. 

I want to report this to my manager or area manager, but I’m not sure if I’m within my rights to do so. I know what she is doing is wrong, but I’d like to know how to go about this. I’ve never had to do this before, but I feel like it’s a breach of confidentiality. ",22Jun2018,2
348,"I'm 17 and I live in a tiny camper trailer (that is ment for a Max of 2 people) next to are house that burnt down with 5 people: me, my mom, my dad, and my two sisters. My family has no source of income. I don't mean a small source I mean absolutely none. Both my mom and dad can't work. My dad got hurt doing a government roofing job. He tore both rotator cuffs but only one has been worked on. He was on workers compensation but they cut it off. He has two lawsuits that have lasted over 4 years. My mom can not work because her foot went though a car windsheild because of a drunk driver. She can barely walk. You might be thinking we'll just get them on disability. Lawers have told my dad not to get on disability but that has chamged. We can't get anywhere to start applying for disability because we do not have a working vehicle. Most of are so called ""friends and family"" have stopped helping us.  We run a generator that we borrowed from a neighbor 24/7 but it is hard to get gas for it because we can't go anywhere. I have started suffering severe depression. It only gets worse each day. I have looked into emancipation but that's not an option because it can take several months and I would be 18 I that by that time so it would not matter. I want to leave this situation does anyone know how I can.

352,"So generally I’m a very outgoing person. I know how to strike up conversation with just about anyone and I’ve been told I’m very relatable to others-which is probably why I have many friends of all different shapes/sizes/colors. 

Here lately tho something’s been happening that I can’t seem to figure out. 

For an example I’ll be talking w/ someone-anyone. It could be a complete stranger or even a close friend/relative and I’ll start to become very anxious, even to the point of breaking into a mild sweat. My eyes become blood shot and my face gets red. It’s super embarrassing but I usually just play it off (“man, I’ve been having these mini heat strokes-menopause coming early) 

It’s super strange tho because it comes out of nowhere and it’s not like I’m nervous talking to family/friends-(it even happened when talking to my grandma!) ...I have no idea what’s triggering it, but it seems like if it’s not the red face/sweat session it’s a fear of voice cracking-which I’ve been doing a lot lately. Which I think is a part of the anxiety. 

It’s not terrible, I still have great conversation w/ people, especially once I get into my “groove” but I’d just like to know why it’s happening so I can correct it and go back to being 100% me w/out overthinking things-which btw is much harder said than done. Seems like the more I try to relax or whatever during these moments the worse is gets. 

So yea, crazy! Especially bc I’m always giving others advice about being themselves/relaxing around others etc etc and now this is happening to me :( 

Thanks for any advice/pointers in advance!

I am 100ish lbs, and I am 5'3"". I like my body where it is now, but I loooove food.  Especially junk food and fast food. I don't gain weight from eating, nor am I necessarily trying to. But I usually get hungry at night and eat a bunch of junk until my stomach is in pain. It's been affecting my health, I have no more energy to ever do anything. I'm not a very good cook, nor do I enjoy it. I need advice on how to not binge eat and practice more self control, yet people laugh at me and tell me to eat more because I'm so skinny. I just can't find the energy or motivation to do much. ",22Jun2018,3
356,"I’m a sales rep for a certain company. I was taking to someone I met online (but haven’t yet met in person) about my job. They jokingly asked me if I was able to give them a friends and family discount, and I admitted I could. To make matters worse, I actually shared the specifics of said discount (how much/for how long).

Immediately after I told them, it dawned on me that I should have kept my mouth shut. Now I am freaking out about what to do. 

Does information about that type of discount constitute a privacy breech, even though they would know anyways if I WAS giving them the discount?

What do I do know? Do I admit to my boss that I made a mistake, or should I keep my mouth shut for once? 

Yes,  I’m stupid, I know. ",22Jun2018,1

358,"My daughter is 18 years old and seems to have no plan whatsoever for her future. I realize a lot of young adults need sort of a few years to ""figure things out,"" but at the very least, they ought to have a job and be supporting themselves, even if they're still living at home, which my daughter is. Her father and I have offered to help her fill out applications and whatnot. We've even gone as far as to bring home applications from the restaurants we go out to and such. But she turns her nose up at every type of job opportunity that arises. I know she has no interest in working in fast food and retail, but the thing is, we've tried explaining to her that as someone just entering the workforce, she has no choice but to start from the bottom. She still expects us to buy her clothes and her makeup, which we've cut back on in the hopes that that would incentivize her to get off her but and put some serious effort into job searching, but it hasn't seemed to have made a difference. I realize that getting your first job can be hard. However, the fact that she's not even TRYING is becoming very tiresome. Again, we have offered to sit down with her and help her fill out things and look, but she seems to have no interest. I really don't know what to do at this point. ",22Jun2018,1

360,"My ex best friend has been friends with me for 4-5 years. It started to go downhill in the past year when I matured more, got different interests, and hung out with different groups. Meanwhile, she developed an extremely childish personality that she switches to sometimes where she’ll bite people, sit on people’s lap, chew papers, throw “tantrums”, and talk like a 5 year old.
She has chewed and stolen my sheet music, nearly jokingly broke my stuff, and thrown hissy fits, all while getting upset if I don’t pay attention to her.
I recently realized that I find her to be a narcissistic nuisance and that I don’t really like hanging out with her. I would have no problem with just cutting her off, quick and simple, or telling it like it is, but there’s one problem. 
She came from an abusive family and I’m one of her closest friends. If I cut her off, she’d feel like everyone hates her and would be very emotional. She might even harm herself.
I don’t want to harm her in any way, but she’s harming me. How do I cut her off without hurting her? Do I not cut her out of my life at all?",22Jun2018,7

362,"It’s been almost a year, and with the treatment schedule I put myself on it might be another 1-2. Not just sex, but anything. I’ve been on one date since my last relationship and it was fine but didn’t go anywhere. After that I decided I should just focus on my health and personal growth for now.

I’ve never been much of a “stud,” I’ve had a few girlfriends and one time made out with a girl at a party. Never hooked up with anyone, never had a one night stand, never had a fwb, so dry spells are not new to me in the least.

This time is different, I’m a grown adult working full time, my friends are getting married, everyone around me goes on dates and finds partners like it’s nothing; I had to spend half a year chatting with people online before a single person wanted to go out at all.

So my question is: how am I supposed to cope with the unending human compulsion to have sex and be close with someone when that clearly isn’t an option? I have no family, few friends, and no casual arrangements in my life. I’m pretty over it and it’s been making me increasingly suicidal.

I have started to develop a feeling of cynicism and indifference towards love and relationships that I now don’t know if it is good or bad. I just don’t care about finding a girlfriend, I just want money, peace with myself and a good stable job and then the rest will come. I, for example, now think that marriage is bullshit, that love is stupid and that relationships are dumb. Sometimes (very few times) I feel kind of jealous of others for having cool relationships but it just goes away. I just do not care much. I don’t know if this is good or bad. What do you think?

366,"I work at a locally owned business and I really enjoy the work I do but the people I work with are making me hate being here. For starters my hours were randomly cut a couple weeks ago, I went from having 10 hour shifts a day 5 days a week to have one 5 hour shift a week. I was very blind sided by this and talked to my shift manager about it, when I told her I needed more hours she laughed and said “I know right” 
I thought about asking her about it again but my manager mocked one of the other people I work with for asking for more hours
She then made fun of ANOTHER one of my coworkers for also asking for more hours as well and even said “(my name) is the only one who should be complaining about her hours, hers suck” 
She also called another one of my coworkers and they teased me about how many hours I’m getting 
 
Today I got hurt on the job and wasn’t able to walk, I again told my manager that I was hurt and she again laughed and told me “that’s so random” and completely brushed it off 
My coworkers constantly make fun of me for things I like to the point that I just pretend to have interests that match there’s. For example they called me disgusted and weird as hell when I said I thought ferrets were cute

One of the shift leaders is also very competitive and will constantly make me redo all my work so that she can be the only one up front making sales, she even told the owner that I’m terrible at the job 
I asked the owner to double check my work after this and the owner said I did everything perfectly 

They love to sit in the back and talk bad about my other coworkers and our costumers. I don’t trust my manager or my shift leaders at all anymore, I’m afraid anything I say to them will be repeated to everyone. I have heard both my manager and shift leader talk about me when they thought I wasn’t listening 

I’m not sure what to do, I really enjoy this job but I’m feeling more and more drained by the people around me ",22Jun2018,0
