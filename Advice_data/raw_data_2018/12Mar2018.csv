3,"For the past 5 years I’ve had horrible thoughts and have hated myself for so long. I panic all the time and blow situations way out of proportion and I feel serious stress. I hate myself and I think everyone else hates me and they use me to think, “Well let’s try not to be like him.”
I’ve had dark thoughts of just disappearing and darker thoughts. I wanna talk to someone and see a doctor but something always stops me. I just think I do nothing but disappoint and fail all the time. Please help, I’m miserable.",12Mar2018,3
4,"Hello, so usually it’s the dad’s job to tell the kids not to watch porn or encourage nudity, but this time it’s vice versa, only I haven’t told him. It all started when my dad got Instagram and one day he came up to me and said “Geez, look how pretty this girl is.” It was a pretty innocent picture, no ass hanging out or cleavage. Then I said something I now regret; “Yeah, you should see some of the models on instagram, they’re insane!” 
                   Fast forward to today, I looked at who he was following, and he’s following at least 50 soft porn pages. Not only is it gross to me, but he also has a lot of people who he works with on instagram. I don’t think he knows that people can see who he’s following. How do I tell him? I really don’t want to make things awkward. ",12Mar2018,127
5,"As stated my teeth pain are getting worse. I've been trying to take care of my teeth better because of a small dull ache but it's gotten fairly intense now. I'm taking near 20 ibuprofen a day to try and manage but it's no longer working.

I've always had major teeth issues. While I want to believe my teeth issues are genetic, a lax in care at an early age probably contributed. Both mother and father have horrible teeth as well (also due to smoking). I have 2 root canals, one removed tooth and recently a severally split tooth. Luckily the split tooth doesn't hurt.

I'm fairly sure I need another root canal and I do not have even have close to the money it would take to get one. Even the dental schools in my area would only be 40-50% less and I can't afford that either quite honestly. My family are not in a position to help me either. I applied for CareCredit and got denied because my financial history was messed up pretty bad by being a reckless youth.

I'm currently 29 and I have no idea what I can do to help alleviate the pain. I would appreciate any advice I could get on the matter to help point me in the right directions. I really just want the pain to stop",12Mar2018,3

 has completely lost it, about 10 minutes ago I just had a shouting match at him over a microwave timer, because he insisted that he hit the timer button, instead of just typing in the time and turning the microwave on, I was joking and said he was ""retarded"" (which in hindsight obviously wasn't the right thing to say, but I usually say things like that and he takes it as a joke pretty well) This situation has been getting worse over the course of about 4-5~ years once we moved from where we used to live that he seemed to enjoy a lot because of his hobbies in fishing. (Near lake erie), But as soon as we moved down south to where I was born he started playing sexual games and talking to other women, as well as masturbating with his door wide open and doing ""sex video chats"" I live with my mom as well but we don't really have good income and we can't afford to move out quite yet, the reason I have only been on part time is because I can't get more than 30 hours at my current position, and I have bad feet and some back problems, I really need help because I don't know where to go and I'm thinking some bad things

12,"I am 25 and alone. I've suffered from depression and anxiety for a good portion of my life. I'm pretty awkward socially and meetup groups, online dating and trying to socialize at work has been a disaster and just makes me more self conscious. Friends that I once had in high school and university have since moved on and we don't talk anymore. It seems the older you get, the more acquaintances you get to know in the working world and the more difficult it is to make friends.

I'm kind of at a ""what now"" point in my life. I know the only real way to meet others is to put myself out there and online friendships and relationships don't really hold much significance to me (sorry if I offend anyone).  I also don't like going to breweries or cafes or places of the like by myself because creepy guys try to hit on me and get aggressive when I try to let them know (in the politest way) that I am not interested.

Because of this, i'm only taking one math class and i'm not doing well in it, which is ridiculous..... and it's because this class just isn't my main focus right now. I put no effort into it because all these other problems are swamping me. I've been thinking about just taking this semester/summer off and try to fix these other issues in my life and just work but at the same time I don't want to drop out of school because i worry i wont go back or that i'll get depressed because my friends are all transferring to 4 year colleges soon and i'll be stuck at home getting even further behind.

14,"I recently started at a new school and I’ve had trouble making friends. All day I feel like a shadow, like I don’t even exist to anybody else. Everyone is always forgetting me, teachers, students, even my family. I could disappear for hours on end and they wouldn’t notice. 
I’m also extremely lonely. I barely see my sister, who used to be my best friend, anymore. Some days go by where I only say a few words to anybody. It’s like I’m completely invisible. I seriously believe if I died nothing would really change. 

Usually I have control over my feelings and I don’t get too upset, but today I just started crying like never before. I was wailing and I couldn’t stop. I don’t really understand why. All things considered, today wasn’t a bad day- I got out of the house to go to church and I saw one of my old friends there. But I was just overcome with a gut wrenching hopelessness. Like everything was a mess and it’s never going to get better. I was crying so hard my heart physically hurt. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I have rapid mood swings all the time and everything just really seems to be going downhill. It’s probably worth mentioning that I’m also struggling with anorexia and body image issues, so that might play a part in what’s going on. 

What do I do? I want to tell somebody, but my older sister has problems with anxiety and my cousin is currently in therapy for suicidal thoughts. I feel like if I tell somebody it’ll look like I’m piggybacking off of them. 

I know I should speak up, but it’s really hard. Can someone tell me if it’s worth it? If talking about will actually help?",12Mar2018,3

17,"I am 24 and alone, no family or friends really. I have suffered from anxiety and depression for a good portion of my life and therapy and medicine never really did much for me. I am pretty awkward socially and meetup groups, online dating, trying to socialize at work, etc. have been a disaster and have only made my anxiety and depression worse. Friends that I once had in high school and college have moved on and lost interest in me already. It's life but it sucks when it happens. I feel like the older you get, the more acquaintances you acquire and the harder it is to make friends. People are starting/have families and do not want to be bothered by you or already have their own little clique of people they've known forever. I wish I knew what the secret formula is for making friends and having them stick around.

I am at a 'what now'? point in my life. I have a B.S. in psychology that, while I am using it at my current job, I do not make a lot of money and I am no longer interested in the field (I wasted so much time and money on this degree and it has me feeling really down). I want to go into engineering but I am worried that my work schedule, finances and being out of school for two years will be a major hurdle for me. I know the only real way to meet others is to put myself out there and online friendships and relationships do not hold much significance for me (sorry if that offends anyone). I also do not like going to places such as breweries, bars or cafes by myself, as I have done this in the past just to get out of the house and usually men that I'm not interested in will hit on me and then get aggressive when I try to let them (politely) know that I am not interested (I don't want to say that I attract the creepy type but...lol). 

I should also mention that I am female and do not have many interests. I recently bought a gym membership and want to start going to work out soon as well as go to yoga but of course social anxiety is holding me back. I also want to travel but I have safety concerns as a young woman traveling alone. 

anyways... any advice from someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated. ",12Mar2018,5

21,"Was walking into my local subway and a homeless guy asked if I could buy him a beer, I gave him the excuse I give other homeless people and said I was a broke college kid that didn't carry cash.

Then he saw me entering the subway and asked if he could get a sand which. I said, sure.

I didn't want to spend much time there, since I ordered online. So I just got my order, split it in half with the dood, and bought him chips and a drink. 

I left telling him I felt bad he asked me for a beer, and that I felt better giving him a sand which instead. Also something about hoping others would do the same for me yada yada.

24,"There is this girl that I care for (Janet, not her real name obviously) and have done for a couple of years now. I actually met her back in 2012 when I moved from one side of town to the other when we were both a bit younger. I didn’t think much of it (we had one conversation in the park and that was it for me). However, apparently I caught her eye. Because she had then sent me a friend request on Facebook (to which I didn’t accept, I had no knowledge of the request ever being sent to be honest until she brought it back up) and later told me she had actually quite liked me at the time. We get back in contact in 2016 due to her dating one of my good friends at the time (let’s call him Peter). We become friends very quickly because we knew each other before and our personalities, humor and traits/habits practically matched, so it was very easy to lose hours in the day just talking to her about everything and nothing.

As time progresses, her relationship with Peter worsens, and we become very very close, we probably know everything about each other by now. And I do start to fall for her. However, she hadn’t quite fallen for me, and actually, due to the awful relationship that she was in originally, fell for someone else, my best friend of 16 years - I’ll call him Ken. Janet and Ken get together after Janet breaks it off with Peter (he was really shitty to her), and seem to be in a good place together, happy and all. At this point my feelings fade, because clearly she is a no go due to now dating Ken -someone who I literally grew up with, hung around with every day at school and on weekends. We did everything together. 

However, Janet and I obviously were still speaking as friends at the time, but started speaking about subjects that I feel were more suitable to be talking about with her boyfriend. Stuff like: the future, how our kids would be and look, marriage etc. We’re both very open minded people so it felt just normal for us to be speaking about things like that. We say the things about our kids and future together, moving away and stuff in an inside joke kind of way, yet, it’s not all a joke. There’s underlying tension and seriousness I feel. Like, this is what we both really want?

She also says things like, ‘I don’t sing in front of Ken’ (she sings comfortably in front of me, has a lovely voice), I ask why, she says she doesn’t really know. She also said recently that she feels more comfortable at my place as compared to Ken’s. She hesitates when talking about her future with Ken, she’s never included him in things that she has planned, yet will willingly talk to me about how our children would look. How their cheeks would be chubby and they’d be really cute. We got drunk the other day together and she admitted she thinks about me a lot (to my utter surprise due to my lack of confidence!). There are lots of other things that she has said that tell me she favors me over Ken but I can’t particularly remember them enough right now to articulate. 

Ken has had a history of lying to her, and kind of playing her around a bit and has been doing that again recently. He also told her he wanted space to focus on things for himself (work, college, sports), and I’m thinking the end may be near because they seem to be argumentative and the honeymoon period may be coming to an end (been together just over a year). She’s a very loyal, very sweet, kind, down to earth, beautiful person who I sincerely want to give the whole world to. Even my family love her. I have two older sisters who adore her because she’s great with my newborn niece and so outgoing. My mother really likes her too, and so do I. But there’s a catch, Ken.

I’ve known this guy basically all of my life. And he sees me still as a brother (we haven’t spoken as regularly as we did when we were at school, so I naturally didn’t regard him as much of a brother anymore, we have other friends now). We’re both busy too so no time really to hang out. However, I’d give up all my time to hang out with his girlfriend!

It’s such a bad situation, I love and care for this girl like I have no other. I think cares a lot about me too, but she is dating my best friend. I don’t think he’s the one for her though. They’re too different. She told me of how she asked Ken what they had in common. He listed a bunch of materialistic things like shoes, clothes etc. She then asked to name things that weren’t materialistic, to which he had no answer. Yet, when I asked her what she and I had in common that were not materialistic, she named a list of about 5-10 things that we had in common. I don’t know what message she’s trying to send me but I am thinking about it way too much! 

What do I do? How do I approach this situation without hurting anyone? 

Does she like me? She clearly cares about me, I know that, she’s said that. But, does she like me in a way that she’ll be with me at some point? She says you never know what the future holds and that it could happen. Does she secretly have feelings?

I think I should wait a bit, continue talking how we are and see what path their relationship goes down. Yet, I don’t want to wait too long as to send the wrong message that I’m not interested when I clearly am.

Any other advice/suggestions? If so they’re greatly appreciated!

TL;DR - Like this girl who is dating my best friend, yet is very close to me as well, I think she likes me too.

By the time I was 20, I had lost roughly $70 million dollars in bitcoin to negative thinking, and hundreds upon hundreds of hours of time wasted wallowing. I am still wanting to start a business because it seems like a better real world lesson that would help me more and force me to improve more than if I went to college. The problem is, I am very negative. I don't have a drive to succeed, I have a drive to lay down and die and sit around and make up reasons why I can't do something and bitch and cry about how my life isn't going the way it I want. I have been like this since I was probably 4, and as cost me friendships, experiences, money, time and energy. I am tired of it. If I am to start a business, period, I need to learn to think more positively and have more motivation instead of over whelming negativity. 

Also, how can I change it when I get motivation I sit around with a happy thought in my head, and then get so overwhelmed with the feeling of excitement and happiness that I do nothing but bounce around the internet and real life and sit on that feeling tell it goes away and the negativity come back?

Before it could lock up, the second shift supervisor came back. And took the time to look through my phone. Note: This is my personal phone.

I'm an asian male living in a flat with my girlfriend, going to get married at the end of this year. Currently a room is rented to a lady that's younger than me. I grew up with western influence and is pretty lax about casual sex.

I thought she will be embarrassed when I saw her walking around the flat without any bra (i could see her nipples poking out of her tight shirt), but apparently she's not. In fact, we had a small conversation over breakfast when my girlfriend was at work.

She's an 7/10,cute girl. I'm just looking for sexual gratification, no strings attached. I'm not sure about her feelings because she's young and asian.. and could be more conservative about these things.

All these years I've been faithful to my girlfriend because I don't want to live a life of regret. But on the other hand, damn she's cute, tempting and a f-ckable material.

50,"So, let me start off with the fact that I have been actively working with my Marine Corps recruiters since around june of last year. I have lost 55 lbs since then, and here I am now. I am doing well physically, but I'm in a plateau at 220 lbs. I need to be 215 to enlist. 

Now... That isn't the half of it. I originally had to be 221 to enlist, but we miscalculated my height, and so we had to adust. That was December. 

Fast forward to now and I'm still at 220-222lbs. Now, back when we were about to enlist me, back in December, my recruiter said I could go to Boot Camp in May if I lose the extra 20 lbs after hitting 215 and enlisting (getting to my Boot Camp weight). 

But the biggest thing here is that my family is coming up on the end of our rental contract for our house, so we have to move... And we are looking to go out of state... I don't know what I should do. Should I bring my folks in to talk to my recruiter and figure this out? Do you all have any super weight loss tips that I can use to speed this up?

51,"I hate jobs. I don't hate work, I hate jobs. Often it's not the physical work aspect of jobs I hate, it's other shit. I've recently been through the ringer of crazy af jobs. When I was around 21, I worked in an ice cream factory. This was my favorite job. However, the orders slowed so I got laid off, set for rehire months later. I left the job because I didn't want to be on unemployment for months, also I felt God wanted me to move on. I then worked at a fast food joint and with kids with behavioral problems. The fast food joint was ok outside of my supervisor smoking weed in the deep freeze and my boss letting that shit fly because they like him so much. ( I mean, I liked him too , it's why I had sex with him but that's beside the point).The behavioral kids job was nuts. My boss made her own rules and asked us to fudge on documentation. The kids were hardly allowed any freedom and the environment made their behavior issues worse, not better. One of the kids would pull out knives if he didn't get his way. I left that job to work with adults with intellectual disabilities. For that job, my immediate supervisor smoked all the time in spite of being pregnant. The rules were insane and one of the clients would pull hair and break glasses. Got tired of that job, left for Wal Mart. 
Had some cool friends there, still hated the overall environment. I was a cashier and I felt the front store supervisor's or csms all acted like they were hot shit for being Wal Mart supervisors. They would constantly hound me on dumb stuff like making sure I greeted customers, etc even though I always kept to myself whenever I was there  and I always did what they said. They would *hound* on me and I always felt like I was doing my best not slacking off,etc. They even confronted me saying I was doing below average performance and they wanted to fire me but one manager stuck their neck out for me. I ended up getting fired anyway due to too many attendance points. Now I drive cab and my roommate says it's my fault if I get hurt for taking such a shitty job. I'm tired of changing jobs!

She constantly pushes her beliefs on me and tells me to go to church with my boyfriend and involve him in religious things, because he's not religious or involved in faith at all. If I had any interest at all in doing these things with him, I would, but I'm not interested and this often triggers a fight with my mom and my mom always assumes my boyfriend is the bad influence. 

That being said, today she wanted me and my boyfriend to go to confession. For what reason, I don't know. She said it as a suggestion that I ignored. When she asked if I was going and I said no, it ignited a fire. Now she's not speaking to me or my boyfriend again and I don't know how to deal with her. These situations come up constantly, involving religion or not. 

As an adult woman living with this still, how do I deal with my independence and also having to live in this war between my mom and I? I can't afford to live on my own as of right now, nor can I just move in with my boyfriend. Having civil conversations with my mom also doesn't work because she just wants to fight. I don't want to just succumb to anything she tells me to do because I'm just too old for that. I don't know how to balance my independence with dealing with the bullshit.",12Mar2018,4
56,Im currently an undergraduate at my university and I wanted to become an adjunct professor in some writing/composition class after graduation. I understand most adjunct professors need a masters degree. what is the best course of action for this?,12Mar2018,2
58,"Like the title says- her parents have been helping a lot by watching her other 3 kids while she and/or I were at our respective jobs. With the 4th kid being born, her parents made the decision that they can only watch them at limited times. These limited times pretty much prevent my gf from working at all. Her other 3 kids' father watches his kids twice a week, but because of his work schedule, not consistent. 

I've suggested working online to her, but the online jobs I've found she doesn't like or she's not qualified for. We've looked into support (SNAP, etc) and I make too much for us to qualify for it. However, I don't make enough money to cover the expenses for her and her kids. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. 

TL; DR: gf can't work because we can't get someone to watch kids. I can't afford to support her and her kids on my salary alone, even though I make too much to qualify for assistance.",12Mar2018,2
59,"I am the second of three children in a family of parents who emigrated from the Philippines. We live in one household as me and my older sibling are still in our teens.

My dad's very hard and physical on us occasionally because that's how he was raised when he grew up. He shouts if we refuse to do something, if we're not fast enough, etc. If we aren't doing things his way, he'll grab the nearest object that won't break, and throw it to somewhere in close proximity to us. He'll pinch, slap, and push us to submission if we're still refusing. When I complain to my mom about these things, she tells me to expect that punishment from him and that when I move away from them, I'll be in charge. In all honesty, she's right. If I just didn't talk back, if I just wasn't giving him a hard time and spewing bullcrap all over the place, he would just stop it, and I know he will because he doesn't drink, smoke, or take drugs that change his mental state and wouldn't just casually beat us up. Seeing him just giving a dirty look at me throughout yesterday, I could tell he was disappointed at me for not following his lead in the first place and talking back. His methods to clean weren't as effective or hygienic as modern ones, such as using the brush you usually use for toilet bowls to clean the sink, and wiping the walls down using shirts (albeit clean ones), but I should've just followed through so as to not make any more discord in the place.

I don't like doing chores, and let's face it, not many people do. My mom tells me to clean my room every weekend, coming in to supervise and yell at us to see if we're doing the job right. She'll yell at us to pick this up, sweep that down, arrange this, and so on, and if we don't do it within a certain time frame (usually 10 to 30 seconds, depending on what it takes to do it), she'll start shouting at us and trying to keep us in check as if our attention spans were so low that we would've lost my focus the second we're downstairs to get the broom. She said she'd change but she just went back to our old self. This sets me in a very bad mood, this getting worse until I started shouting and arguing with her about cleaning. I get into an emotional trip crying, breaking down, and letting myself tell her how I really feel about them doing this to us. She then responded to me by telling me that she's only doing this because she loves me and that she doesn't want to see me living like a pig when I get to college not learning how to do all these chores. She's doing this to me until I get it in my head and do it out of my own accord instead of having to get yelled at to do it. I still didn't understand and got frustrated with her, yelling back the question of how to make this a habit. At that point, she'd stop talking to me and she gives up on trying to reason with me because she knows that she's done this multiple times and it,s never worked out for me (I'd always just forget her advice about it in a week or so). 

Today, it was the last straw for her. I did the same thing, but this time, I instantly became frustrated when she told me to clean my room because I knew what was going to ensue and I was mad, not just at her, but at my brother as well. He laid the clothes down in my bed this morning (we share one bedroom) and I yelled at him to put it in the laundry hamper. I tossed the towels that were left on the too bunk of my brother's bed onto the floor and became very arrogant, letting my emotions out on everybody. My mom asked me why I put the towels in the hamper for the dirty clothes, and I responded trying be a smartass about it by telling her that the towels were on the floor, therefore they were dirty. Then I yelled at her, saying that I would've listened if she just wasn't yelling at us like this and telling us to go and help them do help with the TV despite the numerous times I've taught my parents how to do it (I'm the family tech head). I just lost all my patience with them right then and there, and she gave me a very real guilt trip lecture about how she didn't yell at her mom when she was young and that she's just trying to do her best and now her son is arguing with her about how she's not doing it right in their eyes or that she wasn't doing enough for them in their eyes despite working a 9 to 5 job running a business with her husband six days a week. That's when I realized that I've been disrespectful with them, that I've messed up and that this whole time, I was wrong.

Now, I REALLY wanna push for that change. Previous attempts failed, and I've concluded that I need more advice. I'm desperate, as my parents have seemingly started to isolate themselves from me, and I have three more years before an opportunity to move out rolls in. Don't pin this on them, don't criticize their methods of parental control. I'M the one who needs to change while I'm still young.",12Mar2018,13

My parents were never in love and are separated but still live together. I’ve never seen them even hug each other, and I don’t remember the last time they showed me any affection either. I’ve never been in a relationship or even seen a functioning one, and so I have no idea how to navigate them. Also, I’m afraid of opening myself up to another person. It feels like I can see the end before it even begins, which I know is unhealthy and isn’t doing me any favors.

-how much should one put into a rough budget for each expense? examples: how much typically for electricity and water?
-what is a good amount to spend on groceries for 2 people for one month?

62,"There was this girl I went on a date with about 5 months ago, her name was April. April and I were supposed to go on more dates, but bad timing and such just lead us to agree it wasn't going to work out. We have remained good friends since then.

I have a really good friend, his name is Curtis. Curtis and I have been friends for years, since elementary school. We stay in contact pretty regularly.

Curtis normally lives in my hometown but he's off at a college about 200 miles south right now. April lives in a city about 20 miles north of me, but goes to my college.

Curtis asks me about April. By this point he doesn't personally know April. I had told him about April back when we were still texting daily and had dates planned. After the relationship fizzled out, I told him I had no feelings for her at all *at first* because I was embarassed that I had ever even told him about April in the first place. A few weeks later, I fess up and tell him I had liked her, and wished that things had worked out between me and her.

Three months after April and I had gone on a date, and after all the aforementioned mess, Curtis messages me, saying he found April on MeetMe, a sort-of dating website. He had been skulking around on those websites trying to pick up women. He regularly sent me photos of saucy text conversations between him and women on the website. Anyway, he sent me a photo of her profile, with a caption saying something like 'new mission acquired.' I told him directly that I didn't like that kind of joke, that I found it weird. I didn't like the idea of him messaging her and I told him as much.

Curtis tells me he understands, assures me he won't do anything. He starts talking to her online daily about all kinds of stuff, including me. He tells me about the conversations they have, and I tell him again that I think it's weird he's going out of his way to talk to her. After all, this is all going online.

About two months later, we are in present day. I find out today that Curtis has come all the way back to our hometown just to go on a date with April, and spent the night with her at his house. I get really mad at him, telling him that it was all preventable because he initiated every single point of interaction between the two of them - he messaged her first, continued to message her, decided to ask her on a date, and spent the night with her on purpose. I tell him that the least he could have done was ask me if this was cool with me. He tells me that none of this was by choice, that I don't own him or her, and that I'm being clingy and emotional.

**Ultimately, here's the gist of it:** **Curtis contacted April online after I asked him not to, continued to message April after I asked him not to again, and started getting romantic with her, driving 200 miles her way, after telling me nothing would happen.**

Is Curtis right? *Am* I being too clingy? The way I see it, if this had happened organically by regular contact, in some college class or something, then maybe it wouldn't be Curtis's fault. 

 Should I just drop him? I think he's a really funny guy, but I feel that he's crossed a line. He did these things despite my asking him not to. He is surrounded by women at his college - all he really wants is companionship and sex - and he chooses this one, 200 miles away? And then he tells me something about he couldn't help any of it. I feel personally offended. Am I being melodramatic? Do I just forgive him and let bygones be bygones?

Background:
One of my best friends comes from a ""fortunate"" situation where she doesn't need to work and her parents pay for her rent and all her expenses. (I put fortunate in quotes because this means she usually spends all day shopping or hanging out in coffee shops waiting for me to get off work so we can hang out--being filthy rich sometimes isn't always all that fantastic it seems). I'm on the complete opposite of the spectrum where I am working as an engineer AND going to grad school, and most my money goes towards bills and school and food. Up until now our financial differences have never been an issue. I never feel uncomfortable telling her I can't afford to do something, and she often suggest activities that she knows I can afford. We always try to build each other up. 

Current:
I just moved to a different part of town which is closer to downtown where I work, and it's a really trendy and vibrant area. This area is sort of made up of a bunch of smaller areas, and I definitely live in the cheapest area, because it was all I could afford. I was fortunate enough to move into a house for real cheap ($400!!!!) with dogs and really great roommates. I was excited about the move and told the friend about it, and shortly after she started looking for a place in the same part of town, which irked me a little because I felt like this move was sort of my thing, and she had always expressed a disinterest in the area. But whatever, she's her own person and I kept that to myself (even though she will flip out if anyone ""copies"" her, even if it is just posting a similar looking IG photo). 
I was on the phone with her telling her about the place (she asked) and how happy I was to find such cheap rent in such a great place, even if the house was a little old. I asked how her search was going and she said that she was looking in ****(the wealthiest of the three areas), ecause the other areas were run down, but couldn't find anything that she liked. I asked what her budget was and she said $2600/mo, but she couldn't find anything, because anything below that sucked.

I told her I had to get off the phone after that, and she sent me a text apologizing and asking what's up, because I never get off the phone that quickly. I let her know I was jsut busy, because honestly, I don't know why that upset me so much. It's not her fault I'm not as rich as her, and she should be able to talk to her best friend about her apartment search, but it made me so furious to hear her be so ungrateful. I would LOVE to be able to afford $1000/mo, and I work my ass off to get what I have, and she literally does nothing but shop and get botox, and her hair and eyelashes and nails done all day. I've never felt jealous of her before, but something in her statement set me off.

I need help understanding what and why I am feeling this way, and advice on how to proceed.

77,"Please hear me out. Let me give you guys all the evidence that's leading me to think she is.

1.) Every night for the past week or so, she ""has been talking on the phone with a friend from work"" when normally, me and her talk on the phone at night and she's never been too busy talking on the phone with a friend to talk to me, mostly because her friends never call her anyway, and she never talks on the phone at night with anyone but me.

2.) When she's ""on the phone with a friend"", she takes about thirty minutes to reply to my text messages. I don't see why she would take thirty minutes to reply to my messages when she always talks on the phone with earbuds in her ears, so she should have both hands free to be able to reply to my messages, so why isn't she?

3.) She hasn't been letting me check her phone. I don't know, maybe she has embarassing messages with her friends that she doesn't want me to see, or maybe she has flirty and dirty messages she doesn't want me to see. Either way, there's something on her phone she doesn't want me to see.

81,"I (17M) broke up with my girlfriend of 9 months 5 months ago and I haven’t gotten over her. We ended on “good” terms, she had some stuff going on and she started to lose interest in us as it wasn’t a priority. We were part of the same friend group so we still talked. We got along fine and talked to each other like nothing was wrong but that soon changed.

The way she broke up with me made me really upset. Basically she said our relationship was no longer a priority to her and she asked if I’d be ok if we broke up. I didn’t say anything and she walked away. I felt cheated because 9 months of time and effort building a relationship with her and it just ended like that. We were really close and had plans for the rest of the year so I didn’t really expect us to break up even though we were going through a rough patch, so I felt lost afterwards because now I had nothing planned. 

I started to hate her and took everything she did as an attack on me and coped for a while by making her the bad guy so I had someone to blame. She was going through some family stuff and was generally agitated with everyone but I only noticed when she was “mean” to me. I felt like she hated me so I hated her and so that’s the way it was.  

We stopped talking completely after I stormed out of a class and ignored her when she said hi so we stopped talking/even looking at each other. I thought I moved on when I could talk bad about her and think of her poorly without feeling bad but I was just trying to cope.

After a while I realized that she went about her life and didn’t dwell on us while I did thinking she was too. She dealt with her family issue is back in good spirits but now that we are on bad terms we still don’t talk and I can tell she gets irritated when I’m around her.

I love to play computer games and interact with the \*lovely\* people online but rarely leave my house except for school. I play #2 hopefully #1 for the varsity tennis team and am going to play 7 days a week for hours a day just to do something. 

So that’s who I am. I figured I’d add it in case it helps. But my main question is that I enjoy just leaving everything behind and starting fresh again. I’ve done it numerous times in the past and I just never feel like I fit anywhere or with anyone. I’m just wondering if maybe I have a screw loose or it’s just a personality type. It’s like, I go somewhere new, reshape myself to be a part of that group, realize I don’t belong and things start to fracture, cut people down and rinse and repeat. 

Right now I have 3 people I talk to consistently. 1 is a nice friend I talk to at school. 1 is another I see sometimes outside of school. The last one is a teacher I’m close friends with that I have 3/6 classes a day. Outside of these 3 people, I rarely talk to and it’s nice but even now, we might be moving to another stage for next year and I am excited to just leave. It gives me a bit of anxiety just wondering if I’m just going to be a lone.

83,"So, in my head I’m often thinking of funny comments or good things to say in certain conversations, but I always just stay quiet and distant from everyone. I feel that I have the potential to be this social butterfly and to have people actually wanting to talk to me, but I can’t seem to get there. I have some close friends that I can be myself around and don’t always judge, but we keep falling distant from each other as we get older and I want to start branching out more with some new people. The thing is, I can’t bring myself to saying what is on my mind. The reason for this is because every time I try to speak, I stutter, stumble on words, or get a squeaky, high pitched voice that makes it hard to tell what I’m saying. I also have an illness that makes me constantly feel sick, so that sometimes affects my speaking voice and makes it dry and scratchy. One of the reasons why I stumble on my words is because I have adhd and have trouble processing things before I take action on them, so I’ll have an idea of what to say, and quickly blurt it out in an unclear way without realizing. This also makes me hard to talk to because although I have perfectly fine hearing, whenever someone is speaking to me I’ll just say “what” because I’m not processing what they are saying.

I’ve had veterinarians in their 50s who are just getting paid $100k or more as opposed to when they were in their 30s. 


I took a career aptitude test and results came out being art/music as my first and second being working with animals. Obviously the animals is shot down, I thought of doing veterinary medicine to be a vet tech... but it’s crazy how low the salary is. I’d rather be in customer service and get paid more than what vet techs are making. It’s crazy how much work they do to get paid that little, overall, veterinary medicine is just an underrated and underpaid profession. Which shouldn’t be. 


Anyway, my boyfriend is putting pressure on me to go to school and find something I like... but I just can’t. With art there’s really not much I can do unfortunately but maybe be a teacher or do music business. But I want to create, with that though, I won’t have a stable income. Even being an educator, they’re underpaid. But anyway, I tried getting into programming and it’s hard and I’m not sure if I even like it. The pay is what draws me but I just really don’t understand it, maybe because I’m doing it myself and I can’t focus very well but it’s so much money to do boot camps. I mean if someone can train me and teach me physically then maybe I can do it.


I’m just lost. I still live with my parents and I’m only making about $27k per year, I wanted to live with my boyfriend but he’s not ready to move in either as hes still with his uncle. Idk I just don’t know what to do anymore ",12Mar2018,5
88,"Two days ago, my boyfriend committed suicide. We have been together for 3 years and were about to end 7 months of long distance to move in together, with plans of marriage and children. His suicide came as a complete shock to everyone, and I am absolutely devastated. I love him so much and I have never felt pain like this before in my life. 

To be with my boyfriend, I have been living abroad in his home country for the last 3 years. Without him, I have no reason to stay and made the decision to return home. I called my dad in an obvious emotional state, telling him I am coming home but telling him I didn’t want to talk about why. After that I posted on Facebook asking if anyone had a spare room I could stay in for a bit (my dad lives in a one room trailer with no extra space). Several of my friends excitedly commented offering their rooms as well as many more expressing the desire to meet up for the first time in 3 years. My friends are all under the impression that I am just visiting and I know it will be shocking to them that I am moving back so suddenly when I recently posted about getting a new apartment and job here in my boyfriend’s country. 

One of the reasons I want to go home is because I need the support network and I have no doubt my dad and friends will be really helpful and supportive when they find out what happened. But my problem is I have no idea how to tell them. I feel physically sick at the idea of saying out loud that my boyfriend killed himself or even that he passed away. I can’t imagine saying the words out loud and even thinking about it is enough to make me start crying. I also don’t know how to broach with my friends that for me, this is not the happy homecoming they are expecting. I feel as though the moment any of them hug me hello, I will burst into tears and start crying uncontrollably. I also feel guilty for dropping such a huge bomb and asking for such emotional attention that might put a strain on their lives while having only been a minor part of it for the last 3 years. 

Do you have any advice for how to talk to my dad and friends about what happened?",12Mar2018,2

Im incredibly sad all the time, and this job just makes it worse. Deep down I know what i want to do, but I’m not sure if its the right thing to do..

90,"Hey all, so my parents recently decided to implement the xfinity xfi onto our network and it is blocking my access to reddit all together on my laptop. I can still use reddit on my iPhone for some reason but can’t access it in my laptop. Also some YouTube videos have been restricted but again, only on my laptop. 

Maybe they just haven’t figured out to add my iPhone as well? Idk but I have a feeling soon my iPhone won’t be able to access reddit either, which honestly would really suck.  This is where I de stress, learn new things, stumble upon sick memes, get my eye bleached, have discussions with people who enjoy the same things I do and etc. 

And I can’t convince them to turn that off for me either; they aren’t very understanding people.

91,"I have planned a trip to NYC and Boston this coming week. On Wednesday I am seeing my favorite artist, who rarely travels to America. The problem is that I have class on Wednesday. Her syllabus states that any absence is unexcused unless I'm in the hospital or someone close to me has died. We are graded on class attendance, and I am aiming for an A in her class. I want to tell her my reason for not being in class, but I feel guilty. I don't want to lie to her because she is a really awesome professor. I have considered lying, going to NYC after class, and even skipping, but none of these options work. I guess I'm really asking how I should write an email to her while remaining completely honest. I also want some input from you guys. Is this a bad idea? I'm telling myself it's not because this artist is playing a tribute to Nujabes (a hip-hop artist who passed away years ago) and their music brings me a lot of joy in life.
Anyways, I really appreciate any input from y'all. Thanks.

Edit: here is the email I wrote so far. Feel free to help edit

""I want to be honest with the reason for my absence. I got tickets for a show in New York City prior to starting the class.

I've always had a dream of moving to a big city and I'm starting to think I should give it a try. It would give me some new experiences and I think I would enjoy all the opportunities and culture that a city would provide. Has anyone else gone through something similar? Did moving or changing something about your environment help get you out of a rut?",12Mar2018,4

However, my boyfriend is in college right now and all my family is in the state I’m living in now. I’m really afraid to go alone but I also know I’ll really regret it if I never do these things.

Do I leave everyone and everything behind? Am I being selfish? ",12Mar2018,2
94,"Currently, I’m in my second year of undergrad at a community college as a bio major, who is aspiring to go med school.  As of now, my focus is to transfer to a 4 year university and finish off my remaining 2 years there. But everyday, I feel like I’m screwing up my chances to be a successful student, even though it may not seem like it. 

 I’m a hard working student, who has their lazy days once in awhile just to rest up. I sort of feel a little jealous seeing my friends, who are already attending 4 year universities directly from high school, having a great time visiting new places, going to concerts, hanging out or partying. 

I’m not so much of party person, but I would love to have my own adventures during my time in college too. But here’s the problem. I feel so anxious whenever I take a break from school. Be it a Friday where I sit at home, watching a movie with my family (since I’m in a community college, I still live at home) or a Saturday where I binge on some YouTube videos, I feel extremely guilty whenever I do something not school related. 

I’m always either at school or at home taking care of my family. I’m not that smart, so I need a lot of extra time after school to study and practice the learning material, which honestly takes up a lot of time. And whenever I take time away from my study to draw (as a pass time) or to watch some videos, I beat myself up for it since I feel like should have been using that time to only study. I feel that things in my life are a bit mundane, yet I’m so scared to leave this cycle because I’m worried about slacking and doing poorly in school. I really want to experience a social life before things get even more strict and mundane if I head off to med school.

Yet, I want to make my family proud and get good grades in school.  But I truly feel like I missing something from my life. To be honest, I feel a little inadequate since I’m in my 20s and haven’t experienced anything exciting like my friends already have. Idk, I really I don’t want this to bug me so much so I can just focus on my studies, but I’m always being reminded on how boring or “extra” I am about school. 

Sorry I’m all over the place about  this, I just really don’t know what to do.

We have a great relationship, except for a few important things. I have anxiety and am painfully shy, but every time I try and talk about it she belittles it and essentially tries to give me a pep talk which I dont need.

A few weeks ago a close friend of mine attempte to take her own life. It put things in perspective for me, and I don't know how but I started to develop feelings for my friend.

Last weekend I ended up in hospital and this friend was amazing, bent over backwards to be there for me, soending a lot of time with me.

Now I'm on my own I miss my friend, more than my wife, which sounds terrible. I don't want to say anything to my friend because I dont want to make things awkward.

97,"So I'm at university and I adore my roommate, she's wonderful, but sometimes she makes comments that are unsettling. Her behavior is pretty normal; she works out most mornings and she eats an average diet (generally healthy and balanced diet, she eats sweets but doesn't overdo it). But she's always commenting about how she loves working out, and how she's trying to cut back on sweets, and how she would hate herself if she got fat, and how if she eats a burger she can feel the fat inside her, and she's made comments before akin to ""nothing tastes as good as skinny feels"". Any by always, I mean it's rare that a day goes by without her mentioning weight, size, or cutting back on unhealthy foods a couple times (usually when we're eating, or when we're in our room and food is brought up somehow). She said once that being fat is her worst fear, and earlier today she was measuring her (thinner than average but not unhealthily thin) waist and commenting how not-thin she was (she didn't say fat though). She's not restricting her food, and it seems like her work out schedule is no more intensive than anyone else that enjoys exercise, so I'm not dealing with pressing health concerns, but these comments she makes strike a nerve with me. There was a time when I restricted my eating and got down to an unhealthy weight, and some of the comments she makes remind me of things my mind would say to justify not eating. I'm at a normal weight now, but those thoughts do still affect me at times and I don't know if her making these comments will make things worse for me. First of all, should I be concerned about her because of these comments, or am I overreacting and she's just super healthy? Second, should I be concerned for my own mental health?

Edit: I didn't consider this before, but she's from South Africa so could this just be a cultural difference that I wasn't aware of??",12Mar2018,3
98,"I have been in a committed relationship for nearly three years now. My boyfriend, we’ll call him J, is an amazing guy who I truly do love with all of my heart. Before we started dating, I had a (probably unrequited) crush on him from afar for years, even though I didn’t really know him very well at all. This is unusual for me; romantic crushes have been very rare in my life and usually only happen when I know the person well and really trust them. Anyway, J and I became friends, the crush grew on both sides, and we finally started going out. The past three years have been amazing. J is the most caring guy in the world. He’s talented and brilliant and kind. He loves me so well. We have so much fun together and are truly best friends. We’ve talked about marriage since probably the first month of dating. I always felt that he was, without a doubt, “the one.” I know, it’s arguably a flawed concept, but you know what I mean—I felt like we would surely be together forever, he’s my person.

That is, until now.

Last semester, I met this other guy through a class we were in together. Let’s call him C. C is also talented and brilliant and kind. He’s ambitious and idealistic, and I can relate to these and really love them about C. J isn’t quite like me in that way, i guess, and C really is. Every time I’m around C, I want to stay around him. I want to talk to him, I want to listen to him, I get excited when I know I’m going to see him, sometimes I even go out of my way to see him. He gives me butterflies, and I’m not sure I ever got that with J. But also, I don’t know C nearly as deeply as I know J, and maybe this is just because C is new?

This whole thing has been eating me up lately, and I don’t know what to do or even what I want. I never thought I would feel these things for anyone but J. 

Extra info: C has a girlfriend, though they are much more casual than J and I are. I don’t really know much about their relationship though, I don’t ask and he doesn’t mention it. We actually haven’t talked about her for a couple months, so who knows if that’s still a thing. I have no idea. Anyway. More info: J and C are friends, but not very close to each other. They hang out every once in a while, but always in groups, like I am always there. 

I don’t know what to do. Like at all. If any of you are married, I’d be curious to know if you’ve had feelings for someone besides your husband/wife before and what you did about them. Or in dating relationships, too—how do I know whether to listen to these feelings or to ignore them?",12Mar2018,3
99,"so throwaway obvious reasons. 

I have had a crush on a guy named ""bob"" for a while now. We have flirted and went out on ONE date. We were co workers, and it was decided that it would be best to not continue the relationship.. A few months later we start flirting again, off and on. Talking and occasionally hanging out. It has been made clear that we are not in a relationship. Bob doesn't always respond to my text messages, even when related to work. However one day he does come to my house and we sleep together. Fast forward a few weeks and we're only speaking at work again. I had thought everything was over. No texing or hanging out at all. So another guy named ""Joe"" comes over to smoke. I don't really like Joe, he kinda makes me uncomfortable but I ignore the feelings and have him over anyways. We end up sleeping together. I didn't want to, however I didn't say no, and I realize that this is my fault. I don't speak to Joe again. A few weeks later Bob and I really really hit it off. We are hanging out a lot, talking all the time, going out. He knew Joe and I smoked but doesn't know that we slept together. But I have developed serious feelings for Bob, and I know that it would absolutely crush him if he found out about me and Joe.. I normally wouldn't tell him because we weren't in a relationship. However we DID have a ""thing."" And also Bob and Joe are starting to hang out.. I would not want Bob to hear this from Joe, it would need to come from me.

100,"I work at a grocery store, won’t name the store but there is more than 1 manager. Usually about 5-6 of them. I’ve been working here for 2 years and recently, 3-4 of my coworkers have asked me if I was thinking about moving up and being promoted. It was weird to think that some people believed that me at 19 years old would be capable to moving up, but the 3 people asked me in a span of 2 days. I thought about it, and I told myself that if one more person asks, I will look into it more and today, another coworker asks me if I want to become manager. 

I dont know if it’s a sign or something but it’s just weird that it all happened so fast. School isn’t really an option for me right now, but I think what’s bothering me the most is that if I do agree, this could be the rest of my life. Or the rest of my “teen” years.

I've lost like 4 close friends a little while ago due to this. I'm always very calm and even tempered, but I feel these drugs are causing me to become a jerk.

I am normally a very outgoing and easy type person and I feel confident in what I do so for me to be bullied for the first time and be affected by it was crippling to me and I felt powerless. 

One day, he pushed me too far and I said very hurtful things to him to the point where he went offline and told me the next day “it was a good fight we had, we’re straight now.” I don’t believe it for a fucking second, he was just taught a lesson and he chose not to mess with me again. 

To this day, I still harbor the hatred and anger for him so much. I want to physically harm him to the point of death for making me feel weak and vulnerable when I tried to be his friend.

I have a lot of ex-best friends that (I assure you) screwed me over so many times that it has made me hate human nature in general. On the daily I'll smile at people, hold doors for them, buy their meals in the fast food line, compliment them. But when I have to seriously communicate with them, get to know them, etc, I start to pull away. And when someone close hurts me, the wall immediately shoots up and suddenly I'm ready to be a hermit for the rest of my life (I already nearly am for how much alone time I indulge myself in *happily too*). I don't want to hate humanity but I'll be honest. I just do. I can't stand the selfish traits of human nature. Even the selfish traits I see in myself. And I figure all the time that I'm better off not being around people, so I close them out. 

But with how much thinking I do, I know that deep down this is some sort of defense mechanism. The only problem is that I can't seem to disengage it. I just... don't like humans. And finding grace for them is proving near impossible now more than ever.

108,"This is a long story and its full of things that don't make awesome sense, but here goes:

There's this girl I dated for almost a year (I'm a 17M btw should make that clear) and the girl left me because she turned out to be gay and left me for another girl. That sucked and hurt but we gave each other time and space and I got over it, and we've become... friends?

I say it that way because the way she treats me is confusing, and frankly a little insulting. But like... I have no right to say that I feel like and it makes me a terrible person to feel that way I'm pretty sure: this person was a victim of sexual assault 8 years ago, and its really damaged her. And she expects me to be there for her because when we were dating she told me but she didn't want to tell anyone else. Now she has told other people, including a professional, but she still feels like I'm someone she should talk to about it. And I'm more than OK with that. But the thing is... it ends up with her getting angry at me every single time. She's taking a trip to Idaho right now, and today she texted me saying how she's having panic attacks and flashbacks because ""everyone here is so sketchy"" (no offense to the good citizens of Idaho, her words not mine). I told her that I'd been to the place where she was going to be staying (she was still en-route), and that I understood that it was hard for her but that she was going to be safe there. She told me to ""leave [her] the fuck alone please and thank you"": keep in mind, she was the one who texted me...

Like on the surface, my initial reaction is that she's being awful to me and even though its hard for her I shouldn't be her punching bag. I've apologized so many times to her for stuff that wasn't my fault (if you want, ask me about the time where she made me say that I was sorry when she cheated on me thats a good one) and I'm getting so sick and tired of it that I feel like I should just tell her to ""leave me alone please and thank you"" when she comes back and tries to get me to tell her how sorry I am so that we can be friends again. She's done this to me 3 times now in the last month and I'm starting to feel like maybe it's not my fault for once.

On the other hand... am I being a total asshole? Because I feel like one. I feel like she comes to me because she's desperate for help and I say the wrong things because I'm just some guy who has no idea what he's doing, and that hurts her and makes it worse. And I mean even though we're not dating and I (most certainly at this particular juncture) don't have feelings for her anymore, I still care about her. Like despite her doing this sometimes, she's a decent person who deserves to be happy and is going through a lot. I really try to be a nice guy and I want her to feel not afraid because the way she sees the world, theres an attacker around literally every corner and if theres anything I can do for her I want to. But I just don't know if I can keep this up or if I even should. 

The biggest problem with just torching the bridge is that I go to a tiny school where my grade is 23 people, one of them being her. We have to be in close contact basically every time we're at school. And we have a lot of mutual friends who, if things went nuclear, would side with her under literally any circumstance, no matter what the actual facts were (some of them already have she's sicked them on me after blowing what I did out of proportion). Plus it would make me feel awful because underneath all this, she's my friend, and I don't like burning friendships if I can help it.

Just... man this was incoherent. If anyone made sense of this, I'd love some advice on what the hell should I do. I made her sound evil but she's not, just she does stuff like this sometimes. If there's any clarification needed, feel free to ask. Thanks!",12Mar2018,4

112,"It seems like not too long ago I had everything I'd wanted in life. I was popular, had two amazing best friends and was also making 2k a month from YouTube. Unfortunately, it seemed that more often than not my so called amazing friends would either talk behind my back, hang out with each other and disregard me as the third wheel of the trio. Although there were a lot of people that supported me, I was hurt by my friends and decided to delete all social media except Instagram, where I deleted all my posts. Snapchat was rid of, and this is where all the shit began. 

Around ~80% of the people I had added (and that was a lot, a few hundred to be exact) had thought I'd blocked them after I deleted my account. Not only did people stop liking me for such a silly reason, I also started hanging out with the more ""geeky"" people. I'm not trying to sound like an asshole, but losing all the friends and connections you had to only then start hanging with people who watch diehard anime was not very appealing to me. 

Now, recently I came back to snapchat &amp; I no longer have the friends I used to. The other two friends I had hang out with only each other now, and it kind of hurts to see it; but I also know it's my fault since I stopped talking to them willingly. I look a lot worse than I used to, and only now realize that I'm suddenly socially awkward! I can't talk to girls the way I used to, and most conversations are utterly difficult to keep with me.

My YouTube channel got shut down as well, so I have no more money and my bank is at -300. Sometimes I feel so lonely.

If you are wondering, I am currently fourteen. Guess it's not the end of the world but I feel like I'm in a dark place right now. I'm not the lovable and friendly guy I used to be. Just some ugly fucking socially awkward mess.",12Mar2018,2
114,"Where does someone that went through school with no friends, never got to develop social skills, never had a girlfriend, never even had acquaintances, begin? I just want to know where do I begin. I've searched this forum for advice, searched the internet, YouTube videos, I've read books like Carnegie's. Literally none of this applies to me, every one of those pieces of information is aimed at people who are normal already. Not for me. I'm even afraid that no one here can help me, as I'm just too neurodivergent.

I'm 22 and in college. I get approached by people, so I guess that makes me approachable? I must not be too ugly, or smelly, or boring. So if people are approaching me they must be interested for whatever reason, right? I try to be social but I can't. The conversation either becomes an interview (they ask/speak and I passively reply), or an awkward silence is followed by the other person leaving. I feel that I might already be hated, or though of as an arrogant individual, due to my social inhability.

I really want to change, I'm ready to do whatever it takes. My reasoning is that if I become social and people hate me, I will end up right where I started so nothing is lost. But if I don't at least try to change I might as well kill myself. And if I can't change I might as well kill myself.",12Mar2018,13
115,"In general, could the parents on reddit tell me if it is a bad idea to call one's parents for comfort and consolation? 

I would say I'm at probably the lowest point of my college career at the moment. I've been getting bouts of debilitating anxiety and have been crying nonstop because nothing in life is working out at the moment. I'm incredibly stressed and I want more than anything to be comforted by the people who know me best, my parents. HOWEVER, my parents have been through enough. I was a difficult kid, especially in high school when my mental health was significantly worse. My parents already worry for me so much, as parents do, that I don't want to add to it. I've even seen my strong-ass, testosterone heavy dad secretly cry after he dropped me off from the airport last year. Plus, they have to deal with my sibling in high school, who is also going through a stressful time. 

When I left home for this semester, I left with a huge smile on my face and made sure my parents knew I was a very health, happy kid (I wasn't lying, my mind was genuinely relaxed back then). I did my best to make sure they were at ease about my future. So I guess this is my dilemma: should I leave them with their ignorant bliss so they can concentrate on my younger sibling, or should I call them and vent? I love my parents to death and it pains me to think about how selfish it would be to cause them stress and worry. However, my mental state is also giving me a lot of pain.

123,"I don’t really know where to start with this. Back in September I started university in the city over from mine. The city is close enough that it would probably take me an hour or two to get there from my parents house, and I have a girlfriend in the city too who said I could stay. But me being an idiot and wanting the “uni experience” I decided to get accommodation. I started to rent this nice place in the city. I paid for the first 4 months up front and countless letting fees (literally my entire maintenance loan) and I was planning on moving in. Things happened such as my dog passing away, issues with work and me just spending every night at my girlfriends anyway. So I didn’t stay at this accommodation at all. I kind of forgot I even had a place there. But come December I realised I needed to move out. I emailed the letting company to tell them that I planned to move out. They agreed to put the place back on the market. But that id have to pay a £200 fee. That was fine and me being an idiot I believed that was it, I didn’t realise I’d have to pay rent anymore. I’d simply have to pay the fee and I’d be out. I told them to email me to let me know what’s going on. I went nearly two months without an email until I simply got one saying “you have one month outstanding rent” I replied and said I’d pay it back. But I then emailed to see if there was any information on when I’d be able to leave. I mentioned that when looking for the accommodation I could not find any property. So I assumed somewhat naively that they had already found a replacement. But when I asked they simply told me the place was put back on the market again. I looked for it later and found a listing was put up for the property literally that day. March 8th. Despite being promised the place would be back on the market back in December. Which to me means there has been a whole 3 month period wasted. Where instead of looking for my replacement they decided they would just take some first year uni student for a ride and force me to pay rent for a property I have not spent one night in. Before anyone thinks I’m trying to get out of paying. I’m perfectly happy to pay money that I owe. I just feel like I’ve been conned and they haven’t bothered to look for a replacement. I have proof both that the property only recently got listed and of proof that the company promised to put the property back on the market in December. ",12Mar2018,2

127,"Basically, far as I've seen, women just don't make good friends for men. The men usually end up getting feelings. The women usually don't really offer much. It's just, you always have to walk on egg shells around women, I can't be friends with someone I can't even fucking be me around, but you can't just be yourself around women, not even for friendship, yourself just ain't good enough. 

Problem is, I think most people only date via social circles, and, I really don't want to sink back into dehumanizing women, that was a dark, evil place for me to go, I really don't wanna go back.

131,"So I was in a relationship with my first real girlfriend, let’s call her Stacey, for nearly three years. We met and had been dating for a year prior to that. I’m 22 and we just broke up Feb 1st on good terms. At first I was heart broken but I soon realized exactly how much she had been holding me back. I was changing myself to make her happy. 
She was very religious and I am only slightly. Because of that, she never wanted to have sex, do drugs, swear, etc. while I didn’t mind any of the above except for obviously hard drugs. 

Anyway, in the time that followed I tried weed, and I foot every once in a while. I also will finally be having sex one day here soon. But here’s where I need advice. 

I was using tinder and found three girls, two of which didn’t respond too much and therefore the other was the one I spent more time getting to know. Well turns out, after a while the other two started really responding and getting Interested in me. So I need your help. How do you decide who is right for you?

Girl #1: MEGA kinky. Seriously won’t stop talking about sex and being dirty and it’s actually amazing. Perfect for me. Looks are 6/10 but she’s got a great personality. Also age 25. She’s really into drinking and weed. Like really into it. Not sure how I feel about that. But she’s coming to stay the night tomorrow :)
She seems very emotional in a good way. She’s fun to talk to and be around. she’s been sexting me the entire week during her Hawaii vacation. From things she’s said it seems like she does not want me to be with other girls. She said she’s getting feelings for me and I am too. But I’m also having doubts, mainly cause of my other options here. 

Girl #2: age 18, looks straight up gorgeous 9.5/10 she’s into sexual stuff but not by several miles compared to the first girl. I haven’t met her yet but she seems really sweet but also texts are slightly emotionless? Still trying to get to know her but she says she’s super into me. Seeing her on Thursday. Also drinks and does weed. Sends me the sexiest pics I’ve ever gotten. She really doesn’t exhibit much emotion and says she was scared to actually go out with me the first couple times we planned, and stood me up. But i seemed to have changed her mind after a good talk. We’ll see if she ends up following through. Also super into dogs and so am I. 

Girl #3: seems really sweet, tattooed like crazy, I definitely know her the least, but also down for sex and weed and seems pretty cool. Her parents actually grow it in Oregon and her brother deals it. Age 22 looks 7/10 coming over Wednesday maybe? Also has a dog. 




Okay I know that’s a lot of info. But I obviously haven’t been in the dating scene for a long time. Am I doing this wrong? I don’t know what I got myself into and I don’t want to get too attached to someone and just drop them. What does the normal dating scene look like? I don’t wanna fuck this up. I am the kind of person who needs a relationship. Haha

Me: Concerned friend. I’ve been dropping hints for over 2 months that she needs to go to the gyno and that the smell is curable with just some medicine. The smell is so intense that I️ have to leave the room she is in sometimes when she spreads her legs. It’s not normal and she knows it.

Yesterday: I️ had a real, genuine convo with her in person about it and it went a bit like this.
“Why the hell would I️ go a doctor when I know my body and there’s nothing wrong with me?”
I️ tell her nothing is wrong with her, it’s just the healthy thing to do for herself. Long term infections or STDS can translate into PID or infertility and I️ just want her to be safe. I️ tell her I️ care about her and wouldn’t tell her this if I️ wasn’t trying to be a good friend. She goes on and says I’ll go when I️ need to, and I️ don’t need to right now. Money isn’t an issue for her either, I️ just don’t understand why she just can’t get this treated.

I️ feel awful. I️ never want to hurt anyone’s feelings so that’s why I️t took so long for me to even bring this up. I️ know it’s her body, her choice, but I️ can’t let her do this to herself when I️ know there’s a problem. I️ don’t know what to do.",12Mar2018,1
133,"Please excuse the typos because Im trying my best to steady my hands but it is now working. 

Also, warning my dream is very graphic.

It starts with me being at a party. I keep throwing up this weird black goo but no-one notices. I do this about 3 times.Finally, I tell my friend that Im leaving but she says no, stay there is a bathroom down the hall.

I walk into the bathroom and it is very strange. It is very blank and empty. The walls are made of a cushion material and are white. The floor is made of whit tile. The only thing in the bathroom is a tub filled with water. The faucet is on slightly, and drops of water fall one by one making a drip, drip sound. 

I climb into the tub fully cloth but when my body is fully submerged in the water, I am naked. The warm water is so relaxing that I fall asleep. I dont knw how much time pass, but when I open my eyes their is a guy sitting on the edge of the bathtub. He hands me a razorblade. “You know you want to”, he say, “its time to free yourself.”

I take the razor blade and press it deep down my wrist, then slide. I do this on both arms, leaving gallons of blood flowing from the deep gashes . They look like waterfalls of blood.

I dive in an out of consciousness and sink into the bathtub. It feels like Im drowning and bleeding out at the same time. I sink further and further. It feels like Im in the ocean and a anchor is dragging me under.

Untill I see hands. They grab on me and pull me out the tub. I feel barely alive at that point. Blood is stil pourng out of me. The guy lays me on the floor, gets on top of me,and rapes me. I try to yell, but I only end up throwing up water so he covers my mouth.

As he thrust in and out I can feel mysel dying. My life flashes before my eyes. From birth, to childhood, to the moment now. Before I know it, he is done with me and leaves the room but not before turning off the light. Im in the dark but I want to get out. I cant move. It is like im superglued to the floor. 


I spend the last few moments of strength I have trying to get unstuck from the floor, yelling “Help me! Somebody please! Help!”

Last year I had three friends die. One, was shot. One, committed suicide and that was around September of last year. Then October rolled around and my best friend since the 6th grade died in a car accident on mine and my fiancé’s anniversary. He was buried three days later on my birthday. Yesterday I found out another friend of mine committed suicide. And not even ten minutes ago I found out a co worker and friend also took his own life. 

I have had to deal with death maybe twice ever before these deaths. I feel like everyone around me keeps dying. I guess I came here looking for a little more than “we are praying for you”.

135,"So I'll start during my first year of University. I was on an Engineering course, along with a friend who I'll call John. We had a larger friendship group, but he was easily my closest friend. We could talk for hours about politics, history, foreign films, etc. John was in a relationship with Sarah, who I was living with in a shared house, which meant John was around a lot, which was great, as we got along well. John was like a brother to me, and Sarah a sister. 

After a year of living with them, my 4 year relationship ended. I'd been suffering from severe depression since the start of my first year of University which contributed to me ending the relationship as I was very unhappy and suicidal. Thankfully, with support from my family I started to recover, and it's been a slow process but things are a lot better. That relationship ended in June, so I had a whole summer with Sarah and John and we bonded strongly. So now the background is done.

I get a phone call from John. John has gone through Sarah's messages on Facebook using her password and without her permission, and finds that she has been sending explicit messages to a guy I'll call Adam. Upon finding those messages, John is very hurt, and I head back to house to find what can only be described as carnage. Sarah's there too, and John has thrown her phone out of the window, cut up her clothes, smashed her Xbox and destroyed her laptop. Me and my other housemates decide we need to separate them, and as John and I are so close we leave the house while my other housemates comfort Sarah. 

That's where John tells me about the explicit conversations Sarah and Adam were having, how they referenced them having sex previously, etc. And then John tells me that he wasn't angry when destroying the stuff. He knew what we has doing. None of his stuff was damaged, he targeted things she loved to cause her as much pain as he was feeling. It was calculated. Alarm bells should have been ringing, but he was my friend and so was she, so I tried to be there for both of them, giving up what time I could when either needed me.

Fast forward, and John ends up in a destructive cycle, then back with Sarah, then they break up again, and then back together and then they break up again, and any time they have broken up Sarah is running to Adam. This was all going on based around our shared house, with me and my housemates trying to study for our upcoming exams and causing a lot of stress and anxiety for us all. We decide, and tell Sarah, that we on the house are not comfortable with John staying around at night anymore after everything that has happened. If she wants him around during the day then okay, but John was spending almost all of his time at ours when they were together. She was okay with this. 

While all this is going on as well, John and I have been meeting up and chatting. He tells me more and more about the relationship, about how the whole relationship was based on the foundation of he wanted sex and she knew he had money. Going through my head at this time was ""well, if he's being this open about it maybe he's turning a new leaf. He is my friend and was there for me through my breakup, I should give him the benefit of the doubt. He genuinely seems like this has changed him and he's learning from those mistakes."" He tells me that he was psychologically abusive, during arguments he would focus on completely tearing her down to win the argument rather than constructively deal with things. Again, I think okay, he's surely learning from his mistakes.

John and Sarah are apart for some time. Sarah and Adam go on holiday, Adam's treat, to Spain. On the day Sarah is due back to the house, she arrives not with Adam, but with John. I try asking John if he wants to talk, and try a couple of times to arrange for just us getting out of the house to chat, as he was looking like he was staying around for a long time again. Both times, he blows me off after saying he would. At this point me and my other housemates are frustrated and our patience is wearing thin, and we believe this is only going to end badly, and so I swing a message to Adam asking if he knows what's up.

Adam replies saying he has no idea that John is with Sarah, and I arrange to meet up with him so we can both try and get a clear picture (I had only seen John's side, not Adam's so I thought getting a more well rounded perspective might have helped). Adam and I chat for a couple of hours, and when Adam realises the extent of what's been happening he decides to tell Sarah that he's done and nothing will ever happen between them again. John then messages me saying he doesn't appreciate me going behind his back, but I just shrug this off. John is still with Sarah.

About a month later I've moved out, and I get a message from Adam. We've become friends at this point so have been chatting from time to time, but in this message Adam is expressing concern about physical abuse by John to Sarah. I have a screenshot of the message Sarah sent Adam, but she's basically saying that she is not allowed to talk to Adam anymore (even though they are on the same University course and trying to still be friends) because she likes having her fingers unbroken. Adam tells me that Sarah has already been hurt by John a few days before when he was trying to delete stuff from her phone and she tried to get it back off him. Adam and I don't know what to do, but I message Sarah and just say that I hope she's okay and please stay safe, and Adam encourages her to get away from the abuse. This transpired back in August. I haven't talked to or seen John since, because I realised that he hadn't changed. He'd fallen right back into a pattern of abuse and I was struggling with my own depression and now this was causing a large amount of anxiety. Last I heard John and Sarah were no longer together, she ended it for good.

These events have been some of the most scarring events of my life. I still have issues processing it all, and struggle to deal with my closest friend being abusive to his now ex. It makes me feel physically sick knowing that someone I was so close with, someone I gave up so much time to be there for through all this, would fall right back into physical abuse to a partner. And worst of all, I feel like I gave up on him. I feel guilty for letting it all end how it did, even though I know it was the right move for my own sanity and mental/emotional well-being. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to deal with it.

137,"I’ve been chasing my dream for the past 8 years finally got my dream job last year but wound up laid off because my work wasn’t good enough. For the past 6 months I’ve tried to get back on track and nothings working. Let me start from the beginning. Right after I graduated high school(2010) I went to LA for a recording school I used to wanna be a music producer. By the end of my school stint(2012) I wound up working on a couple of student films doing sound effects editing/designing and decided to pursue a career in filmsound. Yea I know what you’re thinking hollywood isn’t guaranteed career but listen to my story because I got a lot further than I thought I would.

After I graduated got my first internship working on a low budget creature feature(its on Netflix btw its called Spiders). I loved working on films from that experience alone which I also did for free. But those first two years after school I struggled to freelance obviously I have no experience it was expected. So I got jobs so I could stay in LA and work projects on the side and network my way into a Post Production sound studio which took me about 3 years btw. 3 years of hard work and shitty jobs being a janitor, working in warehouses, working at a call center, in customer service and finally at the US Postal Service (during christmas time btw I don’t recommend that). Until I finally got the opportunity of a lifetime in December of 2016 a small studio wanted me to base there as a contractor. It was a dream come true literally because this studio’s main focus was animated tv shows and when I was a kid I used to want to be a cartoonist but then I got bored with drawing as I got older around middle school.

Anyways, so this studio was an emmy award winning studio that does sound effects and design for networks like disney, nickelodeon, amazon and netflix. I, myself used to work on two disney shows and also an adult swim show. To get to the point I started officially working for them in Feb 2017 and was let go in Sept 2017. To be honest I don’t blame anyone but myself and I think thats where the depression sets in. I really did try my hardest by pulling all nighters, working 8-12hr days and making sure my work was detail oriented not just to make sure I did things correctly but also cuz I loved working there. This was the first job I had without a toxic environment or management. There was always communication and they were always willing to teach me. They even said they’d give me a recommendation when they let me go aint that some shit. To be honest tho just seemed like no matter how hard I worked or how smart, organized and efficient I tried to work there was always something wrong. There are a lot of factors for example: sometimes producers and directors want certain things to sound very specific in certain shows and it just seemed like I did better on the adult swim show rather than the disney shows. I guess raunchy comedy is kinda my schtick.

However, since I was laid off I’ve been trying my hardest to get back in that world and unfortunately had to move back in with my dad (he got sick with a bad strain of pneumonia at the same time of losing my job go fucking figure). Its kinda been soul crushing at times where I can’t get a project to save my life and also watch my pops lose 30-50lbs and be sicker than I’ve ever seen him. I can’t even get an office admin job to save my life which I actually have two years worth of experience in. I’m also sick of everyone telling me to just take what ever job I can get. Like I get it some ppl don’t get as many opportunities as I do but I also know taking those jobs will just crush my soul even more and I’m sick of being in those dark places and toxic environments. Like i don’t need some exclusive ass job I’m just sick of ppl thinking they can treat me like shit when they get a little management power. Some family members have offered me to be a security guard and no disrespect to yaw but if something went down I ain’t fina do a damn thing lol im sorry my life aint worth a check. I guess I also hate how basically everyone is telling me to forget the last 6-8 years of my hard work and struggle and just go work at in n out or mcds. It just makes me feel like whats the point? If I did all of that hardwork and I lay it out to get myself an ok receptionist/office gig wtf is the point of all of this shit? I at least want to make enough to pay off some debt and maybe travel a lil bit while saving money. 

Idk what to expect from this post maybe I’m just venting, but I do still feel lost and I’ve been considering giving up on this dream but Idk if I could forgive myself if I do. Only other subject thats really caught my interest is software development I know theres jobs for that especially since I live in norcal(sacramento to be exact). I’ve been researching it over the past couple of weeks to see if its a viable option or if I’m just doing this out of fear. I just don’t know how much freedom you have with that. Also Idk if I’d go back to school or what for that. School seems like such an expensive thing nowadays im not trying to drown in debt i want to travel the world. 

Btw for the past 6 months I’ve been doing a combination of door dash, freelance film sound work from home and applying to jobs when I can. Unfortunately I haven’t gotten any callbacks and my resumé is updated. I’m trying to make sure my applications/emails goto actual ppl instead of general email inboxes. 

What do you think I should do? I’ve literally been waking up everyday asking myself what do I want out of life and I can’t come up with an answer.",12Mar2018,2

140,"Hi everyone!

For anonymity I will refer to my friend with the fake name Kate.

Kate and I have been friends for at least 5 years and I would consider her one of my closest friends, probably my best friend, but we go to universities that are far apart. Kate, her roommate, and I all went to the same high school, and I've known her roommate since middle school but we were never close friends. To get straight to the point, Kate's roommate constantly barrages her with texts and messages and lays out all her problems onto her. Kate has sent me screenshots of her text history with her roommate and her roommate is seriously crazy. In fact, Kate literally just yesterday deactivated her ""find my friends"" on her iphone because her roommate stalked her on it to see where she was, and Kate told me she was at her other friend's room ""hiding"" from her roommate.

I've asked Kate multiple times to talk to her roommate about it and try to work something out, but she always tells me she doesn't want to be rude or doesn't have a good reason to. She's even going to room with her again next year because she told me she didn't have ""good reason"" to say no to her. 

But she also always tells me how much her roommate annoys her. She has had anxiety attacks and sometimes goes to sleep in her friends' rooms because she can't fall asleep in her own dorm room. At least twice a week she tells me that she's losing her sanity or that she's feeling depressed. I always tell her I'm there for her and I'm there to listen to her, but she says that nobody can do anything about it and talking to people about it doesn't help so she doesn't want to talk about it. 

So what I'm thinking is to just fb message Kate's roommate with something like:

""Hey _____, can we talk? And can you please not mention this to Kate? Kate doesn't want to seem rude to you but I think you might be overwhelming her with texts and messages and everything. She's been having a rough time lately with school and she's talked to me about how your constant texts are driving her a little crazy. Could you try to slow down and give her a little more space? I just want the best for her.""  

Do you all have any opinions or advice? I really do just want the best for Kate and it stresses me out that she doesn't want to do anything about her situation. She has definitely become more irritable and distant and I'm really concerned for her. Thank you!",12Mar2018,2
141,"Sorry if this is long and confusing. I'm not really sure how to describe this. I occasionally have nightmares and they're usually pretty normal ones (danger, fears, etc.) but the other night, I woke up panicked like I had just had a nightmare, but I didn't, it was just a random dream. However, as I sat there awake, something just felt wrong. I ignored it and went back to sleep. I woke up a short while later, again having dreamt but not a nightmare. This time I felt a very strong sense that something was very wrong. I immediately called my family to make sure everything was okay since I hadn't spoken to them in a couple of days, but they were fine, as were all my close friends. It's safe to say that this is the most scared I've ever felt for an extended period of time. I had to sleep with all of my lights on to even feel well enough to fall back asleep. Since that night, I continue to feel this wrong feeling, especially when I'm home, where my roommates are all gone for spring break and I'm alone. I don't believe in the supernatural, but this is really freaking me out. Any advice on how to get rid of this feeling?",12Mar2018,2
142,"Just a solution to a relationship problem (? Not so much a problem as a semi disagreeable/agreeable desire). My boyfriend and I both know people who we both like. He brings up the idea of threesomes, but we never seriously try to do anything because I’m a bit “asexual” when it comes to people outside of my partner, and really just people in general. I am of course sexually attracted to people, but I have no desire to actually have sex with them, the idea, and vision of them is nice, but not the physical aspect of sex. 

I was thinking perhaps a solution to this issue would be to, as a unit, “date” someone, but without sexual aspect. Flirting, light touching (hands, thigh, kiss), sure. Maybe even swap light lewds (we run a blog like this together, so it’s not odd for us aside from the fact it would be privately shared). Just a way for us to have a bit of fun with the person(s) we like, without overstepping boundaries.

Is this doable? Normal? I feel like it seems impossible to do in a hook up culture and might, worse case, spiral out of control into cheating, not on my end though of course. I’m fine with not doing it, as well as not doing anything about our shared attraction to mutual friends (several of whom definitely recipocrate, so don’t worry I’m not jumping ahead of myself), but just an idea I had that could be a midway point. Just asking for advice on what other people may think. Neither of us has slept with anyone aside each other and our exes, and have only had long relationships. We’ve never engaged in any short term dating or hookups, so we’re not sure how these types of things work. I’m not sure if it matters much but I should say we practically live together, just not officially yet, just as a way to set the tone of how serious the relationship is.",12Mar2018,1

Couldn't sleep and when ever I stopped occupying myself with things. My thoughts became a mess. I found comfort in eatting but later decided to start working out. I became obsessed with it.

I've recently gotten a cough from cardio runs.  I guess what I'm looking for is advice on how to control this.

147,"I’m sorry about any formatting errors. I’m on my phone.

Last Friday night, I was calling my friends on Discord. I was having fun with them and counting down the hours til midnight, when my birthday started. A few minutes after midnight, I remember hearing my mom jolt in her chair, so I turned around. She looked at me with an angry expression and threw her arms up in the air and said, “What?!”. Honestly, I didn’t pay it much mind. I just went back to talking to my friends. A minute later, she started yelling. She asked me, “What, are you roleplaying again?” Thats something I do often; its fun to make stories with friends and less time consuming than writing my own. I said no, I was on Instagram. I was- I was using my phone for Instagram and my laptop for calling. She then asked me why I was awake so late. I said it was because I wanted to count down to my birthday, and that I didn’t have anything going on in the morning anyway. She went silent for a moment, then began yelling: “You want something to do then?! GET OUT. NO, I’M SERIOUS. GET OUT.” I got scared and immediately got up to pack a bag. She followed me to my room and kept yelling at me. She asked/yelled why my sleeping schedule was so bad, why don’t I clean my room, I don’t listen to her, etc. When I said there was no excuse, she accused me of not being sincere. I don’t know what I was supposed to say. Should I have made up some bullshit? There isn’t an excuse. Afterwards, I went and hid in the bathroom until she went to sleep. 

In the morning, we didn’t say a word to each other. I canceled the bday party I had planned, but my friends (bless them) came and surprised me anyway. I spent the day with them. I don’t regret it. I really didn’t want to talk to her, because I was mad she tried to kick me out of the house 20 minutes after it became legal (i’m 16) and made me cry for a good two hours. When I got home, she didn’t talk to me. She just went straight to sleep. 

About the party; before I cancelled it, my mom had been helping with the food planning. Specifically, I asked her to help order pizza and make lumpia. She didn’t want to make the lumpia because it was too much work, and she later gave me money to buy my own pizza. I did all the preparation by myself. 

Sunday morning, I woke up to a looong message in the family group chat. She was/is upset that her and my dad weren’t invited to my party (they were- when there was one), that I spent it all with my friends, when were they going to have a chance to celebrate with me, etc. She asked me who I was; was I just a renter in their house? how long was it going to be until I moved in with my friends?. She asked me if we were even family anymore. 

When I was finally brave enough to talk to her that afternoon, she wouldn’t even look at me. When I finally got her attention, she just turned halfway, crossed her arms like a child, and glared. I tried to explain my actions. I said that I didn’t want to celebrate with her because I was upset she yelled and tried to kick me out on my birthday, and that I don’t want to celebrate with her until she’s done being mad. I said that I cancelled the party because I was too upset to party, and that she didn’t seem interested in attending anyway. She went off on me again, saying how lumpia was too hard to make and that it was easier for me to buy the pizza myself. It felt like she wasn’t really listening to me, only waiting to speak. Basically, the conversation turned into her explaining why she is mad at me. She said she felt no connection to me, or my dad. I mentioned her yelling at me, and that we should probably get family counseling, but she didn’t reply. She just kept complaining about the stupid lumpia. 

At that point, I gave up. After my dad left (he’s deploying for a month and a half) my mom went with her to help load his luggage, I moved all of my homework, my bag and laptop into my room so that I wouldn’t have to spend time in the living room. Haha, I even brought food and water in with me. We haven’t spoken beyond “hi, go eat, bye” since Sunday evening. 

This afternoon, I came home from school to cupcakes sitting on the counter. She didn’t say anything about them, just that I should go eat. I don’t know what to do. Is she trying to apologize? What do I say? 

I’m still angry at her, but its just us for the next month and a half. Whether I like it or not, I cant just ignore her, 

Please help.

158,"Hey guys! 
I’ve got a mini conundrum. So, I’m currently 17 and will be 18 this December. For my graduation trip, my parents are paying for my trip to the States. My mother is coming, but the issue is she gets ill for a long period of time whenever she is fautigued e.g the aircon was too cold when she was sleeping and didn’t recover until two months. So I proposed I go alone and my mother accepted, which made me very excited. Then I call my dad (because he’s overseas) and he says I can’t because it’s too dangerous. 
Dangerous. Now, if I were going to a third world country with poor safety standards, I would understand. But this is Los Angeles and San Francisco. Yes, I will be a female travelling alone —but I think America is a pretty safe bet for solo travel, especially for such a touristy area. I am aware LA has some unsavoury areas —but so does every other major city. The closest one to me, Sydney Australia, is the same. Yet with this logic I am not allowed to go alone. I do have experience with solo travel, I lived in Japan for five months with a host family —very safe country, my mum’s Japanese so that was fine. And I’m thinking the U.S is next on my list, and I really want to go alone. Additionally, my mother agrees with me and says she will pay for my ticket and he’ll ‘just have to get over it’. But that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth because I really hate it when he’s angry. So, reddit how can I assure my father I’ll be fine?

161,"I got a message on facebook about an hour ago from a girl saying she found me from my response on her Craigslist ad. I was somewhat confused and concerned since I rarley browse Craigslist and never actually reach out to sellers. At first I had assumed someone was using my email, but this felt odd that the person would track me down onto facebook.
So I curiously asked what the ad was for and she told me that it was an ad seeking for someone to basically sleep with her and her boyfriend. [No judgement on my side]
She sent me the email that claimed to be, used my real name, had false information about explicit body parts, and three actual photos of me signed off with my real name. Upon further look I relized that two of the photos were from my Snapchat, one a long while back, and the other around august. So someone had screenshoted these and kept them for safe keeping for a while now. The girl is currently seeing if she can get a phone number or actual email from this person but I'm curious if theres any actions I can take.
A way to trace this? Or do something about it?
I have to say that I'm genuinely freaked someone would put this much effort and time into something that seems so silly. 
However, I did have a previous abusive ex that I fear may he the culpret and I'm geinunly terrified.

Now since we've been friends for as long as we have been, naturally she's shared a lot of things with me in confidence. Including at least three times she's cheated on her current bf, who I've always liked. However when it came to the cheating I always gave her my unbiased opinion on all of it because I was a good friend. I tried helping her with what I believed to be the core cause of her cheating, her insecurity and lack of feeling desired. Yet the lack of any meaningful apology has made me realize that she never really cared about anything that I did for her.  As a result for the past few days the only mental thought I have when I think of this situation is ""Tell her bf everything. You should care more about how this affects him than how it affects her. You don't give a fuck about how it affects her because she was fine leaving you to feel like this.""

I'm not hoping to gain anything from it. I realize that I want her to hurt much more than I am. I don't plan on talking to her or her bf after I reveal the truth and trust me he'll believe everything I tell him without a doubt, even if she tries to convince him it's a lie. There's no possible scenario where he doesn't believe me because I have solid, undeniable proof.

176,"(Note: I'm not from the west)

I used to be really socially awkward when I was a kid. I had very few friends when I was young. In high school, I tend to prefer one-on-one friendships as I am introverted.

Now that I am at uni, I have been working on my social skills. I was socially awkward when I first started uni. I tend to have the same classes with the same people in my major. I then became depressed. I got bad grades and failed some courses. 

Now that I am feeling better, I don't know what to do. I've been working really hard to make new friends and I only end up with acquaintances. Most people in my major have already formed their own social circles so they are not exactly open to the idea of me joining them no matter how much small talk I've done with them. Almost all of the girls in my major/class are taken so I guess they are less interested in pursuing a BFF-type friendship than me.

I've reached out to people at club events and dorm. I did end up knowing a lot of people and can easily engage in small talk with them. People never reach out back to me though. At the end, I only end up with acquaintances. At some point, even the friendly ones will decline my offer to hang out with them or catch up with them.

I don't know why it is so difficult for me to make friends. I've had people tell me they really enjoy talking to me, and a week later, they never talk to me again and ignore my text messages when I try to reach out to them.

It's not like I dislike being single but I just want companionship. I know that older single people often feel lonely when all the people they know are married or taken, but damn, I am feeling this at the age of 20. I don't think I've ever met a guy interested in me but this may have something to do with my social skills. I feel like everyone else has moved on in life except me.

As for my grades, they are really bad as I have failed a couple of courses. I tried applying for summer internships this year and got rejected from all of them. I feel like it is too late to do anything as I am already a junior.

Tl;Dr: I am a junior at uni and feel so hopeless after depression/withdrawing from other people/failing some courses.

I really need some help with my friend. For some context we are both in a final year of high school and have our exams in May before we both go to university. However, over the past year they has been in arguments with their parents who made them see a therapist about their weight and ever since, they have trusted their parents less and less. However, after gaining back the weight she lost before they are still unhappy with her and constantly arguing with them and saying that they don't want to let them go to university. Whenever they call me and vent to me about their problem I never know what to do or say. I feel as though I should tell the counsellor at school or I wonder if I should try speak to their parents about it (I am quite close to them). However, I know that if I were to do this my friend would accuse me backstabbing them and I know that it would only add up to the stress that they are currently facing. I really want to help them but I have no clue what to do and whenever they call I feel helpless. They constantly mention how they want their parents to know how they feel (they think they are doing it for attention) and they make jokes about killing themselves to end it all. I know that they think they are fine though so I don't think they would ever go through with it but the whole conundrum is causing me stress and I feel like a horrible friend for not knowing what to do.

Around half a year ago, I met some new friend. We really got along and also hung out together.
We eventually decided to take a weekend trip to Spain once and this is where some of her true characteristics showed. She wanted to leave MCDonalds because there  was a policemen present just eating his burger, at the airport she ignored the policemen and wanted me to talk to him because she refuses to talk to policemen.
She thinks all of the police are secret nazis and wishes the police gets banned.

She also thinks that the Antifa robbing shops and vandalizes is good since someone has to suffer ""in order to make the world better""

I usualy brush those comments off with  ""let's not talk about it and rather enjoy the day"".

But last week something  happened.
She started talking with my brothe about League of Legends and Overwatch. She commented that supposedly almost all guys make fun of her  that she plays these games and how the character of Overwatch are better because they have more diversity  and aren't as sexualized als in LoL.

Somehow she then turned this  into a feminism conversation.
I mostly just sat there  and listened and then when they were talking about radical emberassing feminists, I thought  I might show a fun video about some woman that harrased a man and accused him of sexual harrasement just because he said ""Hello"" to there.
Seems like that was a big mistake, but I didn't know this then.

This whole debate about feminist topic continued and eventually I said "" STOP! stop, stop, stoooop. We met up to look at the pictures of our trip together, please no politics anymore.""
Time flew by and we didn't  have time to look at them anymore and and only casually chatted for aroubd 30 minutes before I drove her home.

I texted her 3 times the last week and always only got cold  responses. I confronted her about it and then she flipped saying that my behaviour  aa shitty and that it was disrespecting playing that""feminazi"" video on Youtube, that I screamed at her ( I swear I didn't) and she doesn't  know how to handle my attitude and is doubting  our friendship.
I tried to explain myself but now she doesn't  respond  anymore.

I always had a lot of fun with her and she got also along with  my other friends. But now I am not sure if this friendship has a chance anymore. I have to admit that her political views and always bringing them up make me uncomfortable. I always could look past it but now I have some doubts...

188,I applied for two digital marketing agencies (actually 3) of which 2 already called me back today. The first guy offered me a part time gig. and the second offered me an internship. Both of which are good enough. Now how do I deal with the second agency? They are expecting a reply from me. What should I tell him? The second agency's interview is tomorrow and the first guy who reached me would like to have a meeting with me this Thursday. I need help!

190,"So this girl and I used to date a while ago. We stopped it but we still kinda remained in touch...last night she texted me at around 4am saying ""hey i just had a threesome""....I am actually not sure how to react on this. I was mad entire day - i couldn't focus and i wasn't myself. It's like a guilt i feel but there is nothing bad to feel about...also feeling of missing out is present as well...

I am at work now, hopefully that feeling will change, but i am not sure how to react anymore and do i have to text her or what to tell her...i  am just confused how doesn't she know that there are things people don't need to know about...ignorance is bliss

I don't argue with them anymore, i do my house work and i try to be very nice kid in their eyes..

But no, today my mom started yelling at me : YOU ARE A PIECE OF SHIT, YOU WILL NEVER MAKE IT, YOU ARE TOO OLD FOR SCHOOL, FIND A JOB YOU LOSER ''

I've been on like 50 job interviews so far, i'm very attractive tall guy, i'm social and people seem to like me wherever i go, but i never pass job interviews... i don't know why and it's hella annoying.

I was 2 years in vocational high school for security officers in Finland, i never liked it and i hated it with all my heart, so i dropped out. It was a mistake since i went there randomly because i never knew what i wanna study after primary school..

What can i do? I only have 2 choices, keep going to job interviews and go to school once summer is off.

FUCK... i fkin hate my life and this fkin country.. i'm so lost right now, my youth is going by and i don't have money to go anywhere, since those 500 euros go to other stuff such as speeding tickets that i haven't paid yet...


FK :(

PS. My parents are both from ex yugoslavia, they came to finland 20 years ago because of war, imagine this, they never graduated school either, they live in a very good country and still didn't graduate, i see single mothers with children who work and study and still graduated, my both parents worked in finland 20 years and had a decent salary, still didn't make it though, i wouldn't call a bus driver and a bred factory worker successful..",12Mar2018,33
192,"My best friend and I have been pretty much inseparable from since year 7, so age 12, has over the past year been acting very strange. I am in a relationship with a man and have been for 6 and a half years, we are very happy and moving in together soon enough. She also has a boyfriend of long term and they seem pretty happy together. The awkward behaviour is particularly after she's had a drink or two, I myself being bisexual do not find her attractive, she's pretty but I would not date her, that's just simply the way it is. She will play with my hair, even when it's distinctively annoying me, she will lean on my shoulder, she has sat near me in a pub in front of my partner and slowly put her lips on my shoulder blade before.. I moved away quickly and gave her a strange look and she looked rejected and defeated. I have warned her about her behaviour and asked if something is wrong? 

Another incident.. I was pouring myself a drink one time at a friend's house, she walks up behind me, pretends to thrust at me and asks if I will sleep with her? (Very very drunk at this point) I laughed it off..

I recall about 5 years ago she informed me she had feelings for a woman who matched my exact description and had said this woman will never love me. She has a boyfriend.. surely this is completely unfair and horrific for him to witness. 

Just the other night my entire friendship circle was out just hopping bars and my bf wasn't there that night, my boyfriend's best mate refused to go to a bar I suggested.. no biggy right. It was for her as she unzipped my jacket and exposed my chest, well.. low cut top and implied that should convince him to let me choose the next bar? She also slapped my arse 5 times. I had told her repeatedly to stop.

I don't like being like this and would prefer to be a 'Wednesday is washing day' and 'Ready for bed by 9' kind of person but I badly struggle keeping to schedules.

But I can’t because either I’m tired, have “better” things to do (all low energy activities), or procrastinate the act believing the opportunity will come up again. I just can’t get past the door.

197,"
I'm a mid 20's male. Backstory: 1.5 yrs ago at my grad school I met a girl (different grad programs). I was interested in someone else and that didn't work out.
Fast forward a year, we've maintained contact via message etc. I realize I was stupid for not pursuing something back when I met her but whatever.
basically I'm on rotations at different facilities and so I never get to see her in person. I start talking to her more and its going really well in my opinion. Over Christmas 17' I mention getting together (over text) for a coffee. (I hate asking out over text but have no choice since I never see her)
She seemed really receptive but at the time she was visiting family for 2 weeks in another state. Then around when she gets back her texts start becoming distant, like days to a week apart.
I'm not stupid, so I'm like 'alright whatever she wasn't interested'. But she keeps responding.
It started to make me feel back burnered but she finally tells me she's been dealing with undiagnosed medical issues. She can't even go to work some days and feels horrible. They have no clue whats going on. She has had to have every diagnostic test in the book. She even had to take a leave of absence just a few weeks ago. (I know she isn't making all of that up, btw, she's given me significant details which add up and which, if BS, would be the most idiotic, intricate 'not interested hint' ever)
But basically since mid to late Jan, we've been conversing regularly. she responds with asking questions and gives meaningful replies.
But we still haven't gone out.
I haven't brought up going out again, because as sick as she's been I've felt like its not the right thing to pressure her with that. I've been supportive and encouraging and check in on her here and there but not too much so that I'm not overbearing.
But now I also kind of want an answer as to whether she's interested realistically, cause if she's not, I want to move on. I'm mid 20's and my dating life has been nonexistent, so I don't just want to give up cause I've struggled with my busy schedule to even get dates and any dating I've done has gone terribly.
How do I get an answer with the chance for best results? Do I just ask about coffee again and see what she says? Do I wait it out until she gets treated, but that could be awhile? Do I ask her if she's interested? Thoughts?
Also, we've basically texted to this point - what do you think about me changing it up and calling to check in on her and bringing it up that way since doing it over texting sucks (but again I have no choice I never see her in person)?
She's been really appreciative of me being there for her in terms of checking in and stuff, I just can't keep doing it forever, I'm not getting younger and dating is getting harder. Thanks so much.",12Mar2018,2

I don’t really try and talk about it with him now but it sucks and is hurtful that I can’t talk about it with the one person who I’d want some reassurance from :( he doesn’t really compliment me that much either so when he just doesn’t want to engage when I’m being open about my insecurities it feels equally hurtful because I’m getting nothing at all.

I am working a part time job 6 days a week, and I feel like this last 9 weeks have been the most stressful time I’ve experienced through all of my hs years. I work at 5:00 pm 4 days a week, I get out of school at 3:00 so if I need to get anything done I only have two hours to do it but most days I just need to nap before work. I’m becoming depressed but trying to think positive and look forward to summer break. My question is, does it get any better? Keeping a part time job while taking part time college classes, will have more time than when in high school? or is it just as time consuming? does it get better? I get that college will probably be more stressful with harder work but will I have more of a break?

200,"I'm not usually one to share, but a few people i play for have told me it was the best they've ever heard. i didn't believe them, so i went on youtube and listened to the most watched piano improvisations of all time, and i was surprised to find that they might not be entirely wrong.. 

Now I don't know what to do. 

It's always a street corner or a train station where a pianist happened to find an upright piano and decided to play.. a few people stop to listen and afterwards everyone claps and walks away. All the most watched videos on youtube are like that. Maybe the chance nature of the video being taken at all makes people feel lucky to click on it, i don't know.

i live about 30 minutes from downtown san diego, so i had the sudden urge to drive down and start wandering around train stations until i found a piano before i thought ""wait, no. ask reddit. they'll know what to do.""

TL;DR- I might actually be good at piano. I have no idea what to make of this discovery.  and I'm sick of making music that no one is ever going to hear.

So what now?

UPDATE: I spent the whole day on this. After buying donuts, I made an appointment for tomorrow afternoon with a piano instructor who barely speaks english but assured me she can expand my repetoire, and then I searched my entire town for public pianos to play- no luck at school campuses, weirdly, but the hospital receptionist told me that their piano is locked until further notice for some bullshit reason and i should ask volunteer services, so i sent them an email asking when would be a good time to play. She also said that there was a piano at the train station in the next town over, so i drove there. Apparently the piano was removed years ago, but the woman at the coffee stand told me to ask the town's visitor center across the street, where an old lady pointed out the window to a bar across the railroad tracks and said ""i know the have one, but i'm not sure if they'll let you use it."" It was an awful piano, i had to basically hammer the keys to make a sound- *FORTE*- in a small bar with quiet conversations.. so i played for half an hour, and then i got a call from a friend who was in town trying to buy a fishing reel, but his card was being declined, so i came to the rescue and we went fishing. We walked through half a mile of squishy lagoon banks to a freeway underpass. After a few minutes and a few casts into the lagoon, some random guy comes climbing over all these rocks. We start talking, and without even mentioning my quest for a piano, i find out he's good friends with the owner of a piano bar within five miles of my house, the very piano bar i was hoping to play at.. so i told him what i've been doing all day and that i want a job there, and he told me exactly how to get a job at this place. I just got home, feeling satisfied with my day. Tomorrow i'll try retirement homes, craigslist, and.. wtf, i just got a text from another friend about a friend of his, ""you guys should hang, he's just as psyched about music as you are"".. today has been strangely serendipitous.",12Mar2018,3
201,"My uncle lives in Spain and usually visits England to see my family and I. However yesterday we discovered that my father had planned a secret visit to Spain and was planning on telling us he had to work the whole week instead of telling us he was going to Spain. He says it's to see his brother, which we don't doubt, but my uncle is a ladies man and sleeps around a lot. When asked my father says he didn't want to tell us because of the grief he got from it last time (last time he went whilst I was in hospital, friends and family were angry at him for it). It seems weird that my uncle wouldn't just come here and that my father was keeping it secret. Not sure whether my uncle will try to influence him to cheat, since he cheats on women himself.

204,"The situation is the following:
I'm a college student at the moment; hopefully finishing my studies this summer. I've started a full-time job this January and now thinking of quitting. Haven't decided yet so please help me decide. Here are the positives of the job:

* professional development

* excellent salary

* free lunch each day at the cafeteria

* all commute costs covered


The cons:

* boss is a narcissistic asshole that I'm growing tired of

* hazardous environment to health (working with/near powder-based chemicals that often fly in the air - I am afraid it'll effect my health on the long run)

* commute is long, 3 hours per day (2 x 1.5)

* very tiring, I get home late in the evening not being able to do anything other than take a shower, have dinner and sleep. Have no time to study for school or pursue my hobbies.


Because of the cons, I am thinking of quitting my job. Not having a job would suck, but at least I have a sizable emergency fund that easily covers all my expenses for the next 1 year. I would like to finish my studies. Currently I can not study because of constantly getting home exhausted.

Since December last year, I've been having this..delusion? of being talking (verbally, audibly) to people I've never met. It could be the people I see on the news, or celebrities, or an author.. I just start talking to them about stuff I guess. Not necessarily related to who they are. It usually progresses to me believing they can ""read"" my mind, and that's when it becomes a **real**, terrifying problem.

Now, I usually talk to myself when I'm alone in a room, or walking down an *empty* street. My mother has ""caught"" me a couple times, but I managed to just laugh it off or something.

My parents are the most caring, compassionate people I've known, and I honestly believe my mum loves me more than herself. I love them too, of course. But the thing is, they're very traditional in their views on mental health. My mother believes there is nothing between ""crazy"" and healthy. Each time the topic of mental illnesses comes up (talking about other people, of course, I've never told them about any of this), my parents go ""Oh, those poor parents, their kid is insane, how unfortunate for them"" They would **never** in a million years think that their own kinda-smart pretty-funny socially awkward daughter would be..*insane*.

But I am. Let's be real here, I absolutely am. I've cried about this so many times, googled more things about it than you could imagine, but no dice. I don't know what it might (""it"" being the illness) or how I could tell my parents about it.

It isn't schizophrenia, by the way. I've never had a hallucination in my life, only delusions. So that's that.

Please, please, please, someone help me. Tell me what to do. We do not have a ""school counselor"" or anything like that *at all*

I cried silently. Hundreds of people were writing so fast with the same posture, as if I was the only one in another universe. DESPAIR, anger, and fear. I even wanted to hit myself as hard as I can.There came the math section. That was pretty easy, maybe. Tired to cheer up, I yielded, still too weak to fight back my mindset.Whenever I am taking tests or do sth. important, I AM DYING. I do so-so in school (1300 or so); but this time, I failed to even read a passage calmly. University, future, my classmates’ scores, and parents’ hope… all the stuff just twinkled a little then faded away. Black clouds haunt overhead. SCORES—I feel STUPID to worry that STUPID thing. I seriously told my friends about that but they just… showed their surprise; asked some insignificant questions. No one really care and give me some advice. I dare not to ask. So, stupid.There is one solution I definitely know—have a high control of the test(ability) , or, to have confidence. Well, I cannot have them neither. I tried. I force myself to blow my trumpet, but that ends even more stressful and depressed. Just like you can’t force an introvert to be an extrovert. That makes them exhausted and disgusted. As for study ability. I’m…so sorry. That’s my best try. I just can’t stand anymore. Don’t force me on that. I knew what does it feel like to be a poor student (especially in our school, environment). I am not lazy, just stupid, can’t use the right study method. I let my parents and teachers down. Please don’t count on me. There are tens of hundreds of students waiting for your teaching and guidance. SORRY.And I am also ashamed to say that I wanna find a person that can tell my fears to. He/She shall not laugh or disdain me, and often give me advice. I am vulnerable, and I hate myself. I hate to expose myself in the public.

My SO has always wanted to get away but hadn’t pushed too hard for a move for my benefit. I am slowly coming around to the idea but have some big wish list items that would need to be checked off for me to consider leaving my home town. I would LOVE some advice on where to start looking. Here are some facts and wish list items to help with recommendations. 

Careers:
-My SO is finishing up their undergrad in computer science and looking to go into programming. 
-I have my undergrad in psychology and am currently in the human services field but can be flexible with a career shift. 
-We drive everywhere so we have no problem with a bit of a commute to work. A car is a necessity where we live now anyways. 

Area:
-Where we live has a Wegmans. I understand I’m limiting myself if I only want to live near a Wegmans but anyone who has shopped in one knows it’s the tits. 
-Good bread. Italians who have sauce on Sundays need good bread. I guess I could always learn how to bake bread though. 
-Generally safe and family friendly (we have one young child). 
-Good public schools but private can be an option if needed. 
-Flexible with suburbs and urban areas although we aren’t keen on apartment living (at least I’m not!)
-Character! Gotta love an area with history. 
-Accepting. Living in the North (and visiting family in the south) has given me a more liberal set of eyes when dealing with others and I would like where I live to be that same kind of way. I know everywhere has their assholes but I think a diverse area is kind of what I mean. 

Geography:
-East coast of the USA preferably since we have family up and down the coast. 
-Humidity is not my friend although my SO and child have eczema and would benefit from a warmer climate. 
-A little bit of snow ain’t bad. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice on where to move (if we do decide) where we could all be comfortable and happy. We have visited Boston (loved it), NYC (awesome but a bit too busy for me), many areas of Florida (holy shit the cockroaches), Virginia Beach (why do bugs have to be bigger down there?), South Carolina (inland), Maine (poutine), Philadelphia (diverse) and explored New York a bit too.

I graduated almost a year ago with a degree in engineering and still have yet to get a job. I'm honestly at a total loss for what to do now. I've had many people look at my resume, have had my resume sent to pretty much every contact both I and my parents had in the industry, and so far nothing has come of it. I've applied to hundreds of jobs and have barely even gotten any interviews. 

I graduated with honors, but did not have any internship or coop experience. I majorly screwed up and haven't been working, mostly because of anxiety. I've applied to lots of lab tech and receptionist type positions, since they would pay better than a retail job, and somehow I can't even get one of those. 

I've tried to ask about certifications I should get but no one really had any concrete suggestions besides in data mining, but that doesn't interest me at all so I didn't really want to start my career down a path I know I won't enjoy. I looked into getting CAD or solidworks certified, but I only have a mac and solidworks only runs on windows... so no luck there. 

I'm feeling really stagnant and not sure what to do anymore. Soon I'm going to be competing with this year's graduates for jobs, and I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. I'm really personable and definitely not the super awkward, can't communicate engineer, so I don't think it's that. I'm even open to relocating and have been applying to jobs pretty much all over the east coast of the US. I really just need advice or connections or anything that any of you can offer to help.  

For anyone wondering, my degree was in Biomedical Engineering.

232,"So I work as a personal care aide to a quadriplegic woman. She has me and one other aide currently, and cannot do anything without one of us here. She has a wheelchair accessible van that we use to take her anywhere she needs/wants to go.

About two weeks ago, she got a recall notice for it, basically saying that during a rear end collision, the drivers seat may detach from the vehicle causing an increased risk of severe injury. 

I helped her call the company and she made arrangements for her cousin to fix it. I haven't driven it since, she hasn't needed to go anywhere.

Well, I came in this morning and see that it had been driven yesterday. Being that yesterday was Sunday, it couldn't have been for a doctor's appointment or anything necessary, I'm guessing she went to the mall or something but I haven't asked. This has made me really mad. She has done some pretty inconsiderate things in the past I try to brush off, but putting someone's life at risk so she could get out of the house seems really fucked up. 

I will say that I might be overly sensitive about these things because I was in an accident last year where if all my safety equipment wasn't work properly I probably would have died.

239,"A bit of backstory first.

My mother is vindictive. She is what you would call a bitch, and does not understand how her actions effect other people. She has very few friends.

Anyway, when I was six I was diagnosed with a mild form of autism called Asperger’s syndrome. In the last ten years I have grown up and adapted. By the age of 11 I had lost all of the tell tale signs of aspergers and requested my mother stopped telling people I had it. She did for a while (or so I thought) and that was the end of it.

Well now I’m 16 and have just recently joined a new boxing gym and was looking forward to meeting some people who didn’t already know me and making a good impression. Everything went great my first night at the gym although I felt that I was being pandered to a bit and given leeway that some of my peers weren’t. 

I went home and forgot about it until I was checking my mothers texts (with her permission) to see the times and days it was on (she had contacted the coach).

As I’m scrolling through I see the word Aspergers and do a double take, wondering why the fuck that would come up in conversation.
As I read the message I see that she had asked to for a membership discount for a person with a mental illness. She then started going into detail about me having social issues and using boxing as a way of “standing up to bullies” (I don’t get bullied, and I do boxing for fitness and because I took PE Boxing and one of my GCSE subjects) . 

Anyway I was furious and questioned her about it. “They won’t judge you! I was just seeing if I could save some money because of your concession!” She says. I went on to tell her about how I could feel them judging me and that I don’t want to go back there, and told her it wasn’t her secret to tell.

I’m now in my room, typing this. I’m quite angry and upset that she would do this. I just needed somewhere to vent and ask what I should do next.

Sorry for the long post and bad language. Also I’m not that good at telling stories so sorry if it got boring.

I am currently studying medicine in my little hometown. In Turkey, you have to enter an exam for university, masters etc. I got a really good result. Like .01 or something. But I chose here so I wouldn't be a burden to my family. 

Family's finance has gone better. So I want to get a more qualified education. But it still bugging me. I have never left home. And I wouldn't be able to live as comfy as now. 

And I would still need some money. To put perspective, I get $200 from state a month. To study in these schools, I would need 200-250 more. My parents would cover the most of it and again, I don't want to be a  burden.  I have 2 siblings who are going to school with me. I will sell my pc and other things if I move to cover first months.

Should I do it? If so, how can I get some extra cash? I can do translations, sketches but not professionally. I am thinking about  working weekends. Weekdays would be a no, because of 8am-5pm school schedule. Anything online would you recommend? 50$ a month would be huge for me.

I have only one t shirt, one long sleeve shirt, one pair of jeans, one pair of boots and 3 pairs of compression shirt as underwear. I recently applied for food stamps &amp; have to apply for health care/ Medicaid. 

I really don’t have any good skills. I have work experience as a security guard but haven’t renewed my license since I wasn’t getting any decent paying jobs to survive off of. I’ve worked as a doorman temporarily as well. The only other experience in work that I have is working in an after school program when I was a teen and in my early 20s. 

All the above aside, I want to get back on my damn feet ASAP. I figure that I can use the money I have saved to survive, but also invest in a skill or certification to get a decent paying job. I’m considering either getting my real estate agent license &amp; certification, then eventually becoming a broker in a few years, maybe. I’m also considering getting my personal trainer certification. 

Based off of everything I shared, what suggestions do you have for me? Should I invest my money into a program or school to learn a new skill and become certified? Are either of the two (real estate agent or personal trainer) worth investing in to make money and get my life stabilized?

The groom has been dating her for 7 years now since freshman year of college. He'd always had a thing for me growing up, and about 6 years ago, we kissed. We both felt absolutely horrible - him because he loved his girlfriend and me because I initiated the kiss knowing he'd had long-standing feelings for me and was in a relationship. We both talked, expressed remorse and forgave each other and it hasn't come up since. We've continued our friendship for years now and I'm very happy for him and his fiancee.

Cue today, and the wedding is coming up. I feel a lot of guilt for what happened, even though it was so long ago and we were practically kids. They are considered the golden couple - together through all the wild years of college and beyond- and I feel like a total harlot for damaging  that perfection.

Outback steakhouse (host): walked into the managers office and quit for the same reasons

Starbucks: worked for 2 months and handed in my two week notice because school was starting back up.

UPS: walked out as a preloader, loading boxes night shift for 7 hours a day. Left to go to a restaurant for a month, then left the restaurant to go back to UPS. Got into a physical altercation with a co-worker and then got fired.

TGIF (host): told the manager to schedule me less hours, as school was picking up. They scheduled me 35 hours for the weekends and I quit without notice.

270,"Hello everyone, so as the title says I’m going through a little bit of a “quarter life crisis” here. I’m hoping to get some advice from people who are my age, or have just been in my situation, or are older, more experienced; hell anyone really lol

So recently, I turned 26, and I am totally unhappy with where I am in life / totally scared for my future. I currently work at a bank (nothing fancy, just basically a teller with some other responsibilities mixed in), and I absolutely hate it. I hate the business model, the shallow socializing, pretty much everything.  Due to this (which I acknowledge is my own fault), I have no hope of being promoted (not like I’d really want to, anyway). 

On top of working full time, I am currently enrolled in school full time, pursuing a bachelors in Economics.  I already had an associates degree (Liberal Arts) that I got right out of high school, so I transferred in as a second half sophomore.  Originally, I had planned to continue onto law school (something I had flirted with in the past), but after noticing the abysmal job market, I decided to shelve that idea for now. 

Since I’m majoring in economics, I’m learning about data analysis and the like, which seems pretty interesting to me, but the way I entered into my present school I’m missing internship opportunities going into the summer, but even if wasn’t, I wouldn’t be able to take advantage of them anyway - due to me already having a full time day job - and needing the money I make from said job to pay the bills.  I also find it hard to quit this job because admittedly, the benefits and pay are decent for someone with my experience (which is not much).  This makes me stress even more because I feel like I’m missing out on experience that I will need with future jobs regarding my degree while wasting away here. So all this just leaves me feeling stuck. 

I also keep reverting back to childhood activities of mine - playing old video games (Pokemon, Diablo 2, CS 1.6) and rereading old books (Harry Potter), watching old shows (Dragon Ball, Jackass, Viva La Bam, etc). I haven’t thought much of this up until now, but I’ve recently realized that I probably do this to cope with my current issues - which makes me feel even worse. 

I feel lost and unsure. I see people like my S/O, 
majoring in something she loves and is on track to getting a job in a field she loves, while I have nothing that interests me as much.  I’m so happy for her, but I feel so upset with myself. 

I’ve tried to make it a point to make changes in my life (for example, as mentioned, I enrolled in school and I’m actually doing really well for once), but no matter what I do I don’t feel any closer to being content with my life.  I basically feel like a huge loser. 

Has anyone else felt like this and seen the light? Is there any glaring improvement opportunities with the limited information I provided you guys see? Any and all help is appreciated - nice stuff, tough stuff - anything. Thank you. 

P.S. didn’t realize how long this was lol, so extra thanks to everyone who made it this far",12Mar2018,9
271,"About 3 weeks ago, I started a new job in an office Monday-Friday. It's a small team of us, and in terms of the workload and my training, I feel like I'm doing well. This is my first non-retail job, and the whole ""culture"" of how things work, is still something I'm getting used to (I'm 22 by the way, and a recent graduate). 

My issue is my coworkers. They have all known each other for at least a year, and it's stupid, and maybe a bit paranoid, but I feel like I'm being left out? Like whatever conversation we have, I always try to get involved when I can, but a lot of it is their own inside chatter, and jokes. They are nice people to my face, but I can't help but feel like they don't feel greatly of me when I'm not around.

I've offered to get things for them, asked about the job. I genuinely feel like I'm doing all the right things, but then it's just them sitting in a circle, talking about their personal lives, and such- whilst I'm sat at my desk, on my own. I don't expect them to come flocking to me by the way, but I've never felt welcomed since I started basically.

The people around me are saying it's going to take a while to get to know them. I have anxiety, and completed my CBT appointments last year, and I'm trying to implement what my therapist told me, but this still something I worry about everytime I drive home from work. I feel like the impact of not as being friendly with them, as they are all with each other, is going to affect me negatively to my bosses (I have a 6 month probationary period). 

I know this sounds stupid, but in my retail jobs, I was friends with everybody, and I'm still friends with a lot of them to this day, but here- it feels completely different, and it's making me kill my self confidence. This was something that was supposed to boost my confidence (especially as this is a graduate level job), and I have definitely come a long way to get to where I am now.

Is there any advice that any of you can give me? Do I need to get a grip? Do I just get on with the job? Do I even do anything?

I don't know what to do... I hate studying logistics, car mechanics, IT, construction.. everything..

275,"Hi
I just wondered if any of you could offer some advice on this situation.

I bought a house year ago, but I am yet to move in. I am in my early thirties but suffer from long-term depression, although I appear entirely normal in my appearance and in my communications with people, albeit a little quiet. I am currently still at home with my parents. 

Now I know this is hardly crisis of the century, however, I am a little embarrassed what my new neighbours might think when I start moving in; that it may seem a little weird to have bought a house and not lived there, turning up infrequently, etc. I am sure that moving out and getting your own place might be a normal part of life, although it is actually a bit of a milestone for me. I have only met one of my neighbours, briefly, shortly after I bought the house. When I do move in, I will likely divide my time between there and home, so won't really be moving in full time. Ok,  I'm not exactly a noisy or troublesome neighbour, so there is no reason to really be paranoid. Maybe I am over-thinking this.

I know I could try the usual excuses of something like I work away, but concerned that it may even turn out that one of m neighbours could end up working at the same large local company I work for. At the same time, I would be too embarrassed to tell the truth. 

Any suggestions appreciated :-)

276,"I'm asking this here because I feel like I've been overthinking this, and asking a stranger might give me a simple solution that I didn't think of before.

So last semester I had absolutely zero female contact of any kind, and now I suddenly seem to have a choice. On one hand there's a friend who I'm starting to get pretty close to, but I'm only about 50% sure she likes me back. On the other hand there's a girl I've gone on some dates with already, where success is pretty much guaranteed, but I don't know her that well yet. Let's call them Mary and Sue respectively.


*Mary: pros*

-Has the same sense of humor as me. 

-I see her every day in class. 

-I already know her pretty well. 


*Mary: cons*

-Maybe it shouldn't matter this much, but there's no guarantee she'll even be interested. 

-She still lives with her parents, which is important because... Well you know. 

-She has some history with a close friend of mine, although it was just once and he has a girlfriend now. 



*Sue: pros*

-Listens to the same music I listen to. 

-99% sure it would work out if I go for it. 

-Simply a lot less complicated. 


*Sue: cons*

-I would still see Mary everyday, which might complicate things a little. 

-I only just met her, with my last girlfriend there were a bunch of... Incompatibilities. I found out about her after we started going out, which might happen again here. 

-She hangs out in different circles, we don't really have any friends in common


Trying things out with one and having the other as plan B seems like a pretty scummy thing to do, so please recommend one of the two options.

286,"I'm almost done my first-year of university. I lived in residence and made some close friends and I have a girlfriend. I have never brought them over to my home where my parents live. With the school year coming to an end, they are most likely eager to come over at my place to hang.

How do I explain to them that I can't have people over at my house? The reason why is I have an older brother who has autism. My mother is a stay-at-home-mom because she takes care of my brother. The house is a mess. Mostly because my brother has broken some stuff, created holes in the wall, and makes it really difficult for us to find time to just clean up the place. We're obviously going to have a massive makeover when my brother leaves and moves to a group home.

But until then, what am I supposed to say now? In high school and elementary school, I only really ever had two close friends and they knew my situation because they lived on my street. I never explained what was happening in my family to anyone else. I never knew how to explain it. Which is why I never made a lot of friends back in high school and elementary school. I was different compared to everyone else. I have actually never met someone that is going through the same thing as me.

What should I say? I don't want to say something where they interrupt it in a wrong way. I also don't want to sound like some weird kid who has dumb reasons for not having friends over. And I don't want to sound like I have a terrible family.

I worry that they might not understand what I am going through.",12Mar2018,1
287,"Burner account for what I feel to be obvious reasons...



Anyways, I've been debating this post about debating myself for just over a year now and I finally hit a low enough point to write about it and ask you all for help. My relationship with (let's call her) Sally started 3 years ago during my Senior year of university. To preface things, Sally went to my high school too, a year younger, but we never talked. Just admired each other from afar. Fast forward back to my Senior year of university. We matched on Tinder, and that's how we started talking. Sidenote: The fact that we 'started talking' with Tinder as the impetus is definitely something that bothers me internally. One night I got some liquid courage in me and asked her to come over and hang out. We did so and she ended up spending the night. No sex, nothin just talking/feeling each other out. Once we got to know each other more, I found out that she thought our first occasion was just going to be a booty call and was shocked that it wasn't - another thing that bothers me internally. So fast forward two years of a relationship and being 'in love'. At the end I wasn't providing the support she was looking for and internally I knew I needed to move on to accomplish some of the goals I've set out for myself. Anyways - October 2016 we ended it for the first time. For the next three months, I was super lonely, in a new state that I didn't have friends in (moved for work), and it was hard. In January of 2017 I had a life-changing moment through meditation that showed me the love we shared but also showed me that that love was in the past. One of my biggest fears is and always be going crazy (mental health issues in my family), and that moment also showed me that I was not crazy for the massive dreams I have, but that relationship is crazy. Anyways, at the end of this experience, i was left with a feeling of resounding love. I wrote my SO an apology letter for the messy breakup, and sorry for 'deleting' her out of my life. No communication, nothing. Said I missed the times we had. But, I went on too far since I was so energetic from this experience that I ended up getting back into a relationship with her thinking that that love is there and always be. :\ We weren't 'official' though until June 2017 again. So, it hasn't even been a full year yet and I quite frequently struggle with the thoughts in the sidenotes above and just questioning everything. I know questioning things is great and having an open mind is great, but if this was true love would I really be questioning it? I lose my patience when she begins to complain and when I think I can tell when something is about to roll into something unnecessary. An emotional expenditure I'm not looking to further. I don't know. I always thought love would be a motivating thing. Something I enjoyed every day, something that's the impetus for my creative endeavors. It has not been that. Or is currently not that. Occassionally, I see similar qualities of my past SO's in my current SOs and it irks me. Sometimes I feel like the universe if playing a joke on me seeing familiar things in all my SOs - just variations of them.



Also throughout my relationship, including the months broken up, I have lost my friends, and most importantly my best friend. It's been hard putting all my eggs in the basket of 'this is the one' I don't know. I also have lost motivation/energy/desire to be better, to strive towards my creative goals, I don't know. Is this all on me? Is this on my SO? I'm at a loss. Also to top it all off, occassionally I feel/think that I am homosexual/bi and the love I felt with my best friend was something that was a product of that. I'm not sure if it's that love, or just love in general - and that currently I am feeling none of it. I don't know and am struggling inside.



I think that's all. It's all brief (hard to condense three years in this) and I know it's all over the place. But if it resonates with anyone, I'd love to hear opinions/advice on the subject at hand.



Is love just someone that sticks with you through it all or something more? What I felt with my previous best friend when I realized what it may be, was amazing. It was just under my nose the whole time of being around someone for 10+ years.



Please let me know. Thanks.

I heard somewhere today that the average man speaks 7,000 words today and it hit me like a train that other than answering questions people *have* to know (directions for example) I speak less than a hundred words a day. This came to me as a surprise since I'm not lonely in the ""*traditional*"" sense where I just have no one to talk to and no one talks to me. I'm lonely in the sense that I have literally no connection to any other human being, and the only not faked connection I've had was with my (RIP) dog. This includes my parents, I never had a relationship with my mother and I don't have a father. 

I did some thinking and I don't check any of the stereotypical signs of antisocial(ity?). I look completely normal, I'm not socially awkward and I don't get anxious/nervous pretty much ever except for the last couple minutes in tight ball games, and even that's only limited to my hands getting shakey. I looked up mental disorders and illnesses and I don't think I really fit into any of them, which leaves me with the only sensible solution: I'm the biggest cunt I've ever met. It actually adds up pretty well. When people talk to me my responses are pretty much limited to ""ok cool"" and my questions are limited to yes/no questions that kill the conversations. It's not like I don't have anything to say either, before I moved &gt;1000 miles away from my hometown I used to have 3 hour long conversations with people on basically a daily basis. The asshole theory holds up even better when you consider the fact that the range of emotions I show people goes from indifferent to indifferent. We had a ""self discovery"" course once and were supposed to be described by the others present. I was given the title of the most indifferent person one of the people has ever encountered. Even when I'm introduced to someone as *the funniest person in my class* and I **know** I'm supposed to do or say something to back that claim up my response is just a nod. It doesn't even matter what I do, from hitting the last beer pong cup to a buzzer beater I just don't fucking react and it kills me. 

I don't try or want to be an asshole but it looks to me like I just am one. I feel like I'm pretty much throwing my life away at this point because it's like I'm keeping a wall between me and literally everyone who looks at me as a friend or tries to be one to me. Even my relationships aren't spared from the Trump treatment, I've fucked **every single one** of them up by having no reaction to anything that happens. I can't even argue, I just hang up/leave. The worst part of it all is that I don't even think I care about fixing it for the sake of being human, the only reason I paid this discovery any mind is because I keep fucking up with a chick I'm into whenever she talks to me by dumping out yes/no questions or answering yes/no to answers where a deeper answer is obviously expected.

311,"I (29 F) have been with my husband for almost 9 years, married for almost 4. We’ve had our ups and downs through mental illness, legal issues, school and work stress, and a lot of financial problems, but we’ve always tried to make it work. 

About 9 months ago, we moved away from the state I lived in for most of my life, where my parents and most of my friends are, to the state where a lot of his relatives live. I left a job I’d been in for over 6 years to start over with him somewhere I thought he would be happy. 

The ups and downs have continued since we moved here, and despite best efforts, he has decided to end our relationship. Our lease is up at the end of June, and we’ll begin living separately at that time. I am heartbroken and have no desire to move out or move on, but he is not interested in continuing to work at our marriage, so I have to try to learn to accept it. 

Since we’re coming to the end of our lease, I have to decide what to do. As I said, we’ve lived here for about 9 months, so I have started to settle in. I started a new job in my field in November that has potential growth opportunities, and I have a small but strong group of friends who I see often. I also have a therapist with whom I have a good working relationship. Other than that, though, I wouldn’t say I have much in the way of a community here. 

On the other hand, the idea of moving back home isn’t perfect either. I have no interest in going back to my old job, so I would have to start another job search at a time when I don’t have a lot of emotional or mental resources to spare. Our dog will be staying with me, but she and my parents’ dog don’t get along, so I would also need to find a new place to live there right away as well. I enjoy the friendships I have from my hometown, but a lot of them were former coworkers that I hung out with after work; it’s likely I wouldn’t see them much if I don’t return to work there. My other friends are all sort of settling into that domestic couple-hood stage that accompanies the late 20s-early 30s, and simply don’t have the time and space in their lives for me to see them as often as I would like to. 

In short, neither staying here nor going back home is particularly appealing, and I only have a few months to make a choice. I don’t want to move to door number three and start over completely somewhere new either, so I’m looking for opinions and advice on where to go from here. Now that I’m alone, and a mess, should I stay or should I go?",12Mar2018,1
312,"I've (16M) been friends with this girl for about half a year now and ever since, I've had the biggest crush on her. We've become relatively close. We hang out after school and do multiple extra curricular activities together. Our friendship up until now has been relatively platonic, but recent events have gotten me thinking.

This past weekend, we were just texting eachother over Snapchat as usual when all of a sudden she asked me for my phone number. She called me immediately after she finished hanging out with her friends and told me she that she didn't want to be alone. I was the first and only person she called. I really enjoyed the conversations we had. 

This morning I woke up to a good morning text from her. I was kind of taken aback, because she's never done that before. We're close, but not THAT close, ya know?

She's also been acting kind of different? Maybe it's just me imagining things, but it seems like she's been laughing at every single one of my jokes lately. We were hanging out last week and she kept telling me to touch and hold her hand (She doesn't really like being touched, but I guess she's comfortable with me?).

This is all the more confusing because just 3-4 months ago she said that she wouldn't date me. What do you guys think? Am I reading everything wrong? Is she just being platonic??

Tl;dr: close friend I have a crush on is suddenly acting weird. asked me for my phone number, started texting me more, even started sending me good morning texts. once told me to touch and hold her hand.

313,"So I just graduated from college and I'm back home with my family, and I wanted to get a small job until I get into grad school.  I was applying to different places.  I got called for an interview to a gas station convenience store.  I told the manager I was looking for part-time, but she said ""oh, we were looking for full time and the overnight shift...""  I didn't want to miss the opportunity so I said, ""okay, I can do full time.""  She asked me twice if I was sure, because they'd have to pay for a drug test.  I said yes, I was 100% sure.  

I got hired and I just had my first day last night.  And I can't see myself doing this full time.  It's hectic, plus working overnight sunk in once I did it since I'll be sleeping the whole day, 5 days a week.  I could probably get a better job.  

I want to quit but I feel guilty since I told my manager I was 100% sure I would work for a longer period.  She gave me a chance, knowing I have little work experience.  But I also know this job won't last, and I just want to leave before any more expectations set in.  Also they already gave me 2 company shirts, but I guess they can dock it from my first day of pay.    ",12Mar2018,1

320,"Hello, 
I am 20 years old, and go to a public university in Pennsylvania and feel like ive already ruined my life. Im halfway through a biology degree with shit grades, probably below a 2.5, am not even interested in biology, and have no clue what I wanna do. The thing is, im very smart, social and positive as of today, but I was not so much this last coming year. I ended up getting a bit depressed, and that lead to a downward spiral off bad behaviors like excessive partying, drugs and other self defeating behaviors. I know I did not get a GPA to my full potiental, and know I could do much better. I feel stupid, like I wasted my time and life.  Not to mention, I have worse ADHD then anyone ive ever met. I know this is no excuse, Im just saying this because I feel back on this excuse too much and didnt just make myself do the work that needs to be done. I wanma take it all back, get a perfect GPA, and show my potiental but I feel its too late, and im destined to by the average for the rest of my life. How could I get a 2.5 (or maybe lower) when I know i can do better? Is there anyway I can turn my life around and be the prestigous working man I want to be? I feel like halfway through college its too late to be the best I can.  Hell I might even want to go to med school.. But not with a gpa like mine. How do I recover?",12Mar2018,2
321,"I am 25 now. I am short, balding and have a small dick. it gets even worse, no one understand what I am going through. if I would tell anyone about it, people would laugh at me, they could not take me seriously. if you even suggest that your problems are due to what you have been given at the beginning of your life you wont be taken seriously. it‘s not only the dating aspect, even though dating as a person in my position is an absolute zero game. noe one wamts someone who has been dealt with the wordt in every physical aspect that actually matters. and not only that, I am also stupid. I always wanted to go to college and study mathematics but my cognitive abilities do not match up with what I am interested in.
I have done numerous of cognitive ability tests, credible ones conducted by a psychologist. I never scored above 95, I am even below average intelligence, in something I thought I could at least excell. the math degree is off the table obviously, I have tried it, I have failed, I have worked harder than most people but I still could not make it. when all your friends end up with the life you have always wanted, when they achieve everything you wanted to do with minimal effort it gets enormously frustrating. more than anything one could ever imagine. intelligence(what I am referring to is really ones raw cognitive abilities) matters and looks matter too, more than most people would ever realize, you only get exposed to that fact once you actually are in exactly that position. it‘s not that I am not a van neuman or hilbert, it‘s that I am honestly not very capable cognitively. it‘s frustrating as hell and no one takes it seriously. my lives is going downhill at this point, nothing actually works out the way I expect it to be, not in any branch.
people told me as long as I work hard for it I can get what I want even though, this is painfully inaccurate. there are things some people can never achieve. my life is a mess and I have no idea what to do with it, how to handle it. I am also horribly alone, the last time I attempted to date someone was 7 years ago, since that all I got was rejections.
people will tell you it‘s because of your „personality“ when in fact rejections come from people explicitly naming your height as the reason why they are not interested in you",12Mar2018,1

323,"I separated from someone I was engaged to and had a home with. It was quite sudden and I was basically kicked out of the house a few days before Christmas with no explanation. It really sucked but I’m dealing with that okay, thanks to my supportive family and a great therapist. 
What I’m having tons of trouble with is the loss of the two dogs we had, who I was the main caretaker for. I stayed home and looked after them, walked them daily, and paid for about half of their vet bills during the time I had them. I had never had dogs but was super excited and even bought and read a book on the breed (husky). I planned to eventually sled train them too, once they stopped growing so I didn’t have to buy a new harness every month. 
Now I will admit that my ex was covering most of their expenses, as he has a well paying job and no college debt and I am a recent graduate.  My ex works long hours and then goes to the gym after work, resulting in him being gone for 10-12 hours. As far as I know, the dogs (husky who is 9 months old, malamute who is 7 months old) are being left alone during that time. I’m not sure if a dog door has been installed but I think there is. If not they are using pee pads.   The yard they have access to is fenced, but the fence isn’t locked and is 4ft tall. They are not neutered and both male, I worry they will be able to jump the fence and look for ladies.  They don’t get walked, and get minimal human interaction. I think the last time they went to the park was before winter.  
And lastly, I just found out that my ex got a third puppy. He is an Akita who is also likely going to be left intact. I worry about three male intact dogs alone in the same house. 
These dogs aren’t being abused by any means. But they aren’t being shown the love they deserve. They don’t understand what happened to me, I just suddenly wasn’t there for them anymore. And the fact that a third dog is in the picture makes me feel like he treats them like possessions he wants to collect. 
I guess I should also mention that the first dog he owned on his own went to live with his parents because he didn’t properly socialize him and didn’t neuter him until he was 2 yrs old. The dog is aggressive and has bitten at least two of his family members. 
Since we separated, I moved back in with my parents and got back all the money I put into the home we had. My parents aren’t very keen on the idea of two puppies running around our house. But I just started work at a dog daycare/vet where I could bring them for free every day I work, after they are neutered. 
I just don’t know how to get them back. I want to just go to the house and scoop them up from the yard but I know that’s not right. They’re not being abused but I know that their needs aren’t being fully met. I just want my two babies back and I don’t know how to make that happen. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. ",12Mar2018,1
324,"this is gonna be a long post so ill try to separate things in paragraphs
Anyways maybe i should mention that i was kinda bullied throught my entire elementary school(which lasts 8 years in my country) and i was bullied trhought highschool(4 years) but not by school mates but by the same bullies from elementary school if i would come across them(usually late at night when coming bk from a night out or something ),mostly called a faggot as i have some feminine gestures that are out of my control and yes i am gay but im not someone who is ''out'' about it and puttin it in other peoples faces,and the bullies well.....are a group of folks around my age who kinda failed at school and education,have lots of police reports some are about to go to jail,have corrupted families etc. anyways the kind of people who u cant dicuss the problem or the reason of being bullied cuz your words mean nothing,they either want u to express your fear or to physicaly stand up to them and they are never able to bully u unless they are in groups or individually when drunk or high,or the worst scenario grouped up and drunk/high.So i think that a lot of my issues go bk to those experiences.I never told anyone about bulllying ,only people who know are my classmates who witnessed.My parents still think i had the perfect life a scholar could have.
I dont have a strong conection with my parents,i mean i love them there is no doubt(tho i love my mother more than my father) its just i dont feel comfort in talking to them.Few situations:when i told my dad that i was bullied by some kids at the new school in town where we just moved to.He just told me ''how come u are the one who always gets bullied'' and im sure he didnt mean that,and im sure he wasnt thinkin it through since that night was rough in general since he did deal with my bullies in previous school and so on,but after that being said i never talked to him about a single issue.My mom on the other hand well she aint aware of any issue i think,i mean she always says how she knows me the best and blah blah but the only thing she succesfully noticed is me vomiting(in my boulimia phase of life) beside that once i asked her to see a therapist because i felt anxious for a while and she insisted on knowing what was the problem as i declined she told me that its just a phase,that everyone deals with anxiety and that she would be too curious not to try to find out what i talked to my therapist about.So thats where things ended with talking to my mom about almost any kind of issues.(i do talk about health issues with them because as i would like to know if they have any they should know if i have any either)
I have a sister too,5.5years younger than me(im 19),also no connection there.I love her the most but we just dont really talk about anything really.I dont know what are her interests,i dont know how alike or not alike we are,i dont know/or want to be honest to ''involve'' myself into her teenage life ....simply there is no conection.The only thing i fear is if any harms comes to her for being my sister ,by the same bullies or people who have the ''faggot'' image of me cuz they know the bullies personally and so on.
I hate the town i live in,i dont go out to clubs where everyone goes to since i try to evade unvated situations of...again meeting the bullies in clubs.I dont like the club atmosphere in general but not that much taht i wouldnt go at all.I never stepped one foot into any local club in my town.And since im also gay it feels bad to be a part of gay comunity only through hook up ap.Since the country itself is not accepting of gay rights ,and people are super homophobic in general so u have to ''somewhat hide''.The gay social places like bars or clubs dont exist.Few in capital city i think do exist.I dont think about coming out to my family until i finish my education and find a job,because i still rely on their financial support.I cant predict their reaction.I think mom would be fine with it,after a while,and for dad im not sure since i heard some spiteful coments when topics about gay rights appear on news on tv.And my mom does not support the marriage of same sex couples since its a wrong example to little kids of what marriage should be.(both of those examples i heard only once out of their moth,and i try to be super protective over any minorities when we diccuss stuff like religions,nationality etc) 
Still it feels terrible to have my early twenties feel kinda wasted u know,everyone is having fun,experiencing love,new things and im kinda alone with my thoughts.
I dont have much friends,and i also dont konw many people.I have a person i consider my best friend,and she knows im gay and i can talk to her openly about most of the things.But its one of those friendships that is kinda bounded by the place we live in.
I feel like after we graduate from university of economics that we go to ,and when we find jobs,go separated ways ..our friendship will fade quick.Which leaves me alone pretty much.(but it also feels like one of thsoe friendsships where  u dont ahve to meet for years but after u meet again it feels like nothing changed....i experiences this with her since she went to highschool in antoher town) 
I never met someone who was genuenly interested in my company.This best friend is the closest to a real friend i have but even she and i dont go out together,like to party....we can go to dinners,cinema ,theather,coffee,talk about problems and so on  but nightlife in clubs is just out of my confort zone as i mentioned above and shes not a fan of constant cocktail drinking nights or dinners etc. ,she likes crowds and bigger groups of ''friends''.
Also for many experiences,festivals,events i dont have finances to go to.My parents have some struggles and i dont blame them for it.I never pointed out how much i have not having certain amout of money like other kinds do.But to be fair its so annoying.....it pisses me off more and more as  i get older.
Anyways this amount of negativity scares me,to add up on all of this i have massive body image issues(due to high beauty requests in gay comunity) but i dont have strenght to write about that at this very moment.I noticed how negative i became throught dog walks.My dog does not behave well in walks and i could get so stressed out when he starts pulling that i feel like ''trhowin'' him against a wall to stop cuz my hands hurt.And imidiately after that thought i would feel so guilty for feelin that way for even a second cuz it truly never experienced love on that level until i got him and i would never do such thing.
Im trying my best to move to another town during the second year of studying if my parents find finances.Because i dont know what to do,and moving felt the best.(i moved a lot since my dad works in military,and never have i ever found it problematic,i always fet so good about it cuz i never found something that connects me to a certain place and we moved like 3-4 times)
Any word of advice is welcome.

327,"First off, I want to say that over the years, I have been diagnosed with Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, ADD, Depression, Anxiety, and Asperger's Syndrome (However I think the diagnosis with Asperger's was misdiagnosed). My therapist has also said to me that she is suspicious that I have PTSD. Ever since I was child growing up, I have always felt that there has been something wrong with me. I would observe other people my age (and still do to this day) and see how their behavior, freedom, and appearance would be different than mine. I always felt like the person that would finish last. For example, a good chunk of people my age have moved out, got married, have jobs, and so on while I still live with my parents, haven't got my degree yet, can't hold a job (I am 23), still rely on my parents driving me places and can’t be left alone from my parents in public. Growing up, I would feel very hypersensitive with all my 5 senses. For example, some people can't feel an ant crawling on their skin while with me, I can feel every tiny little leg perform movement on my skin. I also remember growing up that I would have extreme anger, anxiety, and depression. I remember how if a Lego piece didn't fit on the model that I was building, that toy would turn into missile flying across the room and explode into a million Lego pieces. I also remember that I would start crying from things that most children wouldn't find upsetting such as sad sounding music. I also remember that I would have severe panic attacks at just the thought of any sort of life threatening health condition that might occur (and still do to this day). I have also had a few head injuries growing up from running out of the bath tub at age 2 and slipping, having a shelf one time fall on top of my head, and running under playground equipment while not ducking down enough resulting in splitting my head. Surprisingly none of the doctors think none of the injuries have caused any set backs but of course I have never received an MRI brain scan to confirm their conclusions. My parents believe the reason I feel so shitty is because of the vaccines I received when I was younger. I'm not sure if that is the case but I feel that there is a possibility. I have also had a lot of traumatic experiences growing up from medical emergencies with me to bullying. Before my life really turned into a hell hole, It was the beginning of 2011 and I actually felt my life was going in the right direction. I had a super cute girlfriend, I was learning to drive, and had lots of great friends. I practically felt almost invincible. However, I did have the occasional panic attack which I attribute to both consuming a lot of caffeine back then and past trauma. I would sometimes have a coffee and a large water glass full of Dr. Pepper sometimes in the same day. I remember occasionally I would feel super tense but I thought it was normal. After all I was told when you are a teenager, you body changes and sometimes you might feel funny. I remember around February or March in 2011, that was when my life took a big hit. I remember had 3 really severe panic attacks on 3 different days. Once at home, at a Wal-Mart, and at my high school's basketball game. I remember after those 3 days I can say that was when I really began to have severe agoraphobia. I felt like I became afraid of everything. Being taxis, trains, elevators, big stores, being surrounded by crowds, etc. It also got so bad that the summer of 2011, I spent it inside of my home because I was so terrified to leave because every time I went out, I would get a really bad panic attack. Since then, I have received adjustments in medication, cognitive behavioral therapy and so on. I also got on and off episodes of really severe depersonalization. I had depersonalization sometimes growing up but back in 2011, I had it almost everyday. Due to how bad my agoraphobia was in 2011, I had to give up driving and wouldn't get my license until the end of 2014 (at age 20). Even though I now have my license, I terrified to even drive outside of my neighborhood and feel that my mind is too impulsive to drive safely. In 2012, I actually developed heart palpitations from the constant anxiety that I would have everyday. Thankfully my doctors said nothing was wrong, told me to take magnesium supplements, and the palpitations went away. I graduated high school in 2013 and started college but never finished. I dropped out of college in March 2015 (but went back in August 2016). I only took classes online because I was so terrified being on campus. Back then and now in college I would barely make C’s. I would try every thing from tutoring to Youtube videos to help me understand my classes and nothing worked. The only reason I haven’t ended up on academic probation is that I cheated every single class I took so I could pass. Some classes I can’t even take (such as pre algebra) because there aren’t any good websites online to help me cheat. Unfortunately I wouldn't get my first job until the end of 2015. Surprisingly after I got my first job, my anxiety started show some improvement. I was able to drive from home to my job (my job was a 3 minute drive) and I was able to be left alone places without my parents being close by. However in the beginning of 2016, I had a really severe panic attack on night driving home and almost got into a car crash at night (the person’s bumper was only 2 inches away from my passenger door!). Shortly after, someone got really sick at my job and the paramedics came while my verbally abusive store manager and a customer were both yelling at me for not working well during an excessively long line. Combined with the anxiety from the store manager, line, customer, and the paramedics (since I’m terrified of paramedics) I had a really severe panic attack. After that, I would have a panic attack everyday at my job and was scared every time I was behind the wheel. It got so bad, my mom would have to sit outside of my job the whole time until my shifts were over and she would have to drive me everywhere again. My psychiatrist gave propranolol and unfortunately did not make even the slightest difference with my anxiety. My heart palpitations came back and I developed really bad indegestion. It got so bad, I skipped meals because every time I ate, my symptoms got worse. I also couldn’t speak because my stomach would hurt so much. I also got constipation everyday. My parents told me I had to go to the doctor. because it was so bad. My doctor pretty much said it was due to work related stress and gave me famotidine. After a few days of taking the medication and not working, my symptoms went away. Once I went back to my job, all my symptoms came back in an instant. It was like I never took the medication! I remember one day, I had such a bad panic attack at my job, I felt some sort of rush shoot up my spine and then my heart felt funny, got tunnel vision and felt like I turned into the Incredible Hulk and Sonic The Hedgehog at the same time! It was scary! The final blow that made me quit my job was one day, I had such bad anxiety, my throat felt like it closed up for 5- 10 seconds. I couldn’t speak, or breath and my mouth would only let me make awkward movements. After I quit, my mom said to me how she was worried if I would be able to ever hold a job again. Once I quit in April 2017, my life since then and now felt like it has been during 2013 (after finishing high school) and 2014. Everyday I sit home by myself all day while my parents work. Every day feels the same. I only go for walks in the neighborhood when my parents are away when I leave the house since I too scared too leave the neighborhood without my parents. Thankfully I can go to stores and different places but my parents coming with me is a requirement. Now in 2018, I can say that my agoraphobia isn't as bad as it was 7 years ago. However, I feel that there is very little hope for me being able to live a normal life. I feel like someone with low functioning autism (not literally). They grow up having all these problems but when they're older (after receiving the right help of course) they have improved but will never be able take care for themselves, have a family, hold a job and so on. I had cognitive behavioral therapy from September 2011 to December 2013. I have stopped because it was making little to no change with my anxiety. I started take Somatic Experiencing therapy in January 2014 and still take it today and have also started Feldin Krais in October of 2014. All the different therapies treatments I have helped me to some degree but haven’t made any life impacting differences. All lot of people say that my biggest problem is that I have too many negative thoughts. Even though I do agree my thoughts are mostly negative. My issue goes much further than just thoughts. Everyone has negative thoughts at once everyday (at least that’s what I assume) and don’t go into really severe panic attacks out in public. My biggest issue in my opinion, is my body and mind’s sensitivity. I honestly don’t know how long I can continue living like this. I am getting older everyday while I’m watching everyone else my age pass me by in life while I just suffer with the same problems everyday. I feel like I have tried everything and nothing has worked. I really wish I could commit suicide but I’m also too scared to do that too. Every time I hear when a friend of mine moves out, gets engaged, etc. I just start to cry so much because I feel so far behind in life and feel like a gigantic loser. I’ve probably cried at least 2 times writing this. When friends want to do stuff with me, I always either invite them to my house or when they invite me some place, I make up an excuse not to go since I don’t want them to see my parents following me. I also haven't had a girlfriend for 7 years either. I also feel so intimidated around other girls now because I don't know how to get a girlfriend, what to say to them and I've been rejected a lot more times in life than have been accepted. I honestly believe that if someone were in my shoes, they would have committed suicide a long time ago. I don't know what needs to be done, but I can't continue to live life like this. My life it isn't a gift. It's a curse.",12Mar2018,1

334,"At my school, each class is separated into different sets for ability 
There are 5 sets, with 1 being the best and 5 being the worst 

For most subjects, I’m in set 3, which is slap bang in the middle. However, for science, I’m in set 4. Now you may be thinking “at least he’s not in the bottom set”

However, there are only 4 sets for science. I had my parents know that I’m in set 3 for most things, and set 4 for science.

However, I think I gave them the impression that there were still 5 sets. I was unaware that there was only 4 until recently though so it’s partially an error on my part.

I was struggling with my homework, asked my mom to help with it, she was confused about why I was struggling. I gave a snarky reply: “Well, I’m in the bottom set, what do you expect?”
She let out a very audible gasp, I quickly backtracked saying I said setS, the plural (having a lisp came in handy here). She still seemed unamused though, despite the fact that she knew I was in set 4 from the beginning of the year.

I think that snarky comment I made ruined the illusion that I wasn’t in the bottom set, and now she’s probably going to yammer on and on about how I need to apply myself. 

How can I tell her the truth about being in the bottom set? I don’t think she’ll take it too well, as I’ve basically been lying to her for 6 months, however I didn’t even know I was lying until like 3 weeks ago.

""Competitive"" Schedule: AP Chemistry (2 periods), AP English Rhetoric (or Language? Not particularly sure on the title, it's like analyzation of non-fiction texts), AP Physics, Trig/Pre-Calc, AP Euro, with either AP Art History or AP Computer Science Principals. This would also include me taking French at a local college to continue (it won't fit in my schedule but I want to continue learning), independent P.E. (monthly logs so that I don't have to take gym), and and independent study of my Honors Choir class that I enjoy but also doesn't find room in my schedule.

""Interesting"" Schedule: AP English Rhetoric, AP Physics, Trig/Pre-Calc, AP Euro, Honors Choir, AP Computer Science Principals, and AP Art History. This will require me to take French and independent P.E. in the same way as the ""Challenging"" Schedule. 

I have interest in all of the classes listed, it's just a matter of which would benefit me more in the long run. Thank you in advance for any help!!

340,"My (24F) mother has been unwell for 10 or so years. She has Lupus and breathing difficulties. 5 years ago she was put into an induced coma with severe pneumonia and since November 17 has been hospitalised twice with pneumonia. 
She has gotten a cold again and has pulled a muscle in her back from coughing which is painful. She lives with my Dad (55M) who is her carer. 
They sold their house and brought a bus and travelled around the country for 2 years until recently when my mums health started to decline and the bus life didn’t really suit them. They enjoyed their time away and have lots of great memories. 
They now live in a small granny flat with my sister (28F), her husband (29M) and their daughter (10F) 3 hours away from me. 
This past weekend I visited with my son (1M) and she expressed some pretty morbid things.
For example I was talking about my grandad and that I was going to visit him before I went home “because he’s the only one I have left” she then sighed and said “well these kids (my son and niece) will probably only have one soon as well” she also mentioned several similar things during the course of the weekend which I can’t really remember right now. 
My question is how do I get her to get out of this terrible headspace?
She has no hobbies. Most of the day she spends on the computer doing some photography competitions with photos she has taken previously. 
She never had a job and was a stay at home Mum. She has friends but they all live in another state. I think she’s depressed but will unlikely see a doctor about this.

347,"My husband and I have another couple we’re friends with. Suddenly a few months ago they stopped inviting people to their house. We’ve had just a few things at our house with our closest friends, but haven’t done much really lately either ourselves. 

We think they are thinking we are doing a lot more things without them and are waiting around to see if they’re invited to smaller things. 

I tried reaching out to them to say if they wanted to hang out let us know due to their busy schedule and having a young child, because we didn’t want to invite ourselves to their house since doing things at their house is easier on them. 

Tried inviting them to something recently and they both basically made obviously excuses why they couldn’t make it at the last minute. 

I’m not sure whether to approach them about it and ask if everything’s okay, or take my husbands advice of if they have a problem, they should come to us about it. 

I should add they get super sensitive and easily offended by things, which is what has brought me to this thinking. ",12Mar2018,1
348,"Hey Reddit so I met my ex yesterday for the second time since we broke up about 2 years ago and I think I ruined it all. 

So to give some context to the story, my ex broke up with me about a two years ago (after a year of dating) because I lied to him about a bunch of things. I ended up confessing everything and he broke up with me. It really fucked me up at the time and I've felt so guilty about how it all ended. We ended up going no contact. 

So he ends up messaging me a couple of weeks back and we ended up meeting for coffee which turned into dinner. We had a great time and made plans to meet yesterday. We ended up hanging out and we had a fun time.

Towards the end of the day I asked him why he had invited me to hang out again and he essentially said that he hadn't thought about it. I asked him if it was because he wanted to hookup and he laughed and said he wouldn't be opposed since I looked good. After that he was like ""I mean I can't guarantee that this will be anything more then a one night stand or something. If that makes you uncomfortable theres no pressure to do anything and youre always free to go.""

I ended up hooking up with him and in the middle I started crying. I felt like such an idiot. I started apologizing like crazy and I felt super embarrassed and he assured me that there was nothing to be embarrassed about and he comforted me. 

After I left I send him a message explaining that I felt very very embarrassed but  that I had reacted the way I did because it felt like he was objectifying me to some extent.  He replied and said that he didn't mean it that way at all and he said ""I dont know what will happen in the future and if certainty is what youre looking for, I dont have it. Thats what I was trying to say."" He then said that he had a fun time and that he was sure that we would hang out again. 

I have no idea what to do. Would it be wise to hang out with him again or is he really only doing it for the sex? I enjoy his company so much and I think I would be really hurt if I never saw him again. I dont know how I should interpret the situation and I was wondering what your opinions are. 

TL;DR: I met up with my ex that broke up with me about two years ago and after hanging out and having an amazing day I started bawling in the middle of sex and now I dont know what to do. ",12Mar2018,4

She keeps saying no Steve, we're just friends, but I don't do that just friends shit. She gonna be my wife and that's that."" I couldn't believe what he was saying. It sounded so..wrong. I said ""That sounds a little rapey. If she says no, that means no."" He got very defensive and aggressive. ""Nah dude, it's in the fates! We supposed to be together! She just fighting fate, and she gonna lose. Shes my wife, no friend shit!"" I just stopped and walked away. Some more details. I've also only known Steve for a month. He's 24. She's 20ish I believe.

350,"Ok so I have two simple problems that I can't solve, but there in the same boat. So Saturday night a girl I used to know invited me to a club she works at, so I went and seen her and took my friend with me so he could have a good time too. While there and talking to her I found out she has a boy friend that's in jail, but at the same time she was coming on to me, flirting and kept touching g or hanging on to me. Now the problems I'm having is that was my first time being to a club and I was lucky enough to know her and hang around her, but if she wasn't I wouldn't know what to do or how to act. I guess what I'm asking is how do handle both situations? On one hand she fine as hell but I don't want to come between them, and on the other hand if I decide to not mess with her how do I approach other girls at the club. FYI I'm not a good dancer or a Casanova either. Oh and the reason I'm asking is because I'm  going  back this weekend.",12Mar2018,1
351,"As the title says, I can't seem to manage my priorities and it's bringing me down in every aspect of my life. To give some background, I have been a stay-at-home dad for two years and a full-time online undergrad student for nearly that entire time. I have two little kids (ages 5 and 2) that I watch full-time. My wife's dad offered her a job as his assistant two years ago and that's when we decided to make the switch between our roles in our family so that I could continue my education and obtain my bachelor's in Software Development. While this whole era in my life has had its ups and downs, it has ultimately taken a toll on me that just seems to keep getting heavier as time goes by. There are times where I will focus 90% on school and leave the 10% for my kids, my wife, and my housekeeping priorities (yes, that means turning on the tv and practically ignoring my kids so daddy can study the entire day, save for meal times and whatnot), or I focus 90% on the latter priorities and only occasionally spend my time on schoolwork. Being an online school, this habit is doable as I only need to finish a specific amount of credits by the end of each term, and my frequent changeups of priorities tend to balance it out enough as to where I am able to slide by.

This driven-out dilemma is a constant reminder of how easy it used to be to focus on school while having a small yet fulfilling enough social life and part-time job. I yearn to go back to the days where I could put my entire focus on school and ace my classes without the consistent distractions around me, most of all my children. I love my children more than anything, but I can't seem to give them the full amount of attention they need from me as a parent and caretaker unless I want to fall way behind in school. Even at this point in time, I am far behind where I wanted to be by now and I know that I'm going to have to kick my schooling into motion while kicking my kids to the couch so that I can focus as much as I can, something I commonly have trouble doing.

How do I balance these priorities in my life without quickly burning out? Some people seem to organize their lives so well that I'm left feeling confused and then guilty of laziness because I appear to lack a sufficient work ethic. But I wasn't always lazy, I think I'm just already burning out, doing my best not to succumb to the bordering depression that I fear will eventually cause me to pop.",12Mar2018,1

Last year as a freshman i was super nice to everybody, over time friend groups started distancing themselves because we were in highschool and everybody kind of matured and met new people. My best friends were in a seperate lunch so i just sat alone. Towards the end of the year 3 different special ed kids would sit with me. I would go read in the library or something but they would follow me in. This was all because i was way too nice. Those kids were also super annoying and  had no respect for anyone.

Over the summer i switched schools. I started out with no friends at the new school but it took some time. Now i'm meeting new people to hang out with which are actually pretty cool. Last week one of my friends high fived a special ed kid he knew and that escalated into conversation. This kid only talks about ps4 and nintendo switch all the time. He talks about how he's gonna buy a ps4 so we can play fortnite together. Today i left the people i was walking with so i can sit alone because i wanted to read r/nickofnight ( Really good stories) And this kid followed me and plopped down right next to me. He was sitting super close to me the whole time aswell. I just don't want this to be like last year having all of these kids follow me but i also don't want to be rude because he's also nice kid.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find anywhere that would be suitable for it to live after my lease expired so I was forced to let it live at my girlfriends grandparents with no timetable for my return.  
  
2 years later, I have graduated and the cat has as much personality as ever. Naturally, I miss it since I cared for it when it was young but my girlfriends grandparents also enjoy its company since their cat passed away last year. They even got a nice cat tower that I know it enjoys. Furthermore, her grandpa could be passing away soon leaving her grandma with only her unsuccessful son for company at home.

374,"So I’m mid 20s M and I earn pretty good money for my age. I don’t have a dad and I currently live with my mom. I’ve always lived with my mom as my mom has no where to go. She has about 100K of money (and a little extra) thats been put into downpayment of her house and she’s always in constant worry and stress over money. My sibling and I each give her 500$ per month as we thank her for raising us. 

The problem is I can’t support her 100% my own so she pays half and I pay half, and she’s got no problem with that. She always tells me as a parent, she wants to spend money on us as much as she can as long as she has the money. 

Now, because we share the costs we have to time to time discuss about money and she always gets upset at me when we talk about money. As I said she wants to do a lot for us if she could but she thinks I don’t want to give her too much financial support. She thinks I’m “hesitant” when it comes to spending money on her. Which is not true, because if I had a lot I would do the same for her.

But with all the bills paid, along with the 500$ a month gift to her, I need to save money myself too. There are all sorts of resources saying at least 10-20% of earnings should go into savings. But my mom thinks most people barely save money and they can save by getting big chunks whenever they get tax refund or bonuses. And she thinks me doing that is totally fine. 

I just don’t want to end up like her where I’m old and stressed about money. 

So I really don’t want to fight with my mom anymore and I don’t want to deal with her when she’s upset at me. I can move out if I want and I do want to do that. But I worry about her. How is she going to do everything alone. I’ve been helping her with a lot of work that usually “dads” do for moms. 

My sibling lives in a different country btw. 

When my mom is happy and we get along, I really don’t mind living with her but whenever she gets mad at me I feel miserable and I want to move out as soon as possible. 

I’m not sure what to do. If I move out she will probably go back to our home country, which means my sibling, me, and my mom will all end up in different countries, and I don’t know if that’s a good idea. Us three are the only family members we have. 

Would really appreciate your advice.

I've reviewed some of his examples of speaking in ""code"" and there is nothing unusual about them at all. I'm extremely worried and I don't really know what the best course of action is. It's almost like Josh is two different people. Himself and someone else that he sort of snaps into. Today he talked about a wrecked tractor trailer and I asked him if everyone was ok and if anyone had died. His response was to ask if he was dead, if he had died. He has told me over and over that he is very confused and nothing makes sense.

Please please please help me help him. He does not have insurance or a lot of money, but I believe he needs to speak to a mental health professional of some sort. I looked up some basic symptoms and he aligns very well with schizophrenia, but I'm not a doctor and I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I found a number to call for mental health services provided by the county we both live in (we live in Georgia) and I'm going to call tomorrow.
