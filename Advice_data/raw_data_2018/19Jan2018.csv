1,"Small fry situation compared to some of the other stuff I see on here, but here's the gist, due to my own lack of work ethic and hubris, I will fail my APLang class this semester, I have come to terms with that. I'll be able to make up the credit somehow on my own time, and will strive to do better this last semester and every other class I will not fail. The only problem is that my mother is threatening to take my car away, and  with that I would have to ride the bus, and that is just not something I am wanting to do. I know that I most likely do deserve this punishment, but I'm really trying to do better and want to know how I can possibly talk to her to make her see why it isn't as punishable of an offence.

2,I used to talk a lot with my friends but ever since I started high school they've become distant. We don't hang out at all anymore and some of them have completely stopped talking to me.

3,"Hi,
I have been skater till I destroyed my knee which can't allow me skate this year. I had got surgery few weeks ago.
Beginning of injury was very hard - can't find place and things to do.

I was totally drug free - no drugs, no alcohol, good diet, exercise. Skateboarding is one of the most important things in my life, doing it cleans my head from thinking. Now, I was drunked one time, drunk few beers too, smoke weed, eat sugar, thrash food. I was proactive, now I can't even focus on job. 

What I noticed is that I'm very 'erotic addict'. Because of boredom I started Tinder. I think about pussy pretty all day. I can't walk so I text with girls, watch porn, masturbate. I was porn and masturbation free before!

I'm 24 yo, but I feel that I am way, way more sexual than ever. I always think about pussy, can't focus on myself enough.

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? Is it normal when you lost what you love? How to deal with it. I know... find something other to do. I've tried, but nothing works like skateboarding for me, I love sport.

I want to buy my first car, very fast to just drive. It can be impulse buy and I can regret it, but what to do? How to deal? Please, I rally need help.

4,"About 6 months ago me and my current housemate (21yo)  agreed to move in together, after a few hassles to begin with in terms of actually getting the place together we finally moved in and everything was going great for the first few months.

Apart from the odd little things about living with others that piss you off, there wasn't much to argue about. I've lived with others before and I was fully expecting little quirks to pop up over time. So this isn't what I need to seek advice for.

It should be noted at this point that I spend most of my time in my room, and he basically has the living room and kitchen to himself 90% of the time, I have always been the one that ended up tidying up and cleaning the place after both him and his girlfriend (more on her later)

I went back to my family home over the Christmas break and was there for a month, I knew full well that the house was going to be a bombsite in my absence, So I was extremely clear about which date I was going to be back so that he'd have time to tidy up. Sure enough when I got back he'd ""tidied"" the place, but I could see clear as day it was a sort of patch job to something that was far far worse because in my eyes it was still filthy, but by comparison for him, it was clean. 

I had only come back for a few days, and was going back to my family home for another few days before coming back for the spring term at university, when I got back (only 3 days later) the place had been ruined again, and he honestly didn't seem to give two shits. I was tired from the drive and just went to bed quietly. 

The next day when he comes home from work late at night, I decide it's time to say something serious, now don't get me wrong, he's a nice enough guy and I wouldn't have agreed to move in with him if I hadn't thought so, but his life was literally in the toilet and sinking fast. He will go days on end without showering, he has a number of unknown (to me) skin conditions that come and go causing him to appear to have seriously greasy skin all over combined with rashes and spots, his diet is seriously the worst I have ever witnessed any human have, the number of takeaway pizzas and kebabs/burgers he eats is ridiculous. It's horrible seeing someone who was a good friend just waste their life away.

Then there is his girlfriend, she's 18 and similarly going pretty much no where with her life, she's incredibly immature and from my perspective is dragging him down massively, she too has the same diet, is constantly asking to borrow things off me because she forgets her own (charging cables, ecig juice etc) she clearly grew up very different to me as the one occasion we were going to sit at the dinner table to eat, she genuinely looked disgusted by the idea, proclaiming the dinner table was only for Christmas day. She will shut the living room door, every time she is in there without fail making me feel like I am not welcome in my own house. She is arrogant as hell and quite honestly just not a very nice person all round. 

So I sat down with him and basically laid it all out, being as honest as I could be while trying not to completely go at him. My intention was constructive rather than demeaning and I feel I got it across pretty well, pointing out a few hard truths.

Initially I got the teenager response of 'yeah I know' to everything I said, showing absolutely no consideration for what i was saying to him, clearly at this point I was about to give up and walk away, I nearly did. We had a smoke together and I went back to my game upstairs. The next day I get a text off him that basically said he agreed with what I said and he's going to do something about it and try and turn his life around.

This was just over two weeks ago now, since then I have had a similar chat to his girlfriend after she asked how I got through to him, but asked me in a way that said to me ""why did you get through and not me?! I'm better than you I should be the one"" if you understand what I mean.  I basically snapped at her a little bit and again pointed out a few harsh truths about her life and if she wanted to help him she had to help herself first, she went running to him and I got the standard 'stay out of my relationship, she's my girlfriend and I want to be with her' text about 2 hours later. 

Since all of this, yes, he has started to keep the house clean and tidy, it's been happening in bits, but it is a massive improvement so far, but he has done absolutely nothing to help himself out at all, and best of all (why i am writing this at nearly midnight) he now stays awake until 2-3am every night and either has the TV up really loud, or is giggling to a video on his phone in his room (with no headphones in) through very thin adjoining walls. Or he is cooking until late at night and banging around in the kitchen, or if he has his girlfriend round, they are talking and she screeches late at night with absolutely no regard for anyone else, we have neighbors attached too on both sides. 

I'm tempted to leave him a note warning him about his inconsideration (being non descript) tomorrow morning and warning that retaliation will be swift. Meaning if he does it again tomorrow night (this is day 5, and each day I have to be up early for university, meaning I've had a groggy week) I will get up early on Saturday and play some nice loud music super early. Tit for tat, I know it's petty, but it's that or I go and cut the cable to the speakers inside his tv.

Any advice from anyone about what to do to help him start making a difference in his life and help him not stay at the dead end job forever, and any advice for what to do about him keeping my up all night every night will be greatly appreciated, I'm sorry to waffle so much, I've been keeping it in for a while and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it.

10,"I’ve always been most strong at english, history, the arts, but when it comes to anything STEM, i just crash and burn. Right now I have a B+ in biology and an A- in Geometry, these may not seem bad but it’s just so frustrating how my report card is stained with these, while everything else is A. My friends score so high on tests in math and science and I feel like a moron. I’ve been struggling with math since elementary school, but biology this year has been kicking my ass so far. I’m right at the end of the first semester of freshman year, and I’m really disappointed in myself.
It’s just like....things don’t click for me in math or science. The formulas and rules all turn into mumble jumble in my head yet I can tell Stalin’s life story off the top of my head. I can analyze texts and information really well, but that strength only extends far into words. My highest grade right now is in SPANISH, I have a 103%!! Do I have some sort of learning disability when it comes to things like this?? I don’t plan on doing anything STEM related after high school, I want to be a journalist or something in media anything that has to do more with people and history and information, but I’m worried that colleges won’t think I’m well rounded since I’m struggling so hard.

11,"Hey all,  

Lately I feel like Ive been obsessed with my phone. I usually go through these waves of being normal self esteemed, then way down to absolutely none and constantly seeking validation from social media/texting. Each of these valleys seems to get lower and lower. Especially low since my gf moved away for an internship for the semester. I miss her a ton and I thought the start of school would help distract me but Ive sunk even lower since the first day on tuesday.  

For example today I woke up and spent about an hour on reddit, was late to class. After class I saw a snap from my gf and ended up checking her and my insta and facebook accts for about 10 minutes waiting for my truck to warm up. Got home and decided to get back on instagram before making food, another hour wasted. All the while constantly checking to see if people opened the snapchat I just sent out.  

This pattern continued pretty much all day until now. I just got out of my bed and decided to write this post after spending 2 hours on youtube watching dark souls 3 videos.  

Im driving myself crazy, and I know Im driving my gf crazy too since I usually end up texting or snapping her every two hours. Its hard not to constantly think about her when Im on my phone for 11 hours a day.  

Anyone have some advice on how to overcome cell phone addiction? Ive considered leaving it at home all day but idk that just seems extreme.  

Of course its hard for me to provide all the context in my life to effectively seek advice but I feel the true problem for me mentally right now is my addiction to receiving texts/snap chats from my friends and gf. I seriously crave it now, and when someone leaves me on read it absolutely ruins my day. Ill even spend time planning out my snaps for the day to try and trigger specific responses from people. Its absolutely unhealthy behavior but I dont know how to stop without losing it.

Thanks in advance.",19Jan2018,12

15,"(I am not asking for relationship advice although my past relationship and current sex life have something to do with what I am going through.)

So kick back a month and half ago I got out of my toxic relationship, the next day I slept with someone else, my ex found out and she told me she was pregnant, after a month of not knowing what was going to happen she told me she terminated it, and now she is seeing some new guy. (I don't think I care?) 

Anyways push forward to January the 8th, I had a good Christmas and New Year with my family and friends and have now returned to university to finish my 1st semester. 1st semester I slacked a lot and never went in although still achieved decent grades but I could do better which this semester I am aiming to do. 

While I have been back I have spent about £1500 on impulse buys, nights out, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs (not anything super bad just like party drugs) and unhealthy food such as take out food. I have given an amount of £750 for my parents to look after for me, that's all well and good. 

Another problem is that I can not stop masturbating i'll do it up to 6 times day if i get the chance and have also slept with 3 different women in 3 consecutive days. (I might also note that the ADHD medication I only take to study increases my sex drive a lot, I have tried to get into contact with the people that prescribe my medication but they do not respond to my emails or answer phone messages, I can not study with out that medication).

I can not find the motivation to exercise, i have never fully been committed to a healthy lifestyle. on the last note my friends and I agreed to live together next year for university, I no loner wish to do this but do not know how to break it to them. I am also on the verge of getting kicked out of my university accommodation as I am on a last warning (I've had noise complaints because of my speakers in the lounge and my small after parties I have removed my speakers from the lounge and into my bedroom). 

I know this all might sound really petty but I honestly don't know what is up with me right now and how I am feeling? Am I trying to fill a void, am i just young and stupid? Is this because of my ex? I really do not know and would like some some different eyes on my situation. 

TIA

18,"I have been working in the same industry for nearly 15 years (human services). It's the only thing I have ever done. I received my undergraduate degree (BA Philosophy) 9 years ago, and that certainly helped propel me into some high-paying positions. Due to some career turbulence, those high-paying positions have pretty much dried up and I am now making far less than I once did and I have some really good reasons to believe that this trend is permanent. I have pretty much come to hate what I do. Despite having made a name for myself in this industry, I am so jaded and burnt out that I fight tooth and nail to scrounge up enough energy to pretend that I care about the work I do. I want out, but I feel like I am trapped down this career path. Starting over terrifies me because I cannot afford to make less money than I do now in some new industry. Also, I absolutely cannot afford more formal education to switch careers. It doesn't help that I have no idea what I would like to do. Nothing appeals to me and I have grown very depressed over this over the past year or so.

24,"Here's what led up to this. Last June, I went to a math camp to learn number theory in the summer leading up to 11th grade. And I fucked up. It was pretty hands off, so I didn't take care of myself well. I spent a lot of time playing Minecraft with other people and sometimes skipped class. I inevitably failed the course and wasted my parents money, and I now feel very bad for doing so and wish I had thought of things in that perspective earlier.

Come early August, my parents find out that I failed the course, and they ground me from video games and take my phone away until Christmas. Initially, things were very restricted; the parents would take the router with them whenever they left the house, but as time passed, they became more trusting of me and were willing to keep the router at home in order for me to be able to watch TV shows (which I was not banned from).

However, my parents started to adjust their punishments for my two favorite games, Minecraft and Town of Salem (I have a MacBook Air, so my computer cannot handle many games). First they said that I would only get Minecraft back after Christmas if I had Straight As (I would consider myself a bright and capable student, but I am also taking 5 AP courses this year), and then they  said that even if I had straight As, I would only get Minecraft back over Christmas Break. For Town of Salem, which I was not as attached to, my parents said that I would get it back after Christmas Break regardless, but then changed the punishment so that I would only get it back during Christmas Break.

One downside to this is that without my phone or video games, I basically lost all contact to my video game friends. One of my friends asked if I was alive, and I lost touch with many friends. I have since regained those friendship through occasional video games (usually when my parents are not home) and texting. However, to quote my parents, ""online friends don't count"", and according to them they are not nearly as meaningful as IRL relationships. However, I will not only discuss video games with them but also personal life, and the connections I feel with some people are very real, even if I have not met them in person. 

Come Christmas time, my lowest grade is a B+, of which I have two (in AP Calculus and AP US History). My parents give me my phone back as well as a new mouse to replace my old gaming one. However, recently they found Minecraft on my desktop and took my mouse and mousepad away. They said that I will get it back when I start going out more (like once a week) and when I seem more responsible. However, I feel like I have strong relationships with people whom I can talk to about personal things regardless of whether I go out with them often. I also feel like the rules they have regarding this are veery loose and can be changed easily, which I have seen them do.

I have tried to recognize my faults. I am completely responsible for failing out of my number theory class. I did not manage myself well and was obviously not mature enough to handle a college-like experience. And I think my parents have good intentions in their rules, and they want me to succeed and be the best I can be. However, I feel as if their punishments are too extreme and took away part of my life that I enjoyed and found other people who also felt the same.

If he actually got a job in his career we’d prob be fine but he continues to take job way below his masters. I’m here unable to focus on my masters because I’m too busy paying bills and struggling. It’s extremely hard to focus on my career under all of this stress. I could move back home but my commute would be way over an hour and I don’t have the best relationship with my mom. We got in a physical altercation a few months before I moved out and she’s a total narcissist. We could move out into his Moms but the whole house has a mold problem and she’s an extreme hoarder like she legit has cake mix with 1990 as the expiration date and says it’s good if you try to throw things out she will go through the garbage and take it out . I threw out stained T-shirt’s that had holes in them that were mine and she took them out of the garbage. His mom also makes me feel extremely uncomfortable I have never had a problem paying her for letting me stay but when I use the blow dryer once and I get blamed for the electric bill skyrocketing while she has an electric car doesn’t bode for a positive environment. Just say hey I would like X amount for the bills that’s totally fine don’t talk shit about how I’m the problem when I’m legit in the other room and can hear everything. I’m just asking for advice. Do I stick this out what do I do. I feel alone and I feel as if I have no guidance right now. ,19Jan2018,1
38,"Whenever I read something, I would occasionally read it again to really understand what it is saying because of my lack of grasp of what exactly is being said. I noticed I have had a rather large issue of being unable of comprehending things. This is a common issue in school, where whenever I'd have to do a task, I'd usually forget the what to do after reading it, or I'd watch something and be unable to re-say what I have actually watched. I basically have trouble having an impression of anything. I always lose focus on what I was doing. I can't uphold anything. I always miss out on deadlines and whenever someone'd talk to me, most of the times I'm nodding even though I don't even know what is going on. I'd understand what a person is saying on their first sentence, but afterward, my mind just ignores a lot it, confused and combuzzled (I think that's a word, right?)

These issues are especially troubling when growing into a family with rather large expectations, and when I can't reach these expectations, which I have by the slimmest margins, they mourn and mourn to me about my grades, until it hits a point where everything is hard. Nothing gets easier, it all gets harder, and I can't adjust. I'm already in a presumed ""advanced"" class in school and everybody I see has a fair understanding of what they should be doing and how to do it. They have goals they want to fulfill. They are devoted to their work and they work hard to achieve it. I can't say I'm one of these people. I understand that these people are human and that they are probably going through the same thing, but even the least capable people seem to grasp what they are doing-ish.

Anyways I'm just here to ask what should I do? Any advice/solution for my lack of ability to focus and coherently understand large developed things?

For Chemistry, I recently swapped in-class chemistry 12 to online chemistry 12, but I still haven't started yet because the teacher hasn't contacted me. I have until March to finish all of chemistry 12 so that I can send my report to the universities I've applied to, but I don't know if I can make it in time.

43,"Context: I am a white teenaged girl who lives (and attends) what is imo a pretty diverse high school, given the multitude of students of various faiths and ethnic backgrounds who attend it. For starters, my school has practicing Buddhists, Christians, Jewish kids, Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs (in addition to a lot of people who are either agnostic or not fully committed to the faith they grew up with). In terms of ethnicities, there are a lot of multiracial or biracial people, and fairly large Latino/Hispanic/Asian/African-American populations (there are quite a few people of Middle-Eastern/Indian descent as well), so though the student body is still mostly white, it's pretty diverse. 

As a result, my friend group is as well: I have a lot of close friends of various descents, Latin and Asian in particular (my boyfriend is Peruvian), and I don't pay much attention to this most of the time, except I feel like I'm secretly prejudiced and it bothers me, because I don't want to be this way.

3 examples of why I feel prejudiced: 

1. I (inexplicably) find the idea of meeting the mothers (and just the mothers) of my Latino friends to be intimidating as hell, despite the fact that the Mom of two of my friends is really freaking nice, and I'm pretty sure my other friend's Moms are too. I can't explain this at all because I've never been intimidated by the idea of meeting my Asian friends' mothers, etc.

2. I'm scared of meeting my boyfriend's Mom (father is out of the picture) because I feel like I'm not worthy to be his girlfriend sometimes since I'm white as fuck, and it makes me feel like his Mom will automatically hate me for not sharing their heritage.

3. I was texting one of my (Mexican) guy friends back in November, and we got to talking about the World Cup (this was during the qualifiers). I don't remember the exact conversation, but he said he was a fan of Mexico's team and I joked he'd better root for Team USA too (not intending to write off Mexico). He thought I meant that he couldn't root for Mexico, I quickly backtracked and apologized, and he realized what I actually meant, but I still feel guilty about that to this day.

44,"This is so weird and unexpected to me.  I have been estranged from my mother fornearly twenty years; at first it was my choice as I came to terms with an abusive childhood.  She was not the source of the abuse, directly, but she certainly allowed a lot of it to happen in the name of religion.  As I matured (in college) I began to deal with the abuse issues and I clearly stated to her how I felt about it.  This resulted in her abandoning the religion to a large degree, but then leaning heavily on me for support/approval/explanation.  I couldn't handle that, while still trying to make something of my own life, and I cut ties with her.  That was twenty years ago.  

In the meantime  I found a loving and supportive wife and we have a 17 year old daughter together.  I interacted with my mother only on a couple of occasions in the meantime:  she developed some slow progressing dementia and I hardly knew her as time went on.  I never felt strongly about her, positive or negative, but I did not enjoy being around her.  I did not keep in touch.

Now she is dying, mostly because her dementia is preventing her from taking care of herself or allowing others to take care of her.  I felt the need, only very suddenly, to visit her and let her know that I am not angry at her, and that I am thankful for so much of the creativity that she instilled in me.  

I will be driving around 4 hours to get to the facility that she is in.  I assumed that neither my wife nor my daughter would be interested in going; I also did not want them to go - the loneliness and strangeness of the whole situation, combined with the fact that my wife does not think highly of any of my family (and rightfully so), led me to decide to go alone.

I did not come right out and say it that way, but I did eventually say it.  My wife said she wanted to ""be there for me"" and I said that I did not need her to, and that it wasn't worth having her make the trip (logistics of our small farm, horrible weather, her health has been a bit poor lately).

She was horribly insulted and hurt that I did not need her to go with me, and that I did not want her to go.  I have explained how I feel about it as best I can - I am not devastated by my mother's pending death but the whole thing is very confusing and strange to me.  I can't foresee how I will feel when I am there, nor what will transpire.  And I don't want to have my wife around, then.

My wife sees it as a rejection of her.  I don't mean it that way, although that is exactly what it is.  I don't want anyone with me for the drive.  I want to be alone with my thoughts.  I may encounter a bother who is an alcoholic, whom I mostly avoid.  I love him but I can't interact with him in a real sense because he is almost always drunk.  My wife cant stand him, and for good reason.  If I see him I want to deal with him as I see fit - because my trip here is not about him.  But I don't want to her from her about him - and I told her as much.  I don't want any of that.  I just want quiet, I want to know what I am thinking, and feeling, and doing, and saying.  Because it is bigger for me than I imagined that it would be.

My question/advice request:  At this point, I just want to cease all other interaction and go and get it over with.  I sort of understand my wife's perspective, but I am angry - really angry - at the thought of even taking the time to discuss it with her at present.  So Im drinking wine and telling myself just get up in the morning and go, and deal with whatever when I get back.  Am I being ridiculous here?",19Jan2018,1

For a few weeks now, I’ve (21F) been consistently talking to a guy (28) from Tinder. I’ve kind of grown of fond of him for whatever reason and I think the feeling is at least semi-mutual.

He’s asked me a couple times to hang out and though initially I had legitimate reasons why I couldn’t. Now, though, I’ve had to be completely honest and let him know that my self esteem is super low and I’m just really anxious about it. He’s been pretty cool and understanding about it, but he has told me he does want to meet.

Some bouts of depression, mania and anxiety but way more under control since I got medicated a while back.

I’m not someone that needs to be in a relationship and have no problem being single for a year or two if I’m enjoying life, being single or whatever. I don’t date people unless I see serious potential, although casual stuff is a-ok.

The problem: when I am in a serious relationship it usually starts fast and furious, sex all the time, I’m usually more into it than them and they are usually above average desirable girls by most people’s standards. Then within 4-8 months they usually become more into it than I am, I become extremely sexually bored with them and the constant thoughts of being with other women starts to cause me significant mental strain. I may even love these women and have deep feelings for them, but my sex life goes from near constant to struggling just to meet their needs.

I had a huge crush on this boy (we’ll call him Jay). I asked all of my friends and some of Jay’s friends if I should ask Jay out. They said go for it and that he’ll accept my heart. Unfortunately, he didn’t. I was rejected via a mutual friend..
I never found out why until a year later when the mutual friend told me he rejected me for “not being pretty nor popular enough”. I was over it by then, but hearing it reopened the wound. I guess I want to know why he rejected me.. I want to hear it from him. I don’t have any feelings left.. I think it’d allow me to move forward though and ignore the past..

We have had several discussions about training him not to but she refuses to use negative reenforcement and instead gives him treats when he is attacking my cat. (She does this whenever he looks away from the cat or walks away to encourage him to leave her alone I guess.) 
Obviously this hasn't worked because the dog tried to attack my cat today and luckily I was there to intervene but he bit into my hand pretty deep. That bite was meant for my cat though and I'm pissed.

I am at a 1.8 GPA and it needs to be a 2.  I am a sophomore and my college gives you the choice of either living on campus or living on your own after this semester.  Applications for apartments around here start really soon.  My conundrum here is that if I don't get a 2.0 this semester then I will not be able to come back here.  I don't want to end up signing a lease to an apartment that I'd need to pay for if I get kicked out.  So my question is should I stay on campus next year or live off campus?

My brother who is younger but is 21 also lives here.

I start a new job next Tuesday, 1st shift. I have to be up at 5:45 to be at work at 6:45 in the morning. 

The problem is we have a history of not getting along. 
Hes generally disrespectful and gets of work late and makes a lot of noise.
After living with him for a long time I found he enjoys grinding peoples gears for a reaction.
My mother gets stressed out if we argue and she has heart issues so I try to keep my peace even though I would like to take him down a peg I don't want to make her unhappy.
This makes a great environment for him because my parents won't rock the boat as he will be rude.

My question is what do I do?

If im trying to sleep at night and he comes in the house making noise and having others over how do I deal with that in a mature way.

You may think, just talk to him.
Well ive tried and thought about that but the problem is he likes to know what he is doing is working and it will make it worse.

Ive thought I could just physically solve the problem and I do believe it would work but anything short of that he doesnt feel the repercussions as my mom and dad will not stand by me and will just tell him to keep it down which he will nod and continue his antics.

If talking it out won't work and I cant get mean about it due to not wanting to stress my mom out to the point of a heart attack what options does that leave me? I'm at wits end.

98,"Hi

I've never thought I'd get to a point where I'm asking online for advice, but it seems anonymously is the way to go.

I feel like I have no one to turn to about this. Not my parents, siblings, GC, teachers, friends, nobody. 

Backstory:
Its my junior year, and I started off pretty strong. Im usually an A-B student, and I used to be ranked pretty highly in my school. This year though has taken a pretty bad turn for me. I've had a lot of personal problems, ones i cant turn to my parents about, and I can't talk to my GC about it because my GC legally has to tell my parents.

It's not drugs, but due to what my parents believe I know I just cant tell them. And I feel very alone with it, to the point where my grades started to plummet.

My parents are very strict people, and they've been very confused as too why I suddenly am not performing like I normally do. I got sick a lot due to being more vulnerable, missed a lot of school, and got to a point where my grade in AP Physics has dropped to a 32 and it seems like I'm not trying / I don't care anymore.

I've tried to self advocate, but it's hard to come up with an excuse to teachers and parents when the real excuse has to be kept a secret. I truly do care, and everyday for two weeks I'd go in an hour early to school to see if I could fix it, or talk to my teacher about it, but each time I got to the door I'd somehow convince myself to turn away and go somewhere else, completely neglecting my problems.

The semester ends next week on Tuesday, and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I just can't keep going anymore. I've fallen sick with the flu so i've missed most of this week, and my physics teacher has gotten very exasperated with me. I feel too afraid to even go into his class to talk to him anymore.

My parents and I get into fights everyday now about it, and it's straining our relationship more and more, especially since I can't explain my reasoning for falling out of loop.

It's gotten to the point where everyday I contemplate suicide.

I've never felt like this before, and I don't know where to go from here. I just need to figure out how to fix my situation.

Sorry if this sounds nonsensical.",19Jan2018,1
99,"I dont know where else to go so I amade a throwaway for obvious reasons. I graduated college in May of 2017 with a BS in physics. Since then, I have applied to 150 jobs ranging across all sorts of industries and had my second interview today with an amazing startup company (7 million dollars invested in first year). Needless to say, I felt so underqualified and insecure when asked what Ive been doing since I graduated 8 months ago.

Where do I start? I guess with this: I couldnt tell him the truth. I've been battling with severe depression since then and have even had a failed suicide attempt that no one knows about. I ended up in the hospital and still struggle with suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. 

Why you might ask? I was left a VERY SUBSTANTIAL amount of money from my grandfather who is the only sort of adult that believed and cared about my ambitions as a child to become a scientist. I am incredibly...I guess was incredibly passionate about physics. He died before I graduated and Ive been dealing with that ever since it happened. Ive been living as frugal as possible so I can save that six figure amount for what it is meant for, graduate school.

My girlfriend and friends are paying back there student loans and me? Im watching myself get older without doing shit besides play videogames to distract myself from how horribly depressed I am.

Every day is a struggle. I can't do anything anymore. I dont believe in myself. Im ruining my 4 year long relationship with the gorgeous love of my life. She loves me even though I was initially cold and emotionally detached because of a semi-rough childhood. I'm distancing myself from friends. Im obssessed with just finding a basic entry level job so I can start a career or at least have relevant experience to get into a grad program. 

This all might seem like rambling and I guess it sort of is...I just, really need advice because I have no family or support group. My girlfriend has no idea how close I am to driving down an isolated road and biting the bullet so she can live a happy life without me. It's strangely enough become therapeutic. I'm starting to look forward to when I do it because this constant agony and despair (I truly mean constant) is all I am now. A shell of a man. Having any chunck of success has consumed me and Ive failed. I cant understand why my peers have been emoloyed for months and I just got a second interview when I went above and beyond the requirements for my degree.

102,"Geez this is weird to post. Throwaway account, obviously. 

Alright, here’s the details. We’ve been married nearly ten years. We’ve got a toddler, and we’re both working professionals. We maybe have sex once or twice a month, and it’s always me who initiates it. We have never discussed masturbation by either of us, as weird as that may sound to many of you. I’m sure she knows I jack off, but I’ll be honest I have no idea if she does, and would honestly be pleasantly surprised if I learned that she did. When we do have sex it’s usually pretty good, albeit quick. She always seems very satisfied based on her moaning. She’s just a very conservative type of girl when it comes to sex (although very liberal politically, not that that has nothing to do with anything). I guess what I’m getting at is that she just doesn’t talk much about sex and has never been the one to initiate it, but when we do have sex, like I said, it seems to be enjoyable for both of us. 

So here’s my question: would a sex toy (such as the Lelo sonic stimulator) be just...weird? My thoughts are, we don’t really do gifts for each other, aside from me sending her flowers at work is she’s working that day. We have everything we need; we have pretty good jobs. Certainly not rich by any means but we’re very comfortable. But a sex toy is the LAST thing I can imagine her ever getting for herself, but at the same time I honestly could see her using it if she knew she had a few hours alone at home, and I totally would do everything in my power to give her that at least once a week (via picking up the kid at daycare and just taking her back to work with me at the office). But like I said, my wife is kind of a prude when it comes to sex, so we’d never be able to “plan it” per se, but I feel like if she had this, and I knew she was off work, that I could say like “hey I’ve got the kid, will be here at the office for a few more hours just a heads up.” And she could feel free to go to town. Thing is, she needs to have that release. She works all the time, and since being parents we just don’t have the schedule for sexy time anymore. 

This whole post makes me feel perverted. But the pervert in me LOVES the idea of her getting off to this, assuming she’d like it. Maybe even let me fill her up after she’s warmed up to it for a bit. 

Fuck sake...I’m getting hot and bothered at the prospect. Please tell me this is not a totally crazy valentines gift.

He called a prostitute from TX... We live in VA. But...he had just informed he had a work trip to TX in a couple of weeks.

Last week he went for a ""massage'. And I just didn't feel good about him going. Later that night I saw his phone and he called 3 times to a prostitute. He said he did that to ""aliviate himself"" before the massage. But he withdraw money, $130 to be more exact which is exactly the amount the escort charged for 30min - Yes, I called the number. He said he went to a massage place a x street and had massage with Anna. I called all massage places... No Anna.
Also I pulled his phone history (which he doesn't know can be done easily by just logging in into your cell provider website) and he had called the same number before. I just can't see his account to confirm if he withdraw money those days. 
He never has money or need to withdraw money, he uses his ATM card for everything.

My father is very strict about academics and will get angry at not only me, but other family members as well if you don’t do something his way. 

For example, a few weeks ago I was selecting courses for school next year and decided that I should be able to choose on my own without asking my dad what HE wants ME to do. Once I told him I had already submitted my courses he was extremely angry, yelled at me and called me stupid.

I maintain mid to high 90’s in all my courses while taking piano lessons and joining different sports and clubs at school, yet my dad reinforces a strict no games/tv rule on the weekdays regardless if you have no work to do. 

Today, I finished my work and already practiced piano so I decided to play some video games despite it being against the rules, which I know was wrong of me to do. Since he saw me, he yelled at me and told me to go to bed, which I did. I then overheard him talking with my mom and comparing me to other people’s kids and saying how I would never make it to university and I was a failure.

Hearing this made me feel hurt, I constantly feel like I’m never doing enough to be the child he wishes I was. I went into his room and confronted him saying that I finished all my work and had nothing else to do so that’s why I played. He didn’t reply and so I went back to my room to go to bed. He came in a few moments later and started to threaten me about taking away my phone, laptop etc.. This was the first time I truly feared him. Not because he was threatening to take my phone but because he kept bringing his hand down and every time and I thought he was going to hit me. 

Every time after an incident like this I try to hate him, but I can’t, and I continue talking to him like nothing ever happened.

The thing is that the subject is way too advanced for us. He even admited that he used that on his doctoral thesis and nobody understands anything.

We want to talk to him but the students that already had him as a teacher describe him as a ""child"". They say that if we ask him to teach what he is suposed to he will have a grudge against a student or the whole class and retaliate by making impossible tests.

I should point out that I'm in Mexico, universities here work different than those in the U.S.

117,"My dream job is an English teacher, I love literature and to spread that to students is something I’ve wanted for a long time. But my parents do not want me to be a teacher because of the low pay. I respect their opinion because both of them were teachers at one point, so they speak from experience. They also said that if the job I get after college does not pay well, they won’t pay for any tuition, loans, etc. I decided to  possibly major in business in college, because it leads to higher paying jobs, but I’m super bummed that I can’t pursue English, which is my passion. 

Overall, I love and respect my parents wishes 100% because I know they want me to have a good life thats better than theirs, because that’s what all good parents want. How can I please them, but also be happy?

Also, I’m a junior in high school and going to be selecting courses for senior year to prepare myself for college. I have some time to finalize what I’ll do in college, but double majoring is a no, and so it’s come down to choosing a better paying job or one that I love more. ",19Jan2018,5

I don’t know how it happened. One minute I was 6 years old playing with dolls in my room, the next I am applying for credit cards while searching for jobs. 

Since I started college I have always had a hard time accepting the fact that there’s no way to stop aging. And, to be fair, I still haven’t learned. that’s why I’m here.

121,"My wife and I, aged 24 and 26 respectively, moved from NYC to the Bay Area 9 months ago after I received a job offer. We jumped at the idea of adventuring west to have greater independence from familiar surroundings and opportunity to grow as a couple away from a safety net. We went to high school and college together in NJ, and started working in NYC right away so this has been the first time in our lives that we were able to be fully autonomous. Since moving to the Bay Area, we have adopted a healthier lifestyle (hiking more, vegetarian diets, etc.) and really enjoy the laid-back lifestyle as it feels more suited to our personalities. 

After living here for 7 months, I was laid-off. My wife, who was finishing up a bootcamp for UX Design, was also unemployed so we took the opportunity to travel. During our travels we spoke a lot about having kids and starting a family in the near future (2-3 years). My wife and I both want children relatively young and this is the first time we've felt the most personally ready. Before I was laid-off, we were thinking of buying a condo/apt here and trying to set up roots, but since being unemployed, we really don't have anything keeping us here. Additionally, it is really really hard to break into the real estate market in the Bay Area. 

Basically, we find ourselves tempted by the idea of moving home for the familiarity and for the ability to save money for our future, but we don't feel ready to give up our autonomy and desire to continue exploring.

We are aware it is more practical to move home and that it probably makes the most financial sense especially if we want to start a family in the near future (not to mention we will want to ultimately live nearby family once we have kids of our own), but everyday we flip flop on whether to stay or to go home.

Below are the options we are currently evaluating:

1. Move back home with family in NJ to save money, but sacrifice autonomy, chance to continue adventuring, and overall lifestyle we've adopted.

2. Stay in Bay Area understanding it will be difficult to save as much $$ as the cost of living is significantly higher. 

3. Move to a new area, likely in the Pacific Northwest with lower cost of living (ie suburb of Portland, Seattle, etc.), as a medium to the above options.

122,"The other day I went out on with a girl (5 days ago to be exact). We met on Tinder, but we go to the same college and know some of the same people. We had a great time, or what I though was a great time. We got coffee and chatted for a couple hours. There weren't any awkward breaks in the conversation and everything seemed to flow pretty naturally considering it was a first date. She seemed to enjoy the time just as much as I did. I walked her home (she lives a minute away from me, the plus side and downside of college). At the end of the night we kissed and parted ways. I texted her the next day and got no response. Then I texted her the following day, and once again, no response. I know that no response is usually a sign that they're not interested, but I'm just confused as to why she let the date go on for so long and why she would kiss me at the end if she didn't have a good time?

I'm thinking about texting her in a couple days to let her know that it's okay if she's not interested, but I just want to ask her what went wrong/why she isn't responding given the way the date went.

125,"This past week I (25yo) was watching The Bachelor with my friend and her roommate Katy. There was a girl named Bibiana on the show that was behaving really childishly and (BACHELOR SPOILER COMING UP RIGHT NOW) she was kicked off the show. It was at this point where I, for some idiotic, unknown reason decided to comment on her childish behavior and say “Well maybe that’s the reason she’s 30 and still single.”  I know. This is a completely ridiculous thing to say and it is very offensive and insensitive, and not a minute after I said that, my friend texted me and reminded me that Katy is 30 and single. I have no idea why I said it because I believe it is absolutely 100% okay to be single at 30 or at any age for that matter! I honestly have no idea where the comment came from. I put my foot in my mouth, didn’t think before I spoke, and said something very rude. Katy had no reaction to it, and we all kept watching the show. But I feel terrible for saying this. I have no idea if Katy even caught the comment or was offended by it, but I feel horribly that I might’ve made her feel insecure about being single. I’ve only hung out with her once, but I want to apologize to her, but I also feel like I should probably just leave it alone and not make a big deal out of it in fear of making it worse. What do you guys think? Should I just drop it or should I apologize to her?

136,"My brother tortures my sister with indirect comments all the time. 24h nonstop. It drives her crazy when she's so young (middle schooler). My brother (also middle schooler) hates my family. If that's not the reason why he makes every person in the family mad, then it's a mental illness. He takes advantage of everything. I'm the oldest sibling (high schooler) from the three children. When my father is around, my brother's attitude settles down and tries to stay on his side. For reasons, my father works at a different country currently. Without him, an year and a half has passed and the rest of the family were so pissed off by my brother. At breakfast or dinner, it usually ends up with everyone mad. My brother randomly says something bad to my sister and my mom tells him to stop. Then my brother starts ranting about how my sister started first and questions why he is always scolded. The tone of his voice when he rants is so bad. It's like Hitler squealing in a high pitched voice with loud volume. His facial expression describes the about-to-cry and annoying face. He doesn't clean the bathroom sink after he used it and it's so disgusting. In the past, I was too defensive around him so I just settled down and cleaned it up myself. Nowadays, my brother is slightly acting like I'm my father. Truth is, when we were younger, I always played the servant and my brother the master. He treated me like a slave and I didn't know it was bad. As we grew, I became more and more angry at this golem for years. This kid wrecked my happy family future. This kid bleeded my head with a sharp object and didn't even feel the slightest shame. This kid broke my wrist for winning a badminton game. This kid is the very demon I faced in this small house. So, as I grew up, I punched and kicked him more and more often. As I violently tried to teach that his behavior is making everyone angry, he didn't learn anything. He just kept cursing and yelling at me for being an ugly brother that he was embarrassed of. He tried to fight back but I usually punched him more to stop him. Usually my mom stops me shortly after and scolds me for doing such thing. This woman is stupid. She does not believe that she is raising a mentally ill minded child. She hates him very much, yes, but she doesn't let me punish him. I tried scaring him by showing that I had the most intense intent of killing him. That's why he's slightly leaned towards me. Now, he tortures my sister more because he lost his toy, which was me. When my sister and brother are alone in the house, I can't even imagine what he does. My sister once told me he used a knife to threaten her. My sister developed a very sour personality because of him. I get angry and violent pretty easily now. My mom is just so stressed and sad because my father isn't here. When my father left, the pandora's box was opened.

140,"Say I'm craving pizza, but then some friends walk into the room saying, ""Hey, Mudkip, we're getting kinda hungry, but we're not sure what to get. Where do you think we should go?"" It's at that moment the craving vanishes as if it never existed to begin with, instantly replaced only by thoughts like ""Well, this guy likes x food, but the other dude prefers y food, so I gotta find someplace that works as a compromise."" It's not even that I get uncomfortable voicing my opinion, I just actually stop having one.

This has been a problem for me for most of my life. I can only assume that it was a sort of defense mechanism I developed as a child against constant disappointment at not having my thoughts/desires even slightly taken into consideration, like with the food/restaurant example. I can only begin to slowly regain a much weaker opinion if specifically asked, ""We're down for pretty much anything. Maybe there's something *you* wanted?"" Other than this example, it just boils down to ""Is there any way someone might disagree with you on any level? If no, continue wanting the thing very cautiously.""

142,"I can't concentrate. I'm a just-turned 18 year old highschool student with Asperger's Syndrome (and, if we're being honest, maybe also undiagnosed something else), and I recently started on an online homeschooling platform that's preparing me for a standardized exam at the end of the calendar year, which I'm doing from the library.

However, I can not concentrate. When I got the textbooks, I did a lot of the offline stuff immediately from the dining room table, and within a week I had done a significant amount of work. However, then my dad instructed me that I should work from the library, where I can not concentrate, and lots of the work involves using computers, which I can not concentrate while using. I mentioned this the first day, then when my dad did not relent and said that I had to work the way that I was instructed to I started lying.

I've been lying for about a month now, saying that I'm making progress on my work when in reality I can stare at an online worksheet for twelve hours a day and get absolutely nothing done. The past two-ish weeks I've been redditing and being on other forums in the time that I'm meant to be doing online work, because I determined that it would be about as productive to do this as it would be to stare at my work not doing it, and maybe I'll find some way to be able to concentrate on my work.

I have been unable to concentrate on my work, and I doubt I'll be able to keep up the charade much longer. I can not confront my parents about it because they will only take away what small enjoyment I have in my free time (however little of it there is) and make me ""work"" (or stare at the page unable to concentrate) every waking hour of the day, and, despite being 18, I live in a country where I am not a citizen on a dependent visa from my dad, so I can't just leave. I lack a highschool diploma (that's what this is for) so I can't apply to college. At the moment, I have no realistic way of getting back to America (where I am a citizen) with what small amount of money I have.

The best course of action that I can see from where I am is to find some way to be able to concentrate on my work, but I'm at a complete and total loss in terms of what to do. I've posted a few things on Stackexchange's new Personal Productivity, and they've repeatedly recommended Pomodoro, which doesn't work, so I made a new question explicitly stating that the Pomodoro technique does not work on me. The only advice I got was ""slack off until you get bored"", which, even when I get bored, doesn't help my concentration.

My inability to concentrate on my work has started fucking up other parts of my life, including making me contemplate suicide with a much greater frequency than normal and making me much more reliant on a few friends that I made through the internet (not reddit, so there's no point in snooping) for emotional support (I lack friends in real life). Aside from one subject, they're all things that I formerly really loved learning about as little as two months ago, but now I dread every waking moment of my life because of these subjects.

I'm a straight guy (on reddit too, shocker I know), and for the most part I follow the stereotypes expected of a straight man. I spend a fair amount of time playing dota 2, for exercise I run and swim, I play guitar, I enjoy alt and folk-pop music, I spend far too much of my time worrying about girls, and almost all of my friends are men. I'm also planning on med school, and for some reason it seems to me gay people are underrepresented in the medical profession. 

That said, I do have a few stereotypically gay aspects of my personality. I love show tunes, I love singing (often stuff by Shania Twain and her ilk cause I find it funny), I don't enjoy watching sports (though I do like to play sometimes), and while the way I dress is pretty stereotypically straight, if I weren't insecure I'd dress very colorfully. And it seems unlikely I'll ever have a girlfriend or get married anyway, so I'm not Mr. heterosexuality over here, I'm basically celibate.

OK, here's the disagreement I had with my friend. Women don't ever want to be friends with me, but I know they're more likely to befriend a gay man cause sex is off the table. If I deliberately act a bit gayer around women I'd like to be friends with (and emphasis: this is not some long con to get them to sleep with me, I love having friends), making my voice a bit higher, talking about the side of my personality I usually have to hide, stuff like that, am I being immoral?

I went with her to clubs several time and I really didn’t enjoy it but I still went because she asked me to. Then when we went to bars together, she would always use her phone and ignore me. So when I told her that I don’t want to go to clubs/parties with her, she got mad and called me selfish for only wanting to do stuff that I like. She then stopped talking to me for months. We had classes together and we have the same group of friends but she would pretend I’m not there.

I told her that it would be weird for us to live together because she’s been icing me for months. But she pretends that that never happened. 


So the problem is do I let her stay with me? I really don’t want that to happen but if I don’t then it’ll prove her point that I’m a selfish person.

I don't wanna go to school this upcoming semester because I don't want to and I don't think I'll have the motivation to do so. 

My parents don't run my life but they have a large impact and what they say I don't take lightly so if they tell me to do something I generally do it. I asked my mom if we could talk about me possibly not doing school this semester and me working until next school year but she told me that they would rather have me go to school now and not wait. I need to know if anyone else had this problem and how they told their parents what they wanna do.

 I feel like if I did tell them what to do they would just stop helping me out (i.e not pay for rent etc. although I would do this with a newly acquired full time job). Are there certain things I should tell them? or things I should say that would get them to understand me more? I'm just stuck in this cycle of not knowing what to do and I don't wanna go to school If i can somehow convince them to let me work and hold off school for a couple of months. I need help now because I have to know by mid next week If I am going to school for the remainder of the year. IF you have any questions ask below, if you have personal questions, ask in PM.

158,"Hi all. I have a friend. She’s 40. Has 2 kids. She is down a deep, dark hole and I don’t know what to say to her. She is estranged from her parents and kids. She’s not in contact with any of her old friends. No one is sure where she is living or if she is still working. I know she was definitely working as a lingerie waitress up until recently, but now her daughter says that has progressed to prostitution and drugs. Her family have washed their hands of her (for now). There’s a huge amount of things that have brought her to this place. Up until a few weeks ago, she was randomly responding to peoples msgs. Her phone number changes regularly. The point is: has anyone ever been in such a dark place, so far away from your old life, stressed, depressed, whatever - and did you get out of it? What got you out of it? Did anybody say anything to you to bring you back?

160,"My friend, who is now my roommate, recently moved into my fiancé and I's apartment. She brought an uninvited guest that we only found out about when we picked her up from the airport. It was her cat. She originally told us that she wasn't bringing him and would only bring her rabbits. We're already at the 2 free roaming pet limit because of our dog and cat.

I tried to be positive about it. At first I thought my kitten was the one with the problem because she's hiss and run from my friend's cat. I had hope that they'd adapt to each other until today; I figured out what was happening. Her cat was originally an outdoor cat they took in. He has been aggressive with every cat he's ever seen. My friend answered the door because her food had arrived and her cat ran outside to attack our neighbor's black fluffy cat for no reason. He has attacked my cat twice. He sits by our door yowling to intimidate her and sits up at the living room window yowling whenever he sees the neighbor's cat. He's a sweet cat to humans but not to cats. Considering his history and the level of aggression he expresses, I have no hope left. My cat has become a skittish cat and is locked in my room all day so my roommates cat can roam free. I occasionally switch the cats out but mine is too scared to come out anymore. She has never been skittish at all before.

I need my roommate to send her cat back to her parents. I'm terrified of confrontation but it's either she sends hers back home or I rehome mine. How do I approach this? ",19Jan2018,8
162,"So long story short I graduated with a degree that I want nothing to do with due to being pressured to go to college and now I'm thinking about multiple future prospects and I'm making slow headway in figuring out any of them and was looking for some advice!

1. I'm heavily considering the idea of going back to college. I will be paying it for myself (luckily I still live with my parents) which means student loans which means debt. I would go back for Computer Science and I---as I am now---know that it would be hard but I know that I now have the motivation/determination to do it.

The catch to this is that I have a record of two gross misdemeanors (M.I.P, and Theft 3) because I was an idiot and thought I was invincible. I don't want to go to school and graduate with a degree and figure out that I'm unemployable due to my background. They were both dismissed but still show up on my record. I know it's not as severe as other people may have it but it's still a stain on my record and I don't want to invest in another degree if I can't get employed because of my history.
I'm planning on meeting with an adviser from school to hash it out but I thought I may as well ask other people too! 

2. I want to travel. I've been stuck in the same place for far too long and just need to get out and explore the world. Ideally I would love to figure out a way to travel and work at the same time. I'm Korean that was born in America and am researching the possibilities of acquiring an F-4 visa that would allow me to work in Korea and am entertaining the idea of doing that and living there for a time while doing so. This doesn't seem too feasible because I'm not exactly marketable. Got a B.A. in psychology and I'm not even sure where that would land me in the job market as far as Korea is concerned. 

I would be willing to work anywhere and live anywhere for a time but if this can't work out then I'm planning on just working my entry level jobs, saving, then travelling, then going back to college.

I know this was long and I'm asking for a wide breadth of advice but if you guys have any advice or knowledge you can share that would be most appreciated!",19Jan2018,2

169,"So, I'm currently a youth worker. I love my jobs but they are all sessional/casual contracts meaning I sometimes go long periods without at work at all and it's all on the other side of town from me. The amount of money I'm getting in just isn't sustainable despite the good houry rate, because of how bitty the work is. I love it and for the first time have a good relationship with my colleagues but I can't do this anymore and live comfortably. I haven't mentioned this to anyone yet.

Anyway, I've decided to apply for jobs in after school clubs (I have done this work previously).  I have just come out of an interview for one position. It is contracted hours every week even during holidays and pays much lower than the youth work but because of consistency, my guaranteed pay at the end of the month will be about double my earnings now. It is also a good location and the hours work well with my personal issues (OCD/anxiety/ED), although the holiday work would be unsettling due to the hours being more varied. I will find out on Monday and they are looking to start someone mid February.

Now. I also have another interview on the 22nd of February. It is for another after school club but it is a senior position (I've never done senior work before so the likelihood of being offered that job is so small but still....). The pay is equivalent to the youth work but the hours are much more and despite the club closing over holidays, overall I'd take home £100 more a month compared to the first job. Also the idea of being in charge of running a club is just awesome. The hours are SLIGHTLY more tricky for me to cope with (re personal issues stated above) but something I could adapt to.

My problem is this: if I were to be offered the job on Monday, should I 1. Take it and forget the other interview 2. Take it but still go to theory interview considering how slim the chances are of me actually getting it (but then what would I do if I did actually get it?) 3. Decline and keep searching while holding out hope for the senior position? 4. Tell them that I have an interview in February but I would like to accept the job if they are willing to wait and see how that goes (which they likely won't be)?

Also should I tell my current employers now, before there are any job offers to give them warning I am looking elsewhere? I really care about the young people and th workers and hate to think of going behind their backs and being disloyal but my parents tell me I shouldn't. These companies are all charities and I feel sick about what I'm doing.

I know I haven't been offered anything, and probably won't get this job on Monday anyway, but I just don't know what to do if I get a call saying i got it because I'd need to say there and then ""yes please"" or ""no thanks"". I'm panicking so much and feel like a terrible person right now. Any advice would be great. Thanks a lot.",19Jan2018,1

176,"Sorry in advance, not used to posting this kind of thing, so it may be a bit clunky to read.

I (F) have been friends with this guy, let's call him Sam, since just before highschool (we are in our twenties now). We have been pretty good friends over the years, I thought - would do all sorts together (was strictly platonic, before anyone asks). He was prone to being rather melodramatic and would often complain to me, my partner (M) and our mutual friend (let's call him Nick) over the years that he has no girlfriend. He always would tell us about his absolutely ridiculous standards for one, also. Eventually, he found a girlfriend on the other side of the world to us (let's call her Ellie).

He started acting strangely from the get-go - for the first half a year, he actively avoided myself and my partner (who had been friends with him for the last three years, got on fine). Eventually he stopped it and started talking to us again. However, this is where the downward spiral began. He began acting increasingly strange - very evasive on the subject of his girlfriend, seemed to be slowly turning rather oversensitive to banter me and our other friends would normally engage in with him (nothing to do with the subject of relationships at all). Me, Nick and Sam would often play games online, sometimes Ellie would join in. However, she was ridiculously oversensitive and was extremely quiet (would only talk in mumbles and would often leave as soon as any banter happened, even if not directed at her).

A little bit about Ellie now: she claims to suffer from terrible anxiety, but also seems like a pathological liar. Her story seems to always change on things about her life, or she says things that do not add up logically happened (I can't share, would be too obvious if it isn't already). The only thing she kept more-or-less consistent is that she is not interested in sex. Before anyone asks, I did not share this view with her, Sam or Nick. She also claims that she is going to come to our country and live there very soon, has set dates in the past, but has not come, with completely stupid excuses as to why (none of which would stop her from coming, if she was really going to). Ellie and Sam have never met in person.

Very recently, she came to me over a chat program we often use to ask about the whereabouts of Sam, as apparently he had not spoken to her for part of that one day. I told her I wasn't sure, gave her some advice for her anxiety (I sometimes tend to be no better). She thanked me and left.

Yesterday I found out from Nick that Ellie told Sam to stay away from me and my partner entirely. He obliged, while insisting it was really his idea (he has been very suggestible in the past to others, seems to be ashamed of it - always says it was his idea, even though it's clear he was being controlled in every situation prior to this). He also told Nick a lot of personal stuff that I told him in confidence - I'm worried that he also told others.

I'm not sure what to even do about this. I helped him a great deal in highschool (often played therapist), we were always good friends. I hadn't spoken much at all to Ellie. Now he instantly decides to abandon me and my partner on Ellie's whim, for no clear reason (Nick either would not say or genuinely did not know). I cannot talk to him about this, as Nick does not want to be involved, and it would be obvious where I got this information from. I feel very betrayed. He was only one of very few friends I have (I am terrible at making friends and new social situations). He just abandoned me... just like that... without saying a word about it or anything I might've done wrong. This is super hurtful.

182,"Hey, 

So I have this friend who I've been keeping in touch with for about five years. I've always initiated but he responds and visited this past summer. We had sex and I lost my virginity so it was really special for me, but he was only here for 5 days. He was then traveling all over the world and did not text me once for the rest of the summer. Also, when he visited, he was very kind after we had sex, and he was okay before we had sex as well, but way more neutral. The thing that bothers me is that he made a joke that sort of offended me, saying he hoped I didn't have a penis...Albeit we were watching some very explicit yoga where a man was doing a lot of very weird things on a stick with his penis (it's true...) and I had said it must be painful...Anyway, I wanted to do long distance but he didn't, and, after the 5 days, he was constantly traveling with his best female friend, and it really looked like they were a couple to me...(maybe open or whatever but they are always together and I saw countless pictures of them). He also texted her the entire time he was visiting me and he was on his phone about 75% of the time. He has some wonderful qualities (smart, outdoorsy, good cook, good sense of humor, can be very kind, adventurous) but I felt quite offended at times by the things he said and did: He messed up the tire on one of the family vehicles and let the family blame me for it (he took no responsibility), he said he'd split lunch, but took my cash and paid without giving me any change whatsoever, and he even allowed me to think about transferring to his college to be with him when he is traveling abroad for all of this semester (again, with his ""best female friend""). I've gotten a bit impatient at times when he doesn't respond (and he hasn't unless he ""needs"" to to save face). I messaged him on skype and wanted to skype but apparently he suddenly has a net neutrality issue. We had a decent interaction last time we texted (even though we didn't actually talk) and he's sent me a message again saying thanks for allowing him to visit and all of that. I haven't been very needy, but I have been a bit moody sounding at times over text I guess, because I've been angry. He's been patient and it seems like that is all good. The thing is, we go to university at different ends of the country, and he's usually traveling, and somehow has internet connection but is ""unreachable and busy"" even though he constantly posts about his ""best female friend"" who goes to university with him...I am stumped because, on one hand, I like the guy and he's been a very decent long distance friend for about 5 years, and I want to maintain the friendship, even if we only are in contact once a year... On the other hand, I may have feelings for him now (?), he's always with this other girl, so he clearly deeply enjoys her company even if he's single, and I don't want to constantly feel jealous of their friendship/relationship. Do you think it's even worth maintaining a friendship? We never Skype (at least not for a long time and probably won't from the look of things) and this is the first time he's ever initiated in five years...He did initiate the visit but he was already in my state for an internship over the summer. I am wondering if I should just delete his contact info and totally get over him? Or if I should keep his number just in case I ever hear from him...? My parents and him are connected on facebook, so, if need be, there is a way for me to reach him. However, he's always traveling and rarely ever has cell reception, or is reachable...What should I do? I was thinking of texting him but he says he's not reachable from his cell number for most or all of the semester...I guess I shouldn't? I was responding to his skype message which he sent about a month ago and I just saw it...that would be the text. 
Note: I know he was kidding about the penis thing but it really hurt my feelings, and he also made some implications about my body that were a bit mean and I felt insecure about it. (He was joking about those too, and I joked a bit with him as well, but I wasn't mean to him about his body...maybe his race but he joked about that himself...)",19Jan2018,2
184,"A little bit of background....

My Mom had a complete mental breakdown when I was around 15 or 16. She was suffering from delusions and had also experienced a lot of depression and trauma in her lifetime. She refused to get help. No one in my direct family understood how to properly handle it even though she was in and out of the hospital over the course of several years.

However, I noticed my Mom tried reaching out to her brothers and sisters but I don't think I remember a single time over the course of these years that they visited. 

My Mom stopped reaching out to them.
Fast forward to a little over a year ago she was diagnosed with cancer. It had spread to her brain and was spreading to other parts of her body very fast. Within a little under two months of treatment, she passed.

NOW, one of her sisters, my aunt, is spreading lies that she had cancer for years and hid it from anyone.

I find this extremely disrespectful to my mother and to also everyone in my direct family who understood how deep this actually went.

185,"So recently my old crush and I have started exchanging messages since the beginning of the week. Most of it is catching up and a bunch of random stuff. Regardless, she ended up hinting that she wanted to go  to this venue I often go to and I invited her and she said yes. 

Her and I have been friends for 8+ years but we never texted or messaged each other. The only time we talked is when we saw each other at parties or randomly. The last time I saw her was a month ago when I met her while I was shopping and she was working. We talked for a little bit and that was about it and I haven’t seen her since. So it was weird to me when she messaged me through messenger earlier this week.

Anyway, moving to the actual situation, a year ago I asked out a girl named Ginny(fake names) and she said no and that was a product of my own fault. Cut to now a year later I'm good friends with her roommate Sara, and I come over from time to time to just hang out. Ginny invites me over one night and does some heavy 1st base flirting. We start texting, I decide early on to play defense since she seems unpredictable.(I was doing so well here!!) I come over again and she starts a truth or dare game with me(yea I couldn't believe it either) just to ask series of kinky questions and relationship status stuff. We text more, and I decide to simply ask her if she wants to go out on Saturday, she doesn't respond till much later with just a ""Sorry""(right here is the exact point I slide downhill) I took it as she was busy and asked if she wanted to do something that night. She said she can't so i stopped there. Two days later I come to hang out with Sara(sara is a lesbian btw so there's no jealousy potential) , Ginny is there and just wants no part to do with me. Seeing her around the campus a few times more she shows basically irritation/ignorance of me even being in vicinity. So I'm done, I'm not gonna ask, I clearly played too offensive to her or she might even be having her own issues. Sara approaches me the next day or 2 later and says we have to talk tonight.  I ask about what and I swear she inaudible mouths ""Ginny"" maybe because that's all I was thinking about. So my first thought was ""did I make her that uncomfortable?"" So I text her later inquiring about Ginny and just asking what is it about. And she says she in fact did not ask about Ginny and instead said RA, because she's a RA DUH ME. Sara stopped talking to me since. 
So here we are. I feel like a illogical buffoon, and sorry for the poor writing I am a bit hungover for obvious reasons. So should I apologize? To both of them? The worst part is yes my anxiety played a good role into this. I imagine all chances of Ginny flirting with me again are out. But I still want to do morally right. ",19Jan2018,2
189,"Hello everyone. As the title says, someone left a doormat in front of my apartment door. We don't have one. It probably occurred after 7pm because we had not arrived home yet til that time.

We only discovered it this morning around 6am prior to going off to work. 

I thought the apartment complex might have given out free doormats to those who don't have one: but upon checking the other tenants who usually don't own one, that was not the case. 

Was this just a case of someone being a good neighbor? Or some kind of marking tool for potential home invaders? Is it even a big deal?

Personally, probably just going to throw it out. We never really planned on getting a doormat. But we are generally curious as to why someone would do this.

During my freshman and sophomore year, I took on assignments with full force and treated it like my job. Currently, if I become stressed I will usually just sleep instead of using that to inspire me to work harder. I hardly do the activities I used to enjoy and I dread doing school work.

I think it stems from my junior year; looking back I realized I showed strong signs of depression but in my mind I thought I was being lazy and that I deserved to feel awful for it. Ever since then I’ve noticed I’ve become addicted to social media and being on my phone has definitely made me feel terrible but I also feel terrible when I’m not on it.

201,"We’ve been friends since we were 10 years old and things were fine until high school. 
She lied about having cancer (yup) and I didn’t speak to her for two years but our mutual friends convinced me to become friends with her again. We had a pretty solid friendship up until sophomore year of college. 
She got into nasty drugs, probably any drug you can think of and sleeping with any guy who looked at her. She got kicked out of college her freshman year but continued her antics of cheating on her boyfriend, my friend, the entire sophomore year. She dropped me as a friend because I didn’t support her habits.
We reconnected recently, during my senior year, and I thought things would be good since she said she’s not on drugs anymore. But all she talks about is her new ‘man’ who is cheating on her, and how she’s in denial because ‘he loves me not the other woman he sleeps with.’ She avoids hanging out with me and doesn’t speak to me other than to complain. 
She’s stolen money and purses from me before  when I allowed her to temporarily stay in my house when she was homeless. 

Logically I should not care. But why do I feel hurt? Almost like I think the old her is still there deep down, but the promiscuity, drugs and partying has almost completely killed I.T off. I’m the only person in her life who tried getting her back on track. Shouldn’t she want me in her life?

206,"I am having an issue with one of my female coworkers. She is 28 and I am 33. I have worked at this company for 12 years and she has worked here 5. She works in my dept and started clinging on to me from day one. At first I thought it was flattering and I would help her with her work (we are researchers for a certain nutrition company) and I am a manager after all and she was new so it was my job to help . In the beginning I would do her math for her and explain things after and every once in a while I would hear the head of the department compliment her work and she would explain her thought process which was really mine and our boss would be impressed. I confronted her that I overheard her passing my work off as hers and she needs to give credit when it is due she understood and said she would stop. 
She then started copying my clothing , bags even my shoes. So in an effort to not look so juvenile I stopped wearing things she copied. She copies the weirdest such random things from me. I wore my hair a certain way and she came in the next 2 days wearing it the same way and so I just stopped. I bought a certain phone case ,she found it bought the same exact one and pretended to not realize it when a coworker pointed it out. We use our phones in meetings so its embarrassing. Shes bought the same jewelry etc…..and she pretends she didn’t copy anything. 
The worst thing she did was one day she came to work and was crying at her desk she said she wants her boyfriend to propose to her and she thought her grandmother would give her a ring so her bf wouldn’t have to spend any money and her grandmother refused. She was crying because she said she never thought about what type of ring she wanted and asked me if this was something I thought about. I said yes Ive known for years , she asked me what it looked like and I showed her a picture and told her I showed my bf that same one and he is going to have one made for me. Next day she goes to a jewelry store and custom orders a ring identical to the ring I showed her , she came to me all happy and showed me a picture of what it will look like and she copied everything ( I purposely held back I wanted mine in yellow gold just incase) she got hers in white. She said she ordered it and told her bf to go to the store to pay for it. I was shocked and didn’t know what to say. So he proposed to her a few months later and everyone loved her ring. Everytime someone said” Oh its beautiful and so different” I wanted to yell “THANK YOU!”. But I wanted to be nice, told myself she was immature and to not let it bother me. A few months later my bf proposed. I loved the ring, its actually double the size of hers and he knew how upset I was when she did this and he put diamonds in every place he could and tried to make it look different. Then comments started circulating that I copied her ring and I heard her tell people how it was weird that we both had similar rings. She took a lot of happiness out of my engagement. Instead of getting questions about just me and my fiances futures , I got questions as to how come our rings looked similar. I didn’t want to talk about HER during my moment. I just couldn’t stop hearing about how we got similar styles. One time I heard a salesperson who came in say “ you both have similar rings”. I tried to ignore it and I saw her roll her eyes to the salesperson as if to imply SHE is annoyed. I told a couple people what she did but I didn’t want to make a big deal and seem like we are causing drama in the company. 
Well she got married and they moved in with her mother so they can save money. I moved in with my fiancé who has a house in an expensive area. She now says she wants to move and buy a house and her plan is to make her mother move into a condo , have her sell her house and give her most of the money so she can get a house. Her mother pays for everything, constantly getting loans to help her out I cant believe she would think to make her mom move so she can have a big house too. She makes good money, I don’t know where it goes. She doesn’t even have major expenses her parents pay for her gas, car, phone and insurance.
 She always tells me every year “ I better get a good raise, I am the only one with a masters in this department”, and she always seems content after reviews (yet I have a bachelors and constantly correct her work). She mentions her masters a lot and I think she thinks she is above me even though I am her manager. Once she was doing something totally wrong and the head of the dept came in while I was asking her why she did what she did and she gave me a look with tears in her eyes to stop and I felt so bad for her and I said “ we will look at this later” and I left. Anyway that’s just a small bit of it. I hate confrontation and she loves to buttkiss all the superiors so I don’t think they see her subpar work. Anyway I want to end this copying behavior and her advancing in the company with my work. I hate upsetting people even though she upsets me a lot but I am ready to end this. Please help. The comments still come in about how we have similar rings whenever we are in the same meetings together with people , so a lovely reply to that would be great. Thanks

211,"Two days ago (roughly), I came down with an awful case of food poisoning - I imagine it was due to a sandwich I had at an event I went to the day prior, but that's not the main issue. 

The issue is that it is two days after my major food poisoning dilema, and I still can't eat anything. I know it is not a stomach flu or anything like that due to not having any of the other affects of a flu; that and I've had food poisoning before, but it wasn't this bad. 

My diet for the past 3 days has consisted of toast, and bananas (as well as the piece of crust of a thin-crust pizza yesterday). The issue is, I have been able to drink plenty of water, but I haven't been able to eat anything; this has led to me losing weight rather quickly, especially with vomiting an diarrhea from the food poisoning. 

A few years ago I had acquired an eating disorder due to a hightened depression streak (which I am now medicated for), but I already had a problem with eating (I eat very small quantities as it is); but along with the current food poisoning, I eat basically nothing... and there is no way it is healthy.

Is there any way to combat this? How can I get back to eating regular amounts? It's been three days and I've eaten a few pieces of toast and a couple of bananas. I need more!

I catch myself micromanaging my wife while at the same time, neglectful and tuning out on some of the important things she says. She will have to repeat things SEVERAL TIMES before I can remember it, and I know it's because my mind is all over the place.

I think I also have an ego issue and lack personality because my mom's over controlling nature. I talk about myself a lot and make things about myself a lot as well. I see everyone living their lives with full developed personalities, but I feel like I am behind a glass wall.

The most alarming thing is my potential lack of empathy. I am incredibly self centered, and I want to feel other's emotions. I know I am no psychopath because I can feel it sometimes. It's just faint. I also lack the ability to cry, even when I feel a deep sadness...

Like, I'd even lost weight for it since there was times that I just didn't want to eat. All this happened because I didn't really knew what to do with my life after a year doing something I hated and at the same time I had a really toxic experience with a girl that used me while she didn't had anyone else then dropped me like if I was a dirty handkerchief. If it was a random girl it would be ok but that case was with the person I've loved the most in my life, someone which I could talk about everything.


Since that I've started to see that even when I genuinely care for my friends and for the people who is important to me, they don't give a damn fuck about it. Like every time I've had to dealth with something in my life (suicide tendencies, abbusive parents, lack of self steem or confidence...) there was no one who wanted to help me or they made it look like if it was nothing, and now specially is more evident than ever.

I work in IT, and we're all in an IT suite in the building. The suite is right off the main hallway, so you hear quite a bit of foot traffic. Probably once every two minutes, you hear nothing but ""click clack click clack click clack"" for 20 seconds straight while someone walks from one end of the hallway to the other in their heels.


Every time I hear it, it numbs my mind- and it feels like it hurts my brain- I genuinely cannot think or concentrate on anything else because I cannot get the sound out of my head. It pisses me off to no extent. I usually wind up plugging up my ears with my fingers (like a little kid) to block it out. 

I can't have headphones in at work so there so listening to music to drown it out is a no go.  Can't have a white noise machine either because it would make too much noise in the office (and not enough to drown out the original problem) and I can't wear earplugs either.


And I don't want to bring it up to my boss because I don't want to look crazy.

I mean I sound like a girl and look like one, but I don't have the chest or anything. I also probably need a haircut now, but then -- referring to school days, I had short hair. It's not just boys either that has been doing this to me. Actual girls, grown women, and some of my family seemed to think I was a girl. A few of my teachers would only refer to me as a she. And well it was so nerve-racking...

And yes, I have dated both guys and girls but let me explain. I wasn't bi, I was pretty much into girls until I was accused of being one by everyone. After that I was asexual, meaning I just gave up on wanting to date. But this guy flirted the hell out of me... in school, in front of the class often and I at first found it annoying but despite me telling him I was a guy he still managed to keep flirting me till I... yeah. It wasn't like I was in for having sex with him, but it just happened... And dating him was even worse. I mean for one the only reason I did date him at all was because he told me to see the world a different way. He would semi-force me to dress as a girl, grow my hair out, change it to a strawberry blond ombre'ish for the girly effect, and he made me wear training bras... I hated it tbh. But it got me way too much attention that I was almost scared to admit I wasn't a girl anymore. I felt like everyone would look at me funny if I did.

Don't get me wrong, I definitely told the people trying to get in my boxers that I was a dude but jeez. Skipping ahead, college was the same and what screwed me over was parties... I fucked guys and girls so much I just became willingly bisexual, I mean I was drunk half of the time but well... still happened. I left my third year to take a break and get a job because I was actually raped in college by my friend I was roommates with, worst if we spent a year together as friends and I stayed with them in their apartment.

And now with my job at a supermarket, people still treat me like a girl, customers and workers. A few guys keep saying they want to fuck me, and really the only people that aren't doing it is a few girls who act motherly to me for some reason. Idk... But the problem is set in stone. I don't know what to do. I'm 22 and everyone thinks I'm a girl, no matter what I say or do. 

Is there any advice that anyone can possibly give me? I for one also don't act feminine, I mean I do... but I don't act like a girl.

But I have a problem with the exact same girl. To summarize, I was sleeping with a 14 year old girl who tricked me into thinking she was 18. I'm 26... so that's very bad. I thought this was all over but a few days ago she told me that I got her pregnant. And I'm sort of worried...

First of all, if she is lying again, how do I even find out without getting in trouble? I mean it will flat out say that either I am the father or that I had sex with her and was wondering... Is it okay to ask that despite the age difference?

Also, if she is only about to be 15 and still in school, I will have to take care of the child or end up in trouble either way since it came from me. There's no way to hide it, nor trying to pretend she doesn't know the father.

I feel like it could actually be true since we had a lot of raw sex. And besides being a virgin, it wasn't because I didn't want a condom, but the fact that she would freely give me bjs and sex. Just thinking around the time, I actually came inside of her because she gave me a free ride and keep going after I came inside. So I can't possibly just deny it and say there's no chance at all...

I haven't decided yet what to do. I've broke up with him now, and it's been a couple months. He's sincerely apologized and it is evident that he still has a lot of feelings.  I have also made comments that he should not have female friends (he is friends with old exes-completely platonic), and implied that I would need to know his whereabouts and have access to his phone and computer at all times.


He fears that my mistrust and resentment will only grow bigger and bigger and this will eventually break us. He says that he fears I would be too controlling/restrictive and that would cause us to break up in the future.


What to do? I really value him , but don't want to slip this under the rug. It would be foolish. At the same time, I understand that restricting someone will only cause them to rebel. If I forbade him from talking to certain friends or constantly checked his phone, would it be unreasonable?   I do not want to be the police officer in a relationship..it would completely change the dynamics. How do I make this work without losing my dignity?",19Jan2018,3
240,"So I'm a girl and I've never had a boyfriend. My younger brother just announced that he has a girlfriend, and it's making me feel horrible. I understand that we are different people- he's extroverted, good looking, and popular, whereas I have social anxiety and I suffer from early onset hair loss (I'm currently working on treating this, and I do my best to hide it with synthetic fibers, but I'm still not satisfied with the appearance of it on the top and it's brought a lot of stress into my life). It honestly makes sense that he's dating before me, but it still feels bad considering that he's my younger sibling. The truth is, I'm not interested in dating or having a boyfriend at this current time; I really want to take time to work on myself, focus on hair treatments, maybe go to therapy for my SA and stuff. However, with the news that my brother is dating, all of a sudden I feel like I have to have a boyfriend because it's embarrassing that he's ""beating me""
(forget the fact that I'm not even sure how to get one when I have trouble even making new friends). My biggest concern, and honestly the reason I'm even posting here, is what my parents will think of me. I'm afraid to go home for school breaks (I'm at university) because of this. Even if they don't bring up the topic too often, I feel like they'll be discussing it and that they'll feel ashamed for me. Any advice on how to deal with this? A parents' perspective could really be useful here. ",19Jan2018,3
242,"My roommate and I moved into an older 1,200 sqft 2-bedroom town home in September in Alabama. Our first couple months in the fall our power bill was approximately $80. When it started to get cold we put our thermostat on heat at 68 degrees (very rarely we would push it up to no more than 72 for maybe a day). When it gets cold outside the townhome's bottom floor (kitchen, laundry, living and dining room) is impossible to heat and is EXTREMELY cold and the upstairs stays warm. The downstairs is probably 15 degrees colder than the upstairs. It seems that it is a result of a very poorly insulated downstairs with some drafts probably coming in since its such an old townhome built in probably the 70s. We finally received our power bill for December and it was almost $300.

I want to know what recourse I have. Unfortunately it seems like it will be very difficult and expensive (with space heaters, etc.) to keep the place comfortably warm.

244,"I’ve come to realise my family is quite dynfunctional. I’m a male who has just turned 18 and I have an older sister who is 19. She is quite intelligent I think, but got abysmal grades at A-Level due to depression. Before she went to university she would scream and shout at my mum who would allow her to blame everything on her. My mum even cried and when I try to step in to take care of her my dad just shouts at me because he thinks I’m worsening the situation. 

This brings me on to my next issue, where my dad jokes and teases my sister as if she were the best child he could’ve hoped for. What’s worse is that although it isn’t obvious, I feel like he’s slightly attracted to her and her him. It’s not helpful that she texts him non stop all day and comes home frequently from university (once a month for a couple weeks, because she gets stressed out or something) and wears sort of revealing clothes (shes 100kg so dont get any ideas). Im reluctant to admit it but it really feels like I’m living in A View From the Bridge, a play I studied for GCSE. 

This is why my mums depressed, I’m sure she feels like shes losing him and I rarely see them hug anymore. My parents are old (dad is mid 60s and mum early 60s) and I know they wouldn’t divorce but I tried convincing them to go on a holiday together and managed to convince my mum who then asked my dad who just flat out said no.

There are only four gay men within 100 miles of me on social media apps and all are obese chain smokers who I can't hold a conversation with. I've looked for hobbies. Problem 1 is that there aren't many clubs around here at all, and problem 2 is that the other people going are the same people I want to avoid.

 I want to shoot myself to see what it feels like. Maybe I'll take a tour around the country and visit my friend in Colorado one last time before I do.

* the amount of sex every boyfriend I'ver ever had wants (I don't enjoy sex and don't know if it's ""I'm ace"" or ""my partners just suck at sex"" but I'm pretty sure I'm ace)
* my boyfriend pushes for sex even after being explicitly told that I don't want sex or him verbally asking for sex but I don't respond immediately because I'm still debating on if I want to suffer through sex at the moment or not ('oops, it just happened')
* over-explaining
* telling me I don't talk enough

* making racist remarks
* microaggressions (race, gender/sex, religion, etc)
* underpaying employees (especially when someone fresh out of college gets promoted with a raise faster than me for doing the exact same thing)

247,"Hi everyone so I work full time at the moment at a company that pays decently well. I make well above minimum wage and the pay is going up, although there is a cap. I'm 23 years old and decided to start going back to school for computer science. So far it has been going good in school and I'm overall happy about it and looking to become a developer at some point when I finish. I currently live with my parents and have minimal debts, credit card, rent, phone, car, car insurance. Nothing major. However this is my dilemma, I hate where I work. The management isn't very good and I'm sick of working there, not only that but at some point in the near future I would like to take school more seriously and go full time student. I'm not sure at what point i would like to do this but sooner rather than later would be ideal. I'm having a hard time justifying leaving my job that will pay for schooling and pays decently well although I know I don't want to work there. Everyone that has worked here has stayed for like 30 or 40 years and that's all they ever did. I don't want to get stuck in that rut and when I graduate from college I have 0 plans of working for this place. The thing is I want to go full time student so that I can graduate within 4 or 5 years rather than 8 to 10 years. Everyone that I talk to that works there asks me why I'd ever leave, and anyone that I've talked to that goes to or has gone to college tells me I should become a full time student and I don't know what to do.

249,"Not like we're about to break up or anything. Just at a stand still about this topic. 

For starters, we're mainly cat people. We both had cats growing up and when we volunteer at our animal shelter we'll stay in the cat room for the most part. When I was younger we had a German shepherd but he was A LOT of WORK and I cannot see myself with a breed with that much energy again. If I were to get a dog it would be something like a greyhound or corgi. But after researching different breeds everything else is way too much high energy for my taste. The last thing I want is to come home from a long day at work and get jumped on by a huge slobbery monster with nails that hurt you (not intentionally). Ugh. Also I think I might be slightly afraid of dogs. I mean I like dogs for the most part but I wouldn't approach one on my own free will. If it approached me and was well behaved then I'll love on it for sure. I'm also not the type of person that when I come back home from work I want to go on an hour long walk three times a day. 

My bf however, loves dogs and dogs love him. I've seen him approach aggressive dogs and love on them and they just melt when he touches them. He's never had a pet dog of his own. He's lived with roommates dogs and helped take care of them but that's about it. I don't think he fully understands how much work dogs really are. He says he wants a big energetic dog but I'm not really into it. He says that he'll take care of the heavy duty stuff like training it and walking it after work but I don't think that's fair to him or the dog or me in the long run (how can I bond with it if I don't do that stuff). We also are really into hiking and camping. When we're on the trails we see dogs and they look so happy to be out there. I think this is where the dog issue started because he wants a fur hiking buddy. He wants it to have its own pack and sleep in the tent with us. In theory I understand where the appeal is and it sounds fun on paper but I don't think its a good idea. I'd really only want to stick with cats as greyhounds aren't really good hiking dogs and I don't think a corgi could handle the distance (we hike 5-10 mi usually). But that's another reason why he (thinks) he wants a bigger energetic dog.

Is there a compromise that we could come to? Are there breeds that might be able to give us the best of both worlds? ie a couch potato that can keep up with hikes but isn't the size of a horse? Anyone who's ever been in my position before how did you make it work?",19Jan2018,1

251,"I feel ungratful. 
At 18 I didnt graduate highschool by half a math credit so I went to a trade school and finished in 2 months. Once I graduated my dad and step mom let me know we were moving to Mississippi because they had a VA hospital there. Understandable he has neck problems and fused vertebrates.
I at that point had my real first boyfriend Josh and we were together for a year. I tired living with him but he was young and had self issues so I reluctantly moved with my parents and Josh and I did long distance for half a year. I started college down in Mississippi for 6months.

In the half year things went down hill. My dad went to a mental hospital and my step mom got very very mentally, emotionally abusive to me while he was gone. Saying things like ""I didnt have the balls to break up with Josh like his ex girlfriend did"". I lost a good 30 lbs from starving myself because that was the only thing that felt good well that and cigarettes. 
Dog shit all over the floors I was tired of cleaning up (I said no to dogs). 

My step sister hazel asked me ""Whats it like to be obese?"" After me asking her to help me sign up for college classes. She's 24.

I immediately left that house and dropped out of school severely depressed. Moved back with my boyfriend Josh. I cried and vent and he understood. I just couldnt work I felt burnt out from a heavy college load (5classes) +abuse.

Now I owe my school about 1000 dollars plus 500 in credit card debt.

When I left that house I left I lost the majority of my things and bed,furniture etc...

I lived with my mother in law for half a year but that got unbearable. She was a hoarder, started talking shit about me and her son.

My dad split from my step mom this October and I helped him find a place where my dad josh and I could live, (i stopped talking to my dad eventually when he was is MS because he wouldnt help me out with contacts) I live in FL and the summers suck ass if you work outside with glasses or do anything. I mostly was just fed up of his bullshit. (Defending step mom after I told him of the abuse).

But now he said he'll let us live with him for a year till nov 7 to get our shit together.  Now I work at publix. I just dont know how. 
I know paying off credit card.


Life is hard. Im incapable it feels like.

Sorry for the pity party I just have no ome to talk to.

252,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (20F) just moved into an apartment with our roommate Lily (21F), who's lived in the apartment a year already. We've only been moved in for a week. 

When we moved in she had absolutely no food, the house was disgusting, and her cat's litter box was in the living room beside the couch and the whole house smelled like cat. 

We just went out and bought $200 of groceries, most of which was quick stuff that you can make in the over. We came home, unloaded everything and were informed that the heating element in the oven had broken and it hadn't been usable for a while now. Also found out that there was a bug problem and the sink has had a leak that creates puddles of water on the kitchen floor. 

In addition to all of that, Lily has been eating a lot of our food with no intention, spoken or otherwise, of throwing some money in for groceries. I am NOT a greedy person, but I do have a monthly budget I intend to go by and I can't keep buying food every two weeks. I wouldn't care about what she eats if she paid half for the things she wants. Also, every time my boyfriend and I get something to eat, she comments, almost like a mother who is watching their children's weight and diet, on how much food we're eating or how we've used all the cheese and ""it was a pound bag, how'd it go so quickly?"" 

She's always texting me and asking if I've called my job, how many hours I work, ect. If I leave my bedroom door open, she'll stand right outside and make noise with her phone until I acknowledge her. I feel like there are no boundaries and I don't know how to tell her all of this without coming off as an asshole, as my boyfriend and I are very blunt people, except in this situation because we don't want to cause bad vibes(?) with our new roommate who we'll live with for a year. 

Thanks in advance! 

td;lr my roommate has no boundaries and I need a way to tell her without creating a bad relationship. 

Edit: we saw the apartment a week before we moved in and we had discussed and agreed on splitting bills, cleaning, and buying laundry stuff &amp; reloading the laundry card. It was also mentioned that my boyfriend and I would be buying our own food. ",19Jan2018,3

259,"Hi,
I have been skater till I destroyed my knee which can't allow me skate this year. I had got surgery few weeks ago.
Beginning of injury was very hard - can't find place and things to do.

I was totally drug free - no drugs, no alcohol, good diet, exercise. Skateboarding is one of the most important things in my life, doing it cleans my head from thinking. Now, I was drunked one time, drunk few beers too, smoke weed, eat sugar, thrash food. I was proactive, now I can't even focus on job. 

What I noticed is that I'm very 'erotic addict'. Because of boredom I started Tinder. I think about pussy pretty all day. I can't walk so I text with girls, watch porn, masturbate. I was porn and masturbation free before!

I'm 24 yo, but I feel that I am way, way more sexual than ever. I always think about pussy, can't focus on myself enough.

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? Is it normal when you lost what you love? How to deal with it. I know... find something other to do. I've tried, but nothing works like skateboarding for me, I love sport.

He was away before that for a few weeks and decided while there that he was going to move back to his country of origin permanently, stating that he preferred it there etc...I was seeing a counselor at this point, everytime I talked about the relationship with him, she would look at me with this pained, sorry look on her face, almost pity. That expression she had compelled me to act differently towards my ex and put my foot down, so I replied to him saying you can't keep making decisions on your own without talking to me first, it is disrespectful to me and our relationship. I knew it was a gamble, deep down I hoped he would turn around and say you are right, lets talk about it. Instead he said I have made my decision, it is up to you. I stayed strong on what I said, repeating it, he eventually said I am done with you, good luck with your small life and world. Never to reach out to me ever again. It was a complete shock, I went into months upon months of depression, devastation, and misery. 

I admit within that period I did contact him twice, out of shock it was over, and craving to feel that connection I thought I had with him. The responses I got were unbelievable, he just started criticizing me, telling me what a horrible person I am, that not being with me was the best thing that ever happened to him. He asked me if I was jealous that he had a new gf, I sad no. I ask how is it going? He goes the sex is great. He kept saying I am bipolar, which I am not. I made the decision to never ever contact him again, because it was very hurtful all the contempt and it seemed he was just trying to hurt me. 

Anyway what I found strange about the whole thing was he ended up getting this new gf a month later, and announcing it on fbook, at this point I defriended him.

It just didn't make any sense to me. I was thinking if he was two timing me or wanted to be with her, why string me along and ask me to move country with him in February 2017. The whole thing just didn't make sense. The fact someone would move to another country with someone after knowing them less than a year doesn't make sense either.

265,"Hi, guys. I am on my Fourth Semester in college, taking online classes, and have run into some trouble. Last semester, I took The first half of a two part accounting class. Well, the teacher is using a separate website to do the work through. For the first 10 weeks, I didn't have any problems. Then one type of assignment just stopped working. I couldn't submit it. I called technical support four times, and they basically ended telling me they don't know why it is happening. My teacher just kept telling me I was the only one having the issue so we would ""review my grades"" at the end of the semester and see.  

Problem never got fixed to make a long story short. I passed the class regardless. 

Now, though, I am taking the second class, same teacher (she's the only one offering it and it is one of my electives), same website. The problem is still happening. I tried to call tech support before and have them give me a new account to see if there was some sort of glitch tied to it, but they said that was impossible. Well, the problem is still happening, and they tried the same troubleshooting as last time that did nothing. 

I contacted my teacher yesterday asking to meet with her in person, so I could show her the issue. That way, we could either find a solution or some way for me to make it up. But she ignored that and told me to get the problem fixed like I have not contacted Tech support six times at this point. 

I do not know what to do. I cannot make an A in this class without doing this type of assignment, and I do not think the issue will be fixed any time soon. So since I eventually HAVE to take this class, I don't think dropping it would make much of a difference.

269,"I’m 17 Male and I go to an All guys college prep school. Almost the typical “extremely bright kid doesn’t do homework or study” thing taken to an extreme. Last year I failed the first half of the year but was able to come back and pass and damn near ace the finals in the classes I did so poorly in. This year, school started and because my grades are low I didn’t get put in the classes I wanted and got shitty teachers for the most part. I failed every class but 1 in the first quarter, and I did almost the same in the second. I know I will be able to pass the year but I can’t stand the classes I don’t need to be taking to graduate that just add to the stress. The administration bring me in for the same damn conversation everytime and it drives me insane and they don’t know how to deal with depression.

I’m pretty introspective and knowledgeable of how people work, so I understand why I’m depressed but nothing will get me out of my bed to work hard consistently. I’ve wanted to be a creator of sorts for as long as I can remember, and starting when I was 12 I wanted to be an animator, something I didn’t take seriously until I was 14. I improved a bit at art, but I took major breaks due to the other garbage in my life. I describe it as I’m lying in bed and the world around me is burning and I can move, but I won’t. Then in grace periods, when I have a glimpse of happiness with my life, it’s the ashes that need to be cleaned up and when I get up to do it I get angry at myself that I’ve failed, and I haven’t worked hard enough. When I was 15 I drew each day for 4-5 straight months and then my little sister got shady news about her tumor, I fucked up in school again, a dog I grew up with died, etc. My depression runs infinitely and there’s not much I feel a therapist can do, and anti depressants are completely out of the realm of possibility for me, due to the effects.

Last month, a student in my class shot himself in the head and me and my close group of friends went to the wake, and it was an open casket. They reformed his skull and it made me sick. I reconciled with kids from my past that bullied me who I hadn’t talked to besides a greeting in years, and I went home with friends and they slept over. I truly love people, and I love them, but their personal immaturities and the injustices of the world make me feel so damn alone. They are all applying to top schools and I’m here after applying to 2 schools wondering if it’s even worth it.

My friends have their own personal shit, I get that, and I know they can’t always be there for me, but I’m verbally begging for help from them and no one is offering it cause they are so focused on their grades and college. I’m normally pretty extroverted and love hanging out with friends but this past month my depression has hit an all time low. The night of the wake I took edibles with my friends and they all went to sleep after they made fun of me for being so out of it, but I was breaking and super depressed at that point. The 2 week break after that my depression was just an onslaught. 

I dragged myself to the New Years party a “friend” who doesn’t like me for a misunderstanding, trying to protect a mutual friend who accepts I was right in an argument. There I connected with a guy I used to not connect with at all cause he hated me out of jealousy to a degree, and I had a decent few moments. We smoked weed in the garage and a friend’s girlfriend joined us and he is straight edge and had an anxiety attack in the bathroom after it. At the same time we woke up the kids parents and they came down and screamed. Seeing the kid avoid his family problems and admit to doing so and wearing it like he should be proud of it pissed me off, and my other friends immaturity pissed me off.

My ambitions and personality, mixed with a level of deeper understanding than my friends and even my internet friends have isolated me and I’ve never been more depressed. I’m capable of standing back up again and pushing through, so I can eventually work on creative projects and be happy, but I need advice on STAYING hardworking.

TLDR; My depression cripples me and then I get more depressed about that.
Grades in School and College soon - Angry depressed overworking Mom and Dad works away. Both want to understand. 
Kid in class shot himself in the head and I got plunged into a depression, and now I feel even more so that I can’t relate with ANY of my friends in the ways I need to.
So many ambitions and time is a precious resource and I don’t feel as if I have any real tangible talents (besides maybe creativity and to a degree debate) that I wanted to develop but time flew by.
I need change.
Advice on staying hardworking and grinding everyday, after not working on even myself daily for a long time? Advice for creation in the arts too. Ive been working on a video game concept that I don’t get off my ass and actually attempt to start, and I don’t practice drawing or animation.

271,"I have a cousin who has recently experienced a death on his wife's side. This cousin is a very close friend to me and he's taking this loss very hard. I'm trying to be a good friend and just be their for him- but he is on the edge of quitting his job and moving in with his Father in-law so that his Father in-law isn't alone and doesn't have to quit *his* job.

I understand not wanting to be alone and I understand the want to be close with his wife's family so he can be there for them and I think he is making a very heartfelt decision to leave his job so that his wife can be with her family, but there are a couple of reasons why I feel this would be a bad decision:

1 The area he is moving out to doesn't have a lot of jobs- and the types of jobs that are available in the area are dead end minimum wage or just over minimum wage jobs- making it hard for him to support his wife and build a career for himself.

2 He is currently renting an apartment and his lease doesn't expire until may *and* no one seems interested in buying the lease from him. If he quits his job he will be stuck paying rent on no income for the next 4 months even if he doesn't move away.

I haven't said anything, but I've taken time off work to just visit and be their for him (and no matter what his choice is I don't regret doing so). I'm conflicted about what to say. On one hand I feel like i'd be a bad friend for not saying anything at all, but on the other hand I feel like saying these things would only hurt feelings and make things worse. To make my decision harder he is asking me for advice on what to do and I have no idea what to tell him because it seems like he's already made up his mind on what he wants to do. What can I do in this situation?",19Jan2018,2

I used to be afraid of dogs but now I love them so much I'll always pet them and play with them. I'm getting a dog from a shelter next year when my tests are over.

But for some reason since I've been 11 I've been terrified of a dog that lives next to my grandfather's house. He doesn't do anything, just puts his paws on top of the very low fence and barks.

I Google how to get over this fear but I can't no matter how hard I try to get over the fear of this dog. I can't approach the owners, they're just as terrifying because they're hard drug users (and possible dealers) what do I do?

273,"Per the title, I'm 20 years old, male, living in a studio apartment in Chicago. I've lived here for 6+ years now. At this time, my life is not going anywhere in particular. Living paycheck to paycheck, as most are. Not attending school currently. 


I need a change. A fresh start somewhere else. I am making this thread for two reasons. 1) To receive advice, hear about people's experiences and apply it to my own life. 2) To potentially help others who are in similar circumstances and maybe are looking for a fresh start. 


What I'm looking for is experiences and thoughts from people, both in the U.S. and internationally, on how best to start somewhere new and build a life. What has worked for you? What hasn't? If you've moved around, why? What pitfalls or obstacles did you run into? 

My lease runs out in March of 2019. Upon the expiration, I plan on packing up and starting over somewhere else. That gives me a little over a year to put my nose to the grindstone and save up for whatever may be in store for me. I'm not opposed to moving out of the U.S. if I believe it's the right fit. I'd prefer to be somewhere near a city as I don't have a car and currently can't afford one. The Chicago transit system has been very beneficial to me in this regard. Owning a bike has helped as well. I realize I may very well need a car in the near future so I'm prepared to save for one if necessary. How much would I need? Obviously I'm not looking for anything fancy, decent-to-good gas mileage is all I care for. 

Currently I work in a fine-dining restaurant but the hours are spotty. So far it is enough to pay my living expenses and have some leftover. I am seeking a second job so that I may put that towards savings needed for my move. I attended post-secondary school for a semester but, due to various circumstances, it did not pan out well so far and I have not gone back since. I was pursuing English (and have considered Education) at the time, which I may still want to do but I'm aware that it may not be the most lucrative pursuit. Math is not my strong suit and while I've briefly considered CS, I do not think I have the mind for it. I've read a little bit about trades but I'd like to avoid working my body into the ground when I'm older. The only think I'm really good at is writing and I haven't the faintest idea what it is I'd ever write about, should I go down that route. 
I'm looking for cities with a relatively low (affordable) cost of living, a somewhat thriving culture to make connections in and grow as a person, and opportunities to educate myself and/or work somewhere I can translate to other places if need be.

274,"Hey Reddit, this is only my second post so take pity on me if I make any mistakes. Strap in because I'm about to rant. Recently I've had some things happen in my personal life that are really effecting me in a bad way. I've always dealt with my emotions by myself because I don't want to make a scene and make people think I want pity. When I was a kid I had depression. It was pretty bad and I wanted to kill myself but didn't because I thought I'd go to hell if I did. I never told anyone because my family was super religious and I thought they would send me away to a mental institution or disown me if they found out. So I just dealt with it by myself. That was by far the worst thing I've ever been through. To this day I've never told anyone about it. Fast forward about three years and I got over it. Since then I've been doing really well, with the exception of a couple off days here and there, but nothing that no one else has to deal with. But lately I've been feeling awful, I've been dealing with situations that make me feel like I can't trust my friends or family, and I feel really lonely, like no one cares about me that much. Ive been extremely stressed out and have had a weird mix of really strong emotions (sadness, anger, guilt etc) and complete emotional and sometimes physical shut down. It's starting to scare me a little bit. For example, the other day out of nowhere I stoped being able to feel physical pain for awhile. I also haven't been able to sleep lately, I get around 2ish hours of sleep a night. And I haven't been eating because I never feel hungry. I'm trying to act normal and succeeding I guess because no one has noticed me going through this for weeks now, but I'm terrified this might turn into depression or something worse. Mental illness is something I never want to experience ever again. I feel sort of pathetic going online to get help, but I'm not going to burden my family with this because it'll tear them apart. If anyone else has experienced this I'd greatly appreciate advice and encouragement. Don't be afraid to be brutally honest. Thanks in advance for your help!",19Jan2018,2
275,"So I am in the marketing department and my boss is the marketing manager. This is important to the story. I am a female and my boss is a female. She creates this persona that she is blissfully happy with 2 kids and a husband. In the past recent months she is only in the office maybe 1 day a week. All other days she says she is at one of our communities. I work for a new home builder. The vp of construction is a male and has a wife, 2 kids and a baby on the way. He too has recently not been in the office a lot BUT he is here everyday, just slips out early everyday. That’s understandable because he has homes and workers to look after. There is really no reason for my manager to be out of the main office though.

What I came here to ask advice on is that her and him have been VERY flirtatious with each other and the other day it was just too much. What got me was I was having a face to face conversation with her and out of no where she just interrupts to point at him and say something “funny” but more in a teasing manner. I was standing there thinking....wow this isn’t funny. Why are they laughing? I don’t get it. It was so weird. That’s when I realized holy shit they’re flirting.
Other examples that are weird:
-she copied him on a marketing email that has NOTHING to do with his job at all. An update on a service we just got. No one responds.....but he does with “Very cool!” 
-When he sees she is in the office he comes in the main door, not the side door where his office is and walks straight to her office to say good morning and they talk. Last time she said “why are you here? He reply’s with “I know last night I said I wouldn’t be but something changed and it got cancelled” why where they talking last night?! His job doesn’t help our marketing tasks at all. Why are they always talking...?
-every time she is here she goes to his office and has a CLOSED DOOR conversation with him. We normally don’t do that around here and that is a huge red flag. Considering his job has NOTHING to do with hers.
-in meetings they banter back and forth and laugh and speak almost like with no real detail just like “oh yeah remember that thing ...hahahaha”
-last encounter that was obvious flirting was when I said the word huddle talking to my boss he interrupts and says “cuddle?” Like eww no and why is your mind there while you are standing in her office right now.

I could go on and on with examples. At first I thought it was just weird, but after the last encounter, it seems really flirty and they definitely talk on off hours. I just feel weird because I know they both have kids and marriages and families. Here is the kicker.....I feel like I can’t say anything....because I’m dating a coworker and everyone knows lmao I know. So that’s why I feel like I can’t say anything because I’m too scared someone will make a phone call to hr and say “they’re relationship is a conflict of interest” (even though it is not) in order to avoid being caught that they’re cheating on their spouses (speculating). It’s hard to ignore and I don’t know what to do. Help.",19Jan2018,2
276,"Long story short, both parents are unemployed right now, I'm pretty sure my dad is by definition a hoarder, and my mom is just insane. Our house is disgusting, there are piles of junk everywhere, the floors are covered in dirt and pine needles, and there is clutter on every surface. My parents are constantly talking about how it is all because my siblings (ages 11, 9, and 7) make a mess and never clean. They seem to expect my siblings to clean up most of the house while they bark orders. My siblings are constantly being told to clean and yelled at by my dad. If they do clean anything it isn't good enough and they immediately have to go clean something else. Obviously, they never do anything. They sit around the house all day, playing video games and watching YouTube. My parents yell at them every little while and tell them to get off the computer, but they walk away and in 5 minutes they are right back on it. 

Somehow I seem to have grown out of being expected to clean everything and they leave me alone for the most part. I think it's because I am doing online school all the time while my siblings just... don't.  We are all homeschooled, but my mom isn't really schooling them anymore. 

Is it at all reasonable to expect kids to do the majority of the housework?  

I don't know why I'm here. This happens every month or two. I hate my life so much. I just want to move out.  Every month or two I end up getting extra upset and going to reddit begging for answers. Something that can make it all better. I know there isn't anything that will. And if there is I'm not strong enough to do it. People have told me to do everything from ignoring it and hiding in my room, to cleaning the entire house myself (which I think would be nearly impossible and I'm too lazy to do), to going to CPS or telling an adult outside of my family.  I'm never going to do any of it.  I'm too scared and lazy. So I'm just going to suffer. I don't even know why I'm posting it. Maybe I just like the attention. I don't know. There's my rant.

I went out for Christmas and I thought we had a lot of fun. But since then he's been distant. Two days ago I asked him what was going on and he said he wanted to take a break.

280,"So, uh how to start?

My life has kinda been through the ringer. Not just now, but like, since as long as I can remember.

Most recent in my life story was the Ewing's Sarcoma bone cancer I was diagnosed and treated for at 19.

14 months of chemo, surgery took 3+ months recovery. I ended up losing my right scapula and becoming disabled.

Since High School I had the plan to enlist, or at least do something action oriented in my life. Obviously that didn't work out.

Now I am 24, just recently moved across the country and in with my little brother, I have a job making pasta for $10.50/h, I have a rustbucket pickup that I hate though it runs, and I have a girlfriend.

My brother plans to enlist in the Navy within the next few years, but honestly I just don't know what to do with myself anymore.

I have no desire to be a faceless pencil/paper pusher, or a cubicle dwelling typist. I only have vague interests and no clue where I am going in life.

283,"How to get out of one: Retain a lawyer, if you already have one call them immediately with the client phone they provide at the detox your lawyer can have you out by tommorow.  They can petition a judge and could have you out when you blow zero if you weren't charged with a crime when you were taken to detox by the police.

Do weekends and holidays count toward a 72 hour DETOX HOLD?  Yes, if the hold ends on Saturday, Sunday or even Christmas that is when they will let you out.  Unlike the psych ward 72 hours means 72 hours.

How long does the hold last?  Short answer is until the day after tommorow sometime in the morning or afternoon on day 3.

Day 1: the day you were brought to detox.

Day 2: (the following afternoon) at some point you meet with a CD counselor and they will tell you what time you're leaving tommorow.

Day 3: counting down the hours until they open the door and let you out.

72 hours is more like 60 hours, do not expect any help whatsoever from the staff on getting released any sooner once you are there.  If you need to get out quicker call a lawyer.  In the end it will cost about the same, maybe a little more but you'll stand a better chance of having a job or not getting kicked out of school when you leave.",19Jan2018,0
285,"Back in 2010 I dated this girl online. Never met her irl. Our relationship was pretty abusive and gave me serious thoughts of suicide at the time. Eventually I managed to break trough it and asked her to stop contacting me. This was 2013/2014. She came to the point of contacting my relatives in order to get my phone number so she could talk to me. I always had a hard time just thinking about it, eventually would stop talking to friends and becoming more and more isolated from the world.

After that I met a few people and got myself into a serious relationship with someone I truly love. I don’t care about her anymore, just like I don’t really care about other people I have dated. I just wanted her to stop contacting me because every time she does she starts being emotionally abusive. Just reading the things she send me is unpleasant.

When I threatened her saying I would contact her father and ask him to make her not contact me anymore, she hold back for a while and didn’t send me anything. But now I find myself receiving her texts almost every 2 months.

Any advice on how to stop this behavior?

If you're wondering why I'm starting in the spring it's because I finished high school early... the real story is I dropped out because I was incredibly depressed and couldn't get out of bed to go to school. I got my GED and have been taking a couple classes at my community college, which was a huge step for me going back to school. So back to the advice; I'm scared about literally everything. I hate myself and how I look. I'm scared I won't be able to get out of bed for my 8 AM classes. I'm scared I won't be able to make friends. I'm scared I'll be miserable living away from my family.

Part of the deal with this move is that he had to get healthier (he smokes and is obese). He also is with a crazy woman who also has the issues but also frequently talks about how proud she is of having severe mental problems and does things like getting them in accidents on the highway and sending them to the hospital. He admits all of these are issues and I've tried helping him with them (mostly the smoking and weight stuff because his girlfriend is his choice) but he just completely ignores it and continues to get worse and worse and when I push it he tells me I should've made an ultimatum with the deal because just trusting him to do it wasn't enough. I'm honestly worried about his health because he has had heart issues and cancer before and I would like for him to be around for awhile if possible.

Well, half would have been $1002. Great. Cool. I had $986 in my account. I tried to go ahead and pay anyways and it didn't go through. Obviously. So I decided to go to the school and drop 2 of the classes and just pay in full, which was $888. Great yay! It's paid for in full and I have about $100 left over. So, i wake up the next morning and my bank account is negative around $1000. I check the transactions and I see one that says FORCE PAY NELNET. So basically they forced the payment to go through, after I've already paid the school. Great cool, we can fix it surely. I call them and they say there's nothing they can do and I'll have to wait 45 to 60 days to recieve my payment back.

At this point shes screaming hysterically and we fight around for a good bit, I have a scratches, but oh well,   and she ended up running  leaving through my balcony door and down the stairs.

308,"Hey there.


My SO is currently going through mind boggling downs, which we both pretty much are sure is depression. Problem is, she refuses to go see a therapist because ""it makes her anxious"" and ""talking about it makes her even more depressed"".


This is problematic, because she doesn't seem to get better, even despite my best efforts. She still asks me to 'support' her instead of seeking more qualified help. Now, don't get me wrong, I absolutely want to help her, but I don't think her way of me helping her is working at all.


How can I help her see that going to therapy isn't an inherently bad thing? Whenever I suggest it she gets mad, because when I went through hard times in the past, I started therapy and dropped out of it (Because for me personally, it wasn't working, but I got out of the bad times on my own, along with her help).


I just want her to overcome what's holding her back, but she lashes at me whenever I do as much as to say the word 'therapy' or 'someone else's help'. Please help, I don't think I can go on much longer like this.",19Jan2018,4

314,"I measured my boyfriend’s erect penis last night with a measuring tape and he is 5.5 inches with a 4 inch girth. Last time I measured him with a regular ruler and his erect penis was 6 inches then (this was probably inaccurate because it was done with a regular ruler). Last night when I had sex with him was the fourth time I ever had sex. The first two times I had sex was with someone else I was dating (not my boyfriend) who could barely get it up. He would have sex with me semi erect (like about 2-3 inches) and his tip would only get inside me for about a second. Then his penis would fall out. I was a virgin so I was very tight. The first time I ever had sex with my boyfriend (which was my third time having sex) I was very tight and “virgin like” he couldn’t stay inside me for very long (but there was no blood). This time he did stay inside me longer, I was still very tight like last time and I bleed a lot. Both times having sex with him were very painful, especially last night. Before my boyfriend and I had sex he told me that he has a big penis and he told me that several women told him this. He even wears the large size condoms. He had a noticeable bulge in his pants (he’s four inches flaccid) so I believed him. I looked up his measurements on Google and several websites say that his penis is average. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, that’s okay to be average. I just feel conflicted and confused as to whether or not he is really truly on the large side. There could have been several reasons why those women could have told him that he has a big penis. Average penis size may have changed over the years, those women were exposed to smaller penises, maybe his penis changed size, etc. He is in his late 40’s and his penis size may have decreased. (I heard this older guy took viagra and he penis size returned to the size it was when he was younger.) I’ll take his word for it that women have told him he has a big penis because he has been truthful about everything to me. I’m thinking that my boyfriend probably does have a big penis because he made me bleed. He said the same thing happened with another girl that he had sex with who was petite like I am (I’m 5’ 2”). I want some people to weigh in here: is he average or big?",19Jan2018,3

316," I'm a fifteen year old,male, high school student who has a crush on a classmate. I'm wondering if she likes me back because she has:

1. Called me cute out of seemingly nowhere.


2. Stared at me and smiled when I catched her in the act.


3. Touched me a lot. Things like grabbing my arm.


4. She hugged me twice in a row. First time she hugged me and said how tall and skinny I am. She stopped hugging me while saying she felt short. Then hugged me again to show the people with us how short she was in comparison (this happened today while playing volleyball).

5. Wants me to sit closer to her in class.

 


I don't know what to think of it. I haven't done anything about it because the way my high school works means I will see her every school day, every period  until high school ends. I don't want it to be awkward in case she doesn't feel the same.


I find it hard to believe someone might be interested in me.

318,"I (21f) love almost all of my (26m) bf's friends... except one. She's very dramatic and attention seeking. The kind of person who uses anxiety and depression to draw attention to herself and get special treatment and not have to take responsibility for her actions. I know I'm biased, because I also suffer from those issues and find them very difficult to talk about, but that is my number 1 pet peeve as I feel it adds to stigma around anxiety sufferers as attention seeking and selfish, which we are not. The number 1 reason I don't like her though, is that she is horrible to another of my bf's friends who she dated years ago. In the past, he has tried to be friendly and talk to her and her bf at parties, and she has bitched about this and called him a ""freak"" for talking to her. He is a genuinely lovely guy, and she dumped him, so I see this simply as a case of him trying to be the ""bigger person"". Either way, I feel she is needlessy unpleasant and rude. The least she could do is get over it and just ignore him, but she continues to talk shit and try to hurt his standing in the group for no reason. I find her a very unpleasant person and try to avoid being around her. When my bf talks about her I try my best to act as if I like her but do you think this is unfair? Should I just tell my bf the truth? I obviously don't want to hurt my bf's relationship with her because I know he gains a lot from it and she's not specifically unkind to him, but I also don't want to feel like I'm lying to him.

320,"- severe inferiority complex
- severe anxiety
- social anhedonia (no pleasure in social situations), although this varies. generally i do have some enjoyment from socialising with small groups of people i know very well. if i am meeting new people, as soon as they stop triggering my inferiority complex i will decide they're a waste of time to be with and i'd rather be alone anyway.
- sometimes i don't give a fuck about feedback (positive or negative feedback both just piss me off for some reason), other times i am hypersensitive. depends on if the person triggers my inferiority, i guess.
- severe all-or-nothing thinking. i have to be the coolest guy or else i might as well quit and be nothing. i have to be the best (at work, say) or i'm trash. i have to be spinning plates or i'm a failure with girls and should just be celibate. and so on.
- i hate being with my family and i am hyper irritable.
- unlike classical schizoid i do want a partner -  i find it comforting and i have one hell of a sex drive. i was pretty bad to my last gf because i didn't feel anything for her personally. i didn't bother to remember her birthday for 2 years. i hope i can be different in the future. being nice to a girlfriend just makes me feel like i'm being taken advantage of, i imagine them cheating on me.

I'm 27 now and from stories my mother has told me I've shown clear signs of this problem from at least age 2.

    So, before I started my first college semester, I was a part of a Facebook group for my college class. People were introducing each other all over the place, and I came across one person that seemed really interesting. We had a lot of the same interests, and this person seemed to have a good head on their shoulders. I liked their post, but like an idiot I never commented on it or put out a friend request. I guess I just assumed that I would see this person around when college started.  
First semester goes by, I made a few friends here and there, got really solid grades, and my adjustment to college life was very smooth. My one regret, however, is that I never got to talk to this person, and I saw them around rather frequently, but always in passing, and never long enough to introduce myself.  
So now, I'm entering into my second semester. I'm off to a good start and am generally optimistic, but I still can't get this query out of my head: Should I even bother talking to them at this point? It's not helped that I still see them every other morning on the way to a class.

329,"To preface this, we've gone through all the right channels that we were supposed to in order to claim our luggage back but not one person provided us with the help that we needed.

I am writing this because we are at a loss as to our next move in this situation. Our family took an international vacation out of JFK airport this past August and when we arrived at our destination we found out that apparently my daughter’s suitcase never left JFK. We were assured that it would be delivered to the place we were staying at so we went on our way. As more and more time passed on our vacation my daughter became very disheartened by not having her belongings that it put a big damper on the whole vacation for her.

When we arrived home, we found out that the suitcase was apparently held up at Norwegian Air (our flight) and was confirmed to be in the luggage holding area but NOT ONE employee was available to retrieve it for us so they INSISTED they would mail it to our address. My daughter then looked at a picture of the baggage holding area to pick out her luggage (which showed very clearly that our address tag with our name and address was STILL ATTACHED), which she identified for the employee, then left our address and contact info and went on our way back home.

As weeks passed by we called repeatedly and there has been no action on their part to retrieve and ship the suitcase to us. We’ve spoken to multiple people and at this point we have no recourse but to submit letters to anyone who is in a position to reimburse us for the contents.

We need to solve this situation as immediately as possible. My daughter had medication in the suitcase, and all of the other contents were brand new (clothes, new camera, irreplaceable belongings). She REALLY wants her suitcase back (which, for all we know, is probably still sitting in JFK airport somewhere) but no one seems to have a clue with Norwegian Airline. The amount of negligence across the board is just astounding.  There must have been multiple employees that saw the address tag in the holding area and just didn’t care enough to report it.

If anyone has been in this position before or has any advice on how to resolve this, please let me know. I want to notify as many people in charge as possible to get our retribution.

330,"(23 female) Throw away account here.. I often don't even know what makes me so sad all the time. I feel like when something actually bad goes wrong in my life, I'm not actually effected by it that much, but I just use it as an excuse as to why I'm down. 

My family especially have no clue how much I've struggled with trying to be happy. They only see me a few times a year, so naturally I feel happier when I see them. My boyfriend and I both live in a ski town together. He snowboards, and I ski. He's definitely better than me, so we often do our own thing on the mountain. Lately though, I've been lying to him and he thinks I'm out skiing but I just sit in my car and cry. Today I got all dressed to go out skiing, dropped my boyfriend off at one of the chairlifts, told him I was gonna go to another, but I just parked up somewhere and cried then drove home. I've done this 3 days in a row now, and many other times in the past. I'm so sick of feeling this way. I'm constantly trying to pin point why I'm sad, but I honestly can't. 

I've been like this for many years, sometimes it's worse than others. Today I realized I have hit an all time low because I searched up suicide prevention online. I seriously think about it, but the only thing that stops me is imagining how sad my family would be. Which I guess that means I'm super lucky to have a family that loves me. My boyfriend treats me amazingly. I have few close friends but the ones I do have are great people. 

I have always been hesitant to talk about how I feel sad all the time because I feel like no one will believe me. I don't think people would take me seriously. I don't even know if I'm asking for advice or just needing to talk because these are things I've never told anyone before. But I really don't know how to get out of this headspace. I feel like I have no good reason to be sad too, so I feel like I'd look like I was just trying to get attention. 

I feel like I need help, but I've heard that it's extremely expensive. Fuck. I'm so sick of feeling this way though. I've read self help books, and I have searched up ""how to be happy"" and shit like that so many times. It's all the same shit. Go for walks, be active, stop drinking, don't do drugs, read books, spent time with positive people, I've done all that shit. It's like I'm permanently sad. And I don't know why.

What happened was this: I had graduated high school and was now in college.

I don't remember why i searched for her at all. This was a suprise to me and when she asked all I could say was I have no idea why. Then when i checked deeper I discovered I had searched for her before in 2015. This was when I had her class. Since then tho, I have no idea why I would have looked her up. But I did it and I can't remember why. And now, my girlfriend (rightfully so) thinks im lying. I have no clue what to do.

I have been reading here a lot, mainly for insight and, shamefuly, sometimes for drama. Many posts here relate to things like people love each other but can´t be together because one party involved has ""too much going on"", is ""too busy"" or ""can´t focus because of his/her own stuff"" or ""maybe later"". 
But what does this exactly mean? I think I am the problem here and I want to educate myself. I always thought if somebody loves somebody or is interested or so, they would go for it. OK, feel guilty because of personal problems but still be happy to find someone who would like to share the life with? Why is it so hard? And I am not talking about people with severe depression, but you read this also from non-depressed people (or they don´t admit it).
Where is the thought mistake I am making? And how can I understand these people better? And perhaps - how can I approach people with these thoughts and make them happier and positiver for the future? Everyone has baggage and s**t do deal with - why not together? It can´t be worse than what it is now?
