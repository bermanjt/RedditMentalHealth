Happy holidays to all of you,

i hope this is the right place to ask my question, otherwise i am very sorry.

first of all my backstory: i live near Vienna in Austria but i was born in Germany. Me (27) and my older brother (32). i always wanted to study to become a teacher (what i am doing right now), my brother was always into video games, computer hardware etc.

He went to study informational science (or something like that) at the German troops. I haven't really thought about going there as well because, me being a woman, this wont be the best place for me (and i felt i am way too ""weak"" for the armed forces myself).

Maybe five years ago me and my brother (lets call him Paul) had a really bad fight when we met at a family gathering. Honestly i cannot recollect what it all was about, maybe it was me having a pacifistic attitude, but we never had a really bad connection. There where up an downs through our childhood, but after all we are family!

Since that fight we never really talked again, i felt like he should apologize and he maybe thought that i have to make the first step. But that never happened. we lived in very different parts of the world back then, and the years went by. And now i don't find the right way to talk about what happened and i feel like there is a ""small cold war"" between us, although i don't want this to be!

Why am i telling this story in ""intelligence""?

I think my brother is now in an Intelligence Agency (of the military), i can not know because i never asked him and i think he wouldn't be allowed to tell his family.

While visiting my friends and family (on Christmas) i had the feeling that all my family knew very (specific) stuff about me i never told them. I would prefer not to be more specific about the details but i can tell you there is no other way they could have known (apart from having telepathic abilities). I am not using facebook or other social media services and i use my smartphone only to talk to my friends and use a messenger app, i never have really important data on this device. So i asked myself if maybe my brother is spying on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds very paranoid, but this is the only (satisfying) explanation i could come up with. At the end there is nothing i can do about it, and i don't have something criminal to hide but i would like to believe that i have a little bit of privacy left in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Could someone at the ""army intelligence"" have the ability to spy on relatives, without getting in trouble with their bosses? Do they have the permission and the resources to do such a thing? Have you heard about such a case? and even if you are as clueless as i am about this kind of stuff, what would you do? 

if i am wrong, it will sound very paranoid to my parents, so i am very reluctant to ask them right away.

I have tried recapturing it with a blanket but it just walked out of it while I was trying to work out how to pick it up. It dgaf about the three cats watching it from the windows, i think they're starting to be friends tbh bird is just sitting in front of them. But my worry is the room it is out in is a sunroom and while it learnt very quickly not to fly into glass there is also a pool in there I am afraid it could fly into and a million other little things it could probably kill itself with.

5,"I am 20. My cousins mother/father separated shortly after his birth and have not gotten along since. My mothers cousin(my cousins dad) are like brother/sister, and my mom/dad are close to my cousins biological dad. My cousins mom remarried and moved the family to Mexico when my cousin turned 8, and he hasn't spoken to his biological dads family since he moved. I'm not sure if his biological dad made an effort to communicate, but my cousins mom hates him. Since then my cousins biological dad started a new family and remarried. I am the only person in the family that speaks to both sides, and my cousins biological dad and grandma have been trying to get me to get my cousin to communicate with his dads side. Granted, I have been friends with my cousin since very young, he is like my brother and we have talked almost every single day for 10+ years despite him living far away. Recently my cousins biological grandma asked me to get me to get him to talk to her, she is sick and getting older. I really don't know what to do. Is it my responsibility to do something? I feel like me doing this will start a giant problem between everyone, not so much with my cousin and me but with our families, my relationship with his family, everything. Also he is 19.

7,"I'm subletting my condo and my landlady is being incredibly difficult. Asking questions like the subtenants' nationality, if they have children, etc. I told her she's not legally allowed to ask that, so now she's trying to bombard us with other requirements - seemingly to find grounds to reject their subtenancy.

My subtenants are a married couple, but the sublease is solely under the wife's name. She's provided her credit score (good standing) and a letter of employment from a well-known company with a good salary and 15 years of tenure there. Now my landlady is requesting the same documents for the husband even though his name isn't on the lease (though he will be living there). I've tried looking up information on whether this is allowed but can't find anything on it. Can she do this and reject their application on these grounds?",31Dec2018,1
8,"My fiancé has three friends over right now to play card games. I just got home, and the stench is unreal. It was like a brick wall that hit me in the face the moment I opened the door. My entire apartment smells like vomit. I have quarantined myself in the bedroom because it’s not as bad in this room. It’s not coming from the bathroom, so I don’t think someone got sick here. It’s coming from a *person*. It’s definitely not my fiancé. He’s a clean dude and always smells good. He also said that he can’t smell it, which was very shocking to me because it’s quite strong.

Two of these guys I’ve known a long time and they have never stunk before. The other... I have only met once, and walking past him leads me to believe it’s coming from him. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be an asshole and tell someone that he’s unwelcome here again, but this is disgusting and is making me feel physically ill.

10,"Okay so a bit of background first, about how I was named. I am of an ethnic origin, but for anonymity's sake, I am going to change the names used in this post. 

So my parents were originally going to name me 'John,' but they decided against it because they felt that the name did not work well with my last name (e.g. would be made fun of, etc). So instead, they decided on another name, but being my parents, they decided to change the name so that 'the North Americans' would have an easier time pronouncing it. So for example, instead of naming me 'Daniel' they named me 'Danyeel.' 

Here's the kicker though, they only call me 'John' and not by my actual name, and anyone I meet through them, they introduce me as 'John', whereas anyone I meet not through them, I say my actual name 'Danyeel.' So for the people who are not ethnic to my culture and I meet myself, they think my name is a normal ethnic name. However anyone I meet that is of my ethnic background, many of them are apprehensive in saying my name because they don't know how to or they just think it's weird because they know it is incorrectly spelled. 

Up until now it hasn't been that bad, but the situation is getting frankly ridiculous when my family friends come over to my house and see my degree on the wall with my name on it and I hear them asking each other 'who is that?' It is honestly so bad that my own father's brother didn't know my name until last year (and I am in my mid 20's) and now that he has heard it, he never calls my by either of my names anymore and just uses generic terms. 

It is also weird when my friends come over and hear my parents calling me 'John.' 

Because of all of this, my biggest fear is when I'm going to get married.... half the people invited on my side aren't going to know who I am, and everyone on my future wife's side are going to think 'wtf.' 

Anyways, I've thought of two solutions: Sitting down and speaking with my parents honestly and telling them I'm not comfortable with them calling me a name that they haven't given me and that they should start calling me by my real name. Or the second solution, changing my middle name to 'John.' This way it's understandable when people call me by John because it's my middle name. 

If you've actually read all of this, thank you, I sincerely appreciate it and I would also appreciate any advice from anyone regarding this situation. 

**TLDR**: My parents were going to name me 'John' but decided not to. They named me 'Danyeel' instead of 'Daniel' so that everyone could pronounce it easier (all names in this example are changed for obvious reasons). They call me John still and introduce everyone I meet through them as John, whereas everyone I meet I call myself Danyeel. Living with two different names is really bugging me for a number of reasons. Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",31Dec2018,1
11,"OK so this isn't the most awful problem on the world but I do feel incredibly guilty every time I see that my mum has transferred money into my account.

She and my brother are currently living with my partner and I. I helped them move interstate which she gave me some money for. Fair enough. I would've done the same and I was also helping to pay for food and accommodation on the drive back to my house.  But she's been living here for 1-2 months now and in total she's transferred me about $3000! That's not including the money she gave and spent on me for Christmas.

You'd think she was loaded like Oprah with the way she keeps giving me money.

She doesn't have a job due to a neurological condition, and receives a benefit from the government because of this. The payments aren't exactly above average.

I have told her to stop giving me so much money so many times but she just won't stop. I can't for the life of me figure out why she does this. She doesn't give my brother hundreds of dollars so why me? Yes I only work 2-3 days a week and study but I'm not broke. I can afford to live.

How can I get my mum to stop being so generous with her money? Especially since she's not in a position to do so",31Dec2018,1

13,"Hey guys, so I dont know what to do in this situation and maybe you all could help. So I am a 27 year old married mother of 2 and my husband (who has his CCNA and a degree in networking) works for my uncle doing sales estimation in oil and gas..making 63 thousand a year. My husband says he hates his job working for my uncle because it's too much family intermingling and he wants to switch into the IT field. The thing is he has ZERO experience and would most likely have to start at help desk making crappy money. My uncle offered him alot more money to take over as IT guy for his small company, but my husband refuses because he thinks the job will be taken over by automation. I am terrified about my kids having to suffer because they are only 2 and 3... Do you guys think it's better for him to switch into IT and do help desk and suffer or take the IT position with my uncle. Any advice would be helpful! ",31Dec2018,1
14,"I am 1/3 of a friend group that is starting to feel toxic / fake but i don't know if it's just me being paranoid / overthinking, etc. Long story short one of these friends I've known since we were 12 (30 now) and we've had a complicated relationship. For the most part we're really close and everyone knows us to be inseparable but few ppl know that in the 6th grade she spread rumors about me and my family shopping for xmas at goodwill which she eventually apologized for. In high school she told my dating drama to her male friends who then told me and when i confronted her, i became the enemy and until this day one of the guys hates me b/c I confronted her... Again, I forgave her and she did a few other things that we moved on from and there was a 1 year break in our friendship when we were around 21 b/c her shady cousin hated me after a situation and i felt the friend didn't have my back. 

We eventually became friends again and we have traveled the world together and trusted each-other with a lot but i can't help but feel that she is out to get me. A few details about work drama i told her got into other people's ears, and overall i feel like she secretly hates me (she RARELY compliments me and seems to be happy when bad things happen more than good) but she's also supportive at times so I get confused. I introduced her to another friend maybe 8 yrs ago and for like the last 5 years we've all hung out together, etc. but i'm starting to feel uncomfortable as they seem to be really close and i can't help but feel like the 3rd wheel at times. ... The 3rd friend is a sweet and amazing person and knows the history between myself and the other friend but seems to not want to take sides and really likes the other friend which is cool. I just feel uncomfortable in all of it and i don't know if i'm stuck in the past too much or if i need to break free from this 3's company relationship and find new friends.... but it's hard to let go b/c we do have a good time and they've both had my back a lot too... idk really stuck ",31Dec2018,1

This left me really hurt inside for months. I feel like if they go to this event and I dont she will talk about me badly to my friends, but if I go and she is there I dont know if I would be able to handle it as I would have to engage with her. what should I do?

18,"I'll try to be brief but this story is a bit convoluted.

To start, a bit of my background. I'm 24 years old and incredibly mature for my age due to dealing with my alcoholic mother, my parent's recent divorce, etc. I take pride in generally having my shit well together in life, but it's taken alot of therapy and my biggest struggle in life has been setting boundaries. 

Enter my aunt (dad's sister), who's been married to my uncle for many many years. I have great respect for her although her personality can rub me the wrong way. I feel we are ""wired the same way"" but I'm way more grounded in things because of my experiences and she seems to love lamenting in very abstract ways. 

The deal lately has been that my uncle has a job that keeps him away from home traveling for literally months at a time. As you can imagine this would put a strain on any marriage. They were always very close with my uncle being a huge family man and taking care of cooking, their expansive garden, and so on.

Well, in the past 6 months she constantly alludes to me about her problems. She pulled me aside on a family vacation to help make her a secret email account my uncle couldn't see. I guess through iCloud their stuff is all linked and he's been into all her texts, emails, etc. Which I agree is inappropriate even for someone who is NOT up to no good. They're very old school people. I would not pin this towards infidelity but she's always saying ""maybe I can explain this to you when you're older."" Like I haven't already recently witnessed and been between a nasty and ugly divorce. I digress...

Similar things have gone down like this. Cornering me on Christmas and asking for help because she can't access the email anymore. I took a cursory look and couldn't figure anything out about why. I just wanted nothing more to be out of that situation. I feel it's getting inappropriate... sitting behind a closed door with my aunt while my uncle tells at her it's time to go. I refuse to be that close to the problem. I feel that if she is a 50 year old women who has raised kids with that man, she can face up to him and their problems on their own. Not confide in her ""just getting on my feet as an adult"" niece. Even going to far as to interrogate me if my relationship truly makes me happy... we've been together 6 years and are engaged. Pretty sure I'm confident in my fiance. I have proven to be a smart and responsible lady in my decisions for many years...

Anyways. She wants me to come and do her hair tomorrow for a NYE ball with her husband. Last time I did this last year they had a fight while I was there... I've been ignoring her calls and texts. I'm so tempted to say no and enforce my boundaries but I understand she would want some context for that. I'm not really prepared to discuss these  problems I have with her yet. If she can't confront her husband, I can't imagine how  poorly things would go if I, of all people in our family including 3 of her brothers and sisters, put my foot down first. My dad has always been the ""black sheep"" of that family and I don't feel respected in the same way as my other cousins. I do not trust that my voice will be heard.

I have to call her back soon... I just dont know what to say.",31Dec2018,1
20,"I'm sorry to anyone who might find my issue stupid or find me unnecessarily overreacting but its been its been in my head for quite a while.

So essentially, I'm not sure if what I have is just anxiety or something, but basically, i always live in constant fear that everything I own is gonna break somehow or someway if it makes the slightest sound of discomfort, or maybe isn't perfectly organized or symmetrical with everything else. 

I had some friends over and took my Xbox out to the living room so we could use the big TV, and I put on the floor and accidentally hit it a little with my foot and it slid like 2 inches (the floor is slippery itself so it wasn't like a punt). It seems perfectly fine but for some reason, I feel so discouraged to use it because I feel like it could break at any second even though its probably perfectly fine.

24,"Hi everyone!

I’m on a throwaway for obvious reasons. Also posting on mobile. Tl; Dr at the bottom

So my dilemma goes like this. Every year my friends and I go on a road trip. Usually to a different city and no more than a couple nights away. This year was a little different as most of the normal group couldn’t go, but enough were interested out of the normal group that wanted to so we decided to anyway. All was set for the trip, reservations were made, itineraries were ironed out, until last week. See, we are all in our early twenties, and some are still in college. The friend who this is concerned about is one who is still in school. This friend is notoriously bad at managing money. On Friday I get a text from him stating that he may not be able to go on the trip because he will likely be completely broke by the time it happens (no job and mostly living off student loans at the moment). I said that’s fine and understandable. It was a little nerve racking because the way everything was set up the trip would be affordable with four people but not so much with three. I contacted another mutual friend of the group to see if they were interested in going (they originally said no when the trip was originally planned due to being on the other side of the country but plans changed). He said yes. Later in the day, the friend with no money said he will be going because he “found some money”. When I pressed him on how he found money, he said he never used a visa gift card he received from work awhile back when he had a job that supposedly had $600 on it. When he tried activating it he said it had none and has since been working to get the money from the company. Long story short, he said he will get the money by Tuesday (the day we leave) or die trying. The company had yet to return his calls. I know this is long winded so I will cut to the chase. We each have about $600 budgeted for the trip for everything (the hotel, activities, food, gas, etc.) However, should this friend go, the budget for activities would likely shrink significantly (likely to $250 which would be 90% food and hotel). How do I work to tell my friend he shouldn’t go if he’s broke without hurting his feelings? Or should I suck it up and just try to do the trip on the cheap and avoid doing activities that cost money? Thanks reddit. 

TLDR: Broke friend is going on trip. Need to decide if rest of group should avoid going to attractions we want to go visit so friend can go or to tell friend he should skip it and have another friend go. ",31Dec2018,1

26,"I hate my name with a burning passion, although I'm not going to say what it is just for privacy reasons. It's given me self-esteem issues my whole life and I cringe every time I hear it. Who knew that having a name you don't like can give you self-esteem issues and also identity issues as well. 

Eventually, I started going by the nickname Ellie. I liked it a lot, and it was similar to my name as well. In the past year at work, I was permitted to change my badge name to Ellie and told my coworkers that this is the name I want to go by now. It was a bit of a struggle at first because people didn't want to bother getting accustomed to it when they were used to calling me by another name. But now people respect my preferred name (for the most part). 

However, I find that I'm beginning to outgrow the name itself. I like it, but it feels a bit plain and nickname-y. Another name I have grown to like is Dahlia, because I love the flowers. I know it has morbid connotations because of the Black Dahlia murder case, but I don't really care. 

This year I am set on finally legally changing my name. My name has become a huge burden to me and I just want to get rid of it. I'm just not sure what to change it to. Like it probably makes sense to change it to Ellie since this is the name I go by on a day-to-day basis now. If I were to change it to Dahlia, then I would have to go around telling my friends and coworkers to call me by a new name and I just don't want to do that again. If I moved or got a new job, a fresh start, it would be different.

So I'm a bit conflicted and unsure what to change it to.",31Dec2018,1

29,"My friend and myself have Borderline Personality Disorder. We met in group therapy. We both do drugs (she does way more than me and ones that are more dangerous). She and I struggle a lot mentally and emotionally, but probably her more. We've talked about how we never want kids.

Now she is (unintentionally) pregnant from her boyfriend of 2 months. Without ANY thought about this, she has decided to have the baby and keep it.

She doesn't have a job. She lives with her parents. 

She is a meth addict. She has been shooting meth regularly for about 4 years. She has done meth as recently as two weeks ago. 

She also regularly takes benzodiazepines and smokes weed. I have talked to her specifically about if she is taking drugs now during the pregnancy. **She said she is taking Xanax daily (which she does not have a prescription for) and is smoking weed daily, even though she is fucking pregnant.**

I have told her to stop smoking weed, be careful with benzodiazepines, and to make an appointment to talk to her doctor as soon as possible. Also besides these drugs, we take meds for BPD and I have told her to also talk to her doctor about her meds and if she should be taking them while pregnant (antidepressants, antipsychotics, etc).

Here's some more stuff about her...a couple months ago she overdosed because of fentanyl (and was also doing meth and benzos at the same time) and had to go to ER.  Because of her history of meth addiction, I know how frequently she does it and her multiple attempts at quitting and always relapsing, I do not trust her to not shoot meth while she is pregnant. 

Besides all that -- and this part really isn't my business -- but I believe she is absolutely incapable of raising a child. She is unfit to be a parent. Less than two weeks ago she was very suicidal. She is not mentally stable. Neither am I; I am not judging her on being mentally I'll, because I am too. I just think this is a really bad time for her to have a kid.

I don't know what else to do. If I say more then I know she'll get offended and our friendship will be over. Honestly, she is really, really stupid. She just doesn't know basic common sense about health and pregnancy. 

I don't want to sound judgmental at all about drug use or mental illness. Again, I do drugs, I'm mentally ill, I was also suicidal, all these things. I am only sounding judgmental in all of this because she is pregnant. There is a human life on the line. If it wasn't for that, I truly don't care what people choose to do with their bodies or what they do in their spare time. The health risks involved with her baby are what is bothering me.

Anyway, besides all of that, obviously the worst thing to me is her smoking weed while pregnant. I wish there was a way I could stop this.",31Dec2018,1

My mother went to prison in 2016 for attempted murder of her drug dealer, only she wasn’t charged with that for reasons I have no idea. She is supposed to get out February of 2021. 

My sisters, G and J, are currently living with my grandma and grandpa (from my mothers side). Both of their fathers are not in the picture, one because of kidnapping charges and the other well he was a one night stand. My grandma is an alcoholic and is very rude and insulting to my sisters. Even calling J stupid and a dumbass for making a simple mistake. She has even laid hands on both of them, and I don’t mean just spanking, she just never leaves marks. My grandpa is working 9+ hour days and doesn’t get home until close to 6-7 some nights. He isn’t too bad, he just has extremely dumb rules and never believes anything my sisters say. My sisters were put into their custody after my mom went to prison. They were taken away once because of how my grandma would get drunk, but were placed right back into their care after a few lies. 

I am 20, and currently a stay at home mom to a one year old. I am in college and getting ready to start working. My SO makes really good money and we are doing good. I try to take my sisters as much as possible. Although, with them having school they won’t let me except for a couple days every few months unless it’s a big break. Christmas break they have spent at least 9 days with me. They have a room here, I have bought them clothes, a bed, toys, and other things for them to keep at my house. They love being here. They are constantly asking why they can’t just come live with me. 

I and my SO, have absolutely no problem with them coming to live with us. It is something I have wanted to do since I was 16. I raised these girls for 6 years when I was younger because my mom was too worried about drugs. I have talked to my grandpa about it, and even though he isn’t in good health and has an alcoholic wife, he says that I’m not ready for them. He doesn’t realize that I have literally been preparing for this for 4 years ever since I moved out of my moms house and into my dads. 

I guess the advice I need is, what do I do? I really want my sisters to come live with me but how do I get custody over them? They are both miserable where they are at and I’m tired of seeing them this way.

Most people will be out with friends, so I'm not sure how I'm going to cope - it does feel super awkward being on your own in a bar, especially on NYE - I'm not okay with pretending like I'm there waiting for someone, but I know I'll look like a loser. In an ideal world I'll somehow magically make friends and have a good night, in reality I'll likely look like a tit drinking alone then come home.

46," Now, let me get this out of the way. I won't get into this specifically, because I could write pages and pages (and have) on my own faults. But to summarize: Recently I've realized that while I am a victim of things throughout my childhood, how those things project are downright manipulative, self-serving, delusional, tribalistic, and beyond judgmental. I'm in therapy, and I'm trying to do things to get better. I have a really, really, really long way to go.  I got out of the Army when I realized I couldn't be in and find time to really work on the problems I have at the same time. I really needed to devote time to these issues. So something happened at home right before I got out, and one of my closest friends from the Army offered for me to move into his place. He's been a great help. I love the dude, but I've started to realize that if I want to get better, I might need to separate myself from him and stop being so close to the guy. And that sucks, because I love the dude, we deployed together, we've had so many memories and moments together. And some other guys from my unit moved here with him before I got out also, and I knew them before, but now I'm starting to realize some things about them I don't like. 

&amp;#x200B;

 But I'm also overdramatic and have thought the wrong thing before when it comes to these things. So take these with a grain of salt. 

 So about my friends:   
 One friend, gaslights the hell out of everyone. When I went to his home, with his parents, he would yell at his mom all the time. He's very mentally abusive to his girlfriend, and past girlfriends. I see this comes from a place of insecurity. He's not sociopathic, just afraid of losing his girlfriend/friends. He lies, and talks shit about all of us behind our backs. He's never wrong about anything. He just broods insecurity. My other friend (We'll call him E), staged a type of ""intervention"" and he stuck to his guns, even when called out and shown a recording of him lying. I wasn't here for this.   


 One friend, doesn't give a shit about anything. He doesn't show up to a job that E got him, and acts like nothing is wrong. He shys away from all conflicts, and creates more and doesn't take any accountability for his actions. For example: He bought a dog that tore up his apartment, and his roommate had to pay 800$+ for the repairs/etc. On top of that, one night he got ridiculously drunk, and he's an angry drunk, and he shit all over the place. In the trash can, on the wall (somehow, I came home and personally saw what was left of this.) So that tied into the 800$ charge. Plus he stopped paying rent like three months out. His roommate was liar guy mentioned above.   


 And my last friend (E), who I'm currently room with, is a charismatic guy. A natural leader. One thing I realized when I moved in with him, is that everyone practically worships the ground he walks on.  All his friends from high school come over and are all over him.  Trying to get his approval, attention, etc. He's handy, funny, street smart, book smart. Beautiful girls are always trying to get at him, it's ridiculous. But he's a control freak. And he beats the living shit out of his dog when she does something wrong. His dog is really sweet, and is one of the best dogs I've ever met in my life. But he's always talking shit about our other friends, and instigating things. Like if I'm drunk, he'll try to get me to something ridiculous, like I'm known for doing when I drink. That's something I don't want to do anymore. I'm trying to stay away from neurotic things. I broke my foot one night, and he kept telling me I was a bitch for trying to go to the hospital while I was beyond inebriated. I don't even really remember what happened. And there's something off about him. He can't sit still, he likes to talk shit but gets agitated when someone rubs his ribs. But the thing is, E is one of my best friends. He's done so much for me. But sometimes I can't help but feel like he doesn't respect me, and he has me around just because he knows I don't like confrontation and he can control me. Maybe I'm paranoid. But all of E's friends are deeply flawed also. 

  


 I want to be a good friend. Like actually for once, not like I've always pretended. Should I accept my friends for who they are, with their problems, and all of that? Or should I get out there, and try to make new friends? Another thing is, when I hang out with any of them, all they do is talk about the flaws of one of the other guys. And I do partake sometimes, I won't act like I'm innocent. But I wonder if they talk shit about me? I'm willing to bet they do. ",31Dec2018,1
47,I’ve been suffering from OCD for years now and the look of my hands now would disgust some people from all the excessive washing. It’s been more then 5 years of suffering from this because of my parents lack of knowledge on mental illness. My dad responded to me with major violence early on because of the high water bills and his mentality that I was just wasting water for no reason. He assaulted me on multiple occasions and these weren’t any child level beatings they were very violent. I’m  18 now and I’m fed up with my parents mentality on mental illness. They don’t believe what I’m going through is an actual disorder. I’ve asked to go to a doctor and my dad stupidly tells me they will force me onto heavy medication and my mom who is very gullible and also doesn’t believe in these illnesses backs him up. My father has an 8th grade education and my mom finished basic school in a foreign country like my dad. My veins on my hands hurt  because of the years of scrubbing and washing. Every time I use the bathroom I have to take a shower or I’ll feel dirty and spend an hour washing my hands. If someone sneezes in my proximity without covering their mouth I’ll feel like I have to wash my face and feel uncomfortable talking in that proximity for a while. I use utensils when eating stuff like chips and other snacks that require hands. Since my parents have failed to seek treatment I’ve found loopholes in my daily routine that can get past my obsessive thoughts. Like having a short shower after I use the bathroom. These loopholes trick my mind into feeling clean. I’ve been late and have missed my first period so many times in high school because of this illness. Some days I feel like giving up. The joints in my fingers hurt and OCD has been ultimately ruining my life. To all you who may become future parents please be more understanding then what I’ve had to put up with. Even after this lengthy paragraph I haven’t scratched the surface of my experiences. Please to all you future parents please be more understanding about mental illness.,31Dec2018,1

49,"Hi, I'm hoping to get some advice on what I can say and how I can say it, when talking to my niece about a potentially upsetting topic. 

A bit of background - my niece is 18 years old. She has been living with me in another state for approximately 18 months, because of fights/issues she has had with other people in the small-ish town where she grew up. Her parents, 1 x grandparent and brothers still live in that small town. 

I live in an attached townhouse, meaning there is a shared common wall between the two townhouses. Due to need/opportunity, my parents - her grandparents - live in the townhouse on the other side. We also have an open gate between the two houses, and an open door policy, so it is similar to living under one roof. 

The issue is that my dad has recently been diagnosed with cancer, and is now undergoing treatment. He is also in significant pain most of the time. He is, quite understandably, feeling confused and sad and worried and a whole lot of other emotions, as is my mother. Even more so, he just doesn't want to be around other people, which I feel he is certainly entitled to feel. 

They both struggle to cope with their grand-daughter's behaviour at the best of times - she lies, responds badly to innocent comments, snaps when upset etc. We have talked to her and worked with her on this, and while she does do it less around us, it still  happens. 

Because my priority - and theirs - is her grandfather's health and taking care of both his and mum's physical and mental health, we have decided that we cannot handle her living with us full-time next year (2019). She has finished school but doesn't have a job, doesn't have many friends here and can't drive. So, as awful as it sounds, she would be an emotional, financial and mental drain on all of us at a time we really don't think we can cope with any more. 

The other issue we have is that her mum - my sister-in-law - seems to have a commitment to her living with us. I don't know if it's because she truly believes opportunities are better here (they're not) or because her daughter is difficult to live with, which she has admitted to us. My brother, her dad, is not currently in a position to help out much, so I can't just ""handball"" it to him. 

My question is - how do we discuss this with her, what do we say, how do we word it etc. so that a) she knows it is just not an option to live her until at least his cancer treatment is over and b) do it in a way that doesn't upset her greatly or destroy the relationship with her or her mum. 

Thanks in advance, all advice is appreciated.

51,"Today I started a new job. And today, it also ended.

It was a minimum wage line cook job at a local restaurant. I've only ever worked in food and even though Ive grown sick, we are living financially rough and need to support my daughter.

Goes as such, I get there and begin learning the ropes. That's what new employees should do, right? Regardless of my experience no two food companies operate the same and make their food the same. 

I was given some time pre-show to go over menu items and how to make them. It's mostly veganized food. 

I start, and the GM has an employee show me around and start me on a project, which was making turkey burger patties. I made about 2 trays of it proficiently. 

Then we work on up to the line. Before I get into this, I should state: I told the GM I spoke with that Id like to work cashier, as Im much more efficient (mentally) to do so. Well, the GM i spoke to was let go and a new GM was in charge.

The New GM has another employee show me the grill. So I start asking simple questions, such as ""how long do you wait for so-and-so to cook on one side"" and similar. They gave me some useful tips, but I wasn't quite able to do much. We got busy and my chances to help myself were put aside when the rush began and the grill was taken by those experienced. So i used that to put other stuff together. They quickly showed me the ways to make their salads/soups and fry systematics. 

Im not a quick learner. I need to be hands on a few times to get things down good enough but we had no time. First day and I'm already told to be quicker. But how, I barely know how to put these things together. and the GM was no help. He actually tells me to stand aside and watch, so with my pride aside, I do so.

Picture 7 people in a small space doing multiple things, around the new guy who is pretty anxious as he doesnt have the proper knowledge of the works they requre. I was getting claustrophobic and anxious. I stepped outside to catch a breath and nearly threw up.

I mentioned to the GM soon after that I applied for cashier and if I can reposition to that end. Unfortunately I only get part time hours for that, but I agree to it anyway. Ill just get another part time job.

When it all ends I am eager to leave. As I head out I guess I forgot to say anything, because I was chased down by the GM and told to not come back for not ""Thanking me(GM) for the oppurtunity and saying bye to your(me) fellow employees"" I see how that is a problem, but the guy knows my position having to raise a daughter but was quick to fire me. I didn't say anything and just walked off.

I can't blame anyone, but if I end up in food work again in a setting like this, what should I do different?

57,"Hello people, I'm sorry for the formatting of the following post but I'm writing this on my phone away from home...

I don't even know where to start. My father is an alcoholic (but is not violent and never shouts, more of a pathetic sad drunk), he's been one for about 30 years, never being completely dry. He basically has a okay control over it while people are around but as soon as he's left alone he always always always falls back on it.

This time my mother was leaving the country for 4 days because in my hometown one of her brothers was really close to dying... So when she left everything was fine on her first day of absence, but on the second day my dad started getting up at a ridiculous 3 a.m. Which I was unaware of, and I think he got extremely drunk... It barely took my mother a day to notice since its always been the same with him, she noticed it because she called him and he seemed off, as one does when he is completely smashed. After she came home 3 days later she was extremely furious at him saying things I never heard her utter before. Things that sound close to her moving out... I got together with one of my older brothers and we tried to de escalate the situation but I think we merely postponed the chaos till tomorrow

I feel utterly helpless and don't know what to do, I have not a single clue how I can handle this situation, since I'm the one who by far gets the biggest brunt of it. (both of my elder brothers moved out of home already so they don't notice most stuff)... What do i do...

Maybe some context that could help you:

We already had family therapy sessions, he was on an intervention in some special facility or whatever you call it, he has visited the AA weekly for the past 7 years...

Nothing has helped thus far, he used to be a genious artist, I'm the only one in the family who inherited his love for drawing and painting but somehow he is utterly demotivated to engage in any creative process no matter how hard we try to get him to. I thought about maybe trying to bond with him and draw together with him but I don't know how to approach the situation. He is extremely reclusive and hardly ever speaks his mind...

We talk like 1-2 sentences a day and he hangs on his ipad like 10 hours a day and only goes off it to cook or to clean the flat.

As much as I have demonised him on the above, I have to say I still love him from the bottom of my heart when he is his not drunk self. My mother also could be a part of his downfall, she often nags him unnecessarily due to her general unhappiness with her workplace and she vents on him on the daily, he has no place to vent to since he always eats everything up and never shares his thoughts or feelings...

I'm sorry I don't even know where I'm going with this, I'm just so afraid everything is falling apart.

Any advice you could give me would be very appreciated and even if there is none, maybe this vent helps me calm down a bit.... Thank you ",31Dec2018,1

Then I started. My department is ridiculously small, constantly in flux, and the 4 professors don’t care about any the 8 students in the cohort or our interests. I do enjoy the subjects we’re learning about, but I’m definitely not networking or getting closer to finding my niche research interests. Even though I got excellent grades this semester, I just don’t know that I can justify the cost of an MA if I feel like I’ll walk away in exactly the same position that I started in.

64,"So a friend of mine gave me a motorcycle for Christmas. Yes, GAVE me a motorcycle. It’s a 1995 Honda Shadow 1109 ACE with little to no wear, very low mileage. 

Anyways, when he gave it to me, he handed me the title and said I might have a little trouble getting it registered but it shouldn’t be impossible. I looked at the title and observed that he had never had it registered to himself and the previous seller had wrote the name of the previous seller before him when he signed the title over to my friend. Sounds confusing I know, sorry... so it was corrected by crossing out that name and writing the correct one.

 My friend has no valid bill of sale with the bike and I’m stumped honestly. He wants me to just cross out his name and write mine over it, but I feel like that’s a bad idea haha. I haven’t talked to the DMV yet as they’ve been closed due to the holidays. I thought maybe you guys could help me out with some good advice hopefully.

If it helps I can try to upload a picture of the title so you guys can get a better understanding of it maybe.",31Dec2018,1
65,"About five of us on the team know, not including the girl my coach is sleeping with. The roommate of the girl my coach is sleeping with and I are beyond disgusted with the situation and my coach's past, so we're quitting the team. I'm not going to go back to practice. My coach probably knows we are aware of the situation, but she does not we are going to report it. I am not sure how to tell my coach I am quitting. My friends don't want to give her a ton of time to prepare for the accusations and like delete evidence. If I tell her I know and am quitting, she'll probably get on the defensive. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

My three of other friends want to continue going to practice to ""keep an eye on things"" and ""make my coach uncomfortable."" I think this is kind of stupid and I think we should all quit. They've all insisted on not telling people so that my teammates can ""enjoy being on the team,"" but I think they all have a right to know about my coach's past. She was accused of sexual harassment two years ago, denied the claims, there wasn't enough evidence, and the two girls were kicked off the team. The situation was never addressed. We only went and talked to those girls a few weeks ago. We had been ordered by my coach not to talk to them anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

How should we go about telling everyone? I think it is best to do it in a room, all together, so everyone can ask questions. My friends say we should tell everyone one by one. That seems impractical to me and sort of weird.

At somepoint I felt a hand fully grab between my arse and my taint and I was shocked tbh, I thought it was my mate being a dick.

It caught me so off guard I just didn't really understand what had happened until it was over.

Now I just feel angry, I feel emasculated. I have had similar unwanted attention from women as well, but this just fucked me off.

I want to find the guy and put him in the ground, I keep replaying the scenario and I just wish I had confronted him. I'm not shy to do so. Like I said it caught he so off guard I didn't even process it.

69,"God just writing that title makes me feel so stupid. Why would I be upset about my mentally, physically and emotionally abusive husband wanting to cut off the marriage??? Why wouldn’t I just pack my shit and leave?? 

It started about a month after the wedding. I started noticing significant instability with the consistency and quality of his emotions. One day he loved me the next he hated me. His behavior has been so erratic and unpredictable. He’s probably threatened divorce over 50 times in the last 6 months. It’s always when I catch him in a lie or he doesn’t want to talk about something, so Im probably getting close to catching him in the lie. He’s called me every single name in the book and then wrote a book of his own. He’s degraded me to the point where I’ve felt like a shoe lace has more purpose than me. He’s abused me to the point of unconsciousness. He’s choked me 3 times which scares the shit out of me. He makes it very very clear that I would be nothing without him and that he is my savior. 

On the other hand, he’s usually nice when he’s not acting like that. We do fight sometimes but generally we have good times together. He provides for me and our family and my family really likes him. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to find my own self worth again. I need to figure out how to get out of this terribly abusive relationship. I had no idea what to do and it hurts so bad.

I went to 2 events last week so I thought this was maybe the reason why but I then learned that the guy who was hired a few months before was invited and he also went to these same 2 events. I also overheard someone saying that they will try to get me to go if this other guy can’t make it. I should note that this is a team event so there’s only an allotted amount of spots but I do find it strange how I wasn’t invited at all (the organization hosting it had sent it out to my group in the office who then chose to be on the team).

The worst incident was when she attacked a neighbor in US, she got into trouble with the cops. They said that scumbag neighbor threatened to shoot her. I was terrified.

&amp;#x200B;

She was better once, until I messed things up. You see, I suffer from a paranoid and bipolar disorder, and I do the same thing as her. Although not as delusional as her, I rant on for nights.

I'm afraid that she might freak out at a passer-by. She thinks that everybody is trying to harm her, and she is getting defensive.

It's tough living in South Korea. I go to a college that has some intimidating professors, and my grades are failing. I'm an Asian-American from US. I did better in American colleges. I don't know why the hell I came here. The only reasons I can figure out is my parents demanded me to go to South Korea to learn the Korean language. I don't think it's useful.

I shouldn't have come here. I suffered from bipolar disorder and paranoia since childhood, and should've stayed in US.

&amp;#x200B;

But I had no money to find a job, shelter, and medical care. (I'm past the age for Job Corps) Medical care was getting expensive. Especially with Trump administration screwing things up. So I had to comply and get to South Korea.

Living in South Korea with mentally delusional mother was rough. She would rant days and nights, and it's stressful dealing with school and home. She was verbally and physically abusive. My mind was racing to the point of insanity. We had altercations often, and we almost got injured. Last month was the worst. She was ranting as usual. I was filled with misery and could not control my emotions. I yelled at her to stop and she went to attack me. I blacked out, and I don't remember much, but many terrifying things happened. We almost seriously got injured and I got into serious trouble. If this keeps going like this, I'm scared that we would get killed. I'm scared of jail time. I don't know about here in Korea, but in US, I'd spend the rest of my life locked up.

At least US has better medical care, although expensive. South Korea has poor medical care. I tried to tell the doctor about our situation, but he does not believe me. He thinks she is fine, and I am not. But in reality neither of us are. I'm screaming and ranting. She is delusional and and thinks people are out to get her.

The thing is, my name is Jada and (at the time) I was 12. I kept up this act of being some other girl to try and impress him (and get him to like me basically) and he believed that I was actually 15 and my name was May. When we first met, the guy had a crush on me (and I had a crush on him too)  but this girl at school confessed to him and he’s been going out with her since! I was seriously upset about this because I thought we had some sort of connection, you know? Well anyway, a few months pass and I tell him that all this time my name is Jada and I’m actually ‘12’. He was super upset and blocked me, but I was so guilty I didn’t even try and get into contact with him again. But eventually, we got back into contact. 

After talking for a while, I fell right back in love with him and decided that I should distance myself from him because he had a girlfriend and blocked him (stupid, I know). But once AGAIN I unblocked him and he started asking me why I was being so distant and blocking him- the reason was because I loved him, but I wasn’t just gonna’ confess to a guy that 1) had a girlfriend 2) I essentially just catfished and 3) who was mad at me! He was getting angry as to why I wasn’t telling him why I did it and then blocked me.

I’m very concerned because for a week or more now my son is having nightmares and panic attacks because of what this girl said to him.

I complained and spoke with both the principal and the teacher and they both see it as an empty threat and in their words “probably just a joke”.

I don’t know much about this girl’s family situation other than her mom is a single parent and possibly a “rabid feminist” (according to my creeping on her social media profiles).

I think this girl might be learning the behavior from her mom because of what I read on her moms Facebook - basically radfem propaganda.

I was hoping it would just pass but it’s now turned into my son wetting the bed and waking up repeatedly throughout the night and coming to wake me up.

Should I just tell my son to get over it or should I pursue this further? I’m honestly stuck on this.

It has been 3 days of several emails and a trip to the airport to see if my bag showed up and it hasn’t. We are leaving here tonight and I still don’t have my bag or any ability to contact this airline. They keep giving me incorrect info.

Should I just give up hope and forget this bag? I bought a few new things but it’s hard to not have any comforts of your own clothing when traveling for 2 weeks in a very foreign place.

I guess I want to know what I’ve been missing out on and I want to feel connection and love. I never thought I was ugly but my self-esteem is getting worse because no one approaches me and my lethargy and anxiety aren’t helping me when it comes to developing aspects of my personality. My grades, my creativity, and my motivation have all gone to shit. Everyday is a repeat of “I’ll do it tomorrow.” I live in my head way too much and feel so  disconnected from the world.

I’ve never been in a relationship but I wanted to evaluate my worth and also finally experience something of a teenage romance, so over the summer I got on an app and met up with a few people only to be let down and let a few others down. Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about them and finding myself missing them even though I know they weren’t good for me.

I thought I went through a phase of self-discovery when I was about thirteen or so, and for a while I felt I really understood myself, but over the past year I have really never felt more lost. I just suck up media all day and I feel I have really lost touch with myself and don’t know how to get it back. I have no motivation to get a job or study or work toward anything. I don’t participate in my hobbies anymore or approach anything with great interest. I just sit on the internet all day or play video games. It’s unhealthy and a waste of time but I have no idea how to get out of this rut.

I know that my loneliness it’s not the only thing making me like this. There’s also college stress, this weird new adulthood thing that’s been thrusted upon me, and the need to find myself and my place in the world. I feel completely lost with regard to my future - careers and college and everything, and have recently felt like my artistic dreams were stomped on and thrown out and now I have to navigate this landscape of the real world I never thought I’d have to deal with.

So, I guess, how do I get boys to like me when I have awful social anxiety and an average appearance? - or maybe, how do I stop caring about them and focus on myself? How do I find myself again and know who I am and what to do in the world?",31Dec2018,1
101,"Fairly straight forward as the title suggests, but very long story short my parents divorced when I was in 4th grade or so. As a result my dad had to give her a whole bunch of cash and sign a promissory letter stating he would give her another final payment when we eventually sold my childhood home. We sold the house, my dad gave my mom the check and asked for the promissory letter back, my mom told him she shredded it. We forgot about it, until a few years later she tried to contact my dad again to collect on the letter again, so he knows she still has it, and simply refuses to give it up. He’s afraid when he passes away she will take the note to court and try to collect on it when he passes away. 


How the fuck is this relevant?

My dad wishes no harm upon anybody, he’s an extremely gentle and caring man, but that note being in my mother’s possession drives him absolutely crazy, he’s always stressing about what she might be planning to do with it. So he wants absolutely nothing to do with her until he gets it back or has proof that it’s gone.
When the divorce happened my mom moved to South Dakota to her home town, she’s been there ever since, she’s never come back to where I live to visit, I’ve always had to go to her, and somehow my dad and I always ended up fronting the cost of the plane ticket, or gas money, meanwhile I live with my dad and he’s seen my struggles throughout these last few years of high school and he’s been mad stressed about whether or not I would actually be able to graduate, and I’ve never seen him as excited about anything as he is about attending my graduation. I respect him &amp; his request to not let my mom be at my graduation.

My question is how in the fuck do I even begin to bring it up with my mom? Do I even bother trying to negotiate with it? “If I can get the promissory note back you can come”. It’s totally not my business though, thats between my parents so I don’t want to step out of bounds there but I’d hate to have to tell her to simply fuck off.

My friends always go partying and clubbing while I just stay at home. 

My friends neither ask me if they would want to hang out and neither can I hang out even if I’m asked because my parents are so controlling and restrictive. 

I’m their only child and I understand they want the best for me but I can never do anything. I‘m not allowed to drink, smoke, go out. 

Girls don’t like me, they don’t even want to look at me. I have some friends who are girls but I’m talking about the rest who just don’t even want to look at my face. I’m not even that bad looking, just a little chubby. I also just put myself out there on tinder and okcupid, I have 0 matches on tinder and 13 likes on OkCupid with no matches (probably bots) 

I’m not depressed but my life seems so depressing at this point. Like there isn’t any life in the life I’m living. Everything seems so dull, so boring. Nothing fun. All I have is just my passion for music and nothing else. No family support, no friends, no pets, no siblings.

118,"Hey Reddit. First time poster here. I’ll try to keep this as short and to the point as possible. Names have been changed for obvious reasons. 

I have a friend - let’s call him Alex. Alex and I were close in high school. Fast forward a few years, we are now both reaching the end of our college careers. About two years ago, I pretty much stopped talking to Alex/making an effort to see him. In the past month or so, I have more or less brought him back into my life (we ran into each other at a mutual friend’s house, and I wasn’t going to just ignore him). 

Now, considering how long I’ve known him, there are quite a few reasons I could list here to help explain why I stopped hanging out with him. For the sake of keeping this post shorter, I’ll only mention the most important details. Although it may sound harsh, Alex is essentially an emotional wreck of a person that absolutely refuses to seek any kind of professional help. He has depression (undiagnosed, I’m pretty sure, because he won’t get help), terrible anxiety that often results in panic attacks, and to top it off, he lies and exaggerates about everything, so I don’t even know when to believe him. 

A lot of the issues that he’s dealing with stem from a relationship he had with this girl in high school. We’ll call her Jessie. He was controlling and manipulative, and it was no surprise when she broke up with him. Alex would never admit that he was almost always the cause of the problems in his relationship. He would get upset about the stupidest things, such as who Jessie was hanging out with, for example. He would also make all of his problems her problems, too, as if it was her responsibility to be both a therapist and a girlfriend. In fact, he would thrust all of his issues onto the people closest to him, myself included. His parents were seemingly unaware, probably because he never made it obvious to them what was going on. 

There were multiple points in high school where he would be texting either me or one of my friends about his feelings. I understand depression better than most people, but his thoughts and actions were (and still are) consistently irrational. He wouldn’t listen to advice, and would even engage in self-harm or threaten to kill himself when he was experiencing relationship problems with Jessie. There were a few different times where he would say something incredibly worrying and then stop responding, so somebody would have to try calling his parents. To make matters worse, whenever he was having an episode, he wouldn’t reach out to anybody - rather, he would post on social media to get attention. Years later, he STILL does this. 

Alex originally went to school a couple of hours away, but recently transferred to the school that Jessie goes to. According to him, he received an offer to play on one of their sports teams. I don’t know for sure, but this is almost certainly a lie. Jessie actually DOES play sports for the school, and apparently he shows up to her games and sits on the sidelines with the hope that she’ll notice him. Keep in mind, they broke up 3-4 years ago. 

After I ran into Alex again a month ago, we caught up for a bit, and all was fine. Later that night, however, he sent me the longest text I have ever received, in which he detailed all of the shit he’s gone through since I last saw him. Normally, when I catch up with old friends, we tell each other all of the positive things that are going on in each of our lives. With Alex, it was literally just an explanation of the traumatic events that have occurred in the past two years. I don’t know what’s true and what isn’t, but if anything of what he told me is accurate, it’s astounding that he hasn’t tried seeing a therapist yet. For example, he mentioned that one of his roommates tried to kill himself, and he had to intervene, etc. etc. He even said, blatantly, that he’ll never speak to me again if I don’t hangout with him over winter break. He said the same thing to one of my other friends, too. Aside from all of the issues he has, I don’t even enjoy spending time with him, so the thought of hanging out again sounds like a chore. 

All of this being said, I DO care about the dude. I feel as though he’d be alright if he worked on improving himself. But he won’t get help. He says he’s tried seeing a therapist before, but one session is not even close to being enough. I don’t even know if it’s true, anyways. How can I help him? What can I say? I absolutely cannot support him emotionally. It takes too much out of me, and that’s not my responsibility in the first place. As far as I know, his parents haven’t done anything either, despite the times in the past I have reached out to them directly. He’s a grown adult now, too, so it’s not like there’s much they could do anyways. 

I genuinely need help, because I am at a loss for ideas. I’m worried that if I even try to mention to him what my thoughts are on his behavior, he will do what he’s always done and simply not listen. Worse, he may take it so poorly that the end result puts him in an even deeper hole. I don’t want him to hurt himself or do anything stupid. It’s one thing to be there for somebody in their time of need, but it’s another thing when that’s what your entire relationship with a person consists of. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!",31Dec2018,1

121,"So I (20F) am home for the holidays, and am back to babysitting like I do during summer. I don't work when I am away at school, so what I make during vacations is my only source of income. 

There's a family that I babysit for, and the family, though nice, is pretty flakey and inconsiderate of my time. The mother scheduled me for this weekend, both Saturday night and Sunday night. 

I was scheduled to start at 7 on Saturday, and at 2 PM she told me that their flight was delayed and that they would not be needing me that night. Okay, no worries. It's annoying, especially considering I turned down a different job since I had given her my time commitment, but there was nothing they could do.

Today (Sunday) I was scheduled to work at 6:30. At 5, she texted me saying that she would be late, not until 8:30, and asked if I would go grocery shopping for her (with said newfound time!) I did, and when I got to her house at 8:30 she told me that she was tired, and wouldn't be going out tonight after all. I played with her kids for half an hour and then went home. 

All in all, I made 15$ this weekend, though between the two nights I should have made well over a hundred. Is it too late for me to ask to be somehow compensated for my time? She has also asked me to babysit for her on the 1st, and I'm going to lay down some ground rules saying I expect to be paid for the full time period regardless of whether or not she uses me for that time, but I was still shortchanged a weekend.

I am being treated for it but it's really hard to get any relief from it. It seems like everyday gets harder and harder. On top of that ive been struggling alot with abusing alcohol and drinking because it's the only way I feel calm. I binge drink like 2 times a week so I wouldn't say I'm an alcoholic. I take some meds but don't really abuse them. Maybe I take a benzo once every two weeks. Unfortunately my home life is really hard for me because I have a pretty abusive and angry dad. He constantly insults me and yells at me for pretty much nothing. My mother doesn't do anything to help besides ignore the situation. He calls me things like ""mentally ill"" ""wish you were dead"" ""biggest mistake of my life"" and pretty much just baits me 24/7. I have a hard time ignoring it except for when I'm drunk or on medication. I feel so useless to the world and I'm scared about my life.

127,"At times in my life, it feels like people have been pushing me around to the point that they sometimes see me as a doormat.

Sometimes, I appear scared or frightened or nervous not because I am a really jumpy person who gets scared and jumps if he sees a spider or a bug. In addition, I sometimes come off as a person who is a ""yes-man"" because I typically like helping people and sometimes have trouble saying no, to the point that it sometimes affect my plans and such. Don't get me wrong, I love helping other people. The problem is that sometimes, I focus too much on other people that it affects my own needs (and yes neglected needs is bad).

Sometimes, criminals like to stalk and take advantage of nice people or people who look frightened or emotional because they can easily control them, which is not a good or ethical thing to do. A couple times, because I look like a scared/nervous/anxious/hyper person sometimes in public, criminals see me as a person they can scam easily from selling me cars at sticker price, to trying to rob me. Sometimes, it is hard to stand up for myself because I'm not sure how to do it. This I see as psychological manipulation/gaslighting and it is something I am victim to sometimes. This kinda begs a particular question...

How do I become more brave, fearless, tough, and scary in the sense that people won't take advantage of you? How do I adopt an ""I DON'T GIVE A FUCK"" attitude where people don't want to mess with me because I look tough and not take shit from anyone? How do I get an ""abrasive side"" like Spongebob Squarepants did (without being a complete asshole to people in public, shelling out hundreds of dollars for a literal abrasive side, etc), and stand up for myself and be a tough ""jerk"" instead of a nervous wreck? How do I tell people ""no"" without feeling guilty and be a tough guy?

We’re averaging 3 weeks apart at the most before every visit. She’s been pushing adamantly for me to move to where she attends school. 

Before I came up one time she said that she’s been having these “feelings” lately. She describes them as when she talks to her roommate or her coworkers or boss that she’ll have a feeling or thought of simply kissing them. They’re all women, and she says she isn’t attracted to them. I’ve been very supportive of her and encourage her to not be ashamed or afraid to tell me these things. 

However, when we delve deeper into the conversations she says that she doesn’t want to talk about it anymore and sort of brushes it off. She says trying to delve deeper into the “thoughts” feels forced and uncomfortable. And the proposition of kissing a girl during a night out doesn’t excite her because she’s with me. 

She’s extremely attachment driven. And because these are people she sees everyday maybe she’s influenced in some way to people she shares attachments with because I’m not there everyday?

I'm a self-taught software engineer, and usually learning just comes natural to me, but lately it's just been really hard and I don't want my days to just be wasted. I spend literally my entire day coding, so my social abilities have also deteriorated. 

I'm 26 years old, weigh 210 pounds, male, I'm pretty unhealthy, so I think maybe it could be lack of nutrients, and staring at a screen all day. This has been going on for over a 2 months now, not 100% sure why I've been like this, I feel it could possibly be more.

138,"Hi everyone, could definitely use some advice and other's opinions on what's going on in my life currently... please excuse any errors, I am on my phone here.

To start, I recently had to move out of my family home after no longer being able to maintain it financially, mentally, or emotionally, and had no where to go. I was entirely ready to put all my stuff into a storage unit, leave my reptiles at a family member's home, and live out of my car until I could save enough money to get an affordable apartment. Just as I was getting ready to do so, a good friend of mine and his family offered to let me move into their home and share a bedroom with said friend. Not the most ideal living situation, but it was a roof over my head and for all my pets besides two cats.

While I did take some time to think this over, I made numerous pros and cons lists and finally talked to my friend and his mom, and asked if they were really sure it was okay, and finally moved in at the end of November. Keep in mind this has only really been a month here. Well for December's rent, it was $241 being Christmas was here and I was broke as is, so she said that was fine, it would cover their electric bill. In total, there is six of us living in this 3 story home. Two parents (on disability and workman's comp), my friend and I (both working part time), and my friends brother (he has disability for autism spectrum) and stepbrother (minor). So either way, there is some sort of money flow in the house.

Today I asked his mother on how much rent would be for January, figuring it would be about the same if not, a little more. I don't have any type of savings or any money aside as I am entirely broke. Come to find out, my monthly rent is now $500 a month for a shared bedroom that all I have is a bed and my one dresser. It honestly came as a shock to me as I can get a studio apartment for around the same price if not cheaper in my area, but just cannot afford it at this time. I've talked to my family on this as well tonight while at dinner at my Aunt's house, and they don't think it is entirely fair on my end to be paying more than double than what I was originally told before moving in here. I have no where else to go at all... I don't even make $500 a month at my current part time job, which I am currently trying to find another job or a better one, no one is calling me back. To top off that $500, i do have car insurance, a monthly phone bill, a storage unit due to not being able to bring all my stuff, as well as a few streaming accounts (Netflix, spotify, hulu) that I've since had to deactivate to even afford to pay December's rent. In total, my personal expenses come to around $400 a month, making it a grand total of $900 a month with rent and personal.

Some history of mine: Birth mom ended her life in 2001, I was 4 at the time, 21 now. Stepmom passed away from breast cancer in 2017. April 2018, my father tried to kill my siblings, my two friends, and myself with an m16 (I managed to get it away from him) only for him to use a 9mm. He is incarcerated. I moved into my family home to help him with my siblings and gave up my affordable apartment. No family is able to take me in at this time either. Now I'm not including this little bit of history to use it as a pity party story, but to at least give you guys some back info on what I've been dealing with this past year and why I'm struggling so hard.

What I'm looking for is any advice I can get for my financial situation, if any others believe this is a fair rent fee or not, and any other advice I can get regarding ANYTHING involved in this post....

I normally don't reach out for help like this, but I'm seriously struggling as is, especially with my mental health and I can't even find a therapist that accepts my insurance in order to aid myself in that category either.

Thank you.",31Dec2018,1
139,"Hi there, Happy New Years! It's the 31st here for me

I (17f) was not invited to join in with my 'friends' going out for New Years, I managed to be *that* *person* and force myself into the plans. Yeah I know it's not great but also I was kinda told about it?

I talked to one person who told me about these plans, talked to another who got them self in on the plans, talked to another who was a bit more forthcoming about the plans.

However, I just don't feel welcome. I'm sitting in my room with the knowledge only that 'we' are meeting up at 7pm. It's around 4:30 now and I haven't moved to get ready, I'm really second guessing my decision to join in.

These feelings stem from 1. not being invited initially, 2. having no one tell me any real details (eg. being told ""I dunno"" when I ask for information), 3. no one texting me back despite it being a few hours, 4. even after learning about it and being assured that I would be added into the group chat I wasn't and being shown the group chat by one of the people I spoke to who seemed surprised that I wasn't added.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stressed out about this, I'm anxious and I don't really wanna go but at the same time I do.

Does it seem like I'm making these things up (about being excluded) and should ignore them and just go despite not knowing any real details? Or should I just stay at home **again** for the third year in a row with my mother and not really enjoy myself?

I'm really lost and kinda upset.",31Dec2018,1
140,"Im 17m and all my life people would tell me I have no emotion or I’m quiet or never smile. How do I fix this?

I know I have emotion inside me I just don’t know how to act around people.

Since very young, I have always been anxious or shy and almost could never step out of my own comfort zone. I never spoke my mind and rarely raised my hand in class. I don’t firmly or consciously believe this, but it’s embedded into my way of thinking that giving my opinion is rude and a waste of other people’s time. I was always the bystander in every situation despite being taught that this was not the right thing to do. Ive always depended on peoples approval, especially my 20 year old brother’s. Im insecure about pretty much everything about me though I trick myself into feeling confident and I don’t really show my insecurities. The only thing I do is laugh, and most of the time it’s a fake laugh and I don’t know how to control it. I also try to avoid seeming enthusiastic about things when I’m really not. For example when im at a party with friends, I don’t know how to act hyped up and excited. I want to be excited just for being at a party because yea that should be fun but I just can’t get myself to genuinely show it.

I know this problem may not seem as severe as other people’s that post in this subreddit but this is something that I’ve always needed help on. Ive tried therapy but it didn’t help me so please don’t tell me that. I just want honest human responses. Thank you",31Dec2018,1
141,"so i was an awkward and odd kid in HS, I didn't fit in at all and people disliked me because of that and was made fun of/light bullied occasionally, my friends from elementary school noticed and saw that and so they slowly stopped hanging out with me, now that I'm in college, I stopped talking to all of them, looking back, I cringe whenever I think about what they think of me, a loser, awkward, weak etc. I was one of the most hyped person during elmentary school in the group of friends but after entering HS I turned 180 degrees, they were friends with me because I was hyped and fun to be around during elementary school but my fear of being in a secondary school caused me to be different, it changed my personality and made me act a certain way and now everybody left me. It's like they pity me too much to the point where they can't take it anymore and would rather distance themselves from me, they don't want to basically associate themselves with me anymore because I'm not ""cool"" like the other people, or I'm an ""outcast"".",31Dec2018,1
142,"I love my best friend with all my heart. She is like a sister to me. We both know everything about each other, but recently her behavior has been absolutely disgusting. She moved states 2 years ago, but we have made time to visit each other and make more memories, and we talk all day everyday. A year (and maybe some change) ago she decided she wanted a divorce. Which is fine, improve yourself how you see fit and I will support you. She started going out with random men and out for drinks more frequently. Also started heavily smoking (legal) pot. That’s fine, wild oats to sew. I would try and give her some I’m worried about you talk every few weeks to only have it fall on deaf ears. Annoying, but still my best friend and I don’t want her to feel alone or ostracized. Six months ago she meets this guy who is a total loser. 30+ years old, lives with parents, kinda nice but something is off about his character to me. I actually met him when I visited last and chalked up my bad feelings as being protective. Fast forward some and they’re “in love” and going out and getting hotels every weekend because of both their living situation. She has a lot of complaints especially for a early relationship, such as repeated drunk driving, jealousy over male friends, etc. I suggest break it off. However, that is not the case. They have little spats and have been on and off again over the past few months. In the middle of this her dad dies and the partying gets harder. He is still the same idiot and she still has the same complaints about jealousy and drunk driving. I am begging her to let him go because he’s stressing her out and causing performance issues at work, and setting her back on goals I’ve been helping her with such as going back to school to get a degree for a better career for her and her kids. Fast forward to last night, she calls me freaking out that her cunt of a boyfriend was drunk driving and flipped the truck over 3x on the highway and into an embankment. They’re both fine and he spent the night in jail. I make sure she gets home safe (the best I could due to distance) and tell her we will talk the next day. She is refusing to leave this guy and that this “woke him up” and “he is changing because of this” and it has brought them “closer together.” At this point I’m about to have to cut my best friend I’ve ever had out of my life because she refuses to leave this walnut. I just don’t know how to handle this situation at all, I just want her to be safe and healthy. ",31Dec2018,1
143,"So I want to start by explaining some backstory. 2 years ago this girl and I had a thing which I really fell into. We weren’t together but we flirted a lot and talked every day. This meant a lot to me because this was the first girl I ever had this type of interaction with. She later told me that she didn’t have feeling for me and that all of the flirting was just her figuring out her feelings. We were best friends so this basically killed our friendship.

We didn’t talk for 5 months and had a hard time becoming friends again but by the time we did, she had already moved on and gotten a boyfriend, who she is still dating today. However, my initial feelings for her still haven’t gone away, and I feel like the appropriate word to use is to say that I really do love her. 

Today we’re really close friends but I feel these feelings naw away at me everyday. I constantly think about her and I always want to tell her how I feel. We graduate high school in June and I’m going away for school so I feel like I should tell her before I never see her again, but I don’t know.  I know she wouldn’t be mean or react poorly, but I know her boyfriend would hate it and it would make me feel like a tool to tell her. 

All I’ve wanted for 2 years is for us to be together, and I know now that it isn’t possible, so I just want to focus on finally telling her how I really feel ",31Dec2018,1

People tell me to find something I love doing but I always get burned out of anything. My biggest hobby would be playing video games but even that gets tiresome after awhile. There will be times where I can sit down and play games for weeks, and then the next day I'll be really into something else like working out or looking at real estate. I feel like once I get my feet wet, I'll be full speed ahead in anything I set my mind to, I just feel like I have this big barrier preventing me from starting. Does anyone have any advice or tips on getting started, when you don't even know where the starting line is? ",31Dec2018,1
145,"So I just got off a FaceTime convo with someone and has me having mixed feelings.

A good hour into the FaceTime she started talking about my appearance and said that I look approachable and sweet when I want to, but when I don’t which she says is all the time I look like some depressed man that just lost a huge bet.

She blamed it almost entirely on my smile as most of the time I frown. I usually just keep a straight face but I didn’t know it was really just a frown. She also said at other times I just looked so overwhelmed and suicidal. Thing is I’m not, infact by my standards I’d say I have a comfortable life with no room for depression. Sure I’ll get sad naturally but never necessarily depressed. 

In conclusion, how should I even take what she said and how can I make myself not feel cringey when I smile?

146,"I'm not sure how to approach my neighbour about his dogs. I cannot open my back door without them barking. Sometimes they'll bark even when I'm just moving around inside - my back door is right next to their fence. The dogs aren't always outside, but when they are I can't go in my back yard.  In the summer I'd just give them a spray with the hose, but it's winter so that's not an option. 

I haven't spoken to him much or even seen him very often. What I've heard of him is that he can be a bit of a jerk. Because of that I'm a little nervous about approaching him.

148,"For the past few months, I've slowly devolved into this state where my subconscious is ringing alarm bells at me for help. I've chosen to seek therapy but don't have my insurance cards as of yet. I've come to you guys in hopes of getting some experience from those who go through this too. My personality on most days is a very positive and supportive one. Coworkers joke and poke fun at me because ""they like how I react"", even though I normally don't retort at their dick jokes or when they get physical on the dock. My girlfriend goes through depression and during the winter, it gets really bad. She mentioned the other day that this year has been a huge improvement for her, she hasn't devolved or spiraled down at all and is looking up. She has me supporting her Constantly and helping take care of day to day things when she does get down a little. That leaves me. Nowhere in any of those instances do I ever feel like anyone has my back. I get nervous and self defensive when I try to open up about what's going on with me. I can't at all, at any time, talk about my mental health with my gf, as she puts it, ""I'm trying to stsy positive and not sink into my own depression"". I know she doesn't want that, but I feel like im drowning and here this week, I've started waking up and feeling this inability to want to open my eyes and face the day, or any thing for that matter. It scares me because I normally let things roll off my back, something my father wishes he could do, and I don't think twice about if something upsets me or bothers me. I feel like an emotional vehicle, one people can relax and ride in whilst I listen to them and support them, and afterwards, can't catch a ride when I need to open up.

There is no way my mom can get a job because of this.

I work for an airline as a reservations representative.  Writing that I hate my job is an understatement actually.  I graduated with a fricken arts degree and I'm not sure I posses the vocabulary to describe the rage that boils inside me while I am at work.  

I wouldn't have described myself as an introvert before having this job. Now though, I don't enjoy people at all anymore.  I dream of having a job that would require virtually no direct or verbal contact with anyone else, ever and bonus points if I could work from home.  

I'm not married.  I don't have any kids.  I own a townhome that I could rent out if I decided to move.  I just need out of this sh- job.  People are the worst.  This company is the worst.

170,"I matched with this girl on Bumble (a dating app) at the end of November. We are both in our 20s and have full time day jobs. 

We messaged for a few days and exchanged numbers. After we texted for a day or two, I asked her out for drinks and we met up at a bar. A few days later, I picked her from her place and we grabbed dinner and went ice skating. Everything was good to this point, and we seemed to enjoy each other’s company. 

After our second date, our communication become more sporadic, and I always started the conversation, sometimes two or three days in between. A lot of the time, the conversation would just end without her replying.

We went out on a third date again last week (dinner and drinks), and it was great, she even said we should go to the bar we went to again. We get along well, and I really like this girl. After our date last week, it was the same over the weekend, I didn’t hear from her at all. I texted this evening, got one message from her, but that was it.

I don’t have a grasp for rather or not this girl likes me, or if she’s just in it for free drinks and food? We haven’t done anything besides a quick kiss after our third date. I’ve expressed like I like spending time with her, but we aren’t exclusive or anything like that.

I don’t have a lot of dating experience, and I think I kind of sound like I’m ranting about nothing, but I appreciate any advice!",31Dec2018,1
171,"this is a long one but hear me out :D 18m (skip to ""THAT BEING SAID HERES WHERE MY PROBLEM COMES IN."" for the problem)  


Alright so let me set the scene. As a kid thats grown up and has been pretty neglected by his parents i feel like i grew up pretty inept when it comes to people bossing me around seeing as though they havent been there for most of my life (lived with grandparents). So normally before they just decided to pop back in i had a routine and i had to grow up pretty fast in my early life and i feel like i grew up to be pretty responsible and reasonable.   


But, to be fair when it comes to my parents (having moved back in with them 3 years ago) i become fairly unreasonable and easily irritated when it comes to them. partly because we have clashing personalities and different sets of humor also the fact that i have a huge ego and if i try to understand something and it doesnt make sense to me or its not the way i like to do things then i totally dismiss it.   


THAT BEING SAID HERES WHERE MY PROBLEM COMES IN.  
alright so let me just use this dilemma im in right now as a basis for all the rest of my problems. right now my dad and step mom are teaming up against me and trying to tell me how to raise a dog that we just got back that ive already been raising on my own years prior. 

PROBLEM #1

for instance they both are trying to tell me that i should keep him outside for most of the day (by himself no contact with other living beings). when this shouldnt even matter to them because he just hangs out upstairs all day and hes house trained causing no problems at all.

PROBLEM #2

they say that he should only be fed outside downstairs. what? this also shouldnt matter because they know nothing about feeding a dog. hes to be fed once a day and inbetween a period a 3 hours food should be available to him.

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like they are just trying to come up with random rules and regulations for no reason like they nit pick problems with stuff going on with me and slap a regulation on it because when i ask them to explain their side they just give no other reason than the notorious because i said so remark. even so trying to understand where they come from is a challenge because there is absolutely no logic behind what they say. for instance they have no knowledge about dogs and someone whos done research on how to raise my dog they should listen to me because i know more than they do and their ego is too fragile to accept something like that

&amp;#x200B;

anyways if i can get advice on how to combat this that would be great also comments telling me im just a kid and that i should just listen to my parents are appreciated too but im slightly narcissistic so i might just dismiss them ;p thankyou for reading ",31Dec2018,1
172,"So my husband and I moved from Central Europe to the US, Northern California 2 months ago. I knew it would be a big difference in lifestyle, but BOY I was not prepared. I can't drive, and here you are literally useless without a car. Everything is so far apart. We live next to a freeway and the noise is starting to make me anxious. I really like the nature, but the city/suburb is so grey, there's a lot of homeless people (a fucking sad sight to see, and something we don't have in Europe, at least not that excessively). The supermarkets are so huge, it's giving me a minor anxiety attack just to go shopping, because I feel like I'm constantly overstimulated. I am anxious in case I get sick, because my husband doesn't have a job yet, so we are struggling financially, too. I feel like our relationship is getting strained, because I keep saying that things are so different here and that I miss the convenience of public transport and generally walkable cities like in Europe. I don't want him to feel like I don't appreciate what he is doing. But I don't feel like I fit in here at all. Drinking laws are SO strict, I forgot my ID at a bar the other day and wasn't even able to get a fucking beer, even tho I am 23 years old. There's no real clubbing scene here, and bars close at like 2am (which is when you usually START going out in Europe). I really feel stuck. I can't be inside the entire day, staring at a computer screen. I feel like I'm dissolving my brain cells if I do that. On top of everything, I'm struggling with (social) anxiety. The few times we hung out with his friends were fine, but everyday life is killing me rn. Oh, and I quit my antidepressants, so I'm so struggling with my fair share of depressive/anxious symptoms, that are not helping at all. ",31Dec2018,1
173,"Our mother passed away three years ago, after all the funeral costs we split the left over insurance equally among all 8 of our siblings. My mom left a voice recorded message that said not to allow my sister, Jen, any money until she is financially fit to use it and so I was entrusted to keep the money. 

Right around the time my mom passed away my sister disappeared. We suspect that she got involved in drugs. She stole from her nieces and nephews as well as some money from the church. This caused my dad to lock his doors regularly. She has a history of dating men that use her. She moves away a couples of years and becomes the sole provider. Once she loses her job, she moves back into my parents home and she gets dumped. 

Her recent boyfriend or husband (she has never told us that are legally married but she has told cousins) is fresh out of jail and they recently got pregnant. Because he needed a place to be paroled to, she moved out and is now on cash aid, section eight and medical. Mind you she never paid a single bill while she lived at my dad's. 

She was borrowing my dad's truck and the car got broken in to. She borrowed my sisters car and wrecked that. Then she borrowed my dad's second car and wrecked that too. She got a second job and with some of the life insurance money, we got a small car that runs. Now she is asking for tires because the car we got her apparently has bad tires. 

She already has used the insurance money on moving out, furnishing her new apartment, car insurance, and on the newest car. I say no more. It's the new year and I don't want to start off this way. But she has a new baby coming and she is working two jobs. Without a working car she won't be able to work to support her family. But how is she going to support the baby once she has it. She barely has less than $2000 left and what if the baby needs something in the future and she uses all the funds? Not sure how we can continue subsidize her lifestyle as the money is dwindling and as she can't ever stay afloat.

Needing some advice. ",31Dec2018,1
174,"So for context, I am 23 years old, female, and I have been living with my parents since moving back after graduating last June. I lived away for 4 years and would often visit. When I moved back I wasn't planning on staying here as long as I have. I had only thought about staying for a year but I wasn't ready to go to grad school or move out of this city so I made the choice to continue living here. 

It was really hard on me because I felt like a loser moving back home and my parents did not give me a lot of freedom, I just felt like a child. 

Within this past year though they have let me do more, mostly because I am for the most part financially independent and I work and help them pay the bills sometimes. I have grown though to my disappointment I still feel like I am 16 sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with my dad. He for the greater part of my life has been more of a negative presence, and I don't trust him. Since I was little he has argued with my mom, big arguments where he talks down on her and even at times would talk crap to me about her when he would take me to school (he still does this sometimes) he also cheated on her once and my little sister who was about ten at the time found out by logging onto his Facebook, we confronted him of course and he never really apologized to us. 

Years later he is more calm though he still has his outbursts and I am just less likely to put up with them, because I am not longer willing to accept anyone talking to me like that and so that obviously puts in me a tense position in my house where I refuse to talk to him, I just don't care anymore. I have talked to him multiple times about his attitude and words and he simply does not get it or wants to get it. He is the typical machismo hispanic father so I guess that's why. 

But anyways, I did try to give him a chance because I felt like he had been trying to be a better father but he blew up on my family, my two sisters, mom and I, on a recent family trip, so I just had had enough. So I mentioned to my friend who lives in town who is planning on moving out, that if she moved out I could move out with her too. She was totally down for the idea and we went apartment hunting, so as of now she actually was able to get a lease for an apartment we both liked for a really good price. 

I felt very set on moving out and mentioned it to my mom. She expressed being sad, and said that I would be spending less time with my sisters and how I would regret it, and next thing you know my dad is in my room telling me that I am horrible daughter making a horrible decision and that I know absolutely nothing, and that I should take more time to grow more before doing something like that and just basically telling me that I am incapable and that my friend is manipulating me.

I felt so shitty after this conversation, and let him know that no one deserves to be talked to like that. So I figured my mom would now support me but nope, again she mentioned how I would regret it and said that everyone in the house is just hoping I change my mind. 

I'm miserable. I feel like I am now being dramatic and feel confused whether or not my problems with my parents are really that bad. I do feel sad to be away from my sisters who I love more than anything but what's the point if all of this is making me anxious and depressed to the point where I do not like leaving my room when my dad is around. 

I want to move out and I wish I had their support and confidence in me. Another reason why I am hesitant is because I am applying to graduate schools for next fall and was hoping with that I would move and until then I would save up money but now that this opportunity has come up and with my parents I don't even care ALSO I would be moving in with my friend and her boyfriend. My friend and I have known each other for about nine years now and we have gone through a lot of shit especially with our mental healths and she does suffer from bipolar and BPD, it is something that we have talked about and I have expressed my concerns quite low-key just about boundaries and making sure we don't become codependent. I knew her before she had developed the disorders and yeah of course I have noticed things but she is still internally the same person to me. I have never really been bothered by her relying on me when hard things come up, it's never really been a thing where she has always relied on me or anything, though I have spent time with her and have seen her at some part of her worst and we talk about all that. So I am just trying to be very conscious of the implications of her mental health and there is a part of me that's afraid that there will be moments I will not be able to deal with her, though I realize that can happen within any friendship. 

So I just don't know what to do and I'm tired of everyone and their shit and just wished I could be supported and empowered to make an adult decision and not feel like a child",31Dec2018,1
175,"Okay let me start off by mentioning that I don’t know where I’m going with this, I just wanna get it off my chest and hopefully gain some helpful advice on how to fix it

So I am a 17 year old girl that’s dabbled in dating and the sort, mostly from friendships that turn into relationships. The thing is, I always seem to turn into this sexual and “seductive”(ugh Ik I’m cringing but idk how else to describe it) being and I start being more flirty.

But the thing is right after I do it, I feel disgusted by myself and i feel like it’s not even of me to act that way. I feel like I’m projecting this fake persona .Like just recently, I was on video call with one of my guy friends who has made it clear he finds me attractive and vice verse and it was late at night and I just started speaking in a really deep voice. Do you know that stereotypical sex phone call worker voice? That’s literally what I was trying to emit. However I was still talking like a normal person just in a different voice than I would usually use. I felt pretty okay about it until my mom burst in and was asking in a kind of grumpy tone if I was talking to a boy. And idk man just her saying that made me feel gross and weird :( maybe it’s just my conservative mom that makes me feel weird about acting sexual or maybe in my mind, I just think of myself as a fraud each time I try to act sexy cause I am really not in real life. As stated before, I just really hate this feeling of being ashamed and want to find the cause of it and solve it because i already have enough anxiety in my life ",31Dec2018,1
177,"I had mental issues pretty much since I remember, and they made it hard to make friends (I didn’t make any friends during any school year). Luckily, the friends I made during childhood have stuck around... until now. This friend group consists of real family and voluntary family (friends who are pretty much family to me). These people are the only people I consider friends. We literally have been hanging out since birth.  We did everything together, whenever we could (I literally thought of us to be like the characters in Friends). Unluckily for me, one of the friends did something really crappy to another one of the friends. Ever since then, NOBODY IN THE FRIEND GROUP HANGS OUT OR TALKS ANYMORE. Again, these are the only people I consider as friends, and I have mental issues. I don’t have anybody to talk to, or anybody to hang out with. Luckily I still live with my parents and siblings, so I’m not totally cut off from humans. But that’s about it... the only people I communicate with are my parents. My depression and loneliness has made a comeback at full speed... The other thing is, is that the “crappy thing” that the one friend did, in my opinion, wasn’t enough to break up a whole friend group. They apologized and clearly changed from the experience. Anyway... Im Mr. lonely, I have nobody...

178,"Throwaway, simply because I find this humiliating and something I really would rather not discuss in person.

As the title implies, I have struggled with negative thought loops for longer than I can remember. This came to a head late this summer resulting in poor performance at work, panic attacks, and hopelessness (the usual). Since then I have been doing much better between the counseling sessions to change my behavior and vitamins to elevate my baseline mood. In regards to rerouting negative thought loops, I've mostly been able to do this by recalling evidence which disproves the negative thoughts (ex. if I think to myself ""you fucking idiot"", I will recall times where I wasn't an idiot and also recognize that an idiotic move does not make me a ""fucking idiot""). This is especially important later on. The next paragraph is mostly some background information combined with a bit of ranting, if you want the crux of my question, the last few sentences is where you want to go.

To give a bit more background, self-confidence has never been a term I would label myself with, at least with women. As a kid I didn't have much confidence in any social situation with peers, I've always been able to converse better with adults. Going into middle school and high school, I had made some friends and got along with everyone else, but I would get heckled a bit by friends for not ever really talking to girls. It was nothing mean-spirited or malicious but I didn't have the mental maturity to take it in stride. This took a toll on my self-confidence, which just got lowered even more with every botched interaction I had with girls. Eventually when I was a sophomore in high school I alienated myself from my friends and stopped trying to talk to girls for the most part since I'd just embarrass myself every time, it was much less damaging to just be alone and not make an effort to socialize. As a 3rd year college student, not much has changed except for the fact that I feel more inferior than before as I'm 20 years old and have no experience whatsoever. It also doesn't help when I come across threads where women say they'd be hesitant about dating/hooking up with someone with no experience, which is the boat I'm currently sailing in with no change in trajectory in sight based on past trends. In a sense I feel like the clock is really ticking to the point where any potential parter is going to wonder what's wrong with me that I haven't even dated anyone. I mean for fucks sake, my 13 year old cousin has more ""game"" than me and it makes me want to bury myself in a hole. I cannot blame this on me being ugly as I know I'm not and other people are surprised that I've never had a girlfriend or even been on an actual date.

So the basic premise of this post is that since I found disproving my negative thoughts with cold hard facts and evidence to the contrary is the only way for me to effectively combat the negative thought loops, how the fuck can I do this when I've literally had 0 successes with women ever (dating, hookups, etc. whatever your standards would be for ""success""). If I try to look for evidence to the contrary I don't find any, which just affirms my negative thoughts with actual facts. How can I break this cycle? And please no bullshit answers like ""focus on yourself"", I'm doing pretty damn good in that regard between renting my own place, being pretty fit, eating better than most, drinking only water, no booze, and taking care of a puppy. ""Focusing on myself"" doesn't address this fucking thought loop in my head which I'd choke out and put a bullet through if that was physically possible to harm a thought.",31Dec2018,1
179,"I have tried posting this to multiple subreddits, and I guess I probably just don’t understand how Reddit works because it will probably just get removed again. In the off-chance that I get lucky, here we go:

We’re going on week six now.

I really like my roommate, and we’ve been friends since childhood.

Every day I come home, and he jokes about the fact that he is paid for 40 hrs/week but doesn’t actually work.

His job is with a Fortune 100 company, and he makes more money than I do.

He doesn’t have a degree, nor does he have any sort of special training.

I’m starting to get a little salty because I will come home from a hard day of work (manager of a warehouse for a startup) and it’s the same every day... roomie is still in his PJs and he wants to talk about how “funny” it is that he doesn’t actually work.

He is a really good guy, and I like him a lot- but I think in the past 6 weeks, he has been “in the office” for about 4 hours.

Some days I check online during breaks, and I see that he is playing World of Warcraft. (I will sometimes check at 10AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM.. each time I check he is online playing video games).

I guess, bottom line, my question is: is this actually common?  Do people frequently find their way into jobs where they get to hang out in PJs and play video games for months at a time? It makes me feel foolish for working so hard at my job, when maybe I don’t need to?

tl;dr Roommate hasn’t been to work in over a month, and laughs about the fact that they pay him but that he doesn’t actually do anything. I work really hard every (week)day, but I’m starting to feel like a chump for doing so... Am I doing something wrong?? How do I get a job where I don’t have to do anything?

He said he was trying to get a job and then he would get it to me. I shrugged it off. I checked in 2 weeks later, and it was pretty much the same thing. This goes on for a little bit. He started posting pictures of a new car he got. Now i know he has the money. So i ask him again. He tells me he never got the car i sold him running and basically that he didnt want to give me the money. I told him i would accept less than what is due.

He found out about a crush I had on a different guy and kept asking if I still like him. He even spoke to another guy he found out I was kinda into (they were friends) and told him to stop talking to me - he even admitted to it. I know his friends share my selfies in their group chat too (long story) and one time he and his best friend, and the rest of his friend group were all looking at a photo of me on the best friends  phone and they were saying stuff (long story as to how I know that too).

186,"Hi there subreddit. 


I’m having issues at the moment with my sister.
Just a bit of background on her she is nearly in her mid 30’s, and is on and off employment since around 2012 (when she had cancer). She used this as a crutch for a while after getting the thumbs up from the doctors but recently she’s kind of admitted that she likes her spare time. When she does work she works barely 3 shifts a week, and the shifts are 6 hours. 

My issue and the advice I need on this is that she is borderline abusive and completely disrespectful. Since her remission in 2012 she had been living with me, my father and grandmother. She does not clean up after herself. When she uses the bathroom the basin is stained with makeup, hair everywhere and toothpaste stains on the mirror that she doesn’t cleanup. Her room I’m not worried about because it is not a communal part of the house. But she uses the lounge room frequently, and the glass table is filled with stains from food (such as oil, crumbs etc). She never cleans the lounge room even though she’s the only one that uses it regularly. 

She will usually barge into my room when I’m relaxing or chilling or and expect me to have a bounce in my foot. I really just wanna relax especially after a hard day and when I don’t give her the response she wants she gets pissy with me and leaves. She yells at me from across the house constantly and expects me to yell back and I don’t wanna do that. It’s just rude to other people in the house who want some peace and quiet. Since she’s been living with us it’s been non stop of this behaviour. She will occasionally get in an argument with me over me being ‘sensitive’ to something she says, which 100% warrants a reaction (such as a homophobic slur). She will also get in arguments with my grandmother over her washing. Sometimes her clothes become stained with bleach and my sister will LOSE IT at her, calling her a witch, black hearted and cusses at her. I will wake up to her obnoxious noises in the morning and it’s infuriating.

I’m also really close with every manager, (most are early 20s or around my age) and I’d like to say Im a hard worker.

A few months ago, I talked to my boss about wanting to do more and become a manager to help. He’s a real hard ass, and not very likable, and This was my first time ever doing anything like this, so I was a little nervous and he definitely noticed. He said he never thought I’d ask that cuz he thought i haven’t been working hard lately, which absolutely shocked me. I politely told him I’d do better, and he said he’d work with me to help me get more responsibilities. This happened like once or twice, and when it did, I worked my tail off and did my very best work, but ever since I’ve gotten nothing from him.

A few weeks later, I got a position in the restaurant, (which is usually the next step to being promoted)  along with another girl. Now I’m no saint, I am late every once in a while, and I have my bad days, but this girl is late almost every day, sometimes 30 min to an hour, slacks off a lot, especially when no ones around, and even jokes about how she’s shocked she hasn’t been fired yet. 

Well this girl talked a lot to guy managers who often favored her and helped her get away with stuff, and apparently had been helping make her look really good to our boss. Just last week she got promoted to manager since the guy managers told our boss to choose her. My boss didn’t even talk to me or for all I know even consider me for this position despite me talking to him a while ago and working very hard.

I want to talk to my boss about all of this, but I don’t know what to say. I still really want to be a manager, its perfect money wise, location wise, and I have a ton of friends there, and I don’t want to find another job, but the pay isn’t the best without manager wages, and it feels impossible to be promoted at this rate.

What should I say? I work Tuesday and I plan on saying something then, and I was hoping for some advice.

190,"As in, if you really enjoyed something but began to associate it with someone who hurt or harmed you, is there a way to reclaim it and enjoy it again like you did before associating it with that person? 
For example: You are a long time fan of a football team but have unwillingly begun to associate that team with an abusive ex and the negative ways in which they made you feel due to them also being a huge fan and much of your relationship involving your mutual interest in the team.  The negative association is so strong that you can’t see the football team’s logo without immediately associating it with the negative feelings caused by the ex’s abuse. However, you want more than anything to enjoy it again as it was yours to enjoy before meeting that ex.

192,"I don’t know how to explain most of this, but I lost my only friend a while ago and he just recently started ghosting me. 

He was my ex as of probably around 4 years ago now and we were friends until a few months back. We were both in dark places for most of those years. 

He was my only friend, we’d sneak out and smoke and talk for hours every now and then. Used to text every night too, it was nice. He got a gf and I spaced myself a little out of respect, but she was still very upset about our relationship. 

It was not a good relationship for him, he wasn’t happy, but I respected her as much as I could. 

I ended up not texting him for a month or so after she got really upset and thought we had sex because of his phones location at my house. 

He didn’t seem to care about the radio silence, but ended up texting me one night and we started talking again because they had broken up. He seemed so much happier and we smoked again pretty soon after, but they got back together. 

Haven’t talked to him since then really, I messaged him asking if he wanted to hang out soon and he said yeah. 

That was a month ago.

I’ve been fighting myself on whether or not I should message him asking if we’re not going to talk anymore. I know we probably won’t, but some reason I want closure? He was my only friend and I confided in him a lot. I’m worried that me asking would sound like I’m baiting/guilt tripping him into talking to me again, but really I just want a yes or no.

193,"I've been hanging out with my friend for like 3 or 4 months consecutively (known for 6), playing video games daily with him on the mic. He has said he always likes my company (im shy and quiet and kinda reserved so yeah). He's told me things i've done were cute (in the games), he's given me a few game items that cost real money.. and he also has wanted to meet me in real life...

and i've been wondering for a while what that means? Like am I that good of a friend for him to want to meet me? (He lives in another country from me). I found it kind of insane at the time but thought it would be cool and the first time i've ever done something like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is.. how can I know his intentions? Like he never asked what i looked like for like the first few months and was just a good friend? (He's seen what i look like now though) But then, maybe in the last month or two, he's said like ""I love you (my username online)"", or  ""love you, bye"" (in a funny way). It's only happened maybe 4-5x, but I thought that like made it certain he did like me. Also, he's said before that he missed me when i'd be gone for a few hours. Past that, he's called me buddy (jokingly)... also, he always say goodnight to me when we go off at night. ..but the part that gets confusing... the odd time he'll be talking to his friends and say, yeah she's hot (about another girl), or whatever.. so, yeah. One last thing, he recently went on vacation and said next time i should go with him 0\_0 Even though he hasn't met me, he'd be willing to go on a vacation with me for like 2 weeks 0\_\_\_0

&amp;#x200B;

Is he probably just a player? Or just open about talking about other girls being attractive? Or he just see's me as a friend?

194,"So basically I’ve been psychoanalyzing myself for years and came to the conclusion that I’m extremely insecure. I swear this shit dates back to late middle school. Like I currently am in a online relationship with 4 different girls. Something about having a screen allows me to have massive “game” which makes sense but still kinda weird. I think I do it because it offers a little bit of anonymity like even though they know what I look like and about me they will unlikely ever have the ability to confront me. 

Like every time I’d get sent a nude or when they would stroke my ego I’d this high. This feeling of worth that lasts literally half of a second. I constantly want it. I notice myself going into malls and literally looking for the hottest girls to see if they are looking at me. Not even because I’m going to approach them or I want to get to know them. Just so ik I can create an attraction towards me. 

It’s serious though because doing this can get extremely taxing. Like looking through mobs of people for those select few whom I want to eye fuck me gives me massive migraines. It’s created many issues where my mind can’t focus with too many people. I don’t do this in small situations but the second I’m bored and at a large event I catch myself doing it. 

Anyways back to my “gfs” whom I’m slowly trying to get rid of btw. Like so far I’ve gotten rid of one and we are gonna stay friends and she took it very well. This one I’ve actually met up with irl and done stuff with. One plans on meeting me during spring break so we’ll see and the others live way too far away. Idk what to say but I live a life where I can’t really have real local relationships. This is due to my strict parents, and mouthy friends. Idk why I put myself into positions where I lead girls on for my own fucking self esteem issues but it’s fucked up and I know. This is why I created this post so I could get other ppls thoughts. Like should I see a therapist even though I have in the past? I’m also on anti depressants due to my genetic depression.

196,"Hi reddit. 

I’m a college student that lives away from home. I struggle with general anxiety and PTSD, and had a pretty bad summer that impacted my mental health badly. I had my fall semester quickly after some things happened and had to get my “act” together, and slowly I made a lot of progress and I’m proud of that. I gave myself a lot of care and time which was good, but I feel that I wasn’t as strong as I could have been and perhaps painted myself too much as a victim which hindered my mental health in some areas. It also hurt my grades and took a toll on my romantic partner (who was very understanding through it all.)

Now that I feel a LOT better (therapy, journaling, better diet, exercise, sleep) I thought I could enter 2019 with better footing. However, while visiting family, I’ve had a rough time feeling emotionally abused all over again by some members (but some are amazing.) My mother however has been off her medication and has been extremely disrespectful and abusive, and even brought up my anxiety in front of the family and belittled me because of it. That was the last straw, and I’m considering going No Contact once I’m back. Then a few days after, I found out my cousin (who I am close to like a little brother, extremely love him and want to protect him with all my heart) attempted suicide. That broke my heart. I don’t know how to describe or process that actually. 

But the best thing I can do is be strong for him. Be strong for my family and not create anymore drama already by cutting off my mom. I’m trying to be respectful to my Mom too and just say its for the best and I think she agrees. But this is taking a toll on me, but I don’t want to feel like a victim next quarter. All my friends (who are amazing) notice and worry and I feel awful, because I’ve always strived to be the reliable cheerful person. That’s always been me, too. 

Even my writing may sound pitiful but I don’t want it to be that way. Any advice is appreciated, thank-you. ",31Dec2018,1

Her parents have an issue with me. They don't like me at all and they forbid her and I to ever be together but we are still together through school and that we are over 18. I have been over her house multiple times, because her parents thought we were just friends and have been having secret relationship. I love her a lot and she loves me.

So around 6 months into the relationship, her ring went missing and her mother's rings went missing. Now her and her whole family are blaming me for stealing them. I promise I never stole anything in my whole life. I don't know what to do. Her mother told her that I stole them and now she doesn't trust me. We are still together but she keeps bringing it up and she keeps saying I am a liar. She tells me there is evidence that I stole, but when I ask what evidence, she tells me that I am the only one with the opportunity to steal them. She always tells me there are roof workers, gardeners, and other construction workers walking around the house. Also, every day she tells me that there are random people over her house every single day because her mother invites multiple people over every day. She tells me her mother is watching whoever is over so she thinks it could never be them. There is no other evidence that I would have done it. Nothing at all. I told her that it might have been one of those people but she disagrees. I told her what can I do to prove to her that I never took them and she says to figure it out. I don't know what to do to help her find them or anything. Her parents hate me and I am not allowed to speak to her anymore and her parents do not want to see me.

199,"Will try to keep this short.  I'm 27F, in a conservative islamic ruled country where single women AND men aren't allowed to live alone. We are expected to live in with  our parents until we get married. Marriage certificate is bascially the green card  for renting an apartment... Of course there are some loopholes.

My parents had a nasty divorce which resulted in selling our only home. My relationship with mother is non-existent and my father lives with his wife somewhere very far away which makes my commute to work impossible, hence he helped me find an apartment in a very secure building and put the lease under his name.  (loophole) so I live there by myself. Building management is aware of the situation and is OK with it. Its a family building anyway and I am practically living in my ""dad's"" apartment (which I'm paying for) 

My boyfriend of 1.5 years comes over very often, as well as my other friends. However, my boyfriend is my most frequent guest. So frequent the building management picked up on it of course and politely tried to ask me if I wanted to put him on the contract (because he almost lives with me) I responded with ""No"" and ended it there. This caused some friction between me and my boyfriend because I've been super down and embarrassed and scared for the situation I am currently in. Obviously, I dont want my father to find out. Its not going to result in an honor killing but the last thing I want is for him to be disappointed in me. Although I dont believe I am doing anything wrong. But this is the culture I am in. 

Our relationship is very serious and we even spoke of marriage. Of course, neither do I or does he want this situation to be the reason we get pushed into marriage but we had to revisit the conversation after this happened. He made a commitment to tie the knot hopefully by my next contract (Aug/Sept). I'm really excited to spend the rest of my life with this man. I love him to bits. Although I wish it would be sooner, I am so certain this is who I want to be with, I don't want to pressure him into anything. 

Anyhow, building management contacted me again last night to stress on adding my boyfriend to the contract. I tried to keep my composure and play it off with ""I have many guests coming in, I dont get why hes a problem"" but it was so embarrasingly obvious I didnt want to insult the building managements intelligence and just ended up telling the truth and mentioned that there is a plan to put him on the contract just not now. but in the next 6-8 months. The guy seemed understanding but then again he is only doing his job. He said he will give it a think and let me know what we can do. 

I am just worried they will tell me dont let him come over unless hes with a group of friends - have him over less - NEVER have him over - or worse, get kicked out of the building which is my only home. I worked so hard to bring myself up from my family drama mess. I dont want to lose the apartment, but I also dont need building management to tell me how to live my life, I love having my boyfriend over. I enjoy our private time together. and while I respect that I am living in a family building, its not like I am making any noise disturbing any of my neighbors. Nor am I causing any problems. 

What can I do? Any solutions I can suggest to management too? I am so stressed over this. 

TL;DR: could lose my apartment if i dont comply to building management rules. not sure how to navigate the situation with management. worried I shot myself in the foot by being honest. also dont want to compromise the quality of my relationship. Any advice? ",31Dec2018,1

201,"Hello, let me introduce myself because I consider it rude to ask for help without giving details of who I am even. My name is Tomás, I am 18 years old and I turn to this forum as an almost drastic measure. The story I'm going to tell you is going to be long and has certain nuances, so I understand if you cannot read it in detail, but I feel too helpless not to try. So, without further ado, here I go with the question.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out that on November 9, a girl with whom I had not spoken for 5 years, reappeared in my life. The circumstances by which we cut ties are complex, but it turns out that I wound up very hurt that time, largely because of her actions. However people change, a lot of time had passed since then and I believe that all people deserve a second chance. Also, I thought it possible to recover a lost friendship, help her in her dilemmas or take our link to something more intimate and that's why I decided to be there for her, listen to her, read her, accompany her and share certain moments. However, the situation became more complex as of November 23.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out that she had planned to leave the city where we live to pursue a university career (Medicine). And because the change was great (and because of her personality), she required someone to accompany her, to contain and help her during that transition. She had (has) a person in that city, but it turns out that the guy is not who she expected at first: based on what I have seen and what she has told me, this individual is violent, manipulative, extortionist, liar, controlling and victimist, among so many other toxic behaviors. And all that details, evidently, generated doubts in her when making a decision and that is why I am here

&amp;#x200B;

For obvious reasons she asked me for help, something that I was more than willing to give. Obviously, my recommendation was that she should take stock of the situation and should be concerned about her physical and mental integrity. The decision ultimately is hers and no one can take away that freedom. After that, it seemed that everything was on track, that perhaps she wasn't going to change city to study, that she was going to cut ties with the guy in question and that she was also going to try to progress in her relationship with me (because given several circumstances we confessed our feelings and everything went well). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, she ended up ""deciding"" to leave the city (and say deciding very loosely because she never says something absolutely concrete), but the same problem turns out to be recurrent: the other guy and she argue and fight; He insults her, despises her and threatens her, and then returns ""repented"" days later. She forgives him and the cycle begins again. And the reason she forgives him is because she thinks she needs it as a support in that new city, when it's not like that. Nobody has to depend on anyone, even less if that person turns out to be so harmful to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then things have gone for the worse: she didn't want to start a romantic relationship with me (I understand that because I am satisfied with a friendship) and our covnersations have become colder and more distant. The worst, however, is that she is willing to suffer at the mercy of the other guy involved if that means being able to have someone to help her in the new city. She is willing to lie to her family about her safety, to give love (and even her body, sexually speaking) to a guy who does not value her and to distance herself from people who appreciate her for a false idea of ​​""need"". 

&amp;#x200B;

And the subject still has other nuances because, despite having established our relationship as a friendship, she continues to hint at ulterior motives, has kissed me and constantly flirts with me. And it's a situation that I do not know if I can stand. More than anything because I want her to be happy and feel good about herself, her life, her studies and her ties. But every day that happens, that idea seems more distant. The solution seems to be easy, because right now she doesn't live in the same city as the abuser and the career she wants to study is also here, but she doesn't seem to attend to those reasons. And I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave her in such a situation because she means a lot to me and leaving her to her fate would make me feel incredibly guilty, but on the other hand I feel very helpless when I cannot do anything to change the situation. What should I do? How can I help her? 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: when I talk about her lying to her family I mean that yesterday the boy involved had a brief talk with her father and the girl's grandmother. It turns out that previously he had told my friend that he did not love her and that he only used her for ""sex and love"". She talked about that with her grandmother who told her to stop communicating with him (with some insults involved). 

&amp;#x200B;

However (and despite that) with this talk, the old lady seems to have changed her mind and now she likes him very much. That is to say, both her father and her grandmother believe that this guy is the best thing that can happen to my friend in this situation. And it's not like that at all.

202,"Last year i started as a freshman law student at Harvard University. i got back to my hometown San Diego for christmass. On my last day at home, i decided to leave sooner and instead i chose to pay a visit to Los Angeles which is close to our town. I always believed that it's a wonderful city and i was right. I had a wonderful time there. Right on that day. It was evening and i was hanging around in beautiful boulevard of Hollywood and i was ready for heading to the Airport to take a flight to Massachusetts. I was standing near a luxury restaurant and suddenly a girl whose face was familiar to me has got out of the restaurant's door and a man was with her. They seemed happy. I made eye contacts with them for a few seconds and then the guy said ""do you need help with something sir?"" And i said ""Not really. I go take a taxi and go somewhere"" then that girl said ""Yeah he does need help"" and then they laughed and told me that they would bring me to the destination. Yeah it was actually Miley Cyrus. I behaved normally as a educated man and tried to politely refuse the offer but they urged me. So i got inside their car which was a black Bentley and the guy was driving with Miley sitting on front passenger seat. She told him ""First bring him to the Airport he says"" and then the car started moving and they kept asking questions. Miley asked me what do i do and where do i live. I said that i am from San Diego and i got accepted at law school of Harvard University and she admired me with a surprisingly happy mood and said that i should keep studying and become a government official. And then jokingly said ""better than some who are in charge right now!"" Then she kept asking about the university and i said ""The prices can be high sometimes. The price of having a good life is high and being at one of the top universities of the world is a part of having a good life."" Then she she kept confirming my statements and looked at me with a smile on her face and said that i talk like a gentleman and like someone who already has a Ph.D. She also said that i look good in that suit. After a while she told the driver to stop near a phone store and they got off the car and told me they will be back in a minute. After a while she got back with a box in her hand and then she handed it to me. It was an Ipad. She said that this is my gift for ""being a good boy"" and i said that she is doing way too much of a favor for me and i didn't except me. She said that's nothing and she would do much for me later. She said ""promise me that you will be a good and highly paid lawyer in a few years. I want to see you as governor of California in the furure!"" i was enjoying the situation to the level that i said ""the same way i made it to the top university, i'll make it to the top of country as well!"" then the driver said ""top of the world too yeah!?"" then we all laughed. Then she said ""You should get a classy car for yourself soon. Or i could get one for you... Just count on me. If you ever needed any kind of support with anything you know... money, friendly advice ot anything just tell me. I am at your back. So is my family. You are always welcome to our home."" I appreciated her kindness a lot and then she got my number and ringed my phone and said i can call her whenever i want. They brought me to the Airport gate and i got off the car. We said goodbye and gave hands and i stared at the car fading away in night. Later she made a phone call with me too.

That incident in that day was so unique and unexpected that it's still hard for me to believe. But it happened and what i have never told her is my real feelings for her. I don't know the way she treated me was more like a sister or girlfriend. I have so much respect for her and i want to turn my promise to her into reality.

213,"In july my 2 friends (both female) and I went to a music festival. During the festival one of them had a huge falling out with her boyfriend and they ""broke up"". He was insulting her quite alot and it made me real mad, so I wanted to help her.

 We talked about it and I slowly fell in love. In august and semptember we talked and there were some moments which looked like something could happen betweem us, but I didn't want to do anything because I knew they just broke up and wanted to give her some time. I got really drunk once and wrote to her how I feel about her. It was over the phone and she said she wasn't ready for anything new. She then went on a holiday with her father and got back together with that guy. Fast forward, I went to college which is oustide the city I live in. I don't know why but we just stopped talking. We still are friends and go out almost every weekend but it feels diffrent. 

Two weeks ago I again told her how I feel and she told me that she waited for me to do something, but since I'm clearly stupid I missed my chance. Few days ago we were out at a party and she said to a friend of mine (I introduced them), that he is her best friend. It fucking broke me, I don't know why but it did. 

It hurts so much because I love her and there is no way anything will happen. 

I can't forget her so easily and I know I don't have any chances. And this is driving me crazy. 

Also I'm 20 y/o and around 1.9m tall, but all I can think of is either to cry or to just drink, which somewhat helps. Any advice would be helpful.",31Dec2018,1
214,"Okay. I’m 19 and I'm a fulltime college student. I recently got a job at this big bagel place right next to a huge university. I've been working there for about a month. When I first got hired the manager gave me all these promises of consistent scheduling and how it was an easy job and whatever. On my first day the trainer didn't even know I was going to show up, on my first week, every employee was quick to tell me how much they hated working there and how much the manager sucked because she treated her employees like shit. I should have listened and quit then and there. Now a month later, two people have quit since I was hired and we are super short staffed, yet I have only gotten around 15hrs a week max these past two weeks because all the university students are on break and 80% of our business comes from them. They come back next week and when I tell you this place gets busy I mean it. There's line out the door and some people wait up to 20 minutes for a single bagel sometimes. I'm still new but the manager has left me to handle the front alone at times, so not only do I take orders but I make the food and drinks as well if no one else is there or if the manager or shift lead need to go on a delivery because they also don’t have a delivery driver snfjsdnfkls. When it gets busy and I’m left alone to handle the front, my anxiety peaks. The manager has sent me in 20F weather to walk 20 minutes to make a delivery even though that's not part of my job and got mad at me for taking too long when I had never made a delivery before. The schedule has also not been consistent or put up on time once since I’ve been there so most of the time I don’t know if I work the next day until the night before. The manger is going on a two week vacation so we will be short three people and the college students come back next week.  I already know this is gonna be a disaster if only two people are working at the same time with literal lines going out the door.  It’s up to the point where I don't even want to return I would love to quit on the spot I would feed bad but I also shouldn’t be responsible for picking up the manager’s slack. She’s not even actively looking to hire more people even though we really need it. I normally don't quit unless I have found something new but the manager really treats her employees like shit. And I have money saved up so that's not the issue, but my next paycheck is literally only going to be about $100 because they have cut my hours by a lot. And because they aren't hiring anyone atm, once I return to college I already know they’re gonna demand me to work more. I’m itching to just text the manager and tell her I’m not coming back, but my mom and my friends tell me to wait, and also without me they’ll be even more short staffed but I cannot continue to handle taking and making orders alone or with just one other person once it gets really busy. Idk, should I stick it out or quit asap?",31Dec2018,1
215,"So I'm 25 and recovering from a sex addiction. The issue is, EVERYONE either wants or talks about sex. 

I'm supposed to instill in my mind that sex isnt everything but in songs they talk about it as the best thing, I just had two different women offer for me to come over at night in the same day!, My best friend is always talking about how good sex is. 

If I'm not having sex, I don't feel like a man or worth anything. This is sick and I need help. I've even tried finding sex addiction places and they're all just a bunch of creepy guys who hardly ever answer the phone. 

God I need help. ",31Dec2018,1
216,"Recently I have noticed a few people in my like not only exaggerate, but actually fabricate, when they tell stories or make claims. Often the fabrication is embedded in otherwise true stories, so I don’t think most people realize they are fabricating. I also don’t think they realize they are lying, but they just don’t question their own interpretation of reality.

Often I try to ignore this, but it’s difficult when their fabrication involves inaccurate descriptions of me or people I care about. It occasionally gets to the level of slander or libel.

Anyways, how should I handle this? How should I approach them in a way that won’t come off like I’m calling them massive liars?

217,"So i’m a 16 year old boy and have never had the best luck with girls. i have a pretty quiet/reserved personality and just haven’t put my self out there. I downloaded a teen friend finding app just to see if i could meet and make more friends. eventually i met this 13 year old girl who lived in the same city as me and we texted for a while and got along really well. We both agreed it would be a good idea to meet up and just “hang out”. We end up meeting up and it starts pretty casually we’re just talking and she brings up wanting to practice kissing and i agree (stupidly) and things get escalated pretty fast. she’s grinding on me as we’re kissing and eventually led to fingering. It stopped there and we didn’t go any further then that. After all of that we hang out for a couple more hours and i go home. we only hung out once after that doing the same stuff. never since then though and i’m not again. 

I feel really guilty because what i committed is indecent contact with a child. the couple of days the whole thing happened i didn’t think about what i was actually doing and she was under the age of consent in my state which is 16. I still like to keep in touch with her because i genuinely care about her. I’m not really worried about her reporting it or anything like that because she likes and cares about me and wouldn’t want me to go through anything like that. This stress and guilt just classifying myself as a “rapist” just hurts my heart because that’s not someone i want to be and wouldn’t want to disappoint or hurt anyone in my life. I feel like it’s going to affect my future relationships because admitting to something like that really makes you look like a shitty person and i don’t know if i could hold back such a thing like that (just not mentioning it) especially  if they’re curious about past sexual experiences.

it was seriously the dumbest mistake i’ve made in my life and it truly isn’t who i am and it’s just constantly on my mind.  I’m really trying to just build myself up from it as almost a lesson of don’t make stupid fucking decisions and do dumb shit like this.  I don’t know how to think of the whole thing and weather just to keep it to myself and keep it as a personal lesson because it seriously puts such a bad mark on my name and who i am. ",31Dec2018,1

Yes, I'm an attractive guy, sure I work out so i have a nice body and sure god had blessed me with a nice member.

227,"Wasn’t sure where to post this. Basically I got behind in school last year and was very depressed and anxious and couldn’t go to school anymore so I dropped out. She really didn’t care at all. In the summer I guess she realized that I was going to be turning 18 soon and they would cut off the social security checks unless I was still in school. I was planning on getting my ged and the only reason I kind of wanted to go to public school still was so I could make some friends. Well she convinced me to go back solely for the purpose of getting her ss. Public school didn’t work out so I went to homeschool and progressed rapidly. She has been constantly reminding me not to finish too fast so she can still get her money. There have been many arguments because I feel like she cares more about the money than me. I wanted to graduate early so I can work full time and save up to move out ASAP. My whole family also tells me things like that I’m being selfish because I want to graduate early.
I secretly finished school last week but there are outstanding payments on my school so I guess it doesn’t count me as graduated. My mom wants me to go to the social security office with her tomorrow because she didn’t get the last ss payment. I still haven’t told her I’m graduated which may mean she will not get the money and I will be screamed at by her and my whole family. 
I’m not even sure what question I’m asking anymore. Just please someone tell me I’m not entirely in the wrong. I have so much anxiety about this and I feel like this is really fucked up of my mother to do this to me. ",31Dec2018,1

229,"So, earlier this evening I was browsing google images while i was spanking the monkey, for lack of a better term,  under “Real Teen Nudes.” I can see how searching such a term would lead to this discovery but, most people know (including google) the word “teen” in this situation implies eighteen and nineteen. However, one image in particular i saw, the “teen” seemed far to young. I took a screenshot so after my... session, i could go back to the website and investigate further. Indeed I found many pictures of little girls “modelling” ranging from ages 10-15 y/o if i had to guess. The people who post them use disturbing captions with words like “little girl” and “virgin.” I held back tears seeing how young some of them were; in the positions they were in. They also use the term “jailbait” which i researched and found is very controversial. I would like to know what i can do to get rid of it. Anything helps, Thanks!

230,"my parents are the typical asian parents. they want me to do good in school, go to a good college, become a dentist, all that stuff. I'm not the brightest person when it comes to school tho, I get max 2 B's a semester and it really upsets my parents. so their only way of dealing with this is cutting out my entire social life. my mom told me today that all I need in life is 1 guy friend and you'll be happy. I'm not even allowed to hang out with girls anymore, since she says all they do is ""distract you from your success"". this is terrible since I already have a girlfriend and I haven't told them about her. and my mom is EXTREMELY protective. she always needs to know where I am, what time I'm coming home, the phone numbers of everyone I'm hanging out with, I've even overheard her tell my dad that she wants to find a way to put a camera on my bag or shirt so she can see and hear everything I'm doing. so most of the time I just say I'm hanging out with a group of guys friends (even though I'm hanging out with my gf and her friends) and that still gets her upset. I feel like this is a huge invasion of privacy and I deserve to be left alone.

idk how my gf feels about this since I won't be able to see her as much and i know she deserves so much more. I love her to the end of this Earth and I would hate for our relationship to end over stupid shit like this.

and it's not like my parents are the only ones screwing me over, it's my siblings too. they shove all the chores to me and they do no work at all. and when I tell my parents that it's not fair they always respond with ""stop complaining and do your work."" all they do is annoy me and bother me all the time. they hit me and bully me and my parents dont give a fuck. nobody in my family even cares about the shit I'm going through. I'm sorry to say that I don't love anyone in my family and I dislike even being around them. that's why I'm trying to get out of the house more often but now I can't even do that. I'm just so done with all this family  shit and I wish I would just get disowned already. but since i can't leave the house, I'm forced to deal with this situation. should I tell my parents about my relationship? what could I say to them so I could hang out with my friends again? im still young and I'll I want is my life back.

231,"A month or so back my aunty Was kicked out of her apartment because her boyfriend at the time left her and her child (from another man) so she went to go live at my divorced stoner mother (I live with my grandparents cause im only 15 and my mom is in a bit of a bind (I'll tell on a later date)) she only ever smoked pot for obviously fake reasons and everyone eventualy learned to deal with it.

So my aunty went to live with my mother in her house for a couple of months for her to get out is school and find a job, so first night shes living there. My mom has a party (dident even know she partied, shes 40. In other words TOO OLD FOR THAT) 

So my aunt got up at 2 am to tell her to wrap it up and to see where her daughter was (she left for the bathroom) and walks in on my mom getting MY LITTLE COUSIN TO HELP HER SECTION OUT DOSES OF COCAINE, so my aunty took my cousin packed her stuff and left the house, and called the police.

232,"I am a 38 yo F and I started talking to a dude on Instagram (48). I live in LA and he lives in Vancouver. We met up a few times in the summer, once in SF, once in Vancouver, and twice in LA. He kept saying how he wanted to move down to LA, posted pics of my place on his Instagram like “my maybe soon to be new digs” etc. 

But he was *awful*. I learned that we are absolutely not compatible. He hated my dogs, would swat and kick at them. Wouldn’t let them sleep in the bedroom because it would affect his virility (note: it wasn’t the dogs). He made me pay for everything all the time. He was rude to people who worked in service industries. He pouted when I had to work. He had horrible anger issues and would scream and hit things if any little thing happened (like, his earbud fell out or he tripped or one of my dogs tried to greet him). Total nut job. 

I called him an Uber on his last day of his vacation and gave him a hug, and waited until he got home to break things off because he was so unstable. 

I tried to do it gently... we just aren’t compatible, it just isn’t working for me, etc. But he flew off the deep end. What followed was hundreds of text messages, phone calls, videos of himself talking, emails with screenshots of the text messages, for MONTHS. He started a twitter account all dedicated to his rage against me where he called me a booger (yup, a booger lol), said the best revenge was watching me put on the pounds knowing how sensitive I am about it (also knowing i’m in recovery for an eating disorder), said that my childhood abuse made me abuse him, that I deserve to die in a fire, on and on and on. He threatened suicide twice. Then he deleted all the mean tweets and said he just wanted to start over, that he is in love with me. We saw each other 3 times over 3 months, he’s been abusing me for 4. 

He became aware that I am seeing someone else, so he has started messaging him, as well as my best friend too. 

I talked to him once in the middle of all this and he backed down, said sorry, said he’d delete the mean things and said he’d like to be friends one day. But it all started again a few days later. 

Okay 5 months down the road, no change. 

I tried to get his twitter account suspended, I blocked his number and all of his social accounts... wtf do I have to do to get rid of this nightmare!?!?

Sorry, /rant. Help. ",31Dec2018,1

250,"hey, so this is gonna be mixed and messy, i have a lot on my mind and i really don’t know where to start. 


i have this half brother me and everyone in my house absolutely hates, i’ve always hated him, for obvious reasons like he’s my step dads favourite, he never gets in trouble, and the things he says to my mum, but stepbrother is practically allowed to do whatever he wants. 
i guess today he was smack talking my mum and it made me so mad, angry, like as if i was about to actually beat him up... but i didn’t do anything or say anything. i felt extremely guilty... 
i’m 17 and it makes me cry to see my mum get treated like this, but the way i was raised was to always be nice to everyone, “you’re the oldest so act like a man” well apparently acting like a man means to not show any feelings. but i just feel nothing but extreme guilt, pain, and hate for myself. i always was told to be the better person just because i’m the oldest one, help your younger siblings, but what no one seems to know what it’s like being the oldest, no one knows how much i actually care about them, i always have to deal with all my problems alone, i never have anyone to talk to besides my mum but i don’t want to look weak and disappoint her even bough i know she won’t think less of me, 

but i guess the bottom line is that i don’t know what to do. i’m just soaking in tears wishing that i stood up for my mum, she’s the most important person in my life and seeing her being talked to like that completely breaks me.

255,"My girlfriend (23f) and I(23m) have been having some problems. Basically, I showed her the ugliest sides of me that I didn’t know were there. Being angry, being semi-controlling and treating her differently because of my insecurities. Since then, I’ve been reading relationship books, self growth articles, listening to podcasts and trying to get to the root of the issue. Which turns out, is my emotional dependence and need for validation. This is something I’m changing. I didn’t even realize i was like this. Regardless of whether or not we workout. I’ve always been a “self improvement” kind of person. I always did this at work and with my family. I just didn’t know I had a lot to fix from a relationship aspect because it’s been 5 years since my last one. I want us to work but I know she feels like I may be telling her what she wants to hear. Because I’m committed to change, I feel like that’s more of a reason to be together. She made me realize that I was mistreating her and I’m more than willing to change my wrong ways for the sake of her happiness AND mine. I don’t like how I acted and treated her. And now I’m trying to fix things. I just don’t think she thinks I’m worth the risk. And that’s alright I guess. It hurts my feelings but I know I am worth the risk. I know she’s worth it. I know I’m not every other “bro” that says they’ll change and doesn’t. I just wish she could see that. She may never see that, or it could take time for her to see that. And I feel like shit because of it. Things should’ve never gone this far. She feels as thought she’ll lose herself in trying with me and she does not know if it’s worth it because she had to pick up the pieces after her last relationship. I feel awful that I’ve influenced our relationship in this negative way. I miss my best friend and partner.

I am the manager of a homeless hostel. I have a team of 5. 

What the team do not know is that I have a constant terror of being assaulted by clients. I dream about it, it is all I think about on the Sunday evening before returning to work. I imagine being stabbed or having acid thrown at me. 

I have worked in this field for 9 years, and for most of this time I got by fine. I did incredibly risky things such as going into the middle of parks in the middle of the night to find drunk, potentially dangerous individuals. I had NO fear about this whatsoever. For 3 years I was running the hostel by myself, seeing and working with dangerous people. I have been in only one situation in that time when I was assaulted, and it was because I wound up the person who assaulted me. 

In that time I dreaded seeing certain people, but I didn't have the same fear as I do now. It has been ever since I stepped back from casework into management. 

Since then, the fear and anxiety has just gripped me in a way I cannot describe. I am constantly thinking about my staff and the people they may be assessing, waiting for the moment when they come and tell me that they need my help with a very difficult client, or even my help removing them from the building. 

I am satisfied with my performance as a leader other than on this one point. I think it would be easier if we had the money for security but even then I think I would worry about something related to this. 

But in order for me to be a leader, I need to be able to deal with very difficult people if the situation arose. I need to be there for them if this happens. At the moment I fear I cannot. 

Please help me out with this.

262,"My ex girlfriend of a year and I decided to break up because of outside forces on our relationship (her parents mostly) and because of that I thought it would be best if we broke up to relieve some of that stress on her. After, however, she stopped talking to me because we just broke up (understandably), but my friend group that consisted of 3 of my guy friends all went to her to make sure that she was ok after it. One a little too much. One of my friends, I’ll call him Greg, Greg and my Ex gf got really close and they had developed a thing that I didn’t know about. All while my friends were with her comforting her, a girl at my work had proposed to me a sort of friends with benefits thing. Feeling as if I didn’t really have anyone at the time, I stupidly said yes. This went on for a few weeks when I eventually decided that it wasn’t the right thing for me and I cut it off. After this I had come to the conclusion that I really needed my ex gf back in my life because she helps me out and has been my best friend for almost 3 years. I try to connect with her again and 2 of my friends.  Greg and another boy, I’ll call him Felix, decide that they feel the need to tell my ex gf about my friends with benefits situation with the other girl (one that I had cut off already and told them that). They do this because they think im just jumping over to the next girl if one didn’t work out even though I literally have known her for 3 years and we just stopped talking. This makes my ex gf furious at me and I feel terrible thinking I’ll never be able to connect to her again. But after getting the chance to explain to her I was able to convince her it didn’t mean anything. Then I figure out that Greg and her had kissed and had a romantic relationship all while this was going on. After they made me feel so bad for what I had done. Not to mention completely disgusted and blindsided. This made me cut off my friends because they had all known about some part of it and didn’t tell me, while also still hanging out with him to this day. Not that I expect them to stop, just I can’t hang out with them while he’s there and he’s always there. With her however, I couldn’t just give her up because I care about her so much. Also to both of us it seemed as if we had both done something wrong so there was no sense in being mad at each other cause then it would just be a stalemate. So I told her I wanted to work things out. She agreed at first and we decided to try and do that. She was always iffy about it through the past 2 weeks or so. However, just today she told me that she didn’t think it was a good idea to try for a relationship again. She leaves for college in about 7 months but for me I just feel like I can’t just waste these last months I have the opportunity to be with her and not be with her. I told her I respect her decision and that I’ll do anything for us to give it another shot and she seems open to it but it’s just on top of that, those guys were my only friend group  and now I feel like I have no one cause it seems in my head they just took his side after completely just fucking me over. Let me know if I’m being stupid and to suck it up or whatever I just need to talk to someone about it. 


TL:DR: Ex gf had a romantic relationship with one of my 3 best friends with all three knowing some part about it. Didn’t tell me, then told my ex gf about a friends with benefits relationship I had with a girl that I had cut off and told them I cut off by the time they told my ex gf. Made me feel terrible about it, then my ex gf and friend decided to tell me about their relationship. Acting like complete hypocrites. Cut off my friends because of it and wanna try again with my ex. She is incredibly hesitant and is on pretty much the 99% no side after I had thought for a few weeks she was going to support it. Feeling lonely cause those were the only friends I have and now I have no one and want advice as to if I’m being a complete bitch about it or not.

263,"We are renting a tiny house, 800 square feet. 2 bedrooms, one level with a basement. (Unusable.)
Rent is $1200 month. Nothing is included except the most basic things...fridge, stove and laundry machines (which were all broken the first month we moved in) 
We are in no way rich, and had to cough up $480 security deposit to BC Hydro. Fine, whatever. Just got a bill for another $500, which upon reading, my jaw hit the floor. Our heat is on quite a bit, considering that there is piss all for insulation and there is a lot of drafts, a flooded basement and our bedroom window is broken. We also have a child so the heat must be on at least a little or else it freezes. Mind you we moved in around November. None of the damage is caused by us, the house was listed as being ""renovated."" Our area currently has had a water boil advisory for the past month. The landlord half-assedly had a man come to clean the dryer, when I complained of it taking 5-6 cycles to dry an RV sized load. It still sucks..
Anyway, sorry. My question is, should I look at getting my rent reduced because of this? Because he did not tell me the basement was flooded, the window was broken or the fixtures? The landlord has basically said f-all to ke about anything, and when I said something to him along the lines of ""I might need my deposits back, because this is too much."" He grew angry at me for supposedly calling him a slumlord...We don't even have furniture, or any holiday for the little one. And with these bills it's feeling pretty hopeless.

264,"My parents were always abusive, and especially hard on me, my older brother gets a lot of shit too but doesn't get the immediate blame for anything (as I am always blamed for anything). My younger brother (15M) gets only the momentary anger stuff, like after he drops something or makes a sound, all his negotiations with parents regarding friends and school are a fair bit cooler.

My parents are emotionally abusive (never hit us except when we were young) but it's getting worse. I have always wanted to move out but never did much for it, I was going to last year with my best friend but that got sidelined after I had some mental health issues take more priority as I attempted to kill myself, was a miracle I survived but some part of me wished I didn't as after that moment parents blamed me for it and non-stop belittled me for it, and anytime they would throw an insult at me they would say ""How could you make any good decisions, you were soo stupid you tried to kill yourself, and you even failed at that."" My dad has an anger problem you could say, every thing you did (especially mistakes) he would get incredibly loud shouting and belittling us while we tried to fix it and would always step in and take the mop or whatever and clean it up himself and would shout at us across the house when we ran away. He also makes demands, he will demand we do something and if we don't move within half a second he yells very loud repetitively to do it, and after you did it he would rant about how he asked earlier and everything is off now. A big thing in the house was us getting good grades (especially me so as they singled me and abuse me the most), and anything the teacher sent, every report, every homework piece, every email we would have to endure hours of sitting and getting yelled at past the point of crying. This lead to us all begging teachers to not email things and even go into their database to swap the email to a fake one. They are also incredibly manipulating, and they try and keep us dependant on them in one way or another. It was this seemingly random and overreactive moments that made me have recurring nightmares about my parents killing me, usually by stabbing, this lead to me always scanning for weapons in any situation, and looking for escape routes, playing out I would survive given dad being angry.

For the past year and more they have kept trying to tell me that my bestfriend is manipulating me to do anything she disagrees with, and talks to my brothers and try make them hate my bestfriend (who my brothers still think is cool). I always tried to keep most friendships and relationships hidden from them.  And they use this as insults as to why I don't have a girlfriend and why no one will love me. They are also very seclusive family and so the only family I know is my grandparents on mum's side, don't even know my sister who my dad left when she was young. They also repetitively lie to try and gaslight us, and just be annoying.

The house is fairly rich, Mum being the major earner, but that never translates into anything for us, Mum has a shopping addiction and spends at least $100,000 every year on useless things and both parents having purchased brand new cars each totalling over $160,000 and yet they complain about how much we use (very very little) and are trying to basically extort me with trying to charge me $80/day for nothing and simply being part of the family. Unfortunately due to how involved in work mum is she uses this to cut my business life off, talking shit about me to associates and potential clients, and where she wasn't doing that she was using me as like a side deal for hiring, where if you got her you also got me consulting on it as well.

Another common behaviour is Mum saying ""you used to be so athletic"" or ""you used to be so smart"" and constantly despising anything I do, and more recently banning all games (as apparently they contribute to me not achieving in her standards as much). It hurts a lot and makes me really angry.

Another problem is my brother would do something that would anger dad and rush and hide and wait until dad found me and put all the abuse that way.

I have tried so much to improve my parents but it all is not worth it and they haven't improved at all, and they even use all the things I said to try and open communication against me. And I barely talk to my dad, when he is not in a bad mood he is like the step dad you barely know, occassional comments on small things he heard about me or events. I used to talk to mum a lot even though I hated her abuse but I thought it was the right thing to do

So at this moment in time things are very tense, I don't make eye contact with parents and they just went into my brothers room and yelled at him till he cried, we both have bugout bags with clothes, shoes, money, essentials, food and litres of water. I don't have any friends that live nearby and none that could harbour us for a bit, however my best friends grandma lives closeby and we get along quite well and has expreased that she could help out if there was anything wrong so that would be my survive the night or so. My brother has friends that have apartments we can briefly crash at but the plan is to cycle between those until we can put forward an application and get accepted for a apartment and get roommates to help that happen, and I have to shift work from doing it as a volunteer and contract based (it's a charity) to something reliable. It's quite difficult however as since I'm under 18 I'll need parental permission and they can use the police to report runaway child and bring me back, so I would need chuld services on board and to make my older brother my legal guardian.

All of this is on a timer as well, as things are not only getting worse but parents are moving over 1000km away and bringing us so we would need to act fast, also brother needs to stay here for university (he can't transfer uni) and all of my work has been here. I have considered flying to a different country as it will be a lot easier there and a good way to get away from this. We have enough savings for us to survive for a bit over 6 months.

272,"I'm currently an analytics/tech manager in the public sector. I interviewed with company Z in middle of December for a similar position but in private sector (so more money). Their interviewing process was straightforward: clear about the steps involved from the beginning, application and in-person interview. Concise and professional.

&amp;#x200B;

Also applied to company X in middle of December. This is a much more senior position (head of department), with more money and responsibility than company Z (£10k more). Company X also has more potential for growth and would look much, much better on my CV than company Z which is rather bland and uninteresting. I applied to X, was told to complete a technical competency test then was asked to come for an in-person interview which happened a couple days after interviewing with company Z. When asked during interview with X whether I'm looking for other positions as well, I did mention the interview with Z (important later on). 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this would be the final phase of the process, but during this in-person interview they revealed I still had to put together a presentation on my first 3 months plan, my thoughts about the technology they use and how I'd review it and an analysis of a dataset they would provide. If they demmed the presentation to be adequate, then I would be invited to the final part of the process where I'd present this in front of the CEO/CFO. So the whole process is 5 steps (applications, test, interview, presentation, final meet). I felt that not disclosing all of the steps of the process from the beginning was unfair and unprofessional. If I had known it would take so much to get hired I wouldn't have applied. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, in-person interview went exceptionally well (their words), I've worked on the presentation throughout Christmas (40 pages), sent it over and just received words from them. They said it's ""brilliant"" and they want me to come over for the final phase where I present it in front of the C-suite team. This happened yesterday. Fast forward to today, I've just received an offer from company Z, the first I interviewed with. Here's where I need your help and guidance, Reddit!

I've told Z that I'd let them know in a couple days if I accept. I want to email X and mention this other offer. I want them to give me the position without going through the final steps of the process (i.e. yet another in-person meet) because 1) they never disclosed how many hoops I'd have to jump through to reach the finish, 2) at every step of the process they really seemed to like me (during in-person interview hiring manager brought in the team I'd be working with for me to ask them questions and get to know them, he also said he's ""excited"" about the prospect of working with me, also got in touch one hour after the interview to say how much he enjoyed meeting me... all of which are good signs, right?!) and 3) I am willing to take a risk, as this isn't my dream company and some red flags have become apparent already (them not disclosing the whole process, glassdoor reviews not exceptional, team I'd be managing wasn't particularly great etc).

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you think? What will company X's reply be like if I mention the other offer, if I gently push them into giving me the position early rather than go through the final phase of their process? Is it going to backfire dramatically? Will they be receptive, realise they've already tested me enough and rather than lose me, give me the offer? 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the guy that interviewed me might not have the final say, which is why I might need to meet the CEO. What happens in this case? Will the guy I've been talking to (a director) decide I'm not worth the hassle or make the case himself and try to persuade the CEO? This is all new ground for me so I'm not sure what to think/what I don't know.

279,"I worked as an in-home behavioral health tech for someone with intellectual limitations and other psychiatric issues. 

My client was very sweet, and we got along great; needed some encouragement dressing, cooking meals, laundry etc., but my client was very independent, and overall, we had a lovely time together. We went on fun outings like visiting a farm, hiking, making campfires, and other community interactions as part of his daily program. I really cared for and loved my client.

He lived with family; his mother and I got along great as well, until an incident. I have to keep details out, but long story short, she yelled at me (uncalled for) in front of my client, causing an outburst - client was yelling, cursing, throwing things, and she ignored my request to have the conversation out of my client’s earshot/present - so they’re both yelling at me, and I didn’t feel safe/that this was appropriate, but stayed anyway and finished the work day.

Then the next day, her personality was a 180 - laughing, sweet, begging me not to quit, telling off-color jokes, just erratic stuff, but not threatening/hostile - but also very clearly under the influence. Slurring words, very loud, left me outside for 30 minutes waiting to show up for work...

So, I quit. Unexpectedly and without notice, which was supported by my employer, who said they were “surprised I didn’t walk out the day of the yelling.”

She’s furious, and I’m sure he’s deeply hurt (I know she is too), and she’s blocked his number from me and we haven’t had contact. I’m saddest about my client, who is the only one really suffering consequences of me leaving (aside from inconvenience to her). He doesn’t fully understand things like this and I feel awful about leaving like that, but also that I didn’t have any other option. 

My question is, is it insulting/hurtful to send a holiday card to both of them? I didn’t go into much detail, but I did say that I regret how things ended between us, and have only fond memories of them; to him, I wrote something simpler along the lines of I miss him and remember all the good times we had, love always, etc. 

What do you think? I’m not asking for forgiveness from them; but I really don’t like how things ended and want them to know I still care. Is it too soon, too much, out of line?

So I live in a house share with two other people. They're both male aged 29-30, and moved in in August.

Since, it has become apparent that they're heroin dealers. I've seen them packing it ready for sale and hear them on their phones arranging sales. One keeps a machete in his room and I think may own (or is going to get) a gun.  Both have been in prison previously for gang related stuff. They also both carry knives and play/mess about with them pretty openly. In the city where I live there is a lot of knife crime and deaths. I wouldn't be surprised if either of them were involved in these deaths.

Although I'd say we all ""get on"", it's obvious to me now that any kindness shown to me is manipulation to keep me on side. I don't feel like I live in my own home anymore now that it's basically turned into a drugs den.

I obviously can't tell my landlord or the police because then I'd be a ""grass"" and I'd have a target on me. This is really wearing me down and I hate going home everyday.

Posting this on a throwaway, as this is really personal.

This will be a long post, so bear with me please.

This happened about 5 months ago, but I'm still being affected by this, and I don't know what to do about it. So much ridiculous and terrible shit happened that night, but I promise that this is completely true.

TLDR at the bottom.

So, I come from a very liberal family. Super accepting of everything, and never had any problems coming out to my parents; I was really fortunate. (I'm a gay man, for context.)

About 5-6 years ago, after my parents got divorced, my mom met this guy, let's call him Asshole. Asshole is very Republican, redneck, and we never got along. I'd pick up on microaggressions that tipped off his true colors, and mentioned it to my mom, which were brushed off.

Context: my mom is a wonderful person, and couldn't be mean if she tried. So the pairing never really made sense to me, but I kept it to myself.

They get engaged. Wedding planned for 1.5 years in the future.

Wedding time comes around, people fly from all over the country to attend. I took 4 days off work to come.

The day I get there, it's rehearsal dinner. Asshole is nowhere to be seen, as he told my mom that ""today is the only day I have to fish with my friends."" Because fishing is more important than your wedding, but whatever. My mom is very upset, but keeps it together for the guests.

He brings his friends over. They are absolute white trash, garbage people, but we (my friends and family) try to keep an open mind. The friends get belligerently drunk, absolutely obnoxiously intoxicated. I start hearing the word ""faggot"" get thrown around, which I'm not happy about. Not wanting to cause any controversy, I talk to my mom, who is standing with Asshole's sister. I say, ""I keep hearing 'faggot' and it's really upsetting me. Maybe Asshole can talk to them about that? There's children here and that is no way to act."" Before my mom has a chance to respond, Asshole's sister chimes in: ""Oh, they're just making fun of each other. There's no bad intent or harm intended."" I reiterate that their behavior is completely inappropriate, no matter what context the word is being used in, and it's highly offensive to me - and probably other people as well.

My mom says she'll talk to Asshole about it.

I keep hearing it, as apparently Asshole hasn't said anything, or they just didn't listen. My family from up north and I are just observing, thinking there's something really off about this whole situation.

At the end of the night, something I'll remember for the rest of my life, my strong mother looks defeated and is sitting on a chair alone. She looks like she's on the verge of tears, and she says ""I just hope tomorrow goes better."" I've never seen her look this down, and I reassure her that tomorrow will be perfect. The image still sticks with me.

Mind you, SHE (with barely any help from Asshole) has been planning this wedding for literal years.

\- -

Wedding day comes. I'm drinking, as I'm kind of dreading this.

Ceremony begins.

My mother in her beautiful wedding dress walks down the aisle, to meet Asshole by the priest. When she gets there, Asshole's best friend shouts ""Hey Asshole! Gimmie a turn when you're done!"" Nobody laughs, and everyone glares at this fucking moron. I can sense things are heading south.

The ceremony ends, everyone is eating at the reception. Asshole doesn't want to give a speech (fucking baby), so my mom does it. She gives a great speech, during which Asshole's best friend interrupts multiple times with absolutely vulgar and disgusting things about my mom. ""Damn Asshole, she's fuckin hot!"" As there's literal children in the room. My mom doesn't notice (or pretends not to), but everyone else does, and glares more.

I seriously can't believe this is happening. It's like being in a bad movie. I keep my mouth shut.

More of Asshole's friends come back (I think they were fishing....again. Even though the rehearsal dinner was the ""one day"" they could fish, but whatever.), absolutely fucking trashed. Like toppling over shit trashed. They start drinking more.

One of them passes out on the patio in front of the house that my mom was renting for the wedding. In the middle of people. Completely out, people are stepping over this fucking moron. I nudge him with my foot a couple different times, as I went back to the house, to literally make sure he didn't die of alcohol poisoning.

At this point, I'm drunk. I've been drinking all night. But I'm a jokey drunk, and usually just end up getting really tired.

I'm walking with my uncle back to the house to grab some water bottles, and we see the guy, still passed out - hours later. I say ""is...he ok?"" and nudge him with my foot again.

Nudge, not kick. I didn't forcefully nudge him either, just a gentle push with my foot.

Immediately, he gets up, furious. He starts screaming ""WHO THE FUCK KICKED ME?"" I'm like ""dude...you've been passed out on the concrete for hours. Are you ok?""

""I DON'T FUCKIN CARE WHO THE FUCK KICKED ME""

My uncle, 6"" tech nerd, starts yelling back ""SIT DOWN AND LEAVE US ALONE. YOU ARE MAKING A SCENE.""

Eventually, the idiot storms off to find his other buddies.

I'm druunk (with 2 u's) now, so I stop drinking. This part I'm a bit hazy on, due to the alcohol, but I remember hearing ""faggot"" being shouted again by a group of Asshole's friends.

I start walking back to the reception area. As I'm headed there, I get stopped by this older woman I hadn't talked to before. ""You the one fuckin kickin my son?""

""..no? Is he the one that was passed out on the ground FOR HOURS at someone's wedding? I think he has bigger problems."" I get a little snippy when I'm drunk and talking to rude people.

""Well...you should've just let him be. I told everyone to just let him be!!!""

I say, ""Ok but he was LYING FACE FIRST ON CONCRETE FOR HOURS. People legitimately thought something happened."" She mumbles something that I don't hear, and walks away.

I start thinking that something is going on. I brush the weird encounter off, and go to a table and start talking to a family friend that I haven't seen in years. We're in the carport, with about 6 other people.

The way the room is set up is such: I'm sitting at a table with aforementioned friend, across from the door that opens to the stairs to the house. There's semitransparent windows that show some of the stairs.

I briefly notice someone's silhouette coming downstairs, but the person is loudly stomping down. Before I look away, the door slams open. It's Asshole, my mom's husband of about 4 hours. He glares directly in my eyes, doesn't look like he even notices anyone else in the room. His eyes are red, probably due to drugs of some sort. In hindsight, he legitimately looked red with anger.

He screams, while maintaining his glare, ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY FRIEND YOU LITTLE FAGGOT?????""

Immediately, I get up and say ""Excuse me? What the FUCK did you just call me?"" I'm thinking, ""I've never been in a fight, but nobody, NOBODY talks to me like that."" I walk towards him, he backs away. I take my glasses off because I had been sweating and they were falling off my face. He takes this as a sign, that I'm about to hit him.

I keep walking towards him, and I see him pull his fist back, and swing. It connects with my face, on my eyebrow. I immediately drop to the floor, not knowing what just happened. He punches me again in my lip, as I'm on the ground. I realize what is happening, and I pull my arms over my head to protect my face. I'm spitting blood on the ground, thinking ""what the fuck is going on"" and ""don't hit him, it'll make things worse."". He punches me in my back multiple times, before someone notices whats going on. (This all happened in like, 30 seconds or less.)

My uncle runs to see what is going on, sees Asshole punching my back and my face. Uncle picks Asshole up, and completely throws him into a table and shouts ""What the HELL are you doing!???!!"" I'm crying and spitting up blood, hoping I didn't lose a tooth. Police are called, ask if I want to press charges. I decline, fearing that Asshole could pin an assault charge on me, for walking towards him, or worse - the drunk moron who I ""kicked"" could injure himself and say I did it. Fortunately, I didn't get seriously injured other than a split lip and a cut on my cheek (from his wedding ring, no less. Poetic.), so I'm not taken to the hospital or anything like that.

Family friend takes me to their hotel, so I can sleep there. Next morning, he tries to apologize to me and can't even look me in the eyes. I was so angry I was shaking. I've never been angrier than that in my entire life. He literally apologized because my mom told him to. He wasn't going to do it on his own.

Asshole walks away, after I threaten to press charges. He says he will also press charges against me for assault, if I do so. I laugh in his face. ""Yeah you've got some case, you fucking monster.""

I'm informed, after I was taken to the hotel, that Asshole's sister, who is VERY high up in our counties' school district, was screaming and arguing with MY teenage sisters about the word 'faggot'. Saying that it was MY fault that I was offended, and there's nothing wrong with saying it. This woman is teaching kids this rhetoric. Anyway.

Additionally, after I left, Asshole's friends were apparently so drunk they tried to run in traffic. Like tried to kill themselves. My sisters' boyfriends (who came with them on the trip) had to physically grab them and hold them down. Fucking insane.

Asshole leaves. His best friend from earlier (moron at the wedding) casually walks onto the property, unannounced. Drunk as fuck. It's like 10:30 AM. He says hi to nobody, and is obnoxiously singing to himself. After he walks past me, he mumbles ""faggot"". I'm beside myself. I legitimately felt unsafe, in what was supposed to be a family environment. I've never felt that way before.

I yell at the guy, who ignores me. I tell my mom, who tells Asshole, who tells his best friend to ""not talk to my stepson that way."" I'm disgusted at the thought of being his stepson, and tell my mom and him that he is NOT my family, not invited to ANY of my future life events, and I don't want ANYTHING to do with him or his disgusting family.

I then drive home, and cry profusely.

He tried to write an apology letter, but I never read it. I haven't had any contact with him since.

Like I said, this happened about 5 months ago. I still think about it almost every day. I used to have nightmares of him. I've never been in a fight, or abused, or hit or whatever before. I'm typing this from my room in my mom's house, because he's in the living room currently and I don't want to even see him. It's a terrible feeling, to feel like a prisoner in your childhood home.

I don't know what I expect from writing this, or if anyone will even read it. I just need advice on how to deal with this. It's negatively affected my life in numerous ways, causing my (already bad) anxiety to spike dramatically, caused the end of a relationship I was in, made me isolate myself from friends and family.

I'm a pretty privileged person, I haven't had severe trauma or anything like that happen to me, other than this. I don't know why it's still affecting me, but I just want to start being happy again. Typing this all out brought back feelings of intense anger and sadness, but also catharsis.

I thank you if you took the time to read this, may you be kind to every living soul.

TL;DR: my mom got married to a redneck, homophobic, piece of shit human being who punched me in the face &amp; back numerous times at their wedding. I'm still dealing with the residual trauma from it, and don't know how to deal with it. Support would be super helpful.",31Dec2018,1

I met this extremely nice man almost 5 years ago. We moved in together fairly quickly and for 2 years we stayed in my home state of Colorado. I was so thankful. Then we had to make a decision to move because he wanted to be closer to his grandparents. Which I understood and I was grateful I wasn’t whisked away sooner. We moved to Alabama. The Deep South. The Bible Belt. At first I really loved being here. As the years went on, I can see how religion can manifest into something ugly and disgusting. How it can manipulate people. I then saw the immense amount of diversity but nothing like home. Forgive me but it’s almost like living in the past. The “not so great” parts of town are minorities. There’s white people calling the cops on Black people every chance they get.Everyone and their mother voted for Trump. I wouldn’t call our family liberal but we definitely wouldn’t have voted for Trump or Hillary. It was a turn for the worst either way. But at this point maybe I would’ve rather had Hillary. I’m not sure. 
Anyway, I like to stay close to my self for the most part because I really can’t relate to anyone in family aspects and well, people almost always disappoint. We are headed to his family’s get together for New Years. I was excited. I genuinely do like them from what I’ve experienced. Rewind to a week ago and some of them requested me on Facebook, I usually wouldn’t but seeing as they are so close, I did. I was extremely disappointed and disgusted. Nothing but MAGA. Every post was about how Trump cares about and visits our Vets. How the UD is better off ran like a business, etc. I’m sorry but his presidency has been nothing but a shit show. I understand people have different views but I can’t bare to make an excuse for him. If you are in a similar relationship, how would you handle this? Can you tolerate it? I want to make an effort but I’m also not blind to the fact that politics literally shape the way people think and react to the world. How we survive and move forward. Some of you might hate me for this but the people who voted for and support Trump are cultists. It’s downright scary to me. I understand I might get black lashed but I’m genuinely asking for help.

I feel like they are not the right people for this dog. Dogs like these need a lot of care and need to be trained well. The father of sis-in-law her partner doesnt know they have this dog (his ex wife gave it to them. They are not on good terms). My partner and I want to reach out to him. Knowing he knows dogs really well and knows people who actually can take care of it. But we don't want to be the ones that start a big family fight.

306,"Tonight, my partner (25M) and I (25F) are going to a NYE get together at another couple's house (similar ages to us). I have never met this couple, but they went to highschool with my SO and they are engaged to be married in the spring. I have always heard stories about them because we have plenty of mutual friends. I will call them Derek and Heidi for the purpose of the story.

So, a year or so ago, a mutual friend let slip while drunk that Derek had (at least) made out with someone who was definitely not Heidi while at a bachelor party in another city. I asked if Heidi knew about this, and the answer was ""probably not"". Someone else asked how the mutual friend knew about this, and he responded ""I saw them on the dance floor getting it on and Derek asked me not to tell Heidi"". Shortly after this conversation, Derek and Heidi got engaged (guilt maybe from cheating?) and their wedding is coming up in early 2019.

It is definitely none of my business that Derek cheated on Heidi and I will not tell her. We are strangers and I have no proof of any wrongdoing on Derek's part. It has also been brought up that maybe he told her and they decided to move past it, but the mutual agreement was that she probably does not know.

My conundrum is that I feel absolutely terrible that I know this secret about someone and I have to spend an evening with this couple. I have been avoiding them for a year (since I found out he cheated) because cheating really grinds my gears and I was scared I would say something by accident. To be honest, I would want to know if my partner was cheating on me or had cheated on me once in the past, no matter what source it came from. I just know it is not my place, hence the guilt.

I'm already not a fan of Derek as a human being simply by virtue of the fact he cheated on his girlfriend, even if he told her about it. The reason my SO and I are going tonight is because a friend of mine (mutual friend's girlfriend actually) begged me to come and spend time with her before she has to hunker down to write a really big national exam for her career.

So.... I guess I am writing because I am looking for advice on how to move forward meeting this couple tonight and confirmation maybe that I am doing the right thing by keeping my mouth shut. Any advice or personal stories are appreciated if anyone was in a similar situation.

310,"I (F20) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (M21) for 2 and a half years. We've been looking into getting married sometime in the next two years, and he was starting to look for a ring. My parents have had a hard time accepting that I'm with him for a while in the beginning and it really affected our relationship with them.

My sister, who is 19 (you don't have to point out that she's too young, I know), has been with her boyfriend for 4 months. He is 26, had been living out of the country for 6 years and returned this spring, my parents have known him for a long time and their relationship basically started off as a joke between friends that they should get together. It looks like my parents are more accepting of him, which is understandable, since they've known him for a long time, but it just brings out how my boyfriend had got a different treatment. Last night, my sister came into the room and showed me the ring. It took me a minute to realize she wasn't joking. They plan to get married this fall. 

So, after a year of so of people asking us about our plans, and life finally starting to go good with his new job and my college, my sister just swoops in, her bf having an apartment and a car (which we don't) and decides to get married after 4 months. Yes, my parents support them and I feel like a jerk for being angry because everyone else seems happy for them and no one seems to see how stupid this makes me and my bf look. I don't know how to act, I don't know what to say, I am so deeply sad and disappointed and I don't know how to feel.

312,"A little bit about me, I’m a 25 year old Male from India. English isn’t my first language. Let me start off by saying - sex before marriage isn’t as common as it is in the western world, even though we are have a population of a billion people. Around 4-5 years ago, I suffered from depression, low self-esteem, low self-confidence and was obese 35 kgs to be specific. Throughout my teens to turning 22, I was a complete mess- poor grades in school, no friends , poor skin, overweight .I got less marks in 10th , 12th and also graduated anyhow with a degree  from a not so known college which probably was the easiest of all and that too I got a few backlogs. I’ve never had a gf, nothing . The lowest point was when I grew incredibly lonely at my 22nd b’day as not even one person called to wish me. I got really lonely in the coming few months . It lead to watching porn for 2-3 hours a day, masturbating 5-6 times a day. I could sleep for 10 hours and still feel tired and sleepy . I got really upset and then my dumb brain decided to do something I had never imagined, I started to seek sex online. Craigslist , Locanto many such websites I checked and called people , always men picked up so I used to get scared and I cut the call. Then I saw an add where housewife’s were available. I decided to go ahead with it, I met at a flat and I told her only oral cause I didn’t want to lose my virginity like this.  Eventually I got into a habit of this and met a few women like this in the coming few months . I don’t know what got into me. I didn’t even think what would happen if I got caught by the cops, if my family came to know especially my younger sisters, my parents would probably disown me . Even after having sex and seeking sexual affection I wasn’t happy. I left all that completely, it was the month of December and I decided to seek ways to improve , I had been to a few therapist and nothing helped tbh, I continued to research self-improvement stuff online. On 1st Jan I decided to do a one month challenge from all the self-improvement stuff I had read online. I completely altered my self- I started to walk twice a day for 30 mins each, completely cut out junk food and sugar, no alcohol , gave up porn and masturbation ( there is nothing wrong with enjoying it, it’s just that I had a bad habit with it, watching hours of porn and masturbation many times a day ),  Meditation twice a day, with the help of my dad I started to learn to drive , I cut down on screen time, even missing out of watching my favourite football club matches and tv shows. There’s no harm in enjoying such stuff it’s such that I wanted to transform myself and be happy . Within a month I lost 5 kgs (11 lbs) and was very happy. My mental health had improved a lot . Eventually to cut things short - I lost the weight completely ,
Started making friends at yoga class, gym etc. I gained an interest in finance and have my own practice now. I’m more than happy with my life. Once I lost the weight and started to put on muscle. 
Many girls started to find me attractive, I enjoyed the attention. I started to have a good social life, career is going great, parents are happy with me. 6 months ago I met a girl , who I kinda developed a crush , even she liked me. After meeting multiple times and talking for hours on the
Phone , we decided to date as we
Like each other a lot. She’s my first gf, she knows that. Since the past 2 months we have been dating. Like most young couples we make out a lot, we haven’t had sex yet. She told me she’s a virgin , although it doesn’t matter to me, even I told her I’m a virgin. I regret losing my virginity to a prostitute, I’ve never been so upset with myself . I’ve come
In terms with my actions and I’ve improved a lot. But I just
Cannot see telling anyone else that this is how I’ve lost my virginity. I’m afraid telling her I lost my virginity to a prostitute. I’m afraid many will not accept that fact at all. I white lie here and there is okay. But I feel I’m not being a good bf if I tell her I’m a virgin and if In future we have sex. Even if I’m not a virgin she’ll be okay; but if I tell her I lost it to a prostitute, she probably will find it very disturbing. I don’t really know what to do here. Even if I marry someone in future, so I tell the person about this . I cannot really discuss it with my friends, so I need help. A female perspective will be great. So should I tell my gf that I lost my virginity to a prostitute ?

   What usually happens is; I Get up to stop it from beeping, usually by setting the reset button,or pulling the cable out, assuring it doesnt bother me for the rest of the night (not that it would, strictly happens at 1:01).

So there was this girl that went to my school last year (I’m in high school btw) and she was weird asf but we was messing around with her and stuff and I told her it was a prank. But that’s not where it ends one night I had already went to bed and since he was only visiting us from Atlanta (i live in Michigan) I assume he decides to send her pictures of his dick to her off of my phone since he had seen me put my password in before. And he tells me and I talked to her about it and I brought it up to the family and yeah whatever it happened. Fast forward to yesterday I had texted her just to see if all was well cause I am nice like that. And I don’t know what happened but she texts her man and he texts me showing these explicit pictures. I haven’t been able to breathe since then and I feel so sick because even though she lives far now he still goes to my school. If those pictures where to get out everyone would think it was me which is totally messed up because I just started talking to the girl of my dreams and I have finally found happiness.

315,"I don't know what to do. This is my fault for the reason she's mad at me, but I wanna share and tell somebody.

316,"Just a little background, I have been with my wife now over 10 years. I love her more than I can explain, I honestly do. We work perfectly together, we have strong communication, agree on a lot of topics and when we don't agree we respect each other’s opinions enough to finds a balance. If the perfect relationship existed, I think this is it. 

We have these friends that we are very close with. It's her best friend and my best friend who are also married. We do almost everything together. From vacations to holidays even planning on having kids around the same time. We discuss how important being in each other’s lives are and we always talk about growing old as friends together. Herein lies the problem. With the time we spend together and how much we all talk (group text with almost constant communication throughout the day) it started to feel like a relationship with them. Just as a preface this is only from my point of view, I don't know how anyone else feels about this, and I don't want to risk talking to them about it for fear of 1. ruining my marriage 2. ruining our friendship or 3. some unforeseen issues having open discussion about my feeling (maybe being the only one who notices/feels this way). 

There are signs that make me feel I am not crazy though for thinking. For example (without being to descript as to protect my anonymity), on multiple occasions the other women has told me she loves me. Writing this, it is hard for me to explain what I mean, sure you tell your friends you love them, but sometimes the context in which it is said can give more meaning to those words. Its not empty when she says it, she says ""I love you"" not just ""love you"" she looks me in the eyes when she says it, she hugs me in such a way, she tells me things like she wants to always be in my life. and this isn't just a single occurrence, its almost every time we are together the last few months we have one of these ""heart to hearts"" where she tells me how much I mean to her.  Its those other things, when said, make me think its something more. This keeps happening over time, and over time more and deeper feeling develop. 

I struggle with these feelings because I feel tremendous guilt for feeling this way, it is not fair to my wife or my best friend. I know that distancing myself from our friendship will solve this problem but selfishly I really enjoy their company and on top of that it would require my wife also distancing herself from them. I truly feel I have no one to talk about this with as my brother is close with my friends and my wife is involved. More so i think I am also ashamed for letting myself feel this way. 

I really don’t know what to do about this situation, I have felt this way now since August-September and while its not causing any issues in my marriage I feel awful about it and don’t want to continue to feel this way or have it eventually effect my marriage. I guess even though I am posing this on reddit, I don’t expect and true answer to this situation, I just feel like I need someone to talk to about it and I don’t have anyone. 

This also has me questioning if one can love two people, why are humans generally monogamous? Is it so wrong for me to have feelings for her so long as I don’t act on them? I question these things over and over again and its kind of driving me crazy at this point.",31Dec2018,1

318," 

So  my friend is being tracked by her Ex husband. We know because he  revealed to her that she was in certain places, like the house of her  parents, my street the city, a public bath etc. while he was away on a  business trip.

The only possible objects  that he might be able to track are her phone or her car, at least those  are the only things i can think off. Tell me if I'm wrong.

I  advised her to change her mail and iCloud passwords. Is it even  possible to track somebody with just access to the iCloud, or do you  need to go further steps like installing certain programs on the iPhone?

He  had given her a GPS tracker for wallets, keys etc. a while back, it's  called TrackR bravo, but since she never installed the App i do not  believe he should be able to use that to track her. Just to be sure i  advised her to pull the battery on that thing. According to her, he had a  small black GPS tracker he had bought for a motorcycle, saying in case  it gets stolen, but we don't know anything more specific about that  device or wether it was ever installed in his motorcycle or not.

I  told her to look in her car (under the hood, in the trunk etc. if he  installed it anywhere but if he did we were unable to find it), it would  probably need some continuous source of power so it would have to be  hooked to the cars electrical system, wouldn't it?

Did i miss some obvious source for his knowledge?

I know if I WANTED to, I could meet a guy, but I don't know any guys I'd like a relationship with.

I would be feel dishonest and out of place sitting in a group of people who are aspiring Christians/Muslims when I honestly have a little contempt in my heart for religion.

A little background info...I ""ran"" away from my parents house (technically kicked out at 21) and I have a pretty tense relationship with them. BTW I live completely under their thumb because of the guilt I feel about leaving home. So in the beginning of the year my parents (who were divorced 12 years) decided they wanted to remarry again in our home country, Kenya and my presence was automatically required.  I go from basically being homeless to finally get a decent job  plus benefits and I can afford university and my own apartment with my boyfriend. The entire time I'm starving and sleeping out a van they offer no support and I understand that I made my choice to leave but I asked repeatedly plus I was over 18 and about to graduate and leave anyways. 

I work night shift at a place where holiday seasons correspond to how much we'll work so the Christmas season is expected to be completely closed off in terms of putting in vacation or a leave of absence unless approved beforehand. My parents make me feel so uncomfortable and talking to them just makes me so anxious I throw up so I procrastinated the hell out of not requesting a leave of absence and waited until the week of the trip to get to business. 

That entire week I was beyond stressed and barely talking, not eating and dissociating more than ever now until the day of the trip but the morning I got out of work I told them I had no choice but to stay and made up some bs lie but they were LIVID.  I have over 100 messages from my mom that are just too painful to read but I'm not surprised she only seemed interested in me for as she claimed ""her"" wedding and I haven't communicated with my sisters or my dad for 2 weeks now; no merry Christmas nada. 

They wanted me to quit my job to come and I just couldn't because I didn't want to and at first I felt so relieved because I know rent and school will be paid but now they're all coming home at the end of this week and I've been feeling so unstable and lost and I don't even know what do anymore so if anyone could please offer help, I would appreciate it!",31Dec2018,1

Just a few days ago as we were entering the airport, he got mad that I was rolling my suitcase how people usually do and decided I can’t tilt it and have to do it his way. He started swearing and shouting in public. Then yesterday I was back in the airport and he decided to shout again and started saying things like “You like being shouted at in public? You got issues? People with issues get shouted at in public!” Yesterday morning I slept at 4 am because I was up with cousins hanging out. So obviously I was very tired last night so I fell asleep and woke up at 9:30 AM. He has a dumb rule where you HAVE to wake up at 9 for no good reason. I woke up and got out of bed to use the restroom. He ends up knocking on the door and I say “I’m in the restroom”. Then he says, “What time did you wake up?” I said: “I woke up 9:30 but was supposed to wake up at 9.

“I DIDN’T ASK WHEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO WAKE UP! WHEN DID YOU WAKE UP!

“9:30”

“WHEN WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO WAKE UP?”

“9”

Time went by, we got a new branch manager and she is a 100% by the book rule follower. When she showed up I was disciplined a lot, tardiness, work appearance (I have a beard and let it get a little unkept at that point) and other things. 

I realized I needed to shape up, so I did exactly that, I groomed better, stopped using my cell phone, prepared more at night so I would be on time for clocking in and just doing the right thing.

But something tremendous came up in my personal life that caused me to lose focus on things so I haven’t been balancing at the end of the night.

I found out from a reliable source she believes I’m careless and is attempting to terminate me on my next slip up. Although I completely understand where she’s coming from, it’s just saddening that I’m really trying to shape up here but given current circumstances I’m facing difficulty.

I almost don’t want to give her insight on the event due to I just believe she’ll brush it off. Should I keep my job, try to do things to ease the stress and hope for the best here? Or just apply to other banks and move on?",31Dec2018,1

331,"Hi guy,throwaway account here for obvs reasons. I’m 16 years old and need some advice

 I’d say my family are more culturally religious than actually religious if that makes sense eg I dont wear a hijab or pray/fast  but if someone asks me  if i pray or fast and my family are around i’m expected to lie and say i do to keep up appearances sake.

However,it’s recently getting so hard to pretend to be someone im not in front of my family , i’ve developed severe anxiety incase they find out that i’m gay and an atheist. I delete everything on my phone constantly- Ive started binge eating as a way to cope with my problems and have started to push away my friends.

My relationship with my family is quite tense at the moment as my mother has started to push religion down my throat even though i express clear discomfort at it. It doesn’t help that i have a relative who is an atheist who my family have 100% disowned and quite happily brag about disowning al the time.

Its come to the point where i can’t wait until i’m 18 to leave and I need to do this ASAP. I love my family dont get me wrong but if i stay here any longer i dont think i’ll live to see 18. And honestly its just a matter of time before i get outted to them as i suspect a few of my family friends might know.

I decided that for my new years resolution that i need to own up to who i am. Before 2019 ends i’m going to sit my mother down and tell her-she’ll probably disown me and  try to send me back to our home country. However i plan on going to my teachers at school who are really supportive and have them arrange something with social workers beforehand incase anything goes wrong.

I have an incredible support system behind me but i just want to know does this plan sound alright?How would i go about telling her?I live in Europe and I can legally move out of my home at 16,my friends have offered me places to stay incase things go wrong but please reassure me that everything is going to be alright?

Now it’s 11th grade and we’re close friends again but something feels off about it. She’s always telling everyone everything I say, and not even in a talking-behind-my-back way. She genuinely thinks it’s okay to tell her other friends everything I say to her &amp; everything I do. Yesterday she even texted me a story about myself because she meant to send it to someone else. I understand that people enjoy telling funny stories about their friends, but I’m pretty sure I’m all Jasmine talks about, ever. When she’s speaking to me she’ll tell me her other friends secrets, which is another red flag because who’s to say she’s not telling them my secrets too. She’s also constantly buying me things and it’s nice &amp; I’m grateful but I feel like she’s trying to buy my friendship. I ask her not to buy me things because it  makes me feel so guilty that I don’t have the money to return the favor, but she does it anyway.

She takes pictures of me on her phone and sometimes posts them without me knowing &amp; I won’t see the photo until it comes up on my timeline.

I am strongly against cheating, and I wouldn't ever cheat on anyone because that is probably the worst thing you could do to someone. However I keep imagining myself with someone else (not a specific person, just someone else).

336,"Long, I’m sorry

I am a 18 year old girl and I am trying to decide where to go to college right now, it is the hardest decision I feel like I’ve ever had to make. I applied to a lot of out of state schools, Washington, Colorado, Oregon (I live in Texas) after a road trip I went on last summer and fell in love with the area. The main reason for wanting to go so far though is to get away from my extremely toxic direct family. It’s too much to explain but my mom is an abusive selfish woman whose been diagnosed with some mental issues  but refuses help (no shaming here, I understand it’s not her fault but with out her getting help I can not surround myself with her because she is so hurtful). I’ve been living on my own for a year because she got married and packed her things and left completely. I got into a school I really like in Washington, which a pretty large scholarship and financial aid package. I love the idea of going there and starting “over” and experiencing something new. I’m not afraid to be alone and I understand that it will be hard being completely always from all family (other than two distant cousins I have in Washington.) 

I also got into a school here in Texas outside of Austin, which is close to my aunt the only family member who I am super close with and isn’t toxic. She’s been like my sister.  A lot of my friends are going to school at this school as well, and one really wants me to dorm with her. My aunt is really upset about me going out of state and it’s made it really hard to try and chose. 

Every time I lean towards one school I start to think more about the other school. I don’t know what to do. Anyone been in a similar situation ? What should I do ",31Dec2018,1
337,"To summarize what I would consider neglectful (but not overtly harmful) parenting, my neighbor isn’t the best mom. But since she moved in almost a year ago I’ve been helping her w her kids as best I can. This includes, but is not limited to, picking up her kids from school when she’s running late (after 6pm), picking up her kids from school when they get sick and then taking care of them at my house until she gets home (also after 6pm), feeding her kids, giving them baths, worrying about them when they’re playing and I don’t see or hear them for a while, etc...

Basically when I got back into town from Christmas,  my neighbor wasn’t responding to my calls or texts so I was worried, I went next door to wish them merry Christmas, and in the nastiest tone I’ve ever heard she said CPS has been to her house two days before Christmas, that they had traced the calls from the complaints, and they were coming from a neighbor so she knew it was me. They accused her of many things, but not things I would have called cps for (like not vaccinating her kids [not illegal, not something I agree with but not grounds to call cps]). This is the same woman who’s sick 4 year old I had on my couch the week prior because she has to be picked up from school. 

I looked at her and told her she was going to believe what she wants, but I didn’t call CPS and I walked away. 

Now I’m sitting here wondering if there’s anything else that can be done to “prove” I didn’t call? Or to make her realize that I was on her side, trying to help her, and I was never shy about voicing my opinions about her less than stellar parenting. 

Has anyone been accused of this before, or knows someone that has?  What was the outcome? Did the reports indicate that it was a specific person? ",31Dec2018,1

He’s planning a trip to travel around europe. Going back a few weeks, he’s been looking at a lot of dance clubs and strip clubs to visit. He’s been reading and watching videos on how to interest women and how to flirt and how to dress. 

I confronted him about it, and for a second he admitted to it. He said something like “Maybe i was planning on doing that stuff”

But then he backtracked and now he claims it was wrong of him to look up those things, but he wasn’t actually gonna act on it. 

He cried and said he loves me. Then he went on the offensive, and he got mad because I’m accusing him of doing something and getting mad over something that hasn’t even happened yet and isn’t going to happen. 

Its been a few days and I haven’t officially forgave him and we never reached a real solution. He offered to cancel his trip, but then he would have to explain to his parents why he’s cancelling, and then I look like the asshole.

343,"Hello everyone. Me and my family have been in a bad situation for a while and I would appreciate any feedback you can give me.

My parents have been married for over 30 years. They run a successful dental clinic with my dad being the dentist and my mom being the secretary. She tends to appoint too many patients and forcing my dad to overwork. This led to him to being absent during me and my brother’s childhood years. We were raised solely by my mother, who often verbally abused us (she had a rough childhood as well). This caused emotional/ self-esteem issues for both me and my brother (who is now morbidly obese and an introvert). My brother also works in the office but does not contribute much.

Our situation resembles the TV sitcom “Malcolm in the Middle. My brother, my father, and I all dislike my mother. She loves to fight and yell. We have tried therapy and counseling but she is in denial. My father is afraid to divorce her since he never got a pre-nup and knows how vengeful and vindictive she would be. He would lose the business he’s spent 30 years growing. He loves his patients and wants to work until me and my brother are financially independent. However, he is getting old but does not want to retire until he knows that we’ll be okay.

My dad is very kind and avoids confrontation. He is amazing for putting up with her B.S. to support me and my brother. Best dad in the world ☺

In 2016, I decided to move away from home to pursue a post graduate degree in a 7 year international program. While I’ve been gone, I’ve noticed that things have gotten much worse. My mother has fired all the dental assistants causing my father to work twice as hard. My brother has not changed his diet or lifestyle and continues to be an introvert and eat. He is now the heaviest he’s ever been. I feel guilty studying abroad while they both suffer.
I’ve told my dad to hire another dentist and assistant. Every time that happens, my mother suddenly stops calling patients and says “look we have no patients! Why should we keep paying them for doing nothing?” This has happened countless times throughout his career.

For my brother, my dad and I are looking for ways for him to move out. His whole life, he has been with my mother. No college, he’s just stayed at home and been abused. I was once angry and depressed like him, until I left for college and my heart healed. I read a quote the other day that said “You cannot find happiness in the same place where you lost it.” I believe that he needs to leave the house and experience life on his own. We tried to get him to go back to school. My brother replied “you know I’m not a good student. I can’t do it.”

I believe the solution is to get my mom out of their lives. She does not care for either of them. 

What can we do?

One solution I thought of was for my father to buy another dental clinic. He works there while my mother works in the other clinic. That way, she’s not in our lives 24/7.

Do you guys have any other ideas/solutions? We’re in a bad situation and I can use some advice. Thank you",31Dec2018,1

I (23 F) have a colleague/acquaintance (also female) who I met around 2 years ago but never really was close to or became friends with. 
However, every time she sees me in the distance, she sprints towards me and hugs me really tight, often for more than 30 seconds. She often touches my shoulder/thighs/waist or side-hugs me as we share very basic everyday talk. Her hugs and gestures are almost always unsolicited and it gets really awkward for me and whoever I’m standing/talking with, especially in a workplace like ours (hospitals and clinics). 

One time she came towards me from the back and tickled my waist then hugged me. It caught me off guard and I told her I really didn’t appreciate that and that I cherish my personal space, hoping she’d take it easy in the future, but nothing changed.

So to make it short, I feel like letting go of two friends that I’ve known forever. We’ve been growing apart more and more over time, yet we’ve managed to keep in touch and hang out here and there. 

One of them canceled our plans for New Years because she got stuck at work and has been very unwell because of it. She’s one of those people that spends so much time pleasing others/work that it puts her in very negative situations. She also has a very toxic boyfriend that she clings on to because she thinks no one else will love her.

My other friend is someone I only see 3-4 times a year and I feel like we just don’t really connect that much anymore. He’s a good guy and we have some similar interests, but I just feel like he doesn’t have various interests like I do and tends to be stuck in his ways which really isn’t my thing.

The issue is I don’t really have any other “close friends” besides them. I have many acquaintances and a few friends that have ended up moving to different states. I know I can potentially make new friends, but it’s just harder in your late 20’s.

I told her I did not see anything when he was with me, which is truth, be he told us all about the girls that he saw that night AND the night before.

My husband, 5 month old puppy, sweet old girl and I were on vacation (vacation for me, work for my husband). Out of nowhere, at 5am, she has a horrible seizure - we held her until it was over, lasted about a minute. After that she ate breakfast, went outside, played with the puppy, acted fairly normal, so we waited it out a bit... I thought I'd take her into a clinic that afternoon since she seemed alright. At 9am she had another one, way worse this time. I got to the vet about 15 minutes later. They tried to get the seizures to stop for hours, they literally used all the seizure medication they had. The next vet was over 30 minutes away. I was by myself, with both dogs, I was there for hours watching her go in and out of these seizures, sitting in the cage holding her and just sobbing. She started to howl, it felt like she was in pain... That's when I had to decide. We had done bloodwork initially, it didn't show anything that could be the source of the seizures, she didn't eat anything weird (I'm a complete helicopter dogmom, and she was never interested in eating weird things, she was very particular). They said my only other option was to make the drive and get a CT scan and go from there - this vet thought it must be a brain tumor, she had been on the phone with the other clinic, talking through all her symptoms and my options. My husband was giving a presentation at the time, I couldn't even get ahold of him for another couple of hours... So I was left to make this decision on my own...

Wtf.) and then I’ll be working towards getting my actual license. After that I plan to take online classes at whatever college I can apply to easily. I can’t socialize at all and no one like being around me, so it’s going to be difficult. Wtf do I do with my life.

Well, I played part of the first level on a demo, and it's a lot like GTA without as much violence. There's a ton of voice acted swearing. The first level in the game involves you, as a 16 year old girl, sneaking into a club underage, destroying someone's car to steal his money, buying drugs, drinking beer, and getting into fights with older men. She has no consequences and it's just made out to be how to have a good time. It's made to be realistic and not like an anime game.

366,"Hello lovely folks of reddit, 

Bit of a story but I feel a bit of perspective is in order.

I’m curious how you all have dealt with difficult colleagues. I work in a pretty average alcohol licensed venue that’s soon to become a much higher end establishment. 

I (22M) have two colleagues (late 28F, early 44F) whom have worked in the venue for over a year (me 6 months) who seem to constantly attempt to belittle, confuse and sabotage me. 

They are very cold, gossipy sort of individuals who would rather chat to each other than work. While they’re friendly to certain staff members, they are ice cold to me and one other staff member. 

I have done nothing against them until recently (reported behaviour and filed report) and have always been friendly and willing to chat, greeting them and showing genuine care about them and my colleagues. I thank them for their *corrections* and *criticism*.

I am highly competent in all areas of the business according all of my supervisors and management, however, they are constantly attempting to correct me on policies and procedures that I know by heart (I have quietly worked with management on quite a few). 

I have made sure never to do anything other than be friendly and thankful for their input and company but they attempt to fight me over everything from how to pour a beer (&gt;4 years experience) to cleaning a damn coffee machine (7 years and qualification) or how I look after the guests like offering basic services such as running beverages to a table when quiet.

There was an incident recently where one attempted to rile me up as soon as they walked in the door for shift changeover and even followed me outside after I finished. 

they (43F) took it upon themselves to read over a sensitive document (my timesheet)  and came outside to argue as to why I took a short break the previous shift with them  due to policy requiring two staff members and I came back in as the colleague knocked off. They did this while I was sitting with a supervisor who just arrived. 
The supervisor immediately contacted management on my behalf and gave a verbal warning to the staff member after following me to my car as I made it clear I wanted to amend the time sheet or let loose on the staff member.

Their issue was likely  that it’s law I get paid full hours if I don’t take half an hour and they took 45 minutes that night. 

*wonder why I couldn’t have a full break* -_- 


(Staff member doesn’t know I signed an agreement stating I will get docked a 30 min break regardless of actual break length which I agreed to wholeheartedly (preparing for supervisor position that hasn’t been mentioned to general staff yet). 

I discussed their general attitudes with management towards the business and myself which resulted in management outright saying it was clear they had a vendetta against me but they had no idea why. 

Management expressed they were over the moon with my work ethic and that all the other staff members “love” me. I was informed there would be a formal meeting between these two, myself and management and was made clear that the boss had my back. 

Management also made it clear that from what they had witnessed was  borderline harassment but not quite over the line.

Management also made it clear that when it comes down to it, they don’t want to lose me but will happily drop them if they have the proper reason to I.e harassment continues, they continue ducking around at work, etc. 

I have several shifts coming up where it’s only these two and I and I have no idea how to handle it, I can continue being timid and roll with the punches but so much of me wants to confront them and shut them down and all their bullshit.





For those who scrolled to the bottom of my rant,

Two colleagues are bitches to me and have no obvious reason to be, management has my back and wants them gone if possible, after months of ongoing harassment from them I am worried I may explode, there’s a meeting organised for them to explain themselves and their behaviour which management will prep me for.

Any advice would be absolutely superb. ",31Dec2018,1

368,"Using a throw away account here for anonymity. 

So I have been dating this guy for about 7 months now and he has been great. But we are sexually exclusive and have communicated that to each other clearly in the past. So 2 months ago, I got tested positive for an STD, which meant I got it from him, since I tested negative right at the beginning of our relationship. But we both got treated and after some talking, we concluded that he had it from his previous relationships and just didn't know it. He told me that he had only been having sex with me and he would never sleep with anyone else during our relationship. 

Anyways, we both got treated and that problem was over with. I truly went back to trusting him. Important thing to note: ever since I met him, I have been on birth control and we strictly DO NOT use condoms. 

So here's to spilling the tea: last night, while he was in the shower, I decided to snoop in his backpack to see if he had been using these new pair of headphones I had gifted to him for Christmas.( I know it was dumb but I was curious.) But in the process, I accidentally found some condoms in his backpack.

I am so overwhelmed with sadness and I am feeling devastated: I really did trust him and he lied to me. Not only that, he could be potentially sleeping with somebody who gave him that STD in the first place, again, which risks my health, as well. I really enjoy his company so it's really a bummer. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR = I accidentally found condoms in my BF's bag that he shouldn't have. How do I expose him?

I really do not want to have a sudden confrontation with him as it was also bit out of line for me to look in his bag in the first place. With this in mind, how do I set up a situation so that I can really expose him and have him explain for himself? ",31Dec2018,1
369,"Ok so there's this guy at my work who I really dig . I work with him all day everyday, more than I work with anyone else in  the company. we have and great working relationship and (this complicates things a bit) I find him attractive. 
    He has expressed to me that he also finds me attractive but does not date people he works with.   I have accepted this . This is fine. However I still think very highly of him. 
    The problem is once a week I work in another building with two guys that don't like him AT ALL. They make references about him having  substance abuse problems.  To be honest it's well within the realm of possibility that he does. I however am also someone who has also struggled with substance abuse so my feeling is that when a person has a problem,  a decent human being tries to help or at least doesn't add to the problem by tearing that person down. They make all kinds of other mean comments about other things they don't like about him also. 
       When these guys say these things I really want to lay  into them ,but a couple of things stop me. 

First of all they are not saying these things TO me I feel like if they said 'hey Mindy (not my name) don't you think Tim  (not his name) is a jerk'
' I would be well within my rights to say no Tim is someone who I like and respect and maybe you should shut up and do your job'  but since they are not,  I feel like it is improper to say anything. Especially when (reason 2) I do find him attractive but want to respect his stance on work relationships and I feel like If I just go off on these guys unbidden, right away they are gonna think  hey what's up with Mindy and Tim I bet they like each other. I don't want to make grief for Tim. 
 It really bothers me because there have been times when Tim has walked in on them saying these Nasty things about him and there I am not sticking up for him and I feel like crap.  So how should i deal with all of this?Is there anything I could or should be doing ?",31Dec2018,1

394," 

So, my family has been going through some major drama right now. This has been arguably the worst Christmas ever for me. Just a head's up, i live with my grandparent's, my dad and his sister. Now, my aunt is kind of a drug addict, she is always on pills and stealing from us to help her pill habit. We've tried to get her help, rehab, everything. But nothing ever works. She's 38, pays no rent, no bills and has no job. Not to mention, about 2 months ago, she overdosed and we had to carry her to the hospital.

Anyway, Christmas Eve, my grandfather had enough. She stole a jar of quarters (like, a big water jug half full of quarters). They argued and called each other names, and my grandfather hit her. He punched her right in the nose. I think he broke it. He went in her room and started screaming at her, he threatened to break her phone if she called the police. But anyway, she did call the police, we got back home and the cops were there. They arrested my grandfather and he had to spend Christmas morning in jail. But we bailed him out.

Long story short, even though she stole from him, he's still being charged with assault. Also, he isn't allowed to go back into the house, she filed an order of protection against him. He wants to kick her out, but she has tenant's right and can continue to live there until he files a formal evinction notice.

But the innocent victims, us, the cops also told us to stay out of the house for a few hours since she had been on a power trip. Anyway, we just lollygagged around town for a while. Until she texted us that she'd lock the door to the house. We got there and sure enough, the doors were locked. She had been harassing us through text messaging all day. We called the cops, but they never showed up. My dad, grandmother, and i all had to sleep in the truck. In the dead of winter. It was so cold.

Christmas morning was even worse. We got my grandfather out of jail and took him to a motel. We went back hom and tried knocking on the door again, but it was still locked. At this point, i had enough. I started banging on the door, i was telling her if she didn't unlock the door that i would break it down. She told me we couldn't be there, i tried begging because i had to take a shower and that it was so cold, she didn't listen. So, i threatened to kick her ass if she didn't let us in. My dad and i were arguing at the door with her. But, she eventually did.

And, about 20 minutes later, the police came. She told them that we couldn't be there. Yeah, Christmas morning, she called the cops on us. Anyway, they took our side. They told her she can't lock us out, that she just needs to keep away from us and not harass us. So, this has been a wonderful Christmas.

I hate being around her. i'll catch her pawing through my grandfather's medicine cabinet or searching the drawers for my dad's wallet.

Plus, one day, she went of one of her dope spells. In the middle of the night, she kept cutting on all the lights, left food on the stove and went to bed, and pawed through his medicine cabinet.

We've grown in size to include 10 or more people, and are consistently growing in size. We have a group chat where all of us talk on the daily, and this has also spawned a meme chat. We've been growing and including more and more people as we've gone on. However, we've only removed one person from the group- this is where the problem lies.

&amp;#x200B;

For reasons of convenience and privacy, I'm going to name our main subject Damien. Damien had known people through my friend group from before we all entered high school. In fact, he was one of the first people to enter the group. With this, however, came a weird round of restrictions. The guy didn't really allow cursing, and a lot of jokes and conversations went over his head. We were constantly catching him up on various conversations, and it was kinda taxing. Damien was an interesting person to be around, but I wouldn't know it well. I actually had gone to a different school than everyone else in the chat, so I hadn't known the guy at all. The school I'm going to is one that I had to apply to in order to get in. It's generally prestigious, but I'm not gonna end up on r/iamverysmart, so let's kill that thread now. This will be important later.

&amp;#x200B;

One day in the spring of 2018, there was a falling out between Damien and another member of the group. When I say falling out, I mean a SERIOUS falling out. Basically, Damien was arguing with one of the members of the group, and he took pictures with his current girlfriend. All I had known was there was something in the chat and then Damien left. The main reason that the two fell out is Damien's lack of apology for what he did, seeing how it seemed completely wrong to the friend but not to Damien. The word was spread, and he was gone. There wasn't much left. At least, not for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, I'll reiterate that I don't go to the school that the others and Damien go to. Everything is being told to me second-hand, and as such may have a bias. I've heard stories about him yelling at people in the group, going behind their backs and the like. However, what I know of is the repeated instances of trying to get back into the group. He asked me and multiple people in the group to be let back in. This was both over text and in person. Each time, the answer has been a no. I'll give a general detail of how I've handled it each time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 0: End of School Year 2018*

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, Damien was already out of the group, as mentioned above. He asked me if, during the summer, he could be added back into the group. He kinda backtracked and asked to be added back at a later time. I acknowledged the request, but never went either way. That was it- just kinda a precursor to everything.

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 1: Mid-September 2018*

&amp;#x200B;

Damien asked if he could be put back in the chat. I told him straight up that even though I was fine with it, some people were still hurt over what he did, so the answer was probably a no. Damien then stated that the mutual friend that he had initially had the issue with said it was okay for him to come back. After checking, I confirmed what he said that he would be thinking about it. That was logical to me, as the friend had yet to truly get over what Damien did, and it was a bit nicer than just saying ""No."" I told Damien that I would set up a poll to decide if he could come back, as I thought it would be the most diplomatic way to do it. I posted a poll in the main chat, and it went over as well for Damien as you could assume. He maybe got one or two yesses out of the 10 or 11 people. I told him that someone did say yes, but it wouldn't be possible for him to get enough votes to come back. He then said that everyone then hated him in the chat and, attempting to calm him down, I... lied about the percentages. I said there was about a 1:2 split for each option. This was not the right thing to do, and I understand it now. I was kinda panicking, so... cut me some slack. He then continued to badger me on what I meant by ""no"", and I said it meant more time. He ended with having me post a paragraph in the chat about After that, it calmed down on my end for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 2: December 2018*

&amp;#x200B;

Smash Ultimate was about to come out, and Damien asked to be let back in. I simply didn't reply, as I knew how the previous attempt went. Wasn't about to do it again. Maybe this wasn't the right choice, but here we are.

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 3: During Class 2018 (All Second-Hand)*

&amp;#x200B;

Damien had gone up to a person in the group during one of their classes together and asked them, through a note, if he could be let back in. The person wrote back no. Damien then asked why and repeatedly did so during the class, eventually flipping out on the person and yelling at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all the experiences I can remember off-hand. If I remember more, I'll add them.

&amp;#x200B;

We're nearing the end, I swear. In present-day, I still am debating whether or not to let him in. Now that we're nearly done, I'll state the more controversial stuff that might have altered your initial opinion. I needed to be honest, but I felt like the following two pieces of info may have altered your initial view.

&amp;#x200B;

One: Damien has autism. I want to say it straight up like that because jumping around the issue does not help my credibility at all. This may easily impact some of his judgments and actions. I would like to state again that I am not judging him or not including him for his autism- neither is anyone else to my knowledge. There can be a lack of social awareness that comes with autism, and there may be outbursts like mentioned in Time 3 above. However, I feel like he should not only be judged for this, as some examples are basic human understanding, and I would need something other than a basic idea of mental disorders from AP Psych to truly get this.

&amp;#x200B;

Two: Damien's mother can be extremely controlling and manipulative. I go to a different school, so I feel like getting involved as the mediator due to the least bias may be a good idea. However, Damien's mother, who I will call Karen, can be extremely harmful and damaging for other people. Karen has been known to easily get Damien into shows and acts that he wouldn't have gotten into otherwise simply because of the autism claim. For an example, Damien was denied from the choir group, but his mother used the school board to very quickly reverse that decision on the grounds of discrimination. With this said, I don't want to be persecuted and kicked out of my school because of my mediation. I don't want to be wrapped up in the argument of discrimination- however, I am probably the person most heavily without bias in the group due to my standings, and I'd rather not have someone else be punished because of me stepping down.

&amp;#x200B;

There was one talk I had with my friend from Time 3 where I should simply tell Damien, straight up, that he's probably burned too many bridges and is not getting back into the group next time he asks to be let back in. However, I feel like this would activate the Karen trap card, if you get what I'm saying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, thank you for reading this far down. I just want an opinion on my next step. Should I let him back in? Should I tell him straight up that the answer is no forever? I really need advice, as I know this will be a consistent issue. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: A guy is trying to get back into a group chat for a console, and a lot of people don't want him back. He keeps requesting to be let back in. What should I do?",31Dec2018,1

400,"So it's been quiet around the office, and I just got in today from having been out for several days during Christmas week.  I got back and my new coworker who's worked here for maybe a few weeks now took my company provided monitor that I had sitting on my desk (currently unused), and he's plugged it into his station.  Do I just let this go?  Confront him?  He never said a word or asked my permission about it.  I'm currently not using it but I don't think this behavior is okay.",31Dec2018,1
402,"(TL;DR at the bottom)

So it's not as bad as the title may sound. My girlfriend doesn't drink or smoke absurd amounts or even daily. the thing is, I have a little bit of a history with alcohol and prescription drugs (though nothing that strong), and when I was at a really low point, I tried to remedy it with them. Long story short I found out the hard way that they only dragged me down lower and made me want to end it all even more. I also saw several people In my life hurt or straight up ruined by things like smoking and drinking.

so now I'm more or less back at the point I was at before it. not good but not terrible. The difference is now I feel a pretty strong moral objection and genuine disgust towards drugs and alcohol.

My now girlfriend, who was one of my only friends during my low point and over the past year or 2, had started drinking and smoking around the same time I was trying to get out of it. the difference being she was introduced to and pressured into it by a couple of her ""friends"". Long story short, she they got her to drink and smoke with them while they hung out (luckily it never got further than that as far as I know) and she got sorta hooked. 

Shes been pretty depressed the last couple of years and her explanation for why she does it is that it's the only thing she's found that makes her stop feeling, and number her emotionally. Obviously this isn't too healthy, mentally, or physically.

She claims she's not addicted because she ""can go without"", and with drinking I do somewhat believe her. the last time she got drunk that I know of was at one of her friends parties like a month and a half ago. when it comes to smoking though, Its not so easy. 

she's tried to quit several times. and once she very seriously promised me she wouldn't smoke. I even got her to throw out the pack she had. basically, around a week later I find out that she relapsed, and apparently lied to me about throwing out all her cigs, as she left a fresh pack that she had hidden. her reasoning was ""well I'm not just gonna throw it out and waste it"" (cigarettes are pretty expensive where we live). But to me, just the fact that she kept it shows that she never actually intended to give it up.

any time I see her drink or smoke or remember it I get physically nauseous and irrationally angry. not sure at who but just mad. on top of that the whole hidden pack incident made me feel so betrayed and lied to, as she knows what a big deal this is to me.

I love her so much, and I want her to be as happy as possible, but seeing her like this just makes me so sick and disgusted. add to that the fact that she's so dependant she's willing to lie to my face for it.

we've had so many talks about this, and I've tried everything to make it better, for both of us from both sides. At this point I'm pretty sure I can't stop her no matter what I do. So a couple of questions:

1. am I in the wrong here? or just generally being a controlling, overbearing asshole?

2. does anyone else feel this way? as in getting sick and weirdly angry at even the memory of your loved ones doing or using something?

3. how do I adjust and learn to make peace with my girlfriend's drinking and smoking habits?

TL;DR: Girlfriend drinks and smokes. I have a past with and a hatred/disgust for people I care about using harmful drugs and alcohol. she can't/won't stop even though she's tried and I've strongly supported her and has lied to me to keep at it. nothing works to help her or fix anything. how do I accept and cope with her habits?",31Dec2018,1
403,"English is not my first language but I’ll try to explain this as best as I can.

My mom turned 50 yesterday and I’ve been noticing that her health has been deteriorating really fast. A few months ago she started misplacing things, having mood swings, a lot of trouble sleeping and forgetting stuff. Today she forgot her ID in a cab. She’s also been having stomach problems (most likely IBS) and is perimenopausal. 

My parents are Chinese immigrants who came to a country in Central America. They’ve been working 90 hours each week for over 25 years without taking days off so my brother and I could have an education. I just turned 19 and I’m starting college in a month.  

I’ve been helping my parents at work (small store, much like a 7/11 in the US. My mom and I work as cashiers and my dad stocks merchandise) since I was 13. I’d get off school and go straight to help them. But now since I’m going to college and it’s obviously going to take much more time and work, I won’t be able to help them as much as before. I’ve even considered forfeiting education so I can help them at work but I want to get an education. 

My brother (23) lives with us with his wife. He just had a baby and all the expenses were covered by my parents. His wife is taking care of the baby and won’t be working anytime soon (which is common in my culture). 

I just can’t help but feel pain each time I look at my parents because I feel like I’m betraying them by going to college and not finding a husband and settling down (which is what they want but they’re letting me choose my path in life).

Healthcare where I live is ‘free’ but it takes months or even a year to get a consultation. And we don’t have much money to afford going to a specialist to check up on my mom. 

I feel bad for not being able to help them, and if anything happens to my mom I’d blame myself. I love her too much and it breaks my heart every time I look into her eyes.

407,"I started working at a movie theater junior year of high school, and I’ve worked there for almost 2 years now, and I plan on continuing through college. I’m a 19 year old guy and I know every single position, how everything works, I even know the restaurant portion of our theater, which is where the best of the best go. I’m also really close with every manager, (most are early 20s or around my age) and I’d like to say Im a hard worker.

A few months ago, I talked to my boss about wanting to do more and become a manager to help. He’s a real hard ass, and not very likable, and This was my first time ever doing anything like this, so I was a little nervous and he definitely noticed. He said he never thought I’d ask that cuz he thought i haven’t been working hard lately, which absolutely shocked me. I politely told him I’d do better, and he said he’d work with me to help me get more responsibilities. This happened like once or twice, and when it did, I worked my tail off and did my very best work, but ever since I’ve gotten nothing from him.

A few weeks later, I got a position in the restaurant, (which is usually the next step to being promoted)  along with another girl. Now I’m no saint, I am late every once in a while, and I have my bad days, but this girl is late almost every day, sometimes 30 min to an hour, slacks off a lot, especially when no ones around, and even jokes about how she’s shocked she hasn’t been fired yet. 

Well this girl talked a lot to guy managers who often favored her and helped her get away with stuff, and apparently had been helping make her look really good to our boss. Just last week she got promoted to manager since the guy managers told our boss to choose her. My boss didn’t even talk to me or for all I know even consider me for this position despite me talking to him a while ago and working very hard.

I want to talk to my boss about all of this, but I don’t know what to say. I still really want to be a manager, its perfect money wise, location wise, and I have a ton of friends there, and I don’t want to find another job, but the pay isn’t the best without manager wages, and it feels impossible to be promoted at this rate.

What should I say? I don’t plan on throwing the girl under the bus or even mentioning her, I want to focus on my own position. I work Tuesday and I plan on saying something then, and I was hoping for some advice.

This happened about a month ago. I've been living with some old highschool friends back home since, but I'm not sure how much longer they will tolerate me.

My aunt is pretty rude to me. It feels bad to say it, but I don't like her and I can't really avoid her because I get lumped in with my aunt with the adults whenever we're together. 

I'm in my third year studying general biology and I'm in the process of setting up a research project, going through the literature, preparing to apply for a summer grant, etc. and it's so exciting to me because it's all new. My grandparents ask me a lot of questions about it, so I end up talking about it a lot. This is where the trouble begins with my aunt. This is a minor thing that pisses me off, but my project is about katydids. She says cicadas every single time and when I correct her, usually by saying something along the lines of ""They're katydids. Katydids and cicadas are totally different things,"" she either ignores it or does the dismissive ""Yeah, yeah. Katydids. Cicadas. Whatever"" sort of deal. The second thing she does is that she always has to point out she got a bachelor's degree and doesn't even use it because she works in a field totally unrelated to her degree, and that that happens to a lot of people. Which is a good thing to know and keep in mind I guess, but ""kindly"" reminding me of that nearly every time I'm talking about research or classes I'm liking or field trips I went on is pretty shitty. 

I've honestly told her to knock it off every polite way I can think of. I don't necessarily want to involve another relative to back me up and have a word with my aunt because I'm an adult and I feel I should be able to handle this on my own. 

But what should I do? Should I get an older relative involved, someone she'd maybe take more seriously or listen to? Should I stop being polite to her next time?

423,"I have this problem on and off. I’m quiet and reserved sometimes and then talkative other times. 

I tend to make comments on what’s happening on TV and make little jokes when watching with others because I like making people laugh or just giving my input. It’s my parents that verbalize how annoyed they are by this and it honestly puts my down because obviously no one wants to be annoying to others. They will get upset with me for talking when some important thing is said or is happening on TV and I feel so embarrassed and sad about it that I just leave the room and go by myself most times. They then ask why I’m upset all of a sudden and rub it in more by advising me not to talk so much when people are watching TV like I’m a three-year-old.

My mind is always going and I guess I use talking as an outlet at times to share my thoughts. Writing them down does nothing because I don’t get the satisfaction of sharing them with others. It’s just translating them into a written format.

My stories can be lengthy because I like to put in great detail. I’ll talk for hours on a topic of interest if someone lets me. The list goes on. 

Not a day goes by when I don’t piss off my parents for talking too much or out of place. I’m always throwing off their focus on something. 

Sometimes it makes me think something is wrong with me. But I literally can’t help it. When I’m in a really good mood, I talk a lot. And when I’m told to be quiet or that I’m annoying or talking incessantly, it just ruins my mood. No one likes to be THAT person that everyone is hoping eventually shuts up. 

As far as I know, my friends don’t mind it and quite often I make them laugh and enjoy their time with me. I know most people won’t tell others that they’re annoying or talkative though and just roll with it. Parents are more likely to just lay everything down on you...

I work full-time with not much vacation time so I can really only do one trip before moving and I won't really have time for an extended trip (about 4weeks) until the summer.  And then after that visit I probably wouldn't be back until the spring semester 2020.  

I have general elevated anxiety so I'm constantly worried that he's lost interest so then I seek affirmation.  He always replies very affectionately and supportively, but still I worry I'm going to push him away.  Really I just need tools/things for me to remember when we're having our conversations.  Most of my stress occurs when we're texting, phone calls have been fine (something about hearing his voice?).  We love each other very much and really want to see where this goes 👨‍❤️‍👨.",31Dec2018,1

I am very timid and hate confrontation otherwise I would not be asking… 

Little bit of a back story.

I work in an office where we had three office staff (technically 2 since payroll/ accounts receivable doesn’t do any of the task we do).. anyhow, my co-worker decided to go elsewhere in the beginning of October. Prior to her departure (maybe two weeks prior) I had my annual review and received an additional PTO week. My boss (we’ll call Chad) told me not to tell any other employee because he thought I was doing a fantastic job… Well once he learned my coworker was leaving he sat me down to let me know that he was unsure if he was going to refill her position and asked if I could do both rolls and get a pay increase after a month to see if I could handle the work load and if I couldn’t he would hire help…fast forward three months and Chad had to step away from the manager position and go to another company because he couldn’t run this company left his wife in charge. I have spent the last three months trying to train her but she doesn’t really do much help.. It has been over three months since my coworker has left and my work load has increased 10x fold. I have attempted to talk to Chads wife who changed things for a week and it went back to me doing everything…  About two weeks ago she sent out a mass email saying that our vacation time was going to change and that every employee had two PTO weeks. I did not sign the form and have not had the opportunity to bring up my concerns until this afternoon. I am not sure how to talk to her because I am a giant pussy. This pussy is tired though. I need this conversation and would appreciate if someone could give me some advice on how to bring it up to her. There’s several issues I need to address.. Should I write them down on a piece of paper or will that be too much. I am 23 y/o and want to be taken serious.. please help

427,"Where to begin... i mean, honestly? I’ll do a quick TLDR summary here first: i was suspected of being bipolar back in 2014, had a “manic break” in December 2015 and was hospitalized, then hospitalized again in late January 2016 though that was just drug related (hadn’t slept in 72 hours + lots of Xanax through my nose hole + DXM + weed + alcohol + Percocet). Since then, I’ve been relatively clean- I’ve had some slip ups, but they’ve been one offs aside from weed, which I’ve come to learn that edibles are better for my anxiety. 

So why do i think I’m not bipolar? Because I’ve never been honest with any of the six therapist or five psychiatrists I’ve seen. The “manic break?” I just drove around the southeastern United States for three weeks doing drugs in my car and drinking because of a breakup. To be honest, i wasn’t sad about the breakup, i was anxious she might tell people about a “nightmare” i had (i talk in my sleep) that led to the breakup. I screamed “I’m trans I’m trans” and thrashed about. She broke up with me, told a few people about some private things, and i wanted to get out of dodge so to speak. It wasn’t all that irrational and i wasn’t doing anything too crazy for me personally- disappearing off the grid was a common thing because i have so much anxiety.

The truth is, at three years old i begged my sister to “make me into a real girl, because i wanted to be a girl.” I like girly things, i also like sports. 

I remember going to this counselor at my first elementary school, who mentioned “being a girl.” It’s very vague, but i remember he said i could be, but later that day my parents told me “you can’t be a girl and play football.” The sadness dripping in my dads voice, i chose football and that was the last we ever spoke of it.

And i liked being good at football because people were proud of me, but i didn’t like it. In truth i didn’t enjoy any of the sports i played. 

Anyways, the desire to be feminine never stopped. Before rec football practices and games, i would sit in my room and put heels on to compliment my football uniform- i can walk in them all. And this was way before any sexual desires, which I’ll get to. I cross dressed any chance i got as a kid, i never knew it was so... looked down upon but i knew not to tell my parents. For instance, to feel like a girl i would wear an old bikini top to bed at age 7 or so for a few years.

So, this is where things get... complicated to say the least. I was maybe 12 or 13, and i had started to understand this side of me wasn’t going to go away. So, with a computer in my room, i looked up “girl trapped in boys body,” because that’s the only thing i could describe it as. Well, i stumbled onto... some erotica? And it was forced feminization/sissy porn. So, i fell down that rabbit hole- it gave me an outlet to be girly within my reality, a reality I’ll get to in a minute.

So, not only am i dealing with the “am i really bipolar or am i trans?” But also, “am i really trans or just have a fetish?”

So, i tested it out yesterday. I got dressed a little bit- leggings, heels, bra, and went to turn a book in. Lo and behold it wasn’t a sexual thing, i just really liked the way i felt and looked. 

And i do wish i had a vagina. I wish i had boobs. I struggle to perform in the bedroom with women (who I’m attracted to) because i genuinely just don’t like a) my dick and b) having a dick. When my girl plays with my nipples, i feel like I’m a girl for a second.

So what the fuck am i? Like honestly. Am i a bipolar fuck up with a porn addiction? Or am i trans? And if I’m trans, then what’s the fucking point. My family won’t accept me, i have no friends, i haven’t graduated college yet and i have no career outlook because I’ve been depressed about this fact. I have a ton of anxiety if anyone knowing I’m trans or a cross dresser or whatever the fuck i am, and i just don’t know what to do. I’m freaking the fuck out and need some help.",31Dec2018,1
428,"Like the title says, my dad passed away on Christmas. He was diagnosed with ALS in 2013 and given five years, so I was already kind of prepared that he could decline at anytime. 

Overall, we had a really good relationship. We didn't see each other often but talked on the phone every couple weeks and spent time together on holidays. I received a phonecall a couple weeks ago that he wasn't doing well and it was getting close so I flew home. About a week later, he passed. After the visitation and the service, I flew back. I gave myself a day to decompress and let everything sink in, but I still don't feel like I thought I would. I feel guilty because he's my dad, I love him, so I feel like I should be sad. I feel guilty because I'm just a bit relieved he's not in pain. 

Other than that, I just kind of feel normal? Like it's just another day. Is that part of the grieving process? Am I looking into it too much? Any advice or anything is appreciated.",31Dec2018,1

The thing is, he has an attendance policy so each class you miss, he deducts 50 points. So I missed 3 classes, which brought my grade down to a D. Is there any way I can fight this? Why should it matter that I missed my class when I am the one that pays for it. Clearly missing class did not have an effect on my grade because before he deducted my grade, I had a B.

He told me that all I eat is junk even though we eat the same exact things. I also love doing makeup. When I was a lot younger and just starting to try out makeup i asked him what he thought and he said I looked like a streetwalker. I cried so hard. I was only 13 yrs old. And that was 4 yrs ago. Ever since, I've been scared for him to see it. I come home and i run straight to the bathroom to wash my face. He told me I look like I'm trying to sell my sex. I'm only 16. I'm not trying to attract anybody, wearing makeup makes me feel confident and I know this sounds cringy, but different than other people. I wear colorful eyeshadow and dark lipstick. I get weird looks all the time, but it sucks that even when I come home I can't be myself.

433,"me and my ex met and got together almost two years ago. he was wonderful, and he hasn’t changed. he’s one of the nicest people ever, he’s handsome, he’s loyal and he’s like me in a lot of ways, but we differ enough for me to be able to learn a lot from him. i, on the other hand, was not wonderful. we got together a few months after i’d escaped a situation where i was being abused and blackmailed, and i thought i could deal with it on my own without telling him (spoiler: i couldn’t). i was dealing with undiagnosed autism, and what my doctors later decided could possibly be bipolar; i was not mentally stable throughout our relationship, and it showed. our relationship ended for the first time after i had a breakdown over his work schedule meaning he couldn’t talk to me for weeks on end. we tried again and it was good, but we ended organically (on good terms) and stopped talking. i loved him so much. i still do. i’ve been going to therapy for the past two years, and over the past year i’ve made so much progress it’s unreal. i did my ex very wrong - he was the most perfect person i’ve ever met, and i was a complete mess who used him as a crutch to support myself when i was at my lowest. i loved him but was incapable of treating him right, and i wish i could change that. i haven’t been able to stop thinking about him recently. i bought tickets to see a band from his town and it made something click in my mind. this morning he turned up in my instagram recommended section, and i just felt a compulsion to speak to him. i want to tell him that i’m sorry, and that i want to be friends so that i can show him that i really did love him, and so that i can support him the way he supported me. it’s been a year since we last spoke, but it’s time i faced the facts and admitted that i wasn’t a good partner. admittedly, maybe it’d be best if i left things alone, but i want to make an active effort to have him in my life because he was one of the greatest things to ever happen to me and i fucked it up. should i text him?",31Dec2018,1
434,"This is a throwaway and I’m on mobile so sorry about formatting. 

So about a year ago I got to know this girl through mutual friends. She has one of the best personalities I’ve ever met and I quickly really started to like her. I’m not typically attracted to bigger women and she was overweight but had a gorgeous face and honestly carried her weight pretty well (amazing curves). I learned from our friends that she’s actually pretty active and hikes and does other outdoorsy things which I’m super into as well so eventually I asked her out. We went out for drinks which turned into dinner and had a pretty great date. A couple days later I was telling one of my friends about her and he asked to see a pic so I pulled up her Facebook. I could tell by the grimace on his face he didn’t think she was attractive and all he said was “dude she’s fat.” I guess I just got embarrassed and when she texted me to see if I wanted to go out again I turned her down. Flash forward to a few days ago when I saw her leaving the gym I just signed up at and she looks like a freaking model. She didn’t notice me but I couldn’t take my eyes off her. She’s lost all the weight but somehow magically kept her amazing curves and looks as beautiful as ever. I feel guilty knowing I ended things just because my friend didn’t approve but I really want to reach out again. I’m also well aware I’m coming off as a total d-bag, but should I try to reconnect with her? 

TL;DR I ended things with a girl before they could even get started for shallow reasons and am wondering if I should ask for another chance.",31Dec2018,1
435,"So yeah, 18. The day of was kinda weird. I wasn't really happy to be turning 18, more... Depressed.

When I turned 18, I realized something: I was becoming an adult, but I've never kissed a girl, never been in a relationship, never had sex, never done anything.

It's certainly not for lack of trying. I don't go after every girl I see, but when I do ask a girl out, it's always rejection. So naturally, I don't ask girls out much anymore. Then, there's the issue with how I feel attraction. I don't really feel attracted to anyone until I'm their friend. The problem is, Im bad at making friends, and the people I like to be friends with aren't the kind that like, go out and make friends. Not that it matters, though, as chances are I'll just get rejected again.

Now, I wanna state that I'm not a ""Nice Guy."" I don't blame girls for not being into me, it's not their fault. Some people just aren't meant for each other. But that doesn't mean it hurts any less when all your friends hadpp their first kiss already at 14 or 15, had a boyfriend/girlfriend, or are in a relationship right now. Just makes you feel like you're wrong, like there's something wrong with you. Like, if everyone else is able to find that one, why can't I? I don't think I'm the most attractive, either. I'm tall, but really skinny, with red hair, the latter of which I despise.

So yeah, 18. With a new years, to top. I'd make my resolution to try and find someone again, but it'd only end in disappointment again. I should be used to it by now ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",31Dec2018,1
436,"To clarify, I’m a server/bartender at a senior ‘independent’ living home. My manager just quit so my supervisor is attempting to take on his roll. Because that manager is gone, my supervisor is clearly taking advantage of that and not giving any fucks, she just LOVES her favorites and her ‘friends’ are getting the perks while just her employees are ignored. The ‘friends’ are the lazy, always reported, always calling out ones while the ‘just her employees’ are the ones who are complimented all the time, do doubles, show up early, etc. Yet, we’re the ones getting fucked over. Sometimes this place makes you want to just walk out the doors and never come back, sometimes because of the residents or sometimes because of your lazy and rude co-workers.

So, that kid ended up doing what they wanted and then they’d be nice to her again.” I only ever get along with 3 other co-workers, the ones who get screwed over like me. I realize this but like I said, I HATE confrontation and will never say anything, I never have in my 23 years of life (almost 24).

445,"I have terrible anxiety and I need advice on how to lessen it, I’m sorry if I’m all over the place but I’m so tired and I’m just trying my best..

It all started in middle school, I was the kind of kid who caught every single cold and virus possible, and of course it caused me to miss class, if I remember well around an average of 10-15ish days per month. At some point it became more anxiety based because I was missing so much, I had to catch up on everything 10x faster. Before my summer break, me and my parents decided that I should try distance schooling! And boy I was so excited!!We thought everything was gonna be perfect, but heck we were wrong. Around the end of my break, I experienced my first and worst panic attack, and I know this sounds so stupid and weak, I know it is, when it happened I didn’t know it was a panic attack. I thought I was dying or having a heart attack (keep in mind, I’m only fifteen), I was shaking like crazy, hyperventilating, my heart beating at extreme speed, i called 911, and they came and took me in, at that point no one knew what was up or what was wrong with me. They did so many xrays, blood tests, pee tests, even an ultrasound of my throat, almost everything possible in a timeline of like 10 hours because emergency room was so slow. They found nothing wrong with me. 

It seems I have developed this thing where I am sure that there is something wrong with me, like a illness or disease, I do not wish to self diagnose myself, but whenever my heart beats super fast because of anxiety, I immediately think, “oh, heart attack” “oh, heart disease” or when I feel especially crappy because of anxiety, I always find something to self diagnose my self with, when there is absolutely nothing wrong for sure. This has been going on since July 2018 and it is now December 31st 2018, of course I have improved, I’m not as panicky and I’m not constantly doing this to myself, but this is hurting me so much and my mom as well, it makes me cry so much, I haven’t been able to work on anything for distance school, and I’m afraid I’ll drop out and that I’ll have to retake a year and what will everyone think and I am so scared and tired at times. Sometimes I straight up wanna disappear, but I know that wouldn’t help at all and it would just make things worse. 

I do not take anti anxiety meds or anti depressants, I am scared of taking them and becoming addicted or not being myself, my parents dont want me to take them, only if things get really bad. I don’t have a therapist because because it costs so much, and I don’t go to free youth counselling because it’s by my old school and I’m scared of what everyone will think, and I’m really nervous talking to new people; especially about personal things like this. 

I am so tired and numb, My parents are so supportive and helpful but I can sense that my parents are getting hurt because of me and that they are becoming tired too, especially my mom. I have also developed a sort of separation anxiety, my mom was at work when this all happened, and now I get very anxious and sick if she is not home for a long time, this causes her to come home early and miss days at work, I hate that because me she has to risk her job, I hate that this happened, I am so tired, please give me advice... should I go to counselling? What about school?? It’s not always so bad, only at night and when my moms not home.

452,"Hi, 19year old male from The Netherlands Will be out on the street this month or the next. Never finished high school. This is the second time my folks make me go to a ""Grown up"" school (don't know how it's called in english lol)  to get a high school degree starting in september. And it's the second time i drop out after the second week i still haven't told them i am very small posture i always feel like i'm getting targeted/ bullied and i'm too proud to let IT get to the point where they actually start to make fun of me.

 I'm sure they will find out any time soon. 

Can't get myself to get a job because i did a interim job and i felt like i was a kid there IT was the most awful experience of my life. I dont know if there is something wrong with me or just dont have the motivation... I feel awful about the Hurt i inflict on the people around me no one knows i quit school. I have nobody as Friends or anything either i really need advice as i dont know what to do with my life at this point",31Dec2018,1
453,"my husband doesn’t have a very good relationship with his mother, and neither do i. recently after a lot of drama i really don’t care to dive into with his mother and sister, he and I agreed to cut them out of our lives and we’re assuming they’ve done the same. 

however, his sister sent us a bunch of really expensive gifts for our daughter, after we’ve expressed to her that we truly don’t want anything to do with her anymore. 

i honestly don’t know what to do with them. my husband thinks we should burn them, which i think is insanely stupid. his father thinks we should re-gift them to our daughter for her birthday but tell her the gifts are from us, but i personally feel like i should send them back to her. 

i don’t want to pretend i bought these or throw them away i genuinely want her to be able to return them to get her money back. are all of us bad people? should we just give the presents to my daughter?

454,"Okay so first of all, you can meet me, I’ll go by D, 16. My best friend, is L, 17. Her former best friend is M, 16. And the boyfriend is N, 17. We are juniors in high school, N is a senior. 

A little back story, Less than a month ago I found out my ex boyfriend of a year+ was cheating on me/attempting to cheat on me. I think I’ll make a post about that because it’s driving me mental, but so is this. I know what its like to feel so helpless knowing people knew and didn’t tell me. 

M and I didn’t get along from kindergarten to 10th grade but we talk now. She has been with N since September 2017, and he has never told her the truth about anything. He’s been smoking weed, juuling, and not telling her the entire time. But now it’s gotten out of hand. L and M have been BEST friends since 2016 after they reconnected and they have a rocky relationship. Just a few weeks ago the events between L and N have starting taking place. He took her virginity just 2 weeks ago, after taking M’s in July. 

Throughout the relationship of M and L, M was suspicious of N and L. They were best friends too and rumors went around that they were up to something. One night they cuddled for a while at someone’s house and she never spoke of it to M. And another time N grabbed L’s hand when he was sleeping, and M slapped L straight across the face. 

On top of all this he’s also been getting involved with another girl straight after being with L. L is quite mad about that but honestly I don’t know why she’s so upset because she is the “other woman” herself and he has no obligation to her, unlike M. 

L and I have been best friends since kindergarten and I don’t want to break her trust, but I feel absolutely DISTRAUGHT over this. It’s not my place but I know I would have been so grateful if someone, anyone, told me what was going on throughout my relationship. 

N is not remorseful at all and has NO intentions of stopping, in fact he’s on the hunt for more girls. 

And the worst part is M wholeheartedly believes her relationship is better than ever, when in fact, it’s the worst it’s ever been. I don’t want her to feel the unnecessary pain of knowing she was with a liar for months more than she had to be. I believe she should know now, except I don’t know how to tell her. I know I can’t be the one to tell her because of my friendship with L, she means a lot to me and has been there for me throughout my own breakup. She has no intentions of stopping either though, she loves danger and cares little about herself. 

I don’t know what to do, guys. I don’t want to do nothing. M deserves to know, she needs to know. ",31Dec2018,1

456,"Like a lot of people I (24M) get very depressed and lonely in the wintertime due to seasonal affectiveness. Typically I shake the blues by spending more time with friends and making social plans (eg movie nights or board games) with them

However, due to some kind of insane coincidence, my friends are all unable to do social things this winter. One is in hospital far away, the other has had a second kid and works a ton of overtime and the third is not leaving the house or answering his messages because he's entered a new online relationship.

This means I've been alone for the winter and will continue to be - a problem that's been exacerbated by an illness that confined me indoors for about a week recently. In a small town as a teetotaller meeting new people in real life isn't very doable and yet I know I'll need to do something because I'm already pretty bummed out. I do have my SO but we've been together a long time and it's friend type of connection I'm not having, which is different from a spouse one. She has many friends at work and often works with ten or more people. I work without co-workers or social interaction for the most part.

Things I've tried:

4chan - used to go there often when lonely back in my early and mid teens. Incels have ruined it

r/Casualconversation - SO frequents this board and would notice my posts. She's good to me and I know she'd take it as a personal failure that I'm unhappy

Omegle - horny teens only, it seems

Talking to my cat - he does not respond. Senses I'm in a bad state and tries to cheer me up though; this helps

Conversing with a trainee - we're training a teenage girl at my work, so for two hours a week I teach her. She's social and enjoys my company and humor, sometimes staying late to keep up a conversation. This helps but I have little in common with her and feel uncomfortable having genuine conversation with someone eight years younger than me. She's attempted to initiate a text conversation which would be nice but again, I am a grown man and she is a child, it feels weird to exchange more than a basic level of interaction. 

Lately I've found things that normally engage and entertain me do nothing and it's becoming more difficult to break the pattern of depression. Am unsure if I would even follow through if I did make a pen pal or something but I miss being happy so I'm asking people here what works for them",31Dec2018,1

Today she has been emailing me about how I never paid at the front desk, so she got charged with $400. She is now threatening to have a ""private investigator"" come to my workplace along with taking it to court. I told her I'm going to have the police involved if she keeps messaging me about this.

461,"So, let me preface this by saying that I don't think that I'm spoiled, rather I've just been really sheltered and inexperienced (I'm 19). Or y'all can just read this and decide for yourself.

So my childhood was okay, I guess. I grew up in an upper-middle class family initially, and then now we're middle-middle class I guess. We were never super rich but we were never poor, and we don't owe any debt or anything (I think).

Overall, I was encouraged to focus a lot on school/academically, and was pushed to get all A's in K-12. I got a few B's in 9th grade because I was unused to the grading system/didn't practice enough, and my parents were so mad.

As for the typical extracurriculars kids did growing up, I was encouraged to do them only if I were good at them, to help me get into college and stuff. I didn't really do sports, mostly just trivia-like academic competitions and piano.

I was never allowed to party or date or do anything ""crazy"" that high schoolers usually do.

Anyways, fast forward to age 18, I got accepted to UC Berkeley and was initially premed/biology. I finished the first year with a 3.66 after taking general chemistry, organic chemistry, sociology, and two semesters of math--calculus and statistics, and it was a tough experience academically and just in terms of life.

I think after the first year of college was when I started to apply for jobs and the whole resume/interview/finances thing was just a really new experience for me.

I think i just started to realize that like money isn't easily earned, that job hunting is hard, and that like if you aren't resourceful/hardworking/don't choose the right major, you'll be homeless and/or poor because you'll have a low-paying job.

Like even though my parents weren't always nice, put a lot of pressure on me to succeed academically, and we aren't close at all, I gotta give them credit for sustaining me for 18 years because all that shit--paying bills, keeping a job, dealing with your own shit as parents because you can't depend on your kids for emotional support (or shouldn't), is hard.

Also, to talk a bit more about work for what you want, I've recently been applying to summer programs in medicine, and while I'm fine writing my own essays, tweaking my own resume and interviewing myself if it gets to that stage, most require 2 prof LOR's, and yes, I know it's the holidays, but it's literally been like pulling teeth trying to get a letter. Kinda the whole thing about working for what you want/nothing falls in your lap now.

I guess what I'm saying is that I miss being younger and having less responsibilities, even though my childhood wasn't entirely stress-free (always the pressure of doing well academically and in activities), and I don't think I'll ever get used to this whole adulting thing. Like life will never be as easy as when you were 0-18, that kind of thing and I guess I feel too young/naive/inexperienced for all this even though I'm legally an adult.",31Dec2018,1

464,"Me (25f) and my boyfriend (25m) made plans with our group of friends in August to go to New Orleans for New Years Eve. The group is 3 couples excluding ourselves. We booked flight tickets and had someone in the group find an AirBnb for us to stay. Our friends know that we make the least amount of money in the group. My bf is still in grad school and I recently got a new job. The air b&amp;b cost us 432 each making that almost 864 for the two of us. We just recently found the money to pay for our share of the house just two weeks before the trip.

My grandmother (97f) was hospitalized two weeks ago with difficulty breathing and pneumonia. She had to stay on a breathing machine called a BIPAP to clean the carbon dioxide out of her lungs. With her condition worsening by day, I have to stay home, call out of work, and cancel the NYE plans a week before the trip. I spent Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the following couple of days in the hospital with her and my family.

My boyfriend and brother (29m) were trying to figure out what to do about the trip. We managed to cancel our flights for flight credit but our bigger concern was the AirBNB. We told them about the situation as it was developing, made them aware that we won’t be coming, and told them that we would appreciate if we got our share of the trip contribution back. They responded offering only half of the money back. We understand that this situation is short notice but we don’t understand why they are being unwilling to pay the share. ",31Dec2018,1

My dad’s an alcoholic and when I was a child he would often call me an embarrassment and lash out at me whenever he could. I felt like I was a disappointment by default and I had to work to get him to like me. I played basketball at a high level all through high school. I had many shitty coaches ruin it for me so I didn’t play college. I had no motivation at that point. Now I’m in college and feel like a loser. Basketball was the only pride I had. I have such a disconnect with my parents. I’ve had anxiety rooting from issues from my dad my whole life so it was hard making friends.

Wouldn't even share a rent's pay. One time they slept on the couch at my grandma's and every   night they'll have loud sex. Bras and underwear just lying around the house. She found some pills and condom just out in the open. My grandma had been complaining to my mom (she's very old school so this was very shocking to her but she's still nice) Now, mom don't know what to do and have been sick and depressed for a long time and fed up with my brother's constant disappointments.

470,"So a couple of months ago, I started to realize that my best friend was horribly mistreating me. Without getting into detail, they would pressure me into performing illicit (nonsexual) favors, and when I wouldn't comply I got the ""you're a bad friend talk"". In an attempt to salvage our friendship of two and a half years, after they told me I was using them, I felt I had to bend over backwards and do everything they asked, otherwise I would be a bad friend. 

It got to the point where I was working on an important project, and they decided that was the time to force favors on me. But they stopped being favors by this point, and more so demands laced with guilt trips. When I finally couldn't handle being bossed around and micromanaged, I finally stood up for myself. 

I wasnt mean about it. When people screw with me, I'm very aggressive and confrontational. but I held back with this person, because I really cared about them. I told them that I would never, and had never, treated them the way they speak to me, and that I was busy and had a deadline to meet. They reacted very poorly, and proceeded to attack me about various things including my family and myself. Then they ghosted me, and since have told my friends I used them. My friends know what happened, and they took my side on it, obviously, and say this person is depressed and on some power trip. 

Since being away from this person, my quality of life has actually never been better. I have more time to focus on my studies, and worry less about structuring my day around someone else's needs. Despite never wanting to see or speak to this person again, I'm still so angry, and cannot get them entirely out of my head. I want to let go, move on. I guess what I'm asking is, how do you completely drop and forget about someone who is entirely not worth your time? I know I'm better off, but I'm still angry.

473,"Last year, a really good friend of mine named Paul that I knew for 10 years committed suicide on the 26th of December of 2017. This has made me feel very insecure and almost depressed. He lived 40+ minutes away from me. But the thing is he told me that we will go to Arizona to check out a school there. And we were supposed to hang out on Thursday the 28th. But I have no idea what caused him to take his life. I got the call from his aunt at 11pm on that Tuesday as I was going to bed that he is in the hospital. And my mom came in my room later and told me that his mom told her that he hung himself. I did not talk to face to face or see him that day. But earlier that day he uploaded a Snapchat video of him watching Lord of The Rings on a Macbook Pro with an E-Cigarette in his hand aka a Juul. And the regret I already have is why did I not go to his house that day? That's what is bothering me about my friends death the most. Is that I wish I asked him if he wants to hang out with me on that day. But I had no idea that he was gonna do this because there were no warning signs or I did not get any feelings that he was gonna do this. But he smoked weed alot and I heard later that he took XANAX(anti-anxiety pill) and mixed it with weed and painkillers and meth(my mom told me my friend had a cocktail of drugs in his system). But I am not sure if that was the cause of his death. I asked my Parents and Friends about why do I have such a regret of not reaching out to my friend that day because I wish I reached out to him and ask ""Hey wanna hang out and skate?"" or something? But they keep telling me to not have such regrets and there was no way that I was going to prevent my friends suicide. Why do I keep feeling guilty? I miss my friend. And I wish he was still here physically. But I heard he had depression and he never told me that he actually had depression. I miss my friend and I want him to be physically here again. What do I do? On the Monday(1 day earlier) that I saw him he was completely normal I did not notice anything strange in him his suicide just completely caught me by surprise. The 25th of December of 2017 is the last time I saw my friend. The thing I am trying to figure out is why he would do such a thing and not think about his friends? Cause I miss my friend so much. I wish I talked to him on the day he killed himself but then again I had no idea that he had major depression or was planning suicide that day. But still I can only imagine if he would've been alive if I asked him on text if he wants to hang out. My friends suicide has been tormenting me and I keep asking myself why did he take his own life? I really wish I called him up but my other friend tried to call him but he did not respond to his phone call on the day he killed himself. I have been struggling to focus in class. I keep thinking about him day and night 24/7. The thing I miss the most is hanging out with him and skating. I wish I attempted to call him up that day and it's haunting me. I've been struggling to have a piece of mind because of this. Please help. Any useful advice? I miss my friend. His decision to end his life just completely sent shockwaves through my body. And lately I've just been trapped in this constant loop of why did I not drive to his house that day? The thing is on Snapchat that day me and my friends (including the one who ended his life later that day). We wanted to go go-karting but then one of my other friends said that they were busy. But I said that I am free and my friend(who ended his life later that day). Then said ""If we can't hang out today then let's hang out on thursday."" and I said ok. I thought to myself, ok, we'll see each other on Thursday and then I went to go workout at the beach. But then that phone call came at 11pm and it still haunts me to this day. But the autopsy shows that my friend like how I said before had (XANAX, Painkillers, heavy doses of Weed, and Crystal Meth in his system). I am not sure if that caused a negative reaction and caused him to have negative thoughts and then end his own life. But going back. I wish I would've driven down to his house and hung out with him maybe he would still be alive today I am not sure. I am not a fortune teller. But my friend who ended his life also told me like 4 weeks ago that there are days where he just wants to be by himself. I did not see any warning signs or red flags that this was going to happen. I wish I could talk to him face to face if I only knew he would do something like this. I feel lost and hopeless in my life without my friend. UPDATE 9 MONTHS LATER: I still can't get over this. This continues to haunt me everyday school, at home, and honestly the crappy part about this is that I have to live with this forever until the day that I die. I am having trouble focusing on school assignments because I trusted my friend. We knew each other so well that I did not think that something like this would cross his mind. I feel depressed and hopeless I don't know where I will see myself in life in 5 years. Weekends are not the same for me anymore. My friend lived in a nice place by the beach and he had a motorcycle. Last year things were better compared to now. I hate dealing with this type of mental torture. I sometimes wish I was dead too. I am at cross roads in my life right now. People just don't understand the mental and torturous pain of waking up only to know that your friend isn't here. I still can't accept the fact that he did something like this. The thing that is helping me get through this is YouTube, Twitch, and my other close friends. But I really miss my other friend Paul. People just don't realize how much emotional pain I am in right now. Not gonna lie I've been lately having a more negative view on life because this continues to haunt me it's psychological torture for me. It is a vicious cycle of feeling regret and thinking what warning signs did I miss? For example we had a bonfire and I noticed that my friend was saying some weird stuff about how he is gonna be homeless and he refused to go into further detail he just stared at the fire with his hands in his pockets. And I wish I would've told his aunt about this. But I wasn't alarmed until after I got that phone call that he is in the hospital. I miss my friend and I wish he was here. I am struggling to find peace and accept this whole situation. I got into procrastinating on my school assignments because I can't stop thinking about my friend Paul. However prior to his death a few months before he told me how suicidal thoughts were crossing his mind but he made me promise to not tell anyone and (I tried to talk him out of it by telling him that we all are here to support each other and my life without him would be miserable) but I still kind of regret not telling his aunt and informing his family about how he was acting weird at the bonfire because he also said that he was gonna be homeless and it's been bothering me for a long time? I kind of feel guilty after all of this. In the 2013 he told me that he once had suicidal thoughts after being bullied in school but he told me he did not go with it. I wish he would've thought about the pain he would be leaving me with.

475,"I'm in a bit of a situation, normally I'd never post something like this online but I've nowhere else to turn. I'd like people's advice although I am almost certain that the only solution is taking charge and acting on my own when I can afford to. Never the less, I am not doing great financially, entry level jobs having extremely high turnover usually for reasons out of my control (and quite BS ones at that) and rent/bills ruining what little I make from them, no jobs in my career where I live either, every offer I get in my field is always a state or several away. However I rent a place where family (not parents) live. Recently I've been trying to save up and finally move out at the ripe age of 23. However every time I mention leaving to live on my own or with a friend it infuriates my family who start shouting and screaming about how I cannot make it on my own and never will be able to as I am ""too sheltered"". They also tend to say things like ""no job is good for you, you're like a lost cause!"" every time I leave one mc donalds for a burgerking or one retail place for another, or get fired for something out of my control (several times due to coming down ill at places with extremely strict illness policies). Despite this I've made a decent amount of money off remote work for IT and have worked with a lot of professionals in my field on personal projects, so I know I'm not even remotely as incompetent as my family is constantly saying I am, despite firsthand witnessing my own technical prowess. This might sound a bit ranty, but the short of it is that my family refuses to let me out on my own, does not think my career (IT, tech, computers) is a real career, they believe I am incompetent and unqualified and often threatens to never speak to me again or attempt to guilt trip me in order to keep me from leaving. Right now poor income from crap jobs with high turnover however is also stopping me from moving. Regardless I am saving what I can, I have attempted to talk for years now with my family about these topics but their opinions are unchanged even when they see proof firsthand, for example with entry level jobs ending poorly: (me being fired for getting deathly ill, me being blackmailed into firing myself to save my manager the time and effort to get me back into the system) or my skills and education constantly being called incompetent: (repairing their own electronics in front of them, repairing my own equipment, programming practice, using my spare time for studying my profession, etc.). Don't get me wrong I'm not a stick in the mud, I like gaming and nerd shit as much as the next guy which wouldn't surprise me if part of that was why they think of me as still a kid. And no the family is not abusive, stubborn, ignorant and maybe a little dumb, but not abusive. Still any input on the situation or alternate ways to go about things would be a huge help. I'm desperate at this point it feels like my prime years of youth are being wasted away for shit pay with the same restrictions placed on me as when I was a kid(more literally at least) simply because I'm under someone else's roof unable to do virtually anything including drive myself very far despite my own license.",31Dec2018,1
476,I made a post and in the first two hours it got over 150 upvotes so I continued a series but it failed. I figured I just wasn’t intriguing anymore so I just ended up writing again. But I’m not getting any popularity any advice?,31Dec2018,1
477,"So this has been something I've experienced for a long time and it's always affected my ability to get things done - sometimes I just lack motivation to do anything.

Usually it's worst in the morning. I just can't get myself to get up. I sit in bed and play games on my phone or browse reddit or scroll across Facebook or watch random YouTube videos or [insert mindless activity here]. I tell myself ""just one more round of Uno and I'll get up and get dressed. Just a few more minutes of laziness and I'll get going."" But then hours go by. Today I didn't get dressed until 2:40pm.

This is especially bad when I'm on break or it's a weekend, and I don't have class to go to. Extraneous things (like having to be at class) can motivate me to get up, but if it's winter break and I have nowhere to be, i can't easily make myself do it.

I don't think I'm depressed? It's not like the things seem uninteresting to me. Part of me wants to get up and do things and be productive, but part of me just feels...stuck, I guess? And sometimes I have things I'd rather do, like make some art, or watch a movie with my siblings, but I end up spending my free time in less fulfilling ways because I can't seem to find the energy to make myself get up and do the more enjoyable things.

Does anyone have any ways of getting around this problem? I feel so lazy. I don't know why I do this sometimes.",31Dec2018,1
478,"I get a lot of anxiety whenever I see my mom’s name on the caller ID. About 4years ago she went through a really nasty divorce that she never recovered from. She lost retirement money and the house and he quickly remarried and now lives in that same house.

During the time of her divorce, I moved back in with her to be there for her and paid rent to put extra money in her pocket. That’s when things started taking a turn for the worse in our relationship. She began guilting me into “loaning” her money to pay bills which then allowed her to go on extravagant trips annually. That was really all i feel i contributed because she was still very much depressed and very negative.

Once the divorce was finalized we were evicted and it was difficult to find a place together and honestly I didn’t want to. She’s more than capable of taking care of herself but she just kinda gave up on life. She ended up staying with a friend and I kinda bounced around from odd places until I secured the studio I’m currently in. Anytime I spend time with her it is 100% negative energy and her relationship with my younger brother is even worse. She really has given up on life and trying to help her is having a major impact on my own psyche because she just wants everyone to drown with her.

I left out a lot of important details but the situation is so complex. I guess my question is what else can I do to help her? Giving her money doesn’t help because she will just spend it on nonsense because she doesn’t care anymore. Spending time with her, is just her reliving the past over and over and her trying to manipulate me to her side of whatever she is currently mad at. I spend time with her because I care but I do keep my distance as well. I really don’t know what to do if anything about the situation. She’s seen a therapist and that doesn’t seem to work either. Sometimes I just want to check out on the situation altogether. ",31Dec2018,1
479,"I am seeking advice about my brother who lives with my fiancé and I. He has been living with us for about 2 years now, paying $450/month in rent. He has a good job that pays about $2,200 a month. He has no other bills (no utilities, no student loans, no debt). 

My fiancé and I will be getting married in May, and my brother told us about 6 months ago that he wants to move out before we get married.
Recently, he has asked us if we would lower his rent so that he can save enough money to move out. He says if he is not able to save enough my the time we are married, he will move in with his girlfriends mother for free until he saves enough.

I want to help him, but I wonder how he will afford rent in the real world if he cannot afford this rent. It will be almost impossible to find a place to rent around here for lower than $1000/month. I have no idea what he could possibly be spending all his extra money on. I know he has no savings at all as of today, as he just expressed to me that he will not be able to pay his rent tomorrow, and the next paycheck will barely cover it. 

Multiple times over the past few months, I have been asking him about how saving is going. I have tried to help him budget his money. I don’t know what else I can do to help him better manage his money.

What should I do?",31Dec2018,1
480,"I have a very good friend of mine. He’s pretty short (about 5 ft, we’re upperclassmen in high school), and He’s got a quite... eccentric mannerisms. He’s a drama kid, and he’s part of a lot of top theater troops. To put it simply, he’s a little out there, but his hearts in the right place, and he’s just trying to live his life.

The problem is, a lot of boys in our school don’t want that. 

Last year, he sat at a big table of guys. Typical guys for my town- bigger, athletic- and definitely not the theater type. They laughed at him, mocked him in front of our teacher, and took his things so they could laugh at him some more when he yelled at them. The teacher did nothing, so my friends and I made him sit with us.

Just recently, we found out someone made a tinder profile of him. It’s not his. They don’t use his name, but they use his pictures and very sexual language. To make it worse, he’s listed as a trans guy on his ‘tinder profile’ (he’s not one), so now many circles that have treated him nicely before have turned their backs on him because they think he’s catfishing people for attention.

I’m worried about him. He’s been posting a lot telling people to leave him alone, and his other posts are more and more depressing. He even made his profile picture black.

Do I talk to him first? If so, what do I say? Should I go to my school and show them? Would that make things worse?

I asked him if I had done anything and why he stopped talking to me and he said it was because I wasn't saying anything, so there wasn't anything to talk about.

494,"I live in a strict household mainly my father has always watched me quite closely, i am now an adult and feel trapped.
My brother is quite older than me and has always been close with my dad, while my dad has had little to do with me.
They seem to have a direct line of communication and while dont admit it i feel they are conspiring against me. My brother smoked marijuana with me and i felt pressured so i went with it i hadn't seen him in a while and was quite lonely. Any friend i ever had was because my father introduced me to them and i was always taken advantage of.
My dilemma is i am naive and trust people at their word, but anymore i know they [my brother and father] are dishonest and it feels like they are conspiring against me forming a life, anything that i try to do it seems to get messed up, either by not being able to pass a drug test or being asked to movie in with my brother with promises to help me find work, all that ends up happening is i helped my brother with needs in his life to make it easier on Him. 
He promised help me get a job but i would haft to pass a UA, he knew i couldnt because i smoked with him over the holidays and i felt he did this intentionally i can be easily pressured into things and him knowing me well enough he is successful if he wants me to do something or needs me for something. 
I try to explain this but no one believes me saying ""why would they sabotage me like that"" i dont have an answer for why its a difficult situation to explain.
But it seems all to ironic when i give up and dont try i get left alone and when things start looking up i am met with so much stress and resistance that i give up.
My dilemma is this, that i cant let them know of my jntentions and insists on taking me anywhere i need to go, if i leave without saying anything i am met with a ton of questions on my return and only have so many excuses before they figure it out. If i find a job he will surely find out and try to prevent me from moving out as he will then lose the control he has over me, since hes recruited my brother for help im backed into a corner, i feel like he will not be satisfied until i am living on the streets.

first of all I'd like to introduce myself. I'm a 20 year old male, currently in the last phase of becoming a kindergartenteacher or as we call it in Germany, a ""Erzieher"". I've been in school for 14 years straight and have little to no interest in start a job as soon as I finish my training. Now that might sound lazy, but I can assure you, I'm not. I want to do something else before working as a kindergartenteacher (explore the world, get some time to myself, work somewhere remote/interesting etc. you get it). I'm interested in alot of things, open to basically anything and a ""people person"".

To avoid confusion I have labeled each of my friends and will use those labels when referring to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into the story, I just want to give some background on myself. I would say that I am at times I am an emotional person and sometimes this blinds me to people around me and at times makes it difficult for me to let people go even if it is for the best. This next stuff might seem irrelevant, but I feel it has been a factor in some way. I have an older brother who is mentally and physically disabled (born with Spina Bifida). He is completely dependent on me and the rest of my family for assistance in all activity (feeding, bathing, walking). I would say that this has made me a more compassionate person, I've always been the person to notice when people need help and be there for them through thick or thin. I even read articles about this before that people who have had siblings with disabilities tend to also have characteristics of being very compassionate. Furthermore, when I was 15 years old my father passed away which in some ways abruptly ended up childhood. But more than that, I lost someone from my life and he will never be a part of it again. I would say that this has caused me to become afraid of losing anybody else from my life and become attached to people more so than they would be in their relationships and even forces me to hold onto things that are not worth it. Other than my nuclear family, I don't really have any close family members. They all live in India, but have been jealous of my family's success and hate us for it. Thus, I always treated my friends like my extended family.

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating high school, I went to college. At one point in college because of some traumatic things I went through involving sexual assault I started getting feelings of depression which started talking to take a toll on me. I lost almost everyone I became friends with during my freshman year and got close to a point of suicide. However, I started to grow tired of feeling that way and made an active effort to improve myself and gradually I started doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my old friends from high school (I'll call him Y) reached out to me towards the end of my freshman year and asked me to live in a six-person campus suite with him and a few other of his friends one of which is the friend I am trying to ask about (I will refer to him as V). The living unit was divided such that there are three double rooms: V and Y were roommates and I and another friend (D) were roommates (the other roommates are not of importance to the story). I met V before on an earlier encounter and found him to be a little annoying so initially I didn't want to be friends, but I thought why not give him a chance now that we are going to be roommates. So one Friday night, I broke out some bottles of alcohol and invited all our unit to join. That night V got too drunk and reckless and ended up throwing up on the floor (he was fine otherwise though, but passed out). Y was really angry and threatened to me that he was going to turn him into the RA and get him in trouble. I asked him not to and said that isn't cool, so he told me that if I care about him then I should clean up his mess or else he would tell the RA. As I said before, because I take care of my brother a lot this was not too weird for me to do, so I did it. The next morning, V woke up and when he found out I cleaned up his mess, he seemed to appreciate that and personally came to me thank me and that is how we became friends officially. One day a few years later he told me ""That's the type of thing a brother does. It was at that moment I thought, I should never lose this person"". V was not the strongest academically. All throughout college I have had to help him out in numerous classes so much so to the point that he tells his parents that he would not have graduated college had it not been for me. I always considered myself to be a good and loyal friend, always making sacrifices for the people I care about, but I didn't always feel that he returned that to me.

&amp;#x200B;

V was an international student from India, but on top of that his father is a business owner so his family was decently well off. I don't know where he learned it since his parents are really nice, but one of his largest negative qualities is his arrogance, a lot of it surrounding his family's financial success. This involved a lot of talking down on me and the way that I used to dress. As I said before, I lost my father not too long before, it's not that my family couldn't afford nicer things or that I was wearing the lowest quality clothing possible, but the types of clothing I wore was not our priority. Anyways, some of the clothes I bought after that time carried over and caught his attention. He would make fun of me and say ""I have better things than you, look how much better my stuff are"". Once I started working after graduating from college and bought these nicer things on my own with my own money not my parents', he never did this again. If ever I gained a little weight, he would make fun of that too until I lost it. I was still recovering my from depression during the time so even though I tried many times to no avail to get him to stop, I felt that I should just ignore it the best I could in order to make friends.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I would not say that he has always been horrible to me as there were times that he has been a good friend. For example, one night I was out with some other friends going to frat parties, but I ended up losing my group and blacking out at one. The frat brothers took my phone and called D to come and get me. V came along with D and they both brought me back to our suite together. Those frat brothers were nice enough to help out, but had they not been and had my friends not come I could have gotten into a big mess. This is of course, the only memorable thing I can say that he has done for me. Eventually though, I got more involved with extracurricular activities like my a cappella group in which I started taking on leadership roles. It was after I began to take more initiative and responsibility not just for myself but also others, that I truly recovered from my depression and can proudly say that I am no longer feeling that way.

&amp;#x200B;

V and I didn't live together during our Junior year, but I still would be there for him if he needed it. For example, there was one class he took in which the required software would only install on PC's and not MACs, so I lent him my laptop for days at a time, even if it meant me doing my own assignments at odd hours to make sure things worked out for him. One day when he came by to pick up my laptop, I was unloading groceries from my car and taking them into my apartment and I asked him for help. He complained so much that I asked him to help me out and carry groceries. The summer prior to our Junior year, he actually went through a low in his life. A girl he liked during the summer back in India didn't reciprocate back to him. Because I had gone through depression myself, I was able to provide the right support for him during this time and helped to motivate him to feel better and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

During our Senior year is when we actually began to argue a lot because I simply felt very disrespected by him. We took a campus apartment together with two other friends. Because he lives so far away from home he tends to miss it a lot. One thing about me is that I am a really good cook of Indian food. I used to share my food with him a lot and this used to make him really happy. He told me ""You're cooking reminds me of home"". He's a vegetarian, but I am not. I then stopped cooking non-vegetarian food as much because I thought that if I made food both of us could eat then I would continue to make my friend feel at home and be happy. The constant support he needed in his academics continued to be a thing between us. I used to be so well prepared for our exams that I could have gone to sleep at a comfortable hour. He never went to class and would come to me the night before the exam to ask for help. I would then stay up until 3 am teaching him the class, but he would start to doze off into sleep as it got later, so I then would tell him to go to sleep and I would wake up again at 6 am to continue helping him out. I helped out my other friends as well, but they came to me at reasonable hours, but regardless I always am willing to go that extra mile. I would give up on my own sleep to help him succeed. Also, if he were taking a class that I had taken over a year ago, I would spend the time to refresh mysel fon the material and then teach him. Before one of his finals, I spent 2 whole days helping him learn the material despite the fact that I had my own exams and TA work to do. Throughout college, I was the only one in my friend's group who had a car and would give rides to my friends. Many times when he wasn't feeling well and needed to go to a doctor or when he needed to get his laptop/phone repaired or even if he was late for an exam and needed a ride to make it in time, I would stop what I was doing and take him anywhere he needed. All in all, any time he faced an issue in his life, I always stepped in to solve it for him. One thing that he will always tell me is that he would not have graduated college had it not been for me. Even though he says nice compliments to me, I never feel that I see his appreciation in his actions or words in situations that actually test his loyalty as a friend. Sometimes, I feel that he says these things to make sure I remain loyal.

&amp;#x200B;

During the second semester is when I started to really question our friendship. Our friends' group has always been really bad at making plans. A little over a week prior to Spring Break, they decided that they wanted to go to Cancun. I unfortunately had an expired passport and needed to get it renewed. When I spoke to the Passport Office they told me that I would need to expedite my renewal, but that it was not guaranteed I would get my passport in time for the trip (further more, I would need to buy my plane ticket prior to my appointment with them in order to even be considered). I felt that there was a lot of uncertainty involved so I asked all my friends if they would consider Miami instead as it would be domestic and I wouldn't need a passport. Everyone except for V agreed to this, but he was livid. Behind my back he was telling our other friends ""Let's go to Cancun without him. If he doesn't have his passport then he should just stay at home, that sucks for him. This our last spring break, he should go f\*\*k himself. Don't tell him until 24 hours after you buy the tickets that way he can't try to convince you to change plans"". I'm not a selfish person, if they all still wanted to go then they should at the least talk to me about it first and let me know. That's the most respectful thing to do. I'm not saying that because I helped him out with his problems, he can't go to Cancun, but what I am saying is that at the least I deserve better and honest communication. Some friends in the group who were more loyal to me told me about what he was doing. I called him furious with him, and asked him ""why are you telling people to buy their tickets behind my back? You know there's a chance I won't be able to go right?"" to which he said ""Dude it's just spring break, relax!"". I then asked him how he has the nerve to lie and cheat me like that after everything I do for him, after which he realized his mistake and tried really hard to apologize, but there really wasn't any point in that. I ended up getting my passport in time luckily.

&amp;#x200B;

In another incident, I don't remember how it came up, but we were talking about the depression I had faced at one point during which he said ""I'm so strong I would never get depressed"". To that I said ""Hey man I'm glad you're doing better, but you did go through a rough patch yourself at one point"". When I said that he got really angry and said ""Just because you're weak and all that stuff happened to you, doesn't mean other people are too! Don't make stuff up! I can also go around and tell people things like you're mom is a whore!"", which is not true by the way, he just wanted to say something about her to insult me. When he said that I got really annoyed and said ""Just go away, I don't want to talk to you"". About ten minutes later he comes back and apologizes for what he said, I ended up letting it go.

&amp;#x200B;

On the night of my birthday he spent all night trying to look like a big shot in front of my friends. When we went out to bars, my older sister and her boyfriend came out as well. V got way too drunk and kept trying to buy the four of us drinks. My sister, her boyfriend, and I all tried numerous times to stop him, but it was too late and the drinks were ordered and brought. Even when we tried to pay for them, he would confiscate our cards and give his to the bartender every time. He ended up racking up a $200 bill for so many drinks that none of us were even able to touch them. The next day he comes to me and says ""You, your sister, and her boyfriend drank the drinks I bought with my money. I want that back"". I told him that it wasn't our responsibility we tried to stop him from ordering and paying. I am the type of person who would never take a single penny from someone else, but he was the who was reckless. On top of that he's the one that for the past few years always bragged about how rich he was, where's his ego now? was my question. Anyways, I didn't need to ask him that because he answered that himself, whether he was honest is another question. He told me that his family is low on money and that he's on a budget. When he told me that, I immediately felt bad and venmo'd him the $200 right away. The next weekend when I tried to call him to ask him to hang out, in a drunken stupor he told me that he went on a multi-city bar crawl with some of his other friends. Instantly I knew that he lied to me and that showed in my voice. Again he realized his mistake and left the group early from NYC to come back to apologize to me. But despite the apology, I did not appreciate the lie and felt very disrespected.

&amp;#x200B;

Because he wasn't strong academically, he also struggled to find a job. His parents don't want to continue the family business, but instead want him to settle in America. I'm at a great starting point in my career and am in a more stable position. He has been unable to even get to second round interviews. I had been working on myself personally a lot after graduation such as going back to the gym and building back my body. However, because he is an international student and his visa status only allows three months of unemployment from when his OPT is given I felt that helping him settle is more important. This is despite the fact that before he used to talk down on me when he felt that his life was better than mine. I would work from 9-5 and drive one hour to his Aunt's home every day and spend almost 5-6 hours helping him with his job applications, interviews, and tests. Sometimes by the time I get home I'm so tired that I just go to sleep without eating dinner, but I felt that I was doing the right thing for my friend. Sometimes, my boss would ask me to go to a further location which is a two hour drive from his Aunt's, but I would do it anyway. One of those days when I met him to help him out, I asked him to watch a movie with me that coming weekend which I enjoyed and felt that he would like as well because it is in his genre. He instantly said ""Fuck no, I'm not watching that"" without second thought. Essentially, India is a very diverse country and because of that it is not uncommon for there to be stereotypes and ignorance about different cultures. Some of these are directed towards people from the part of India I come from (the south) and thus to some degree he looks down on my people because of ignorance. I was really upset with him and didn't speak to him the rest of the night. He tried to ask me what's wrong, but I didn't say anything. When I went home, I texted him that I felt really disrespected by him that night. Again he realized his mistake and apologized claiming he was just joking and agreed to watch the movie, so I forgave him. I didn't feel that what I was asking was too much. I had been spending the past few months every day to help him get a job, doing one thing that I would want to do is not too much to ask especially because he knows that no other friend of his would do anything for him, he knows I'm the only one. Everyone in our friends' group has issues with him and talks about him behind his back. I always feel that I need to remind him of what I do for him in order for him to do something in return for me. In my perception he needs to be constantly reminded of the value I bring as a friend which I don't need to do with anyone else. One of my other friend's went through a very rough patch and was in the hospital for about a week. I visited him and his parents every day to make sure that he is doing better and is getting the help he needs. Even prior to me having done that, he has always appreciated me as a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

V's younger brother also just started college recently too. Just like his older brother he isn't doing so well in his classes. I've also been trying to help him out as well. Literally, I had to write his essays for him because he was really bad and was about to fail the class. Just like his brother I feel that he takes me for granted. While I was helping him with his essay, he asked if he can leave to go to a birthday party. I told him to come back at 10, and he came back at 10:45 despite the fact that I told him I had work the next day and could not stay up too late. Unfortunately, because he came late I ended up staying up late and waking up the next morning not feeling well rested. Anyways, I helped his brother out with his writing class and managed to help him go from failing to ending with a B. V should appreciate me more for that, but instead he and his brother seem to take me for granted. When he first introduced me to his brother, I took them both out for dinner at a nice restaurant. That same night V claimed to his brother that I am his number one best friend. I am starting to doubt if he meant that or if he was just trying to make me loyal to his brother. For V's birthday this past month, I surprised him with a cake at his Aunt's home just as I do with all my friends. However, his brother is Type I diabetic and thus could not eat the cake, so I specially made him a sugar-free dessert so that he wouldn't feel left out for his brother's birthday. Not trying to fish for compliments, but not only has no other friend of his done anything for him, but none of them have done anything for his brother too.

&amp;#x200B;

This past Friday our group went out to bars together in Hoboken. He wanted to talk to this one girl that was near us, but was failing miserably. I tried to step in to wing man him, but even that didn't help him out much. Whatever he said to her, she didn't seem to respond well at all to him. She later left and went up to another friend of ours in our group whom I will call R and said that he was an asshole. Unlike him I have better luck when I talk to girls because I actually genuinely am respectful towards them. There have been times in college I would meet girls and things would be going well between us, but when they found out I'm friends with him they rant about how much they dislike him and find him ""creepy"" or ""arrogant"". Anyways, he blamed me for the fact that the girl didn't respond to him and started yelling at me in the bar. Later, when R told us what she told him privately I got really angry and texted him the truth. He tried apologizing again, but I just had enough. I texted him back saying he always gives me shit and never appreciates everything that I do for him. Although he never properly appreciated his friendship with me, his parents most definitely did. They had gifted me a belt which I was wearing that night. When I got back to R's apartment I found a garbage bag that he had filled with clothes. I was really upset and put the belt on top of it and took a picture and sent it to him and said along with that ""Where it belongs"" (in his perception I put it in the trash), but I do still have the belt I couldn't bring myself to actually do it. The next day I felt really bad that I may have really upset him so I tried calling him to apologize. He didn't pick up so I texted him instead telling him I was really sorry about that. He hasn't responded at all to anything. He has been picking up other friends' calls though, but according to them he says that he's not angry with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything that he has put me through has created some changes in me that I do not like. For one, I do not trust people as much as I used to. I get very doubtful of his intentions specifically, but also those of others. I tend to think that there is an ulterior motive behind people's actions in some of the most basic situations even if there was none. This is mainly because he has shown me I cannot trust him. Also, I have developed these feelings of hate that I never had before. This change however I only feel towards him. I am torn between still caring for him as a friend and wanting the best for him, but also on occasion remembering how much he puts me through and how miserable he makes me and wanting him to feel that way too. I never wanted anyone to be miserable, I don't know why I am starting to feel that way now.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to think. I feel bad for what I did, but it was after years of him putting me down or disrespecting me after everything that I do for him. I also only mentioned a few key incidents to avoid getting too long, although I might already be too late there. Will he reach out to me again? Should I even care if he doesn't reach out to me again? I have forgiven him for so much, why is it so hard for him to do that here? Is this guy even worth being upset over? Or am I over analyzing him and maybe he wants to be a good friend, but doesn't really know how to? Even though he apologizes he always does something again to upset me. I wouldn't say that I have overwhelmed him with niceness otherwise he would have done something to distance himself. Instead he took everything I did for him, so there is no indication he didn't feel comfortable or right taking from me. I love my family and friends and would do anything for them, but part of me has trouble letting people go because I am afraid to lose people that I care for. Would really appreciate your answers to these questions if you can. Thank you so much! Please let me know if you need more information.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Essentially, I have a friend whom I feel has taken advantage of me a lot and has at many times made me feel miserable. I have forgiven him so many times, but this time I think in my anger against him I may have gone too far. What I did although not nice, I wouldn't say is the worst thing to do to someone, but he hasn't responded to me since when I tried to apologize. I feel that in our friendship he has used me a lot and does not entirely know the value of me as a friend. Am I over analyzing these situations? Should I care if we make up or not? Is he even worth it?",31Dec2018,1
506,So I work at Ross and I work in loss prevention. I literally stand and stare out a window for 6 hours a day and great people. That’s it I can’t leave my post and I can’t even confront shoplifters due to company policy. I get no sense of accomplishment and I already don’t have good mental health. For the past 2 years I’ve been in a deep depression. This job makes my life hell. For example today I’m stressing about going back to work even though today is my day off and don’t go in until tomorrow morning. I feel like I’m going crazy and really want to leave. Is quitting as soon as possible the best thing to do or am I freaking out over nothing ? ,31Dec2018,1
507,"I am a 25 (soon to be 26) year old female and I feel like I'm going through a mid-life crisis. I don't really know what I'm going through, or how to handle it really. There are many faucets to my situation and I'm going to do my best to quickly summarize them. 

This is a throwaway account, as people I know in real life follow my actual account.

1) I have been severely obese literally my entire life. I could make a whole separate post about my struggles with that, but on the positive side, I feel like I've finally conquered this because I've lost 50 pounds over the last few months. I have 100 more to go, but I should get there by the time I'm 27...which depresses me. I've dragged my feet so long when it comes to losing weight. I feel like I wasted my best years being ugly and unattractive. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) I feel like I never really experienced life. Growing up, I was always a shy and reserved student who earned straight A's and didn't party. I've never been drunk in my entire life, because I've always had to be the responsible one around my friends. I feel like I grew up too fast. I started college when I was in 10th grade and graduated high school with an associate's degree. I've never had a ""stupid teenager"" phase.

&amp;#x200B;

3) I have a good job and I like it, for the most part. I started off as an elementary school teacher and now I'm an elementary school librarian. I would eventually like to teach or become a librarian at the high school level. I have no qualms with my career, other than the problem below.

&amp;#x200B;

3) I feel like I have dual personalities: my goody-two shoes teacher side and my goth side. I have a goth streak that I never quite grew out of. I dress professionally for work obviously, but the weekends are a different story. I attend a goth club in a neighboring county even weekend in elaborate outfits and hope to god I never run into one of my co-workers. I feel like it reflects poorly on me being a teacher, because teachers are expected to be role models, and dressing up goth is kinda taboo. I hate that the world is that way and I have to hide that part of me from my co-workers, but it's just how it is. I constantly feel like a fake because I don't fit into that typical mold of squeaky clean sports mom with the ""live, love, laugh"" sticker on her bedroom wall that most of my co-workers fit into.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Finally, I'm at the age where all of my friends are having babies. My fiance (who I've been with for 10 years) is very serious about having children and I'm not ready. I've had this discussion and he understands, but I don't think I'll ever be ready. I'm afraid of losing freedom and my identity. I don't have a motherly bone in my body and I'm sure I'm going to hate and resent my future child until they're 5 years old, because then they're tolerable. I've worked in a daycare. I dislike babies and toddlers. It's not that I never want a kid, it's just that I'm not ready even though I'm running out of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this all culminates into me not feeling like an accomplished adult. I have a good job. My fiance and I own a house. I'm not struggling at all. But I feel empty. Like I'm missing something. I seek validation from friends and from strangers now that I'm losing weight, because I never had validation on my appearance when I was fat. I still feel immature because I like gothic fashion, gothic music, and video games. I feel atypical because I don't fit the mold of a typical teacher. I feel like I haven't experienced enough, and I'm not ready to be weighed down with a child. Any advice on what to do? How to come to terms with myself?",31Dec2018,1
508,"I just finished my first quarter in college about two hours from my hometown. Long story short, my two best friends ended up being angry at me for something truly ridiculous (it’s a long and exhausting story). Over the course of about three months now, I found out that they were talking behind my back and pretty much giving me the cold shoulder. I’ve been back home for break for a month and have somewhat bandaid fixed one of these friendships.
The other friend continued to ignore me since I’ve been home but sent me a long message on Christmas about missing me and being sorry for being distant. The three of us were supposed to eat lunch today to finally make amends, but the one who messaged me on Christmas told me last minute that they felt like they couldn’t wake up for our lunch plans. Lunch was going to be at 2. 
So I’m done with trying to make amends. I feel lonely now and I don’t know how to cope with this. I don’t think continuing my friendship with them would be good because they’ve proven throughout the years to be toxic sources of energy for me. 
What things can I do to heal from breaking off a 6 year friendship?

and i just asked him to loan me another 70 dollars to help pay phone bill.

i just broke up with my girlfriend of four years because i was so unhappy and i overreacted on our last fight and i regret it because i love her and i let her go.

Im probably going to be laid off at my job 70% chance of it happening or moved down to 32 hours a week and the overtime system only lets people with high seniority get hours, so basically fuck me.

I just feel like the biggest idiot alive for being a leach off my parents. they're willing to help me out and they have a lot and i just feel like a jackass for it. I feel like ill never be able to pay them back and ill never be able to work enough hours too.

also how should i go back and talk to her and work things out?

Right now I'm on meds, going to therapy, trying to do art/theater classes, playing music, meditating, but I can't build relationships because I am just not a fun person to be around. I severely lack meaning and purpose in my life which is probably the biggest contributor, but I don't know what I could really do about that as I don't have stable interest in anything. It seems like the world is on the precipice of collapse so it also makes it difficult for me to see the point in doing anything, but somehow it just keeps going so I figure I'll probably have to learn how to cope.

He felt like he was guilted into this relationship in the first place because I liked him and I was depressed. He did say he loved me and does not regret anything but I am so fucking broken.

I stayed alive for him and all my goals started and ended with him. He was my first love and my first everything. I moved across the world to live near him and be with him. I feel so fucking lost and heart broken. I want to end my life. I hope someone can give me some tips or words of wisdom. I'm young, lonely, traumatized and heartbroken. How will I go on after this?

514,"I’m 17f, and love my mom (51) to death. She may not have the picture-perfect Hallmark Movie family, but I think she’s done a great job of raising me and my siblings. However, as I’ve gotten older, she’s gotten more and more into alternative medicine. For my primary care, this has been alright, and has just been going to professional MDs who prefer to prescribe herbal supplements first, but will also prescribe meds when needed. For instance, to get to the root of my ongoing stomach problems, we’re focusing on repairing my stomach lining instead of just throwing painkillers at it. But recently, my mom has been trying to get me to take supplements for my Bipolar II (I am on meds and stable) and current sinus infection.

I’ve told her three times that I want to go to the doctor for the infection. I have had so many of the freaking things that I can instantly tell when I get them. We usually go to the doctor, she says “yep that’s a sinus infection,” we get antibiotics, and I’m out of my misery. But this time, she’s sending me links about colloidal silver, garlic, apple cider vinegar, and other “natural antibiotics” that she wants me to take. I’ll send her articles that debunk those links (often from Facebook/on Facebook but stolen from Pinterest), but she insists that if I use natural stuff, (or worse, just wait it out...I have gotten worse in the last three days) I’ll be better.

The Bipolar II thing was shot down by my amazing therapist, but she wanted me to take some vitamin/amino acid thing to “cure” it. For the first ever time, I had to explain to her that I’m almost an adult, and that it was my choice to continue the meds I’m on (which I have almost 0 side effects from). Thankfully, my therapist explained that one doesn’t simply “cure” bipolar, and she backed off. She hasn’t tried to “cure” my Social Pragmatic Disorder (used to be Aspergers) yet, thank the Lord.

HOWEVER.

Now she’s looking at natural supplements to “cure” my brother, who has depression, and my little sister, who has some pretty intense OCD. This is all encouraged by her friends, who are all pretty into the whole homeopathic thing as well. One’s an RN, as well, so my mom takes her word as law half the time. (“Well, RN has used it on her son, and it’s worked wonders for him, so—“)

What the heck can I tell her/show her to help her understand how modern medicine works? I’m sorry if this is a little rant-y, and I am going to be talking to my therapist about this! Thanks in advance, y’all.",31Dec2018,1
515,"For a while now, watching television or using social media has been an escape for me from my own problems. I’d look at characters or celebrities and see things (such as qualities, aspects of their life) I liked, and things I hated within the context of ‘their story’. They influence me to want to behave a certain way - to be like the character, I guess. All the while I don’t feel like I’ve grown much as a person, and all of these qualities I admire in these characters are lacking in me. I feel as though I’m just obsessing over them like a child would, only I’m not really benefitting from watching them in the same way. 
For example, something I admire is a lack of dependency on social media/TV/celebrity influencers. They’re comfortable in forming their own opinions and being their own person without the constant desire to develop into someone else they like (as I do). They’re focused on their own lives and the people around them in real time, rather than whatever is happening online. Characters who are hard working and studious also make me jealous. They can sit down and focus on things for hours on end, and just get things done. Being disciplined is a quality I admire. Also, when they have many extracurricular or a range of interests/hobbies. I aspire to be like that. 

I don’t want to live my life trying to be like someone else (that doesn’t really exist) who has been carefully constructed to be seen a certain way. I want to be my own person. So, how can I shift my attention from wanting to be like xyz to actually being xyz without carrying through my unhealthy mindset? ",31Dec2018,1
516,"My bf is an amazing person, but I feel like he priorizes his friends over our relationship. 

Sometimes he invites his friends over when I want to spend time alone with him. When his friends just show up in his house, it is me who needs to leave (he doesn't directly tells me to leave, but I'm introvert, and I feel uncomfortable with that bunch of people, and have to leave anyway). He hangs out with friends everyday while I can visit him only 2 times per week. Sometimes he cancels our dates to go out with friends instead, for example, today is new year's eve, and I told him some days ago I wanted to commemorate with him, and told him to think of something fun we can do togheter, but he is going to his friend party instead.

You see, I don't suspect he's cheating, it's just that this whole situation makes me feel really sad, and I'm afraid to tell him because I don't want him to think I'm a jealous, controlling girlfriend or make fun of me for being jealous. What should I do?

I kind of understand his point, nowadays, love relationships are so fluid that people think a friend is more valuable than a partner. Some people substitute his friends over a bf/gf who will leave them 2 months later only to realize that in the end, it wasn't worth it, so they end up losing everything. But I really love my boyfriend, I'm not dating thinking of breaking up, I want to have a really serious relationship with him and make it worth everything.

So,I don't feel comfortable starting a friendship with some of his friends, since everytime they hang out, it's for drinking, and I don't like alchool and just can't deal with drunk youngsters, but should I try to make friends with them so we can hang out more? They have some common interests with me, so that could help. What do you think?

517,"I’m turning 32 in 5 days, my dad just passed in August from cancer at the age of 61 (which he barely found he had just a few months before). I currently live in California and my mom &amp; sister still live back in Texas. I’ve lived 29 years of my life in the same city as my family.

 I’ve opened a few businesses back in Texas that are still operating but not too profitable. I’m in California for the music business as well as side hustles. I’ve been out here for about 3 years now and I live with a few other friends who we run our small label with and have been getting good placements in 2018 and 2019 looks to be even better. However my side hustles such as shooting video or designing and some illegal hustles are supporting my lifestyle out here more than anything else. I have a degree and enough experience that I feel could get me a pretty well paid job out in California. However I’m torn between the decision of either pursuing my dreams and continue struggling out in California til my “dreams come true”, getting a career job in California, or getting a job in Texas and closer to my family. I feel like I’m living a “fun lifestyle” instead of having a normal job and stable life like everyone else. I currently even put off small medical issues with myself because of no insurance and financials.

Both my parents were business owners since they were my age.up til 5 years ago, since then they have been forced to work part time jobs (my mom has to work full time now) to gain special security and retirement benefits since they were never employed to anyone majority of their lives. I have been living a similar lifestyle being freelance since I was 23 (so almost 9 years job free) and running my businesses while developing new ones if they fail. It hasn’t been easy for the past decade, especially moving out to California. I currently still make enough where I’m able to provide a very minuscule amount to assist my mom. 

My sister stays with my mom and helps her with everything she can. Since my dad passed I know they’re both kind of wanting me to be around more. My sister tells me to just do what makes me happy, which a lot of people advise me to do. However California has obviously way more opportunities for my careers and I have established a lot of important business relations since I’ve moved out here. I also think about My situation at 32, living in a frat like house where we’re all pursuing the same end goal and how it’s not the best lifestyle at my age when my peers with normal lives, are purchasing homes and settling down.

I know I’ve never been like the normal person and have always been different, which a lot of people start to engage in business with me because of my appearance or personality.

I’m leaving back to California today and it just eats me up everytime I’m leaving. I get really depressed and just resort back to smoking more weed and working out to deal with my depression. I’m really looking for some sort of advice from anyone who has gone through something similar. ",31Dec2018,1
518,"I work 3, 12-hour shifts a week with rotating weekends. So, I'm often home during the week. I am productive. I make a to-do list and get things done around the house. I mow the lawn, handle our pool maintenance, make repairs and handle home improvements. I make the bed every morning, I cook dinner several nights a week. And one of my jobs is cleaning the house every two weeks (toilets, etc...)

My wife works a ""nine-to-five"" and is often home without me for brief periods and occasional weekends. She is ALWAYS busy. From my standpoint, it seems like she volunteers for things and makes commitments just to keep herself busy. I arrive home from work at 7:45pm to find her still running around stressed because of all the things she has to do. On a weekend. When she has been off work for two days straight. 

I tell her frequently that if there is anything she needs me to do, she can add it to my list and I will happily accomplish pretty much any reasonable task on my days off. Hang a picture? Return an item to the store? Shop for groceries? No problem. If she puts it on my list, I get it done.  I've even placed a spiral notebook on the kitchen counter as a honey-do list.

I'm not lazy. 

But I don't like to run at 100% all the time. When she is always balls-to-the-wall, I feel like I struggle to keep up. I know when the whole family is off, we should go to the zoo or to kids birthday parties. We hang out with friends and go to church as a family. All that is great. But it's the running from one event to another, and staying gone all day, and rushing to cook a dish for a get-together after we just walked in the door from shopping that is just too much. 

What should I do?

Before you say ""Just talk to her about how you feel."" I have to tell you our communication is not the best. She doesn't listen to me when I have objections about how busy our schedule is. She is probably even borderline controlling. 


So, what can *I* do to help out my situation? ",31Dec2018,1
519," 

TL;DR: What are reasonable boundaries to set with my alcoholic MIL who is verbally abusive to my wife and family? Wife is not ready for no contact but is willing to set some boundaries, and has been unable to enforce them. Wife has asked me to take the lead on the boundaries. She will not go to al-anon at this point.

​

Things have settled down after our family Christmas with my alcoholic MIL. We all know she's an alcoholic, has been for 30+ years through three husbands and four kids, and is currently being enabled by all of her friends, family, and her very comfortable financial situation and ""socialite"" lifestyle. My wife hates her alcoholism but as many kids growing up with alc. parents know, it's not that simple. Before we met, she kept limited contact with her mom but unfortunately MIL is bank-rolling my wife's 6-figure education (Dr.) and wife will not be done for another 1.5 years, so we do have to maintain some contact to finish this out. MIL is financially abusive and uses the money as a way to keep in contact. We do have the option to scale back majorly on the amount of money received from MIL (currently she has extended a very large line of credit via a bank to my wife), but need the line of credit as an insurance policy. Wife has not drawn from the line of credit in 6 months but owes over $100k to MIL.

​

MIL is a ""socialite"" whose life is entirely comprised by vacationing and dinner parties/social functions, all of which revolve around drinking. Her new husband is a complete enabler, literally filling her glass and everyone else's then complaining/venting to me, my wife, my mother, etc when she gets drunk.

​

MIL's drunk behaviours include physically harming herself (falling/broken bones/numerous hospitalizations), verbal abuse and belittling everyone, and making awkward, problematic sexual comments and advances.

​

She also has developed a chronic bowel issue which essentially makes her incontinent. This may or may not be caused by the drinking, but surely can't be helped by it and has resulted in those close to her literally treating her like a child ""are you \*sure\* you don't need to use the bathroom?""

​

Lastly, she revealed to my wife on xmas eve (while very drunk) that she is suicidal with a plan but no time frame. Wife is not convinced this is real but you can never be too careful.

​

Friends and family have told her she needs to curb it but nobody follows through. She has a lot of money and friends seem to enjoy drinking expensive wine on her dime. All of their friends are drinkers, none alcoholics as far as I know, but all have seen this behaviour as these are decades-long friendships. She has cut longtime friends out for confronting her in the past.

​

My inclination is to start small...meet with her only during the day (she does not drink until around 4pm and onward), no drinking with her even if she decides to drink, meeting only in coffee shops etc that do not serve alcohol. Then eventually once my wife is out of school, set the firm boundary of basically, alcohol or us.

​

My own family members, who stayed all together with my MIL and her husband over xmas, were very concerned and now I'm starting to field comments from them.

​

My wife used to have limited contact with her mother (see each other once every 3 months or so during the day) but has increased as we got married this year and did xmas all together etc. We thankfully don't have kids but there is no way in hell I would allow them to be exposed to this.

​

Thank you, everyone.

522,"I'm 19, male to female transgender, and I recently met this cute boy on Grindr. He's 21, and I've never really dated a man before, except one, it's always been girls. And the thought of going out, just him and I, gives me super anxiety. I mean, I want to, but I really feel like I would have nothing to say, be super awkward, etc. 

Being trans gives me extra anxiety. He knows I'm trans, and is perfectly good with it, but it still freaks me out being in public. What if I get questioned? What if someone says something? I mean I've found that people generally don't give a shit, but still. 

And then there's the part that I met him online. He lives fairly close to me, and I don't think he's psycho or anything, but I can't help to think about the what ifs. Not to mention that my mom wants to go with me whenever I do meet him, which is smart, but that would make it even worse for me lol.

A big part of confusion is also that he's a man. Like, he has a career and everything, and I feel like I'm still a kid. I don't know how I feel about adulting lol. I mean I have a good job and go to school, but I don't know. He has his own place, he's a full on adult. 

I want to see where things go, but I'm honestly terrified. I've never been on a date, only dated a boy once, never tried dating someone I met online, and don't even begin to know how to make conversation.

I want to change my character but at the same time I like it. HELP!

Hey guys. First of all my English is not that good, so I hope I can explain my situation well.

I am a 23 years old male. I have been an introvert, antisocial and a quiet person my whole life. As a result, I ended up being lonely, and having no friends. No one wishes me a happy new year, never got a surprise nor a gift for my birthday, never had a friend to who I can tell everything.. you get the point. 

Being a snowball effect, I got lonelier and depressed more and more. So deep inside I know that I need to fix something.

My character makes every person's first impression about me being: mysterious, boring and depressing person.

On the other hand, every person who gets to know me is surprised by how fun, crazy and funny I am. I can swear that every person who got to know me told me that he never expected a person completely different and opposite to what I looked like. Even when they tell their friends about me they don't believe them.

Seriously it like being two completely different people. 

I am not a shy person, I just like to look mysterious, shy and serious. BUT also I want to change my public character and show my extroverted side to everyone, so I can have friends like everyone.

I am so confused I like my public character but I want to change it too?

Don't worry I am as confused as you are haha ^^

530,"So my husband has been REALLY weird since the birth of our babies a couple months ago. At first he was just never home and I thought he was stressed because of the prospect of being a father and how we are going to be moving to another country soon and he will have to find work there and how we are having money problems.. Now that I've finally convinced him to be at home more often after he got mugged walking around God knows where in the middle of the night I've been able to actually talk to him. He seems much more than just simply stressed.

He's been having what I believe are paranoid delusions. Sometimes he'll be his normal loving self. Other times he his irritated and will go off on these weird tangents about police, Israel, magicians, devils, and the government watching us. He at one point covered ALL the cameras with tape, which is a fear I can kind of understand with hackers, but then he said it was Israel spying on us.. Anything bad that happens he blames on magic or foreign governments... I've tried talking sense into him, that we are ordinary, boring people. But it just doesn't seem to connect.

He'll be having a normal conversation with me and then all of a sudden he'll freak out over a word I said and start very quickly talking about all these different, unconnected, random things at once.. Then bring up how so and so is working for the devil. How so and so is trying to bring us down. His own friends and family even, one day he will talk about them like they're the greatest things since sliced bread, the next they are terrible people because of one little thing they said or did.

538,"Background on my best friend and I: we both went to the same schools in a small town and she had a crush on my cousin in junior high, so they were best friends and since we all hung out in the same friend group, her and I became quick friends. We ended up best friends for 17 years with a few rough patches and quite a few years where we barely conversed. (She is a bit selfish. If it’s not about her and her ideals she’s not okay with it) 

We got close again in the last two years, and my fiancé proposed last year.  I think she automatically thought she was going to be my Matron of Honor, so she sort of invited herself. At the time, I was thinking of asking my older cousin who I’ve looked up too all of my life. She would have been a much more supportive, encouraging and dedicated person and this whole wedding stuff already makes me really nervous (I vouched for a courthouse wedding FYI.lol) 

But now she is saying she will only know if she can be the Matron of Honor or stand beside me until she knows when exactly her Sister in law is going to have the baby. She is saying she is going to have to leave the wedding if she finds out she’s in labor that day and her due date is literally two days before the wedding. 

So, not sure what to do. If it were me personally I would say of course I’m coming to my best friends wedding but will rush over and skip the reception if she goes in labor. Chances are she will be in labor for 11 hours anyway. It is an hour out of town, so I get that, but I don’t want to stand at the alter with no one at my side (we only picked one person). My idea is to be nice about it and putting off more concern for her potentially being stressed and not being able to see her nephew being born (which is the half truth) but also say I need to have a solid answer. The last thing I want to do is feel alone up there. I will already be super nervous. I’m super shy and this is a nerve wracking experience for me. 

My older cousin would say yes in a heart beat if I asked her. She’s super sweet and knows I’m nervous about this, but I’m not sure about the right thing to do. I feel like I’ve been the expendable friend for years and this really isn’t helping. Any advice? ",31Dec2018,1

541,"So here's a long story that kind of goes back over 10 years of friendship or whatever this is. 

We met in college and became friends. Back then, my ex said he didnt like her..but he had his own issues so I didnt listen to him. I had my own place to live and ran into a roommate issue. She wasnt getting along with her parents so it was perfect timing. She moves in and we hang out and things were going good. I didn't like how she paid rent late (mainly cause it was in my grandfather's name as a cosigner) but I got over it...

When the lease was up, I thought it ended in June..it was July. No biggie. We had just signed the lease for our new place together but we could easily change our move in date. She didnt want to and told me that cause I messed it up on the month, she wasnt gonna pay for last month rent. Asked me...what are YOU gonna do? 🤔🤔 So I made payment arrangements and ended up paying the old rent AND the new rent. After that and her constantly being late on rent and other issues I didnt like while living with her, I didnt get into another lease with her. 

From there I moved back home, she lived with her parents briefly and moved out on her own. I got with my SO, and she kept hers a ""secret"" after a previous really bad breakup for her. So around this time, me and SO move in together. Cool. I invite her to our house and she never came over! It wasnt until I invited our mutual friend that then she came over. After that I'm like whatever, so I have my SO come to a party with me and she was there. And they turned and got into an argument of trash talking from playing cards!  Of course ever since then they never got along..not even now. They both say nasty and mean things about each other. But now that me and him are married, she doesn't say much but she already said previously she doesn't like him at all. He always said he dont care about her but once she made a comment about his mother (who is sickly) he doesn't want her to ever come to our house. 🤔🤔

After that party he tells me..why does she compete with you so much? I never realized it..mentioned it to other people and they said the same thing!I never noticed but once he said it, I really started to notice. I told her that my bf might propose to me at my graduation party..she doesn't come to the party. I call her excited about other news and she says very sarcastically ""let me guess..he proposed"" and I said what? No..and told her what the news was...she said that statement 2x after that in other conversations. I said ok..weird. after a few months go by, she got proposed to. I'm happy for her! That's exciting! She asked me to be the maid of honor and I was happy! As she kept telling me how he did it, she slipped up and said she picked out the ring and he bought it and just didnt know when he would pop the question. I asked was she with him as he bought it and she said yes........🤔 to me sounded like she made him all cause she thought I was gonna get proposed to..but I brush it off and continue moving on.

I asked her numerous of times was there stuff she wanted me to do for the wedding, she kept telling me no, I had issues with my bf at the time so to help her would of been great to clear my mind. But as time went on, it became obvious that she didnt qant my help. I sat back and was like ok..no biggie then. When she picks the date..its my birthday weekend. I said man you picked my birthday weekend for the wedding? She tells me ""you can do something the following weekend and just skip your birthday this year"".🤔🤔..I thought...well ain't that some bullshit to say to someone! My bf didnt like it..and said that was rude and inconsiderate. So I said let's let it go and it's just one birthday. Drama still happened, she lost bridesmaids, and she kept saying she was having the wedding cause other people (her parents) paid for it so it's not about her. I would get mad and try my hardest to make sure I did things to make her day special. So I'm her maid of honor wedding was beautiful drama happened she was mad she yelled at me and I still was there trying to be her friend. 

A month later on Thanksgiving, my bf proposed! I call her and she says oh..congrats . Send me a pic. I send it to her and she starts comparing our rings!? 🤔🤔 I usually dont think about that kind of stuff but whatever. So I made my cousin the maid of honor and had her as my maiden and one more cousin as a bridesmaid. So I'm working out and trying to get life together and plan my wedding. I wanted to do an island but in September..of course that's hurricane season so I was kind of upset a bit. She told me a lot during her wedding that it wasnt about her and about everyone else. Well.....as I'm planning mines she tells me the same thing. It's not about you. Of course, that pissed me the entire fuck off! Of course it's about me! It's my wedding! So me and her have a huge blow out to where I called her a stupid ass bitch for not genuinely being happy for me. She goes to say that cause of her family and background then she's likes this and how I was a terrible maid of honor for hers, which she NEVER mentioned to me before about. And kept asking me if I still wanted her to be in my wedding. Around the date that I chose, it was a week after her other friends wedding that she was in and 2 or 3 weeks after her birthday. I thought it was good cause it was before hurricane season and after her birthday unlike how she did mines..I told her...listen, your gonna have a lot of shit going on. Your moving, your friends wedding..like it is ok if you can't make it to mines just be there for the reception....she kept saying she'snot missing it she'll be there etc.....still wasnt good enough. When picking out bridesmaids dresses she tells the worker..oh heres the asshole I was telling you about who decided to plan their wedding the month of my birthday and a week after I'm in someone else's wedding.......🤔🤔 I didnt say anything just laughed and started looking. Times goes on..and I ordered my dress online. I didnt want to show anyone until I got it fitted. I asked her to come to the fitting she misses it. I asked her to come to the next one...still misses it. I asked her to do a few more things for me..and messes it completely up. So I stop asking. She's busy. Got other things on her mind..I dont mention it. She goes on a rant about how she wonder if I'm really getting married cause I haven't showed her my dress yet....😐😐 I sent a pic of it with a bunch of other dresses and she says she hates them all and continues talking about herself. I dont respond nor say anything. When it came time to start decorations I have her come to my parents and she helps. It wasn't much and she said how she was gonna do this and that and this and that and never did. She then gets to communicating with my cousins about my bachelorette party. Both my cousins hate her now to say the least lol. Even tried to complain to me about them, but after hearing all 3 stories..she was the issue. 🙄

So fast forward to wedding day. She arrived literally 1 hour before it supposed to start..I was running late so it wasnt a big deal. The wedding was beautiful everyone in my family came and had a great time. We go out it was fun and we sing karaoke...she picks a breakup song to sing and it was awkward for all of us there. Everyone knows she doesn't like my husband so...#awkward.

Reception it was beautiful she kept telling me how beautiful it all was and everything. She said petty things but I shrugged them off and continued my day..she of course compared our families and our wedding together and I just ignored her..but then..

That's when I get pregnant lol..I decide not to t ell her. Cause I didnt want her to try to compete about that. I held off until my first doctor appointment to tell her, she says she's happy and she's not trying anytime soonand literally...she got pregnant right after..smh..so now....she's pregnant and I'm pregnant. She's been more sicker than me and I just been sleepy. No big deal. So as we are talking she asks me who the Godparents are..I tell her my cousin and my husband cousin. She says oh.....well then...I told her this information before. Plenty of times. Said the first kid, will be my cousin. The second will probably be her. So she goes to say that she's gonna make her friend the Godparent..cool (I honestly didnt want to be and knew I would be in the kids life) so some kind of way I make a mistake and thought she was talking to someone who was the age of 18..and I made a joke. She didnt like it and asked me why would I question her ability of raising a child and do I think she's gonna be a unfit mother or something....I never said any of that! Turned out she was talking to a 6 year old so it was a honest mistake. After that i kept my distance. I apologized and she kept going on and on about it. So as we are going on she says how the Godparent thing surprised her and she doesn't think family members should be Godparents..personal choice in my opinion (but considering that you and my husband dont get along and so much other shit has happened between us..I wouldn't feel comfortable having you as the godparent...but I wont say that) so I told her again, she would be on the second kid...

(Promise I'm almost done 😁)

So as we are both pregnant..she continues to smoke weed. Says it helps her. And even avoid going to the doctor cause she's smoking. I tell her that ain't for me and how bad it is, she does what she wants so I keep it to myself. She tells me how we have different views on parenting and she never really knew that I would feel certain types of ways that were different from her...I'm excited to start buying clothes..she doesn't see a need to buy clothes for someone who doesn't exist all the way yet. I call my baby a baby..she calls it a parasite. I'm excited for every little detail, she says yeah if it doesn't die before being born..like..what the entire fuck lady!? 🤔🤨 after a while I stop mentioning stuff about her with baby stuff.

So I find out I'm having a girl, I honestly can say that I was looking forward to having a boy first but I got over it quickly. And she tried to help me by saying that she would be cute in a tutu and girly things blah blah etc..cool I'm over it and I'm having a baby girl! I'm still excited. She says she will be happy with whatever...but She finds out what she's having and it's a boy. I'm still excited for her and she doesn't seem super thrilled. She even went on to say yeah I really did want a girl. I'm disappointed. I know the feeling no biggie. I'm still encouraging her to get in the baby happy joy and still negative...

Soooooo when my mom goes out and buys a tutu for my baby, I send a pic like hey. She got a tutu..expecting her to say awww or something. She says...who the fuck bought her a tutu? I tell her my mom..she says cool. I asked her some other questions..you can just hear her sounding like she has an attitude. I asked her if she like someone in a music group, she says..I only remember the names of guys who I fucked..😮😶😶 wut...? Clearly, her being mad about the tutu thing..

So everyone who has known about her and me and the history all say she's a jealous best friend. She's a negative person. She's always trying to compete..I need to stop being her friend. But then, she goes and says she doesn't have many friends and we say we each others only real friends but the reality is..we aren't. I hang out with her at least 2 or 3x every few months. She's not allowed at my house due to her comments about my mother in law (she lives with us) and my husband doesn't like how she likes to come over when he's not here. We literally onl talk on the phone and i tend to cancel plans with her and she does with me. 

With the new year coming, both of us about to have babies and our differences in so many ways. I really want to know if I should just distance myself even more until we just dont talk at all. She has mentioned before about us not being friends and cutting off anyone who doesn't want to be in her life. But the thing is, I've always told her if I do something that pisses you off...tell me. I'm a people pleaser. I dont like people mad at me. But I also dont like disrespectful people or people who are always negative.

 Is this friendship worth trying to keep trailing along?? let this friendship fade into nothingness?? Just tell her all of my issues with her?? Or just end it point blank??

Sorry it was so long lol..I wanted to make sure people know the entire history of this friend or frienemy",31Dec2018,1
542,"I have just read a post on r/Depression, where someone said he/she hear voices (yeah, suicidal voices). How can I report that? Btw. I ain't an American, I just wanna report it to moderator on reddit.",31Dec2018,1
543,"I'm 17, and recently been having thoughts about death, not suicidal, but just ''what ifs'' like ''what if I die tomorrow?''.

This has been on my mind since then.

Basically, I have a pretty fucked relationship with my family, but the weirdest part is that, my family don't even know we do.

Here's why:

I basically have had so many problems with them, and still do, that I gave up trying to fix them or tell them, they're too much effort, and would probably be too much of a shock to them, so I just decided to live a fake life, I guess, where I pretend everything is fine and normal, but it's not really, and we get by now days, I still live with my parents and my brother who works away most of the time, and we don't fight or have problems like in the past, but I still have so much inside me from the past that I have just kept to avoid the time and effort that comes with discussing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another, separate reason, is that I have a weird situation, where I am almost three people at once, I am very introverted, and I am basically one person when I'm around random people, and another when I'm alone, and another when I'm around my family, and I mean EXTREMELY different, I basically am an actor, I act as a different person around them, because I cannot be bothered to explain to them how I'm literally a different identity to what I used to be, (I changed my identity over a couple of years because of some shit in my life, I'm basically a different person, only 1/4 of me 6 years ago is still me.. if that makes sense.

It's very very complicated and hard to explain, and I would have to type this as a whole separate post, but getting to the point of this question:

&amp;#x200B;

I want to write down all my secrets, everything that I want them to know but don't want to bring up, and have them stored so that if I die, before them, they can read it after. But the problem is, if I do, and I tell them ''here's my secret diary/will that has all my secrets in'' then they would know, that I indeed, keep huge secrets, and it would be very awkward, but I am terrified of dying before them, and having them never know who I really was. 

&amp;#x200B;

It should be a human right to be able to keep your secrets stored and have it opened as a will after you die, at any age, not just when you're getting older, it should be free too. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how can I have a will that will allow my family to read about who I really am, if I die before them?

544,I just rescued a baby bird from the street. I dont know the species. Now it's in my house. I imitated a nest with my t shirt to keep it warm. What do I do?,31Dec2018,1
545,"so, short version: when my mom was 22, she had never had sex, wasn’t suuuuper interested, but all her friends seemed way into it so she thought (direct quote from her) “you can’t knock it ‘til you’ve tried it,” and went out with this guy from work who kind of liked her. they had sex, used condoms, she didn’t care to repeat the experience but very luckily for me, once IS enough, and condoms aren’t 100% effective! 

she basically told him she was having the baby (she had always wanted to be a mother - perhaps not quite so soon, but, life happens) he could be involved or not, and that she wasn’t particular about his choice. he went with not.

now, part of his choice was likely due to the fact that he was married at the time. still is, afaik! i have at least 2 sisters, who are older than me. 

i always knew like, i had a father out there somewhere, but there was a lot that came out as i got older. one fun fact is, well. my mother is irish. like, our whole family, v stereotypical irish last name, etc. i stick out like a sore thumb in all the family photos from when i was a kid, because one of these kids is brown! 

yeah. my father is puerto rican, but my mother didn’t tell me this until i was 13. she didn’t actually tell me at all - she had always told me his first name, but it was the shortened anglicized version of such. one day a friend asked what my father’s full name was (frankly one of the less invasive questions i would get as a kid - “what ARE you?” or to my mother “where’d you get her??” “where’d she get her hair??” vom). ofc i had no idea, so i asked my mother when i got home, and obvs i’m not gonna post his name here, but it made it v clear that he was latino and therefore so was i, and i had gone 13 years not understanding why the world treated me with a subtle undercurrent of racism. 

this is relevant because, well. i want to find my family, but i’m less.. like i know if he’s still alive, in order to find them i’ll have to deal with him, but really more than anything i want to have the chance to know my sisters, or at least know if they would want to know me. i’ve spent most of my life since i found out he was married when i was conceived referring to my father as “the adulterous piece of shit” so i’m not like, anticipatory abt that part, but the idea that there are people out there who look like me just... wow.

i’m 30 now, and when i was about 21 i found one of my sisters myspace pages (it’s since disappeared, understandably). i knew it was hers bc she had family photos, and my mother confirmed my father was in them. i was too afraid to do anything then and i regret it so hard.

they really do look like me. their mother is white, too. i don’t look like anyone in my family. i don’t speak spanish, i don’t know anything about being puerto rican. i never had access to any of it. i was the oddly brown child in the irish family and like, don’t get me wrong, i LOVE my family, i’ve just gotten to a point in my life where this feels like a significant missing piece. i tried for years to shove myself into the box and pretend i was exactly the same as my cousins and i’m not, but i don’t want to be just half a thing.

so i guess my question is, how does one go about finding people, like, on a level beyond google? i’ve tried that, and not gotten anything substantial. i have my father’s name, and a few towns he’s lived in, and the knowledge that he is likely still in the area. weirdly if he weren’t alive anymore (he was significantly older than my mother, who is in her early 50’s now) i would probably know and have a lead, bc obituaries are easier to find.

i guess i just feel out of my depths, and know that because i’m so emotionally invested i could easily be skipping/missing basic things or routes that would be helpful?

if anyone has any knowledge that could help, i would be incredibly grateful - and really if you read this far, i’m pretty grateful regardless :)",31Dec2018,1
546,"Hi, everyone. Two months ago I was involved in a hit-and-run by a drunk Lyft driver in Santa Monica, California. I was driving at around 10 pm at night, and there was a Lyft driver that rammed into my car while I was driving by, causing me to have a side mirror to be completely destroyed with a dent on the side of my car. I pulled over on the next block to see what the hell happened, and walked to the front of the restaurant where the incident occurred. Witnesses (whose names and numbers I had) saw what happened and pointed me to the ""intoxicated Lyft driver"" who pulled up in front of my car, took my side mirror that he destroyed and drove off. It was dark and I couldn't run fast enough to get a view of his license plate number and he drove away. 

One particular witness went up to me and told me that guy was supposed to be his Lyft driver, and texted me a screenshot of the cancelled ride, along with his picture and his first name. He described the car, which matched the description of the car I saw with the driver who took my side mirror and drove off. 

I called my insurance company, and they said they need to find who this guy is-- unfortunately, the witness was not obtain to obtain his license plate number and was in none of the records on his Lyft app. I called Lyft multiple times explaining the incident and also filed a police report, and they told me that because Lyft is a contracting situation, that they're not able to track the driver despite receiving the picture of the screenshot and a description of the car. They do not have any records on the information of their drivers, so they could not provide me a last name or a license plate number. 

I'm left with close to $2000 in damages with a $500 deductible. Any advice on how to track this person down? Insurance is being stubborn with the fact that they need to verify who this person is. Thank you!",31Dec2018,1
