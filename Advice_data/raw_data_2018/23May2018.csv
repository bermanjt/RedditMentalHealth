1,"Long story

I've posted about this before, but small parts.

Me and this girl have been together on and off for 3 years. I broke up with her like 5times and we would get together after like a week or something (I was 16 when we started) and everytime she would lose more faith that I would stay, which is understandable.

I was very abusive. I would lie all the time, for no reason. I would blame her for my depression.

I went to therapy for 2.5years, really worked on myself and I'm a lot better.

About a year into us being together, I finally got her to go to therapy, she had cut herself a lot and her family didn't talk about mental health so she was scared. She is now in therapy and a lot more open about her depression.

We aren't even officially together, we have been in a best friends with benefits things for over a year. She says I have to earn to be with her. Which is fine.

Almost daily we fight. To a point where I cry and she says I can't handle her. She says if I followed her instructions we would be okay. She wants me to come see her and call her every time she is sad. But she is kind of very mean when she is sad, so I don't really want to see her. So then she blames me for her sadness escalating.

And she always says, ""you're just going to leave"".

I want to die. I legitimately think shooting myself will be the better choice. I don't want to be the evil person again. I don't know what to do.",23May2018,1
2,"In terms of studies I had studied with somehow wealthy people, in private schools. In my family we are not wealthy but in primary and highschool, my parents could afford the school fees, so I had the opportunity to study in a milieu that I think is the source of my problems. after high school I went to a public university, Which is not prestigious at all, I made new friends now but the problem is whenever I'm on social media or talking with my old friends.... they're studying in the best countries or the best universities, Having a wonderful life, when in fact I could had the same, I was better than most of them ...

3,"Hi r/advice, I have a question re: sick days

It is 1am here. Partner has just come home from a ""walk"" turned sesh, vomiting and crying and generally needing looked after.
I am due to be up at 6am for an 8 hour retail shift, I also did not sleep well last night due a combination of anxiety and a late shift the day before

In addition, I had a hell of a lot of university work that I needed to do AFTER work today, for submission on Thursday.

It has become clear that if I go to work today, I will be wrecked and unlikely to finish my uni work. The submission day is ALSO hectic with other appointments and commitments, which, even if I can manage submission after three nights of less than 3 hours sleep, I'm gonna struggle with.

As uni is more important, I feel like the best course of action is to take tomorrow off.
However, all time off has to be allowed by our main manager via phone, we have to explain our reasons. I think that some of my reasons are too personal to discuss, and he is likely to find that my reasons are not good enough.

I have a relatively high level of sick by company standards, but my company also has high standards (I was sick 4 times in my first 6 months, but have not been sick at all this past 3)

Should I act on my gut and take the day to get my shit together, or should I white knuckle through it?",23May2018,1

6,"Hello! My name is Nicolas and I live in Colombia. I was born and raised in an upper-middle class household. I have always been what is traditionally considered as privileged as I have good life conditions in a country in which people still starve to death, this is the reason why many people think that I should be happy, but since I was born my dad a doctor has always been physically and verbally abusive towards my brother, mother, and myself. This has deeply weakened my mental sanity. All through my childhood my dad called me names because I was thin and just before I became a teen I got fat and he started insulting me because of this, causing a very big self-image problem in which sometimes I feel guilty for eating. Also my dad has beaten me up using belts, books, and other household elements or just kicked me, slapped me, punched me. The fact that my dad also beat my brother because of his low grades made me develop into an academic. Always seeking knowledge and getting high grades. This did not stop my dad as he continued hitting me for getting into troubles or because of my personality. I became a person who seems to be confident and arrogant because of what I knew, but deep inside I knew that the only place in which I could shelter myself from just how crappy my life was was in my intelligence, this caused me to surround myself from people like myself that are just not messed up. My mom finally just couldn't stand my dad's abuse and left. She hoped that we would come with her but we said no. She has always been loving, a bit strict, and a great mother overall so this hurt a lot. 2 months after she left she started telling me how my dad cheated on her when I was a week old, that she sued him because he grabbed her arm and thrashed her, that he did not want my brother, and other messed up things. She told me that she continued to live with my dad because she wanted us to have a dad. This all cemented my deep hate for my dad, but then i realized a way out. I knew and know that my dad will never accept the fact that I am gay because he has always been very restrictive of that and he even beat me up because I wasn't completely masculine as a kid that is why I am not going to tell him and I decided that once i graduate high school I will move to North America and never look back. I know that it seems just stupid to move because my mom is still here, but all of these years of abuse have made me a very self-preserving and cunning person. So I can think coldly and I know that this is the right way out. I have talked with my dad about me moving to Canada once i graduate and he seems on board with it. But sometimes I wonder if he really wants to. My mom wants me to stay but I can't. I am a very resistant person but I just can't go on. I don't want to live in a country like Colombia. I need advice on what I could do. I have worked so hard by learning even more english and getting qualifications in it. I will do anything, I am determined to get out of here and I will. The only way that I could beat my constant depression after my mom left and I realized that i was pretty much alone was by understanding that I can get away from here. I also have an Italian nationality and can speak it. My maternal family is very powerful but I don't know if I can find the support there.

8,"I always used to get a red bump around my lip area when I was younger. It always hurt like a bitch and it took it like 3 weeks to go away. My dad had them too and always told me that they were cold sores, which they were, but he never told me that it was the herpes simplex virus\-1. I always thought they appeared when I got a really bad cold and my snot messed with skin cells.

Luckily I haven't had one in almost 4 years, but I know it will be with me for the rest of my life, so it could pop up at any time. Should I be worried about this? Should I tell my future wife this? Why wouldn't my parents tell me that I had it instead of covering it up?",23May2018,1

They told me they wouldn’t make the sandwich until right before we left so it would be fresh. 

Fair enough.

We eat. We pay. Everything on the receipt is correct.

Waitress says she will be right out with the 2nd sandwich I order. A while later she comes back with a cardboard box. I don’t realize until after she leaves the room that the box actually had pizza in it.

Well, it took a long time to get our food and my friend had somewhere to be. Didn’t have time to wait another 20 min or however it’d be to make a new sandwich.

So we get up and leave with this pizza I didn’t order.

So the problem is that my partner really feels trapped and the reason for this is her parents aggression. Her mother is one of the closest people to her but is constantly on edge and demonstrates bipolar behavior, and this is causing her mother in turn to take the aggression and negative emotions out on her. She feels like I am the only person she can rely on and that her current position is too taxing on her mental. What I'm asking is advice for calming the mothers behavior or completely avoiding it. 

Keep in mind that my girlfriend is in no way rebellious, rude, ungrateful, or disconnected from her mother.

I (16M) am a sophomore in high school and play varsity tennis. I play other sports too, but really focus on tennis. 

Last year my freshman year we had an all senior varsity roster, except one spot was filled by a freshman, which was me. 

After the seniors graduated, I knew I was to be moved to the top spot so spent every single day (not an exaggeration) hitting and working on my skills. 

Through the season, I went 12-2 making me the number 1 seed for our conference of about 8 schools. However when it came to qualify for state, I choked. 

At our divisional tournament I needed to take top 4 of the 30 or so kids, and I was the favorite to take 1st. But I took 5th. 

I never let losses get to me, but for some reason this has been eating at me for the last week, with my coaches and community members telling me they expected me to do better. 

I guess all I’m really asking is how do I get over this funk without the traditional “you’ll get them next year” stuff I hear from time to time. I just dont understand why it bothers me so much when I try not to let it.

Have I done something wrong and don't know it ?  

  .While that may seem odd it's certainly nothing to get up in arms about,except one day while I was in our after school program to take a test we were all in our main hallway I decided I would sit next to this big trophy cabinet and while I'm sitting there  her and a friend(different from earlier) walk over to the other end of the cabinet and slowly make their way towards me and out of courtesy and social awkwardness I got up and walked away and as I'm waking way she looks to her friend and says ""do you want to know a secret"" which gets the motors running again on the theories.While for the most part things have been uneventful I have every seen her glancing at me every now and then,I still have no answers and now we're out school and I don't know who to ask for advice any more. 

          Then we get to the other day I went to were she worked to get some groceries(I went out of my way to find a reason to go there)and talk to her,but when I got up to the register all I could do was look down and say ""Thank you"" I never started a conversation with her and she never started a conversation with me.Since then all I can think about is how much of a coward I am,ironic since I could run into a house fire without thinking.It doesn't help that I've never had a girlfriend and don't know how to talk to girls that aren't my friends. If anyone asks why I don't ask her on something like SnapChat or Twitter,it's because I don't have any;in fact I don't own a phone because I don't want one,and I can't go out and try to find out myself because I work two  jobs and have to take care of a disabled parent when I'm not working(I have a r/MaliciousCompliance post with more on that).
 
          So I came here hoping someone can give me advice on what she might of said?What opinion do you think she has of me?Am I a coward for not talking to her?I feel like it's been tearing me apart for months because of the not knowing",23May2018,1
32,"So recently my really good friend went back to her ex. About 2 years ago she found out that he had been arrested and jailed for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor 14 or younger while he was 25. It happened a few years before they met and he spent 2 years in jail over it. Obviously he never told her, a mutual friend had discovered it and shared it with everyone. She was really disgusted at the time, distraught and crying and said a lot of his behavior made sense. There was also some other sketchy behavior from him, like starting sex with her when she was asleep, trying to get with 18 year old girls when they were dating and he was about 32. 

He also used to mentally abuse her by calling her a worthless whore all the time and really damaged her. He was also a pathological liar to an insane degree. Making up almost everything about his life. After their last relationship she was completely destroyed, came out of the relationship with a lot of scarring and issues.

Obviously I'm very worried about her. He told her the sex offender thing was just a big misunderstanding and the girl was a liar. She's convinced he's changed his other behaviors as well.

I’m currently 18 years old and will be starting university in September (maybe) but I’m not very good at college and I’m not predicted to get the greatest of grades. To my friends and family I’m showing that I’m confident about getting good enough grades and I’ve begun to lie to myself about the situation and how I’m trying to give off the perception that I’m not stressed. It has finally hit me that if I don’t get good grades then I have no idea what I will do with my life. This made me thing about how big of a hypocrite I am because I always preach to my friends the importance of being truthful to yourself and how not doing so is dangerous. I have unbelievably large amounts of content to cover in such a short time period and I’m on the verge of giving up. Upon discussion with my friend about this he seems to think I’m giving up, I denied this at first but maybe I am? I have not been this scared in a very very long time and everything is falling apart and there’s nothing I can do. 

The second thing I’m going through  is that I’m speaking to this girl who I used to have the hugest crush on 8 years ago. I found her recently and we began to talk everyday. I’m also scared that maybe she doesn’t feel the same way I feel? Although my feelings for her are not immense I still care about her and at the current rate we talk at my feelings for her will only continue to grow. I fear that she will not feel the same way and she’ll once again slip through my fingertips. Expressing my feelings for her is not ideal because she’s a very peculiar person and her views to all this love shit is different to most other girls. But this issue I’m not worried about as much. Any advice on what to do about her?

I’m a 29 year old Female of Indian/ Muslim background who was born and raised in Canada. 

I’m having some odd feelings regarding relationships and sex since my last relationship of 2 years ended with my 30 Caucasian/Canadian  boyfriend, 2 years ago. 

I’ve talk to guys here and there but have a difficult time building bonds or feeling comfortable emotionally opening up to them. Other than to feel nervous when I meet a man who I find attractive I don’t really have time to do anything or feel anything else. 

I’ve hooked up with my ex twice since we broke up, and both times the sex felt weird... I enjoyed penetration but everything else the touching, post sex cuddling, kissing was a complete turn off... although kissing men (I’ve never tried kissing women) has always been kinda gross to me. 

I recently hooked up with a guy I’ve known for a long time and we had hooked up a couple times way before I met my ex... I found him attractive... we were in a comfortable place for me... my house and yet again... beyond literally being penetrated I hated everything. 

Cuddling, kissing, and everything else was downright repulsive to me. 

There was a time I really enjoyed giving oral to men as well... but now I find it difficult too. 

I’m kinda lost as to why I might be having these feelings. Guidance and advice welcome. 

Much appreciate!

I would have to go interview with them to make sure we are a good fit, but it seems very accessible..

DC is subjectively a much nicer city than Detroit, but the cost of living difference seems too much to pass up. In DC, $70k doesn't get you that far. In Detroit it can get you a lot further. 

I've been told the DC option is on the table for as long as it takes to go and interview with Detroit, and if Detroit likes me, I will have the full option to choose either opportunity.

Obviously I'll have to figure this out myself, but does anyone have any thoughts on this? Any personal experiences living in either city?

42,"I have a somewhat unique problem.

I'm currently helping a friend of mine design a yearbook. She works for a Montessori Preschool. In the yearbook, we wanted to include some quotes from Maria Montessori, as she is the founder of the ideas the school is built on. The quote in questions is:

""Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed.""

My friend brought up the point that some parents may be offended by Montessori referring to children as ""he"".

My question is, is it a silly concern? Do you think people will understand that it's a quote? As a follow-up, if you do think it is insensitive, what are the rules for altering quotes? Am I allowed to add a /she while still claiming it's a quote from Montessori?

His ex will twist every word and action against him to make his kids thing he is dumb, or doesn't care for them or anything to get the upper hand.

52,"Hello. For some context, I'm going to quit my job as a bagger/cashier(but mostly bagger) at a grocery store. I work at a major, statewide chain and I hate it, honestly. I've been trying to make the best of it but I've had enough. I constantly feel paranoid and scared at work, and at this point I feel that I'm scrutinized. Examples: most of my coworkers treat me like I'm stupid, as well as two of the managers. This one manager seems to watch my every move when she's working; every time I look over, she's staring right at me, and if I make one tiny mistake, she's right there and makes me feel like an idiot for it. Other coworkers boss me around and make commands, rudely, despite the fact that they're not my superiors. There are a couple of employees who are really nice, but I don't get to be around them much or talk to them much because any time I do, I get chewed out for ""not staying busy."" I hate dealing with customers who treat me like I'm subhuman. You might say ""that's part of retail"", but they'll treat the cashier with respect and then treat me like I'm a rodent. I hate going out in the heat to wrangle carts, and often I feel like I'm going to cry because I'm fucking weak, and useless at wrangling carts. It's so frustrating. Random people make comments about it sometimes. It's also so, so loud in there, constant noise and stimulation, and I can't focus or deal with it.

Anyway, I'm sorry for that, I'm just done with that place. It's not worth it. However, I need a job, and I'm limited because I'm 17. I don't turn 18 until September. 

What I am ideally looking for in a job: not standing around the whole time but not insanely hectic, not having to talk to customers the whole time, not a FUCKTON of pressure, more relaxed. 

I know I can't be *too* picky, but those are just ideal things. By the way, I've had two jobs before, so it's not just me ""not being used to having a job."" And at those other jobs, I didn't feel so terrible all the time. It was better.

59,"Hey Reddit,

I really wasn't sure where to ask this because anyone I ask IRL won't take me seriously and I feel like I'm slowly losing it.

So for some background: I'm Asian, and I go to a pretty challenging high school that is mostly consiting of Asians or pseudo-asians. Everyone here has a certain type of drive and push that I'm slowly losing. I'm currently taking 5 H/AP classes and everythings slowly sliding out of control.

I've failed 2 tests this year, of which I've never done before in my life. I can't get above an 85 in math considering my strong math background and experience. Same goes for my chemistry class. I stated off the year with a C average. I used to be a god at Spanish, but now my first two terms ended at a C and a C+. In my history class I've never gotten above a C+ average yet my teacher still recommends that I don't drop and I continue onto the AP course. She's a really good teacher and I still don't quite understand why she thinks that way. My freshman GPA was terrible ~3.9 with  my current probably lower than that, and now I feel like I have no reason to put so much effort trying to get that 4.2 that I want. I got cut off my sport team, and I don't do any clubs anymore because I have a hard time commuting. Everything feels like a downward spiral

I feel like I try very hard and no matter what I do it all goes in vain. Sometimes I study from the moment I get home till 1AM but I still don't do good. I do all of the extra work, and everyone still says that I put no effort and a good-for-nothing. I kept on trying regardless of what both my parents and peers thought of me, and I was eventually by our 3rd quarter to pull mostly everything up to a B- or more, and acting some midyears. But now everything is down hill again

My mom gave up on me, says I'll probably end up in McDonalds and mostly makes fun of my failures. My dad trys but always fails to understand how I feel. My friends don't take anything I say seriously. Sometimes I feel like just quitting and doing nothing. I've talked to my counselor and all she told me to do was drop. I know that at one point I was better or at least equal to everyone around me, but I still can't believe that I've fallen so low. Everyone still thinks I do well, but I know they'll realize when I don't ever get into the college of my choice. I know all my mom cares about is her out Ward reputation and only wants me to get into a good college because I'd be a good badge on her.

Recently I've noticed that I can't motivate myself. I don't have that fervor to do everything in my power to get that A+ that I had a few years ago. It seems that I don't care and I don't try as hard as I could be but at the same time I want to achieve my goal. I'm not addicted to anything. No drugs. I play games casually. K-Pop. I have a girl that I like, and she sorta likes me back but I've been trying to not advance that relationship because I know it'll ruin everything. 

My parents observe all my communications now, thinking my friends are the issue. They're not. Their GPA's are 4.8, 4.4, 4.2. I'm the only one with one less than 4.0. I can't talk to them without consent. At home I'm completely alone except for my dog. Sometimes I just do nothing and stare blankely at the roof. Once or twice I've caught myself talking to myself as if I was in a conversation with someone. I just dream of how happy I would be if I wasn't so stupid. I've tried so many things. Rewarding myself with an hour of games. Slamming my head into my desk. Removing everything I enjoy and only focusing on studies. Different ways of studying. At this point I can barely pay attention and retain information in class. Everything feels like a blur. I daydream of that moment in another timeline where I took the right path. 

My extracurriculars are quite above the average. I really can't say more because if I do then I'll be doxxed (that's why this is a fresh Reddit account)

I'm not suicidal. No thoughts of suicide. I want to live and fix myself.I wish I could be like everyone around me. I want to fix myself, but I can't get myself to do it. I know I need to do it, but I can't scoure up the determination. I don't smile all the time like I'm known for, it's becoming difficult to force myself to smile and people have started to notice. I don't know what to do. 

I'm sorry if that was confusing. I just put everything in my head in this post. If anyone understands, what would you do?

Thanks",23May2018,0
60,"Hello r/Advice!

So me and my new wife are pregnant. We're trying to work out our finances on how we're going to support ourselves with a baby, as neither of us want to put a newborn into daycare. We want to raise our baby, not have someone else raise it for us. We don't have the option of only one of us working, as neither of us individually make that much. 

We've worked out that the best option sounds like her keeping her daytime job, because of the benefits that she gets, and me staying at home with the baby; especially since I do all the cooking and most of the cleaning/shopping, etc. So I would be taking care of the baby during the day, and then once she gets home and we eat dinner, I'd leave and go to work overnight somewhere.

What I need some advice on is what kind of jobs I could apply for that would be part time around the hours of 8PM-1AM. I've thought of possibly doing pizza delivery, but I'd rather not put the strain on my car if I could help it. I've also thought about doing overnight stocking at a grocery store, but I don't know when their overnights start.

What I'd love most is something work from home, like possibly call center work, as I have a home office that's quiet.

I figured anything around $12/hr and above would make it to where we're able to pay all our bills, groceries and other necessities, while still having a little emergency/spending money.

I have talked to a psychologist last year, trying to understand why I can't seem to/how I could, bring myself to study. Clearly failed.  
It's not that the topic don't interest me, but that I do loose my will to study and get result after the discovery part I suppose.*  

I have a highschool diploma, and that's about it. No experiences that would get me a chance to get a job. As a I implied, I am soon to be kicked out (well really I deserve it).

65,"I'd first like to start off by saying my dad is a phenomenal human being. If I grow up to be half the man he is, I will be proud. 

My mother on the other hand, I struggle with. Since I was a kid she's been emotionally abusive. One of my most prominent early memories is coming home after school (maybe 1st grade) to find out my teacher had called my mother and said I talked too much in class. My mother screamed at me for nearly three hours, saying I was a disappointment and that I was disrespectful etc etc. 

This has continued throughout my life, and it's only escalated further. She usually tells me how I'm an awful human being, how I'm selfish, how I make people miserable by being around them... it goes on and on. I am not without fault, and I accept that. Usually I am very hot headed, lack good impulse control among other things. 

Currently I am home from college, after being diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADD. My depression was so severe that I was cutting myself and was suicidal for months. I spent five days in a psychiatric ward (fucking sucks would not recommend to a friend), where all of these mental health illnesses were diagnosed. Because of all these factors, I thought it would be best to stay at home for a semester and try to figure my life out. I was additionally stuck in a pretty bad substance abuse problem of binge drinking and near nightly smoking to try and feel happy or regulate my anxiety. 

Initially, my parents were surprisingly receptive to the idea. I came home, expecting things to be kind of ok. My second day home I quickly realized that this situation was truly fucked (my mother spent about four hours telling me how disgusting of a person I was, how I was faking my depression despite the scars on my wrist, and even if I was depressed that I was doing nothing to get better). I decided to move out that day and bought a bus ticket to Atlanta where my sister lives. The entire time, I got text messages from my mom telling me it would be best for me to come back home, that this would not end well for me. The only reason I did go home eventually was when I got to Atlanta and saw my sister crying, since she was worried I would become homeless. Not wanting to see her like that, I agreed to move back home despite every cell in my body telling me it was not a good idea. 

It has now been a week at home. Things have only gotten worse. My mother told me Im to blame for all the problems in her marriage to my dad, how I am nothing more than a cliche and that should embarrass me, how I do not care for anybody outside of myself and on and on. 

I don't try to move out anymore but after my mother purposefully wrecked my room, took my laptop (which I bought for myself) and screamed at me to get out of her room when I politely asked for it back, I decided to take a walk. For context, this had started when I suggested I take a substance abuse program to try and fix some of my poor coping mechanisms. My mom quickly responded that I also used drugs and alcohol for fun (which is true, Im in college). It quickly went downhill from there. 

I did not make it far. I wound up crying like a fucking pussy in the field across the street for nearly an hour. When I returned home, I broke down and cried to my dad and apologized for being such a problem. He advised me that saying ""Im sorry"" and ""I love you"" to my mom would go a long way. 

The problem is this: I'm no longer sorry for the state of my relationship with her. Maybe she's right and I am a toxic person, but she is also toxic in her own right. She will never apologize and I am not a big enough person to shoulder all of the blame for this and truly internalize it. Things would be easier if I could do that.  Regardless, I did as my dad asked and I felt defeated afterwards. No matter how she treats me, I wind up apologizing which only allows her to think she was in the right the whole time. 

My question is this. Do I ever eventually stop apologizing and accept that my relationship with her is truly broken forever? Or do I try to find the ability in me to just let things go, despite all the years of personal attacks and insults I've sat through? I truly do not know the answer to this question and any advice would be really appreciated. 

Also, I know I sound like an absolute pansy being a practically grown man complaining about mommy issues. I get it. Please don't feel like you need to roast me about this, Im already aware of how pathetic I am. ",23May2018,2
66,"So I am sixteen, and I am in high school.

This week is exam week.

On Monday, it's final prep day. Tuesday is first and second exam, Wednesday is third and fourth exam, Thursday is fifth and sixth, Friday is seventh.

Today, Tuesday, after school I got out early cause of the exams. At 1 P.M. I left home to go to the local gas station and get junk food to help me while I prepare for the next exams.

While I was walking, I was like, walking on this grass field next to a road.

As I was walking I see thee cars all going the same way, the first car just goes through. I am a gay boy, and I am 16. Most people think I am more around 13 cause I am very like petite.

The second car was a truck, and I see this old guy with glasses roll down his window, wink at me and pucker his wrinkled lips. The third car honks at him, and they both speed by.

I was truly shook, like I had walked to the gas station tons of time before and never had any issues.

When I get closer to the gas station, the same guy drives by and this time it's from the shotgun seat with the window rolled up. and I see his silhouette staring at me before driving off again. When I get to the gas station I tell one of my friends who works there what happened, and they gave me two words of advice.

1. Carry a large rock with you.
2. Pretend you're on the phone talking to someone, and no one will bother you.

I did both things as I paranoidly walked home, and I didn't see him. Everything was fine.

But now I'm scared to ever walk alone again and I am paranoid.

I think he may have just been a dick trying to scare and /or mock me for my gay mannerisms. But I still feel paranoid especially cause I saw him drive into my neighborhood before coming back to look at me again.

71,"so my friend has been in a relationship with this guy for a couple of months. i accidentally introduced them at school which i regret immensely. they both dropped out anyways and i had to carry along all semester by myself while i had to deal with this other guy in my classes (my friend’s problem but now i have to deal with).

fast forward to end of semester;
i passed all my classes (second problem guy dropped out as well) but my friend is having many relationship problems with this guy. he disrespects her, ignores her, has shitty sex with her and constantly thinks of himself only. All the while i am supporting my friend telling her that she shouldn’t have to deal with this and she has to break up with him (only because he makes the same mistakes again and again and seems like he doesn’t want to learn to be better).

she always starts the call with ‘i think im going to break up with him’ which causes me to stress out. i hate when she does this because shes not going to break up with him shes just using that phrase to bait me in the conversation in which she talks shit about him but doesn’t solve anything with him. we discuss a game plan where she can discuss the issues of their relationship but as soon as she sees him, she places a metaphorical bandaid on a broken bone.


last week they got in a big fight where he is doubting their relationship. he gets back in contact with his messy AF ex, adopt his shitty ass family’s opinions of her and practically ghosts her. she keeps giving him ultimatums to which she breaks because she wants to continue the relationship despite the advice of everyone in her life. while giving her advice and helping her deal with this i lost two nights sleep, was a zombie for three days, and was constantly shaking from nervousness. i hoped she would move on but she didn’t.


when she gave him the last ultimatum he contacted her before so they talked. now they came up with this stupid ass decision to talk to each other in a week which only serves to delay their decisions on whether they continue or not. shes happy with her decisions but i believe shes ignoring the problems because shes convinced herself that she loves him and thinks that in her age she should be with someone. 


what has me angry is the fact that whatever advice i told my friend she agreed but later got the same advice i told her (about self-respect, how a man is different from a boy...etc) from other people and the internet and fucking showed it to me as if i didnt fucking tell her the same shit for three months. 

and she talks shit of hella people who were in the same situation about how the girl is fucking stupid for not leaving and now shes the same girl. im so angry with her that i cant even look at her anymore. just staring at her makes me upset.


not the fact that she is with this guy, is the fact that she used me for her comfort, ignored what i said when i was the only person in her corner and is now making a mistake that she admits is. 

her words: “if i want to make a mistake, then thats on me”.


but what issue i have with this is that she drags me into shit and when i try to help she disregards what i fucking said just so she can have a boyfriend who disrespects her. she is constantly telling me personal shit about him after i told her my hatred for him, is on her phone with him 24/7 (but complains when other people do that), talks about him constantly and talks shit about him so much. also me and other people are trying to talk to her because shes making the mistakes of people who shes talked shit about. im just mad because shes not the person who i thought she was and she is becoming like him: adopting a victim mentality. 


like im done. i dont want to be friends with her as long as shes with him. i legit want her to stop contacting me until her relationship with him is over. i dont have the emotion, the want or the energy to deal with her and this dumbass relationship. 


what advice can you give me? am i an asshole? am i wrong for feeling like this? should i do something to fix myself? or am i right? am i right and wrong? please help.

We stopped talking daily we still talk every once in a while and we have a streak of 200+ days (probobly irrelevent just providing all the details) She broke up with the guy she was dating because he was flirting with her friends. I would like to take her to dinner but i've never been on a date before or asked anyone out so im not sure how, i don't know whether it would be appropriate to ask on snapchat or like if id have to do it in person.

79,"A little backstory first: Me and this girl (both teenagers) started talking for about a year before dating for about 1.5 years. Broke up essentially because we needed time apart to figure out who we were as a person and grow. However, we both took the breakup hard and wound up not speaking for like 6 months. 

About a month ago, she got back in contact with me, we started talking again, she dropped quite a few hints to getting back together that I was oblivious to at the time. We've just been talking like friends since she dropped those hints, which I unintentionally didn't act on. 4 days ago I text her asking what she wanted us to be in hopes of clearing things up and possibly getting a second shot. She never responded...

Come yesterday, I got a message from her mom. She(ex) was at the hospital after attempting suicide, which apparently occurred 4 days ago too, but thankfully she's okay. I still love this girl and don't think I could stand to lose her. 

So I guess I need advice on what I can/should do in this situation. What can i do or say to fix my mistake of not picking up on hints and get another chance with her? And also, what can I do or say to maybe help with her attempted suicide?

I also don't really participate in the games boys like to play on snapchat and will usually just end convos lol.

I'm literally 5 ft tall and dress pretty vintage-(y?) so I don't reallly get how I seem intimidating but whatever.

82,"I have to get this off my fucking chest. It all started not too long ago when the brother actually had a crush on me first. At first I didn't feel anything. Just though ha that's sweet. But we grew closer,started being around each other more, now I'm having the same feelings back. We play around and joke around, but he's also come forth to me with his problems and opened up about his past. I've done the same too. He's touchy-feely with me. I don't stop it either, I'd be a huge liar if I said I didn't like it. He says a whole bunch of nice sweet things to me as well, and I'd also be lying if I said it didn't make me feel all warm inside. Now this is the part where I tell you that my best friend feels weird about this and would hate if he caught wind of this. But, actually, he doesn't! My best friend kinda encourages it. I caved in and told my friend that I have feelings back and his immediate response was, ""okay so?"" Then, my best friend he would feel happy for his brother if he was to date a girl as nice as me. He even said he wouldn't even find it weird if he caught us french kissing. Best friend has even looked at us and gone ""aww"" if we've done something cute. There's even a little on going joke my friend said that I have to marry him because he's not gonna find a better girl. Pretty sure he's mentioned me to his friends as well. I was trying to get something the other day from his friend and when he was talking to his friend over the phone he was like, ""no no no it's for *discardeds*"" When he said that I turned to my best friend was like why did he say my name like that which he responded, ""because he likes you."" I could go on and on about the cute and nice shit that's happened between us, but you get the idea.

So, it doesn't seem like a horrible situation at first. My friend isn't against it, there is a mutual feeling. Why don't I go for it? Well, the idea of dating him and possibly losing a friend in the process is terrifying. Despite how much my friend has kind of encourage my behavior, I've grown close to this friend and I would never want to lose them. I would never involve my friend in any drama that goes on between us, however it's still a huge risk. Two, the brother is a bit younger than me. Only 2 years. We're both still in high school. I'm about to graduate though. Not a huge age gap, but still feels weird.  Also he ogles at other girls. We're not together right now so it doesn't shock me that he does, but I guess that's just worth noting. (Hell, I ogle at other people too) 

I just don't know what to do. After today, my feelings only grew stronger. (needless to say it was a pretty good fucking day for me and him) I feel like in the past 2 weeks we've really gotten closer. Part of me says just go for it! Part of me says no don't it won't end well. Part of me wants advice on how to get over him and just be friends, part of me doesn't want to get over him and see where this thing takes us.

He has a really bad reputation of using girls, and then leaving them. He has never had a relationship last for more that 2 months, so this one is relatively serious for him, However that doesn’t stop him from flirting with every girl at our school (gf goes to different school). He is keeping other girls interests in case this doesn’t work out. I know they’ve gotten to about 2nd base, but that doesn’t mean anything for him.

89,"OK guys, this one is a bit silly, and the answer is probably as obvious as it gets:

I live in an old, 4 storey apartment building on the top floor by myself with my 4 budgies. This is the first time I am living totally alone since breaking up with my long term partner, and during my time of living here, I have become obsessed with singing. I'm not the most incredible singer in the world, but it's the thing I like to do the most, and it's usually what I'm up to at any given point when I'm at home. 

I've also noticed that the neighbour(s) below me (I *think* it's 2 guys but it could just be one) play guitar, and I believe they might be professional musicians. They sing and play amazingly, and it sounds like they sometimes have little mini jam sessions down there. There have been nights where I just laid on my floor listening to them. How wonderful to have such talent living below.

There was a night recently when I was blasting The Red Hot Chili Peppers album ""Californiacation"" and I could hear them drumming along.

I'm single, home often enough, and I'd like to meet these neighbours! I just can't tell if I have ever seen them around or not, and I don't think I have. It also doesn't seem like they are home a huge amount because it's only usually once a week or so that I hear them. Their apartment is directly below mine, should I assume they are the same apartment number as me (303), just one below (203)? Should I just go knock on their door the next time I hear them play? I mean it could be horribly presumptuous of me to assume they have any interest in meeting or would feel comfortable inviting the singing upstairs chick in. I mean... it's a weird idea, right? But I just want to meet them and hear them play clearly. You never know who I could meet, or what potential musically-based friendship could form.

My second relationship was right afterwards when I was 16 all the way up to my 20 years of age. She also had her psychological problems, but it wasn't as bad as he first one. We had one big disagreement (that ultimately led to our breakup) which was that she must necessarily be in an open relationship whereas I am necessarily exclusive. She had cheated on me a couple of times, and even then I forgave her and still trusted her. However, when she broke up with me she admitted to have cheated much more than she had ever confessed while we were dating and that really took a blow at my ability to trust my partners.
I'm currently dating an awesome girl who is absolutely exclusive and I can't really see her cheating on me but I can't help to feel phisically bad to be away from her because of the fear that I know deep inside I can't trust her, even though I do trust her on a conscious level and I really want this to stop.

103,"I don't know how to explain. I don't know why I'm called such names. I'm somewhat quiet but that doesn't mean I'd murder anyone. I'll tell you what I mean by this:

Just today I walked into my high school library and passed by a group of guys who stared at me, and I heard one say, ""He's a school shooter""

I recognized these guys as the same ones who I told to ""Shut the fuck up"" when taunting a little girl wearing a hijab. I walked on to the computer to finish my art exam. The guys kept staring. I heard one say ""If I saw him I'd,"" then he jerked his knee up into an invisible body, ""like that.""

That's just one example. I'm not making this up. People actually accuse me for being a murdering gunman. I have looked deeply into the school shooting epidemic, and have deduced it to copycat syndrome and retaliation to things individuals don't want to blame themselves for. These mainly among other things.

News companies spread these stories like wildfire. While being important, the stories are being capitalized off of. This is unacceptable. There are even memes, down playing important issues, that depict ""school shooters"" as a certain type. This is irresponsible as psychological types cannot be identified through a physical characterization.

I guess I need advice as to advocate against this idea that you should wrongly accuse an individual based off perceived behavior.

104,"Ok so, I’m a 19F and i’ve had absolutely no experience with guys until i started university this year (went to a girls school from aged 11 before), so for the first time in my life i had an actual guy friend. Thing is, i don’t exactly know what is normal friendship behaviour between a guy and a girl, so whenever he complimented me or whatever i put it down to oh it’s just friendship, but at the same time i wanted to keep some distance so he knew i wasn’t interested in a relationship. 
But anyway, we stopped speaking for a couple weeks and i didn’t go to our society events, but out of nowhere he starts texting me again, a lot. Like several times a day a lot, like several different random conversations i mean. I again, not wanting to let him get the wrong idea pretty much never started conversations, but we’d still end up speaking consistently throughout the day, morning to night. The conversations were harmless but he’d always find ways to compliment me, like call me cute or whatever, randomly text me super nice supportive messages, call me a queen a lot too (what an odd compliment). 
Like i said, no experience with guys so this of course was intense. Add this onto the fact that i’m a naturally awkward person, and that i didn’t know if he was moving to me or not, and i legitimately started dreading whenever i’d hear a notification because it’d be like damn, another goddamn convo that i have to respond to? 
To be fair i’m not a text person, like my parents who don’t live in the country to my best friends, i didn’t text anyone as much as i texted him. But also with him there’s the extra stress of what do i bloody day. 
At this point it should’ve been clear to me it wasn’t a fun friendship like it used to be, it felt like an obligation to respond now, and i hated it. 
So i wanted to take the scaredy cat route out and not deal with the problem directly, just kind of stop replying as much. But still, still he’d message. If i was online he’d somehow know and message me, if i left him on read he’d call me out on it instead of taking a hint, so i mean after 10 days of this i was really at my wits end, like legitimately stressing. I’m just so bad with dealing with stuff when i’m overwhelmed and for some reason i really was, so my friend who i mentioned this problem to once decided to act on her own and talk to him about it. 
She’s super blunt so i’m almost certain she bloody crushed him, she told me she called him intense and told him to calm down if he wants to keep talking to me. She also says she might have called him creepy but she doesn’t remember, and i just hope to god she didn’t because that’s just, kind of mean. I saw him the same night she told him and he pretty much ignored me and walked out when i said bye so, i know he was hurt. 
Anyway, the advice i need is, i want to make this better. Don’t know if we can make up like before he got weird, probably not, but i feel horrible thinking back to how it ended. Ultimately if i was a functional person who could deal with my emotions i could’ve asked him to back off a little, and stick to our normal anime banter, but instead all i did was complain about him to other people. Not to mention he hasn’t come to society events since then (don’t know if that’s because of me but...), and he was a really big part of the group. i don’t want him to completely cut himself off because of an awkward falling out, but i don’t at all know how to go about bringing this up after two/ three months of silence.

Anyways, I was a huge advocate for years, participating in major studies, radio interviews, representing healthcare in D.C, and even writing for my own advocating website. The immense amount of stress from having the disease and having family members with it made me pretty manic, and as the articles on my website started becoming more and more erratic, I felt my depression spiraling downward as well. I ended up attempting suicide this time last year, which landed me in the hospital for almost a month. Now, I feel somewhat shunned by the HD community. They never allow me to volunteer my time or efforts any more, claiming they “have enough volunteers” and so on and so forth, but I know they have all but completely discredited me based on what happened. I believe they think I m unstable to at least some degree, but I would really like to have my HD family back.

I’m not sure if my time would be better welcomed elsewhere, or if I should continue to persue this. I feel as if I no longer have my credibility and I don’t know how to gain it back. Help!!!

107,"Hi. So, I [23F] have been working at my store for the past ~2.5 years. One of my managers [mid/late-30sM -- let's call him John] sort of latched onto me pretty quickly. He's ~15 years older than me. Over the past 2 years, he has said a lot of things that are inappropriate. I get harassed by male customers (and coworkers) a LOT. Like, to the point where my old store manager had to warn my current store manager about it. John often uses these incidents as opportunities to sort of put himself in a good light. One time, he asked me to pick up food for him a couple shops over because he was the only MOD. I did it since it wasn't far. I got catcalled on my walk over. I told him I wasn't doing that again for him because I got catcalled, and this dude starts meowing at me. I looked at him perplexed, and he was like ""those are my catcalls."" That was a long time ago, but is representative of many interactions that we have had. No respect or sensitivity. Everything is always a huge joke to him. This weekend though, he absolutely, 100% crossed a HUGE line. 

There's one customer in particular that I have huge issues with. In the summer of 2016, I helped him, his wife, and small daughter for like 2 hours in the photo department. I even stayed late (manager approved). This guy took it super personally, brought me sushi, and gave me his number with instructions to text him when I wanted more sushi. He also wrote a yelp review about me, in which he stated that I was the most beautiful girl. This guy freaks me out. I hadn't seen him in like a year, and he came into the store and tried to talk to me. He comes in the following weekend (remember, this is after not seeing him for almost a year, and I work every single weekend without fail). I try to walk away before he can see me, but it's too late. He's walking around the store yelling ""WHERE'S FRAYEDPAGES. WHERE DID SHE GO."" I RAN to the break room. I mean a full on RUN. John was like ""wtf,"" and followed me. I told him what happened, and he's like ""He didn't do anything, so I can't tell him to leave."" so, I just waited. John goes outside, the guys comes up to him and they chat. I couldn't hear much through the door, but I think John said I didn't want to talk to the guy, to which he responded ""well, that's fucked up. that's fucked up"" several times. I watched him on the cameras linger for a while in the store and then the parking lot. I finally come out of the break room, and the bastard comes back into the store. I promptly turned around. He eventually left, and I haven't heard from him since.

Fast forward to this weekend and the reason I have to report my manager John. The stalker dude comes back into the store. John finds me and tells me to go hide in the break room before the guy sees me. It was too late, though, and I would have had to cross paths with him to go to the break room, so I just went to the stock room instead. John finds me in the back after a couple of minutes. I tell him that this shouldn't have to be a thing (meaning me hiding from a crazy customer). John was like yeah. And then he starts talking about INCELs and how if this guy is going to bother someone, at least go after someone in his league. I was like ""RIGHT"" because I know I deserve better, and I'm just sick and tired of this bullshit. But maybe that was the wrong response. Because then my manager was like ""You're way out of his league. You're like a 7, and he's like a 3 on a good day."" And then he starts talking about my personality. ""And that's even before we start talking about looks."" I was uncomfortable and just tried to laugh it off. The guy eventually left, and I was able to go back to working. I wish it had ended there. Today, John asked me if I was going to see him perform at a comedy open mic tomorrow night. I told him I have plans with my friend, and he's like ""Bring her along! Say, ""You should come see this guy who's funny, cute, and hot."" Thankfully we were walking in different directions, because I was like WTF. I panicked and said, ""Uh, she's my age and that's not her thing"" or something to that affect. 

I'm tired of this. Work is like a war zone for me, and I don't feel like anyone takes my safety seriously. I can't quit right now, and I can't find a new job right now because I'm moving to the other side of the state in August, and I don't want to have to take a pay cut. I'm super conflicted about reporting John, though. We get along well, laugh a lot, and have intelligent conversations. But I'm not attracted to him, and his advances are unwanted and inappropriate. But if I report it, it's going to make working with him hell. He really should know better because he is a manager, too. It's not just me that he hits on, but I'm his main focal point. We warn all the new girls that John will hit on them. People have reported him before, but nothing has ever been done. I'm worried about retaliation. I don't want him to lose his job. I just want him to stop. It's bad enough that I have to deal with horrible customers. I don't want to deal with harassment from the employees, too. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this?

tl;dr Manager with a history of hitting on me tried to ""comfort me"" by ranking me as ""about a 7"" compared to a customer who was harassing me who ""is a 3 on a good day."" Then today he described himself to me as ""funny, cute, and hot"" in an attempt to persuade me to drag my friend, who I had already made plans with, to go see my manager perform in a comedy open mic. This has to stop, and I need to report him for sexual harassment. But I'm scared about retaliation and the inevitable changes in our dynamic at work. ",23May2018,2

110,"I (21F) currently rent a three bedroom apartment with 2 roommates (both 21F). Backstory: I did not know either of the girls when I moved in and one of them moved in five months ago to take over the lease for my first roommate who had to move for an internship. Even now, I do not know either of the girls very well and have probably spent 4 hours altogether with them combined. I am in a year long lease that ends in a little over two months, but I have basically been living with my boyfriend for the last five months. Even though I don't really live at the apartment, I pay my portion of rent/utilities every month on time without complaint and let the other girls use all of my furniture and kitchen supplies that I left in the common space (90% of the stuff in the common space is mine but I don't mind sharing it). I decided to go to the apartment today to pick up some stuff from my room and check on it because I hadn't been there in probably 4 months. I walk into the apartment (with no one home) to see my Xbox and controller connected to the tv in the living room even though I had it plugged into my tv in my bedroom and had never brought it out of my room before. I was immediately angry because I always keep my bedroom door shut so they must have looked in my room to see what's in there and then taken it out without asking me whatsoever. Additionally, the controller was probably not in plain sight so they had to search my room for it. Frustrated, I immediately took my Xbox and the tv I left in the living room for them to use. Afterwards, I sent them a text saying that I came home to move some of my stuff and was upset to find my Xbox in the living room without anyone asking me if they could use it. And that I was especially disappointed because it was brand new/hardly used and I was thinking about selling it. Now after almost a full day, neither of them have responded. Additionally, I texted them two days earlier telling them how much the water bill was and asking if either of them were sticking around for the summer (we are in college so a lot of ppl go home in the summer) and neither of them responded then either so I don't even know if they are actually living there anymore, yet they still have all their stuff there. One of them has not paid me for her portion of the water bill for the last two months or told me what I owe her for the utility she pays for. Each of us pay for a utility (water, gas, electric) and then pay each other the difference so it is equal. My boyfriend thinks I should move all of my stuff out and maybe even turn off the water if they won't respond. I just feel it was really inconsiderate for them not to even ask about the Xbox then not reply when I told them how I felt about it. I'm not really sure how to move forward from here or if I even should... does anyone have any advice??",23May2018,1
111,"Over the past few years I’ve recently rekindled a few old friendships that I lost back in high school because I was off doing the high school experimenting with drugs and alcohol thing, but more recently it seems as if the friendships are more of a burden then they are worth and I’m not sure what to do with them.

When my friends and I all first started hanging out, there were parties, social interactions, plenty of acquaintances to be made, and a lot of activities to be done, but prior to me joining the service I feel as if the fun started to slow down a lot, and even more noticeably when I returned home on leave a few times. Always the same thing every night, playing cards(mtg), playing video games and voice chatting on discord. 

Whenever we’re in chat I always try to make them laugh by making a fool of myself which leads them to making fun of me like the stuff I joke about is true. They also like to express how “stupid” I am because I don’t have as much knowledge as them in the realm of computers, present day politics and world affairs because of he debates and discussions we had. Sure I say stuff when I don’t really know about a subject, but it’s more for input than to discredit someone’s knowledge of the subject, in hopes of learning more, they just automatically assume I’m dull.

I feel as if I’m becoming more and more depressed knowing I’m going to be coming home to this in a few months, and I don’t really want to interact with them at all. They’re all intelligent and I was hoping to learn from them, but they feel the need to flaunt it around like they’re special. They’re funny, but sometimes the stuff they say actually hurts, or it’s a recycled joke from someone else in the group. Some of them are generous, but others will take willingly and never return the favor in the slightest. (Whenever I did something for them that was at a cost of $30 or more and they’d try to refuse, I’d tell them “Just buy me a beer when I’m around and we’ll call it even.”) Even when I paid my 6 friends $150 breakfast one morning, thanks was given which is enough for me, but it irks me that the chance to refuse their offer to buy me breakfast was never given. 

I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but me being this upset to actually go home is making me think I’m not, and I don’t know if I’m the root of the problems, but I’m not the first person to not want to deal with everyone in this friend group. I just hope someone can point me in the right direction, or help me say what I need to, to try and keep these guys around, or get rid of them.

Sorry in advance for being all over the place with my typing, and the length of this, and thank you for taking the time to read and try to help me. ",23May2018,2
112,"I have to get this off my chest...please help me if you can.

A few years ago, when I was a junior in college, I tried a pot brownie for the first time with my boyfriend and his guy friend (let's call him Rick) in Rick's dorm. It was just the three of us; I was the only girl. Long story short, I had a really bad experience (they claimed I ate too much, too fast).

I saw something really disturbing--and I saw it so clearly--that I don't know how it could have been a hallucination, although they told me it was. Anyway, here's what happened, from my perspective: 

I was sitting in a chair in the middle of Rick's room, my arms wrapped around my legs which were pulled up to my chest, and rocking back and forth intensely. My ex was standing on one side of me and Rick was standing on the other, both of them facing me, and they were laughing and pulling their pants down--in a mocking sort of way. I remember having this intense fear that they were going to sexually assault/rape me (which was why I was shaking back and forth in fear).

The next day I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said the part about me rocking back and forth was true--that I looked really scared and freaked out--but that he and Rick never messed with me sexually. I didn't push him for more information after that; I didn't want him to think I was crazy, so I just dropped the subject. And I never brought it up to Rick, since he was my boyfriend's friend and we weren't that close. I'd only hung out with him on a few occasions.

It's driving me crazy even years later because I know so clearly what I saw and felt, but my boyfriend told me I had imagined it or hallucinated it or whatever since I just took too much and had a ""bad trip."" But I've smoked pot (although I haven't taken edibles again) and tried LSD multiple times since then and have never experienced ANY hallucinations or anything even CLOSE to this. 

If you have experience with pot brownies or weed in general, please help me figure this out. I really need closure :/ ",23May2018,1

116,"My SO and I have been dating for a few years, currently living together for over a year. I really care about her. But for the past two years due to a myriad of personal and family issues she is depressed. She has been suicidal in the past, and often admits to feeling suicidal when life gets stressed. She has been seeing a psychiatrist which is marginally helping.

We aren’t the same as when we started dating. She has no motivation, no ambition. She has bad days where she can’t get out of bed, can’t stop crying. I’ve given her nothing but love and support, but there’s nothing else I can do. Even though she has great days where she seems happy, they are still several “bad days” that seem to be triggered by any little stress she has. She will have a rough day at work and then cry herself to sleep and be totally shut down.

I am happy at the moment. I love her, I really do. But I don’t see a future. I can’t imagine having a child with her, when any bit of stress triggers this depressive state. Am I wrong to end things? And if so how do I go about that? I want to be honest but not cruel, and I don’t want her to kill herself.",23May2018,4
117,"I'm gonna try and make this short and sweet. Throughout most of my childhood, I was raised by an amazing single mom who did everything for me ranging from enrichment programs as a child to letting me go abroad three times throughout high school. Anyone who knows her knows the extent of what she does for me. And I've always been thankful. 

Side note: I'm very neurotic. Although undiagnosed, I know I suffer from some form of anxiety. A lot of this had much to do with my upbringing. In school, I usually did pretty well and earned a lot of praise from adults and peers alike.  So, this cycle perpetuated where I became overly occupied with how people of authority \(like teachers, adults\) and my peers perceived me and my intelligence. To this day in college, whenever I fear I say something stupid or answer an ""obvious"" question incorrectly, I think about it for days after that at random moments. Even with friends, if I make an awkwardly unfunny joke or say something silly, I think about whether their views on me and my intelligence and likability changes. Which I know isn't healthy or normal. 

Throughout my childhood, because my mother was so independent and had it in her head she needed to do everything, I wasn't really taught how to do basic skills until much later. And I'm still learning now. I wasn't taught how to cook \(besides extreme basics\), how to mop a floor, wash clothes until later, and other practical skills. Whenever I'm asked to do something that I don't really do often enough like using certain tools or knowing what to do in a ""common sense"" situation, I sometimes visibly struggle and get a small bout of anxiety which makes everything worse. In the end, I feel dumb as hell like I can't do shit. 

While I have invaluable skills learned throughout my academic career, I can't help but feel worthless when it comes to everything else. Sometimes my mother might make snarky remarks if the dots don't connect quickly enough in my mind when it comes to certain situations. Or laugh and make a facial expression that makes me feel even worse. So I was get somewhat anxious whenever I'm doing anything with her. Whenever I volunteer to do something \-\- something as simple as cutting up veggies for dinner \-\- she says she'll do it instead. Whenever I insist, she just gets upset so I let it go. 

For example, when she drove to help me move out of my dorm \(I'm a freshman in college\), she wouldn't let me do anything and often dismissed any suggestion I had to make the process easier. Whenever she notices my frustration when she does things like this, she'll use infantilizing language thinking it comforts me, but only makes everything worse\(Note: During move\-out she literally said ""I miss being your mom so much"" in response to my frustration as if her ability to physically do things for me makes her any less of an amazing mom that she is\). Whenever, I do simple things like take our plates away after dinner, wash dishes, or try and cater to her for once, she'll make this dopey facial expression and sometimes I feel so awkward and out of place like she'll always think I'm this child pretending to be a decent adult. Whenever I do simple things like sweep, dust, and come up with \*surprisingly\* smart suggestions, she'll be like ""I'm so proud of you"" For awhile, I thought she was joking and just laughed along. But after the first few times, I began to think she really meant it as if I'm this lazy, idiot who can't provide for herself. Note that I went abroad long\-term twice during my high school years and managed to provide for myself just fine. So I'm confused as to why she acts like I can't do things for myself. 

I feel like it's gotten worse now that I entered college. Like whenever I talk to her sometimes, I feel like she's either not listening or dismissing it like it's trivial silly talk which it sometimes is since I joke a lot with her, but recently, I feel like I haven't been able to hold a good conversation in person with her anymore like we used to. I worry about her and if she's okay or if it's something I'm doing wrong. She told me that during some period she's been feeling down in my absence. I try and reassure her that I'll always be there, but sometimes she seems to dismiss it. 

I don't want to seem like I'm ungrateful since I know there are children out there who don't have people that care about them, people that'll help them achieve their dreams. I love my mother. She is my whole life. But it's only now that I'm realizing the impact of my upbringing in more a of negative light. What can I do to help myself change into someone more independent? How do I approach her with my concerns? What should my next steps be?

122,"I'm 20 and live at home with my parents while going to school. We've always struggled financially for as long as I can remember and so I want to apply for CalFresh.

My mom doesn't ever deal with the taxes since they do a joint file. Basically my dad handles everything from taxes to insurance to bills. Everything. My mom has always been a stay at home mom and that's what she's good at. She doesn't like to deal with the finances so she knows very little about it. She did however mention that my dad ""was worried about medical and doesn't want to apply for CalFresh or something like that..."" She didn't seem to sure of what he was talking about. 

So I asked him in the car today about that and he said, ""You don't want CalFresh...They look at the household and then they start looking at you more closely. And you don't want to mess up MediCal either.""

I tried to get clarification and told him I do want CalFresh if I'm eligible. We're struggling and any help is welcomed in my mind. He said, ""We don't want to be a charity case. And you don't wanna rock the boat. Especially while you're getting financial aid and we're on medical; you don't want to screw anything up accidentally.""

It just seems like he's hiding something. But I can't figure out what it might be. Or maybe he's genuinely concerned about CalFresh affecting something??

I gained weight, started having really bad acne (not anymore but I have a shit ton or acne scars), and just overall felt ugly in comparison to everyone around me. Because of this I became even more of a loner. 

I have hardly no friends and my social skills are awful. And I have an awful sense of style and don’t know how to apply makeup well.

124,"I'm a 17 y/o male about to finish off grade 12 and head to uni in the fall. 

My dad's been drinking for a while now, but recently it's been getting progressively worse. His mom (my grandmother) recently passed away and I assume it is because of this that his behaviour is deteriorating. Every time he gets drunk he acts like a completely different person, and my mom gets really mad and starts yelling/throwing things/hitting him. Whats worse is that my dad sometimes drives out to get more, and no matter how hard we try to stop him, he always finds some way or another to obtain more alcohol. 

We've been trying to talk to him and to figure out the roots of the problem. When he's sober he makes us promises about next time but he never holds them.

Every time he's drunk its a new argument, a new problem, something else that's broken.

It's really starting to affect all of our lives. My mom, my brother, and I can't sleep. I lay in bed fearing that no one is hurt the coming morning. Im scared for my younger brother, because he still has a couple more years of high school left. Days have gone by where he's not been sober, so my mom has to take off work to sober him up. His work assignments are always overdue, and I am scared he might lose his job, or worse, his career. 

Now, you have to understand, when he's sober my dad really is a good guy. He knows it's wrong and he tries really hard to be better. The problem is as soon as he starts drinking, he doesn't stop, and it all goes downhill from there.

I'm just really, really lost right now. I have absolutely no clue on what to do. I love my parents, but watching them hate each other day in and day out really makes me sick. When he's drunk I am basically powerless to stop him, and I can only do so much to keep the 2 of them apart.

So a little back story, I went to school with a girl who we will call Sasha. She was nice, smart, and pretty. I developed a crush on her when we were both 15 and one day told my friends.

Turns out she liked me back but because of her parents she could not date till she was 16 but we both started to text each other. We talked a lot and after a year went by I decided to ask her on a date. She said yes. I was so happy as I walked home from school that day. Well an hour or so later I get a text from Sasha about how she thinks us going on a date is a bad idea and she just wants us to stay freinds. Im heart broken and kinda angry that she kinda lead me on but If she dosent want to go on a date then Im not gonna force her too.



 A month or so after that I started to develop severse depression from bullying and lack of self-esteem. My parents helped get me into counseling and my freinds Sasha and David help me through it. My freinds even going as far as to talking me out of killing myself. Me and my family then move to a differnet state not long after that. Even before I leave Sasha jokingly says ""Dont forget about me when you move"" After talking for a year I kinda forgot about her and we stopped talking all together. 




Fast forward to now and its been a year  since I last spoke to Sasha. I found out today by my close friend, David, that she is kinda having problems at home, as in she left home when she turned 18 and now lives in a van down by the river (no joke, Im being a 100% serious). Part of me wants to try to contact her again to see how she is doing. The other part of me believes she doesnt like me at all anymore and should not try to contact her. I also plan on going back to my old town in a month or so because I still have family there and I wanted to kinda hang out with old freinds.

TL/DR: A girl I had a crush on became a freind and helped me in a rough patch of my life. I moved and grew distant from her but I am now thinking of contacting her again. What should I do?",23May2018,1
129,"So I'm 31 and living in a suburb of Portland, OR, making about 25k a year teaching guitar and working for the family business. I work six days a week and things are really hard. Rent in Portland is insane. I can barely save any money. I have three roommates, all severe alcoholics\-\- which is great because I just quit drinking. Also one of them has some seriously horrible habits. I just found out that he stores his urine in glasses that everybody drinks out of and then dumps it down the kitchen sink. His room is right across the hall from the bathroom. Also, the other day they got really drunk and pounded on my bedroom door while i was trying to sleep, they wanted me to party when I had to go to work in the morning. I woke up the next morning and the place was trashed. The lamp was in two pieces, its bulb was in shards all over the carpet. My laundry basket was destroyed \(shouldn't have left it out\). 

Long story short, my mom wants me to move back home. She is planning on moving across the state to be with her boyfriend and wants somebody to be home watching the house. If I don't do it she's going to get a tenant. If I do it, I would be taking over the business which would make me significantly more money, and the household expenses are way cheaper. I could pay half of them and reduce my own expenses 40&amp;#37;, and raise my income a lot. It seems like it should be a no brainer, but I'd have the stigma of being a guy in his 30's who lives with his mom. But why should I slave 6 days a week to pay rent to landlord that doesn't give a shit, to live with drunks, drink out of their urine caked glasses...etc

 My mom isn't financially stable either, and I could really help her out by moving back in.

Gonna go get the pictures I need with it tomorrow. If you don’t know already, this is what love does to you.

It drives you to do things that look literally insane on paper and in practice... move across a continent, not only that but a different country as well.

I’m going to be honest and say I do want this, I’m scared but I want it. And I promised her. A years time and we talk about moving in together. May 22nd 2019. 

We are both adults (I myself barely so) I make my own money and she does too. 

I keep telling myself I want this but I don’t know what my parents will think... all upidty about me not moving out until I’m married. I need to distance myself from them while maintaining their support because it’s what I want. 

My dad is going to be extremely hard to convince... I don’t even know where to start with that. He’s too religious, doesn’t care that I’m an adult, I live under his roof and abide by his rules.its what scares me the most.

131,"Today my friend was caught using the scissor of a Swiss Army knife (owned by another student, and given to him minutes prior)  to cut pieces of paper for a school project. Our gym teacher saw him using it and told him that he would personally confiscate it until the end of the day and then give it back. My friend obliged. The gym teacher then went on to call the dean about the incident and the dean had to tell the principal. 

My friend has over a 100 average, has never been in trouble, and is going to a top university was given 5 days of out of school suspension, a superintendents hearing, and threats of arrest. We are also high school seniors with only 2 more days of classes and there is a chance he won't be able to go to prom or walk at graduation because of this incident. 

We believe the extreme punishment may have been given out by our principal because she has always discriminated against our friend group specifically, even accusing us of using steroids and being high in school.

An introduction about myself, I am 20 years old, and I live with 2 older brothers and my parents. 

My dad and I are currently the only 2 sources of income in our household and we manage pretty well. ( I work retail at slightly above minimum wage but income is income).

Anyways, one of my older brothers, let's call him Brother A ( because I have a wonderful naming sense)
has been taking advantage of my parent's house.

So for the past 7-8 years, he's been living in the basement, playing games like League of Legends and recently Fortnite for about 12 hours a day.

 He hasn't gone outside and isn't sociable with anyone in our family. He refuses to help around the house or with even basic cleaning, let alone  even talk with us. 
For the most part, he is rude and disrespectful even to guests. Sometimes he is OK, but if you try to talk with him while he is playing his game or even if someone enters the basement he becomes defensive and aggravated, and usually results in him just yelling get out and a lot of insults. The few times he does leave the basement is to reset the router because his connection is bad (despite we have rather good internet service)

Brother A also asks my dad for money "" an allowance"" which he spends on skins on the previously mentioned games, to which my dad complies with because he wants to support us which is good, but I feel that it's been too much support and Brother A had become too depending and feels that he is obligated to receive anything he wants. 

There were occasions where we got into really heated arguments and when my parents stepped in he started to blame them for reasons as to why he doesn't have a job, girlfriend and other things that other people have at his age. 

And my parent are getting up there age-wise and cannot reprimand him, because he would retreat to his bunker(basement) and become antisocial again.

I confronted my parents about this, and my dad has tried talking to him, but is usually dismissed by him, and he refuses to listen to my mother.

I have tried to get him to apply to jobs or at least try to decrease the amount of time he plays his games. 

I want him to get it in his head that our parents LITERALLY are not going to be able support us any longer and that he needs to start looking at his future.
That his accomplishments in game do not amount to much when trying to survive. The temporary high from playing and winning games is an addiction that he needs to get rid of.

But, he refuses to listen and I told my parents that we should try limiting the internet speed, or even kicking him out of the house for a day or two for him to realize his situation, but my mom would not kick out any of her son's on the street as long as she lives, and my dad has given up on trying.

I also suggested on getting separate WiFi connections, so that he doesn't bother any one else (because he constantly tampers with the router, one point disrupting an interview I had for a better job, and sadly I didn't get the job because of it.)

So yea, there's alot more to say but I don't want to write an entire book. 

And this is from my biased perspective and I am open to criticism of myself, because I can be wring too in my outlook on things.

Advice on getting him to become more independent and not a dickhead would be greatly appreciated",23May2018,1
134,"So a while ago one of my girlfriend's guy friends made a very inappropriate remark about having sex with her (I already asked for advice about this in an earlier post) he did it again a couple weeks later and she told him to stop and he apologized and blamed it on his ""mental issues"" and his ""dark sense of humor"" and my girlfriend felt bad and forgave him because apparently he doesn't have any friends and wants to kill himself. She asked me to get over it and to try and be his friend and I was hesitant and didn't really try to change my behaviour towards him. Earlier this month while I was in 6th period (she doesn't have a 6th) I let her take my car to go get starbucks and it wasnt til after she got back that she told me she took him with her, in my fucking car. This led to me losing a lot of trust in her, she apologized but I felt so betrayed and angry. Flash forward a few weeks, she logged into her instagram on my phone and forgot to logout, I saw this guy messaging her and started to search through their messages (I know it's a complete invasion of privacy but I felt like I was going crazy thinking about this) and I found that he kept up the inappropriate behaviour, he sent ""memes"" about cumming inside her and recently he called her cute and said she had a nice ass and then said ""tonight I'll try and stay up so we can send pics, cause i know I've fallen asleep every other time"" and she said ""no pics"" and then he kept bitching about it and kept asking her but she didn't say no in a serious way as if she wanted it to stop. She kept saying stuff like ""stop! 😂😂😂"" or ""nice try"" instead of something like ""hey, this is inappropriate and I'd like you to stop"" so now I don't know if anything happened when they were in my car, if they had done this before because he said ""every other time"" or if she actually wants this behaviour to end which she said she does. Apparently she's only his friend because she'd feel guilty if he killed himself. I feel embarrassed and stupid, he obviously doesn't respect me and she doesn't either because she didn't mention this at all. I've lied to her before about smoking weed and about a gift my ex bought me but I've always remained loyal and she's even made me cut off contact with female friends which I did without hesitation. We just had a big fight about being truthful and not lying and now she does this. Do I confront her about it? Do I leave? I went through her private messages which is I know is wrong but I feel like I can't trust her. What do I do?",23May2018,2
135,"I am the male on the end of this for reference. So I had a thing with a girl who I immediately stopped talking to after for personal reasons, she told me she was on birth control when asked and come around 3 weeks later she texts me saying she might be pregnant. Results will probably be done tomorrow or the next day or so, positive on a pregnancy test but the brand are also very known to be faulty and was a digital. Basically all the back story there is.

Now, Im 23, I dont have a good job (still only making $10 an hour), have to move out soon on my own and need to figure out my own life in general. I want nothing to do with a child right now and it is the last thing I could need/want right now but she wants to keep it. She also admitted to fully wanting a kid which leads me to believe that she did this on purpose. Is there anything I can do to not have to be a part of the childs life if she is in fact pregnant? I know this is extremely shitty to say but theres no physical way I can pay for child support (I will inevitably end up in jail from lack of payments) and I want nothing to do with the girl or the child because I dont want her to keep it but in the end that is her choice. So whats some advice I can use for this situation as I am slowly creeping into madness and if she is in fact pregnant with my child I dont know what I will do with myself.

136,"of course, despite having way more internal problems with myself i should be trying to deal with, i can't help but constantly think of that one ""special person"" in my life. its a common and natural thing to feel this way i guess, but here i am. i guess the real problem is i don't know *how* to feel. 

a part of why i like this person is how they make me feel, and it surely can't be happy to rely on them to give me the happiness i can't give myself. i hung out with them till 1 in the morning like 10 days ago and i already miss them so much. i'm sure they don't feel the same of course. i've been trying to limit my asking them to hang out- i don't want to be that one clingy friend who is constantly begging for attention (though i admit i miss the weeks we used to just sit in my car for hours and talk). 

i'll admit, i know i have low self esteem. and i know that yeah, my view of reality is probably kinda warped. but nonetheless, i think it's time i stop having false hope that this person could like me as more than a friend. he says he hates how A clings to him, yet they look like a happy couple whenever i see them in the halls. i don't belong. he said he really did like hanging out with me but despite all the times he's said that i just don't believe it- there is nothing to like, im an ugly a ball of problems while A is full of life and personality. she'd be better for him. i really just don't belong. i feel guilty to even think of loving him. 

my self hate has gotten to the point where i feel guilty to feel happy. i don't deserve it, etc. i know it's bad, but at the same time i guess i'd rather be honest with myself than think i'm better than the piece of shit i am. he shouldn't have to put up with my problems. 

i almost thought of talking to him tomorrow. it's been over a week. thought of saying ""hey, how was your last day of school"", taking some, and maybe even suggesting to hang out friday. but in the end it's just selfish. i don't want to waste his time and in sick of trying to pretend he likes me, even as a friend. and hell, even if he did enjoy my company, he really shouldn't have to deal with my problems. i'm selfish not to isolate myself, or selfish not to pretend i'm fine when i don't. 

it's so ridiculous. no matter what's going on i can never seem to be happy for more than a moment. it's always just stress, hate, or numbness. i almost miss living with my mom, because at least then i was able to feel anger how no one believed me. it was a feeling, i felt alive. now it's all just anxiety, stress. i haven't been able to sleep because i keep running over thoughts of him in my mind, thoughts of my self hate, thoughts of how i wish i was happy. ill down a bunch of nyquil, turn on loud fans, have the room pitch black and yet my mind still keeps racing. i can almost feel my hair falling out from the ball of stress in my head. 
guess that's why i'm typing this. 

i know if anyone happens to waste their time reading this, they'll feel inclined to say ""nahh go for it, he wouldn't hang out with you or say he enjoyed your company or let you stay at his house till one if he didn't enjoy ur company"" but you just don't get it. you haven't seen how A and him look together. how disgusting i am. god i hate myself. 

i think i'd pay a lot to just wake up in a new body, in a new life, a head that felt right. to feel normal emotion, and maybe even feel happy. i feel like i'm going insane, i want to cry but the moment i start tearing up anymore i feel guilty for letting myself feel sad over someone i don't deserve so i can't even cry. part of me wants to start cutting again honestly, just to feel something. but i promised him i wouldn't, we've both been clean for so long. i don't even know why i care though. he's barely talked to me since we hung out that one night, he couldn't care. of course he did text me for a few of the following days. maybe it's my fault for never starting a convo. but that's too unrealistic. and i'd rather hurt myself than annoy him or force myself into his life, one i clearly don't belong in. 

i'll just shut up this is way too long. ",23May2018,1
137,"Long story short: Childhood friend of mine has been partially renting an apartment unit that is shared with the family. We had a dispute over where to put things and I'm not good at talking calmly with people who I consider family, especially when I'm frustrated because I think they're being unreasonably selfish.

I ended up raising my voice when she kept repeating herself and refusing to give any solutions to her demands. I apologized for doing that but she said she forgot or didn't hear it and wants me to apologize because ""she will not tolerate being talked to that way"".

I told her that I can move her stuff out and pay the rest of the rent if she wants to but she declined. 

I could apologize, but I wouldn't mean it at all and it would sour our relationship further. For some reason, I would rather move her shit out than apologize because I don't feel that I need to.

142,"I know very little about cars, as does everyone in my immediate family. So I’m not super sure how to approach this situation. This is the first expensive repair job I’ve had to do.

I live just outside of Phoenix, Arizona. I drive a 2008 Ford Fusion with about 133,000 miles on it. My brakes were totally shot when I took it in. I had been driving it for a while with these issues, which I’m definitely sure didn’t help the cost but I had very little money in the bank and wasn’t able to get it fixed right away. Brakes were making a grinding sound and pedal was very, very loose. Definitely significant issues, no doubt about that. 

This mechanic shop has 4.5 star reviews, and had been recommended to me by a few friends. 

So I take my car in Saturday morning. I give them the above information, they tell me they couldn’t do it right away because they were busy at the time, but should be able to get it done Monday and will give me a call that morning. Monday arrives, and I don’t hear anything. I give them a call around 4pm just to see what may be going on, they didn’t have an answer for me. I finally get a call at almost 6o’clock, shop closes at 5:30. I was told it was going to be almost $1600. Not looking at the exact numbers right now, but they were doing 5 things-

1. Replace Brake Booster- said this was absolutely necessary and car wouldn’t be safe to drive without it. Would cost a bit over $600.

2. Replace all brake pads and rotors- said this one wasn’t as immediate of a need, but still presented some danger and needed to be fixed relatively soon. Cost was in the low 700s.

3. Brake Fluid Flush- I know most of the time fluid flushes are bullshit, but they told me it was definitely important to do if they were redoing the whole system. About $115, so not a huge deal to do with the cost of the other two.

Other two things were synthetic oil change and air filter, which added up to about $85.


After tax, this all came out to be about $1575. Which was I price I was not quite ready to hear. I was told it could be done the next day without a doubt. I knew this was a premium price based on what I had researched online (through RepairPal) and heard from friends who are more knowledgeable than I, but really didn’t have much choice because I needed my car done today. So I reluctantly gave the go ahead to get it done.

Tuesday morning, had my dad drive me to work. They send me an email that everything should be good to go, they had all of the necessary parts and it would be ready for pickup later in the day. So both my dad and I get work off early so I can come pick it up before the shop closes. I don’t have access to my cell phone during work hours-which is something I made very clear to them- and had to skip my last break to make up for time from leaving early. I had missed a call just before I got off, so I gave them a call back. The brake booster they had installed was defective, and they couldn’t get another part out until tomorrow afternoon. I told them this was unacceptable, as I needed the car that night. The whole entire reason I didn’t get a bunch of estimates from other shops was to make sure the car got done that day, which I had been assured it would have. I had made it very clear that I needed my car, but they said there was nothing they could do.

I do understand that a part failure is not something they can necessarily control, but when I receive a guarantee that it will be done by a certain day, I feel like it should be. 


So I’ve got a few questions-

How expensive is the price compared to the work they are actually doing?

How often does it actually happen to where a “new” part fails and the repair can’t be completed on the specified day?

Is it likely they do anything to compensate me for lost time since they had told me it would be done and I made arrangements to leave work early?

Am I totally off base here? Is this standard operating procedure? Or am I getting bent over? 

I really just know very little about this whole process, but this has been an educational experience to say the least.

I would love to hear some answers from mechanics specifically, but anyone with input is welcome to comment. Let me know if I’m totally wrong here, and if there’s anything I can do to rectify the situation. I just feel deeply dissatisfied on all counts- the price, the service, the communication.

Thanks in advance! ",23May2018,1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So there was a girl I like, for the purpose of this story, her name's Erica. 

Erica and I met through a mutual friend (Nick), and she's a very shy, introverted person generally, but gets comfortable as we all do after some time. She's very intelligent, polite, well spoken, gentle, empathetic, but also very proper and formal about a lot of things. Always very composed, doesn't allow emotion to interfere with her conduct, and also, to a degree, she's very innocent. 

We got closer over time, texting every day, chatting and meeting as often as we could. I developed a crush on Erica, and after a month of telling myself that I shouldn't ruin anything by making a move, I learned that she had a crush on me too. We talked, decided that we didn't wanna start a relationship, and it was just better to stay friends. She was nervous things would deteriorate, but I'm of the belief that nothing changes, as long as we're open with each other, and talk about things as they come up. 

Things go fine after that, and we're closer, if anything. We keep chatting as if nothing happened, still teasing each other, making jokes, talking about everything possible. Then suddenly, the texting stopped from her end after a few normal months. An entire 24hr cycle passes with no texts, so I message her (around 6.00pm) to ask her if everything was ok. No reply, so I let it go. The next day, again no texts the whole day, so I get a bit worried, because it's really not like her. I text again around 5.00pm or so. I then text Nick to ask if he'd heard from her, and if she was ok. He replied a few hours later, saying he hadn't heard from her, and just at that moment, I get a text from her. 

She replies to my text asking if everything was alright with, ""Not really"". I assumed something bad happened, maybe aother death in the family (her grandmum had passed a week or two before this), maybe a problem with her work, so I ask what it was. She just said something along the lines of, ""Don't worry about it, it's not a big deal"". When someone says something like that, I panic, knowing I did something that hurt or upset them. 

After beating around the bush a while, she finally admitted something was off between us. She didn't wanna talk over text or over the phone about it, and said we'd talk when I got back from a family trip I was leaving for 2 days from then, but I'm the kind of person who worries from the moment something is wrong, until the band-aid is ripped off. I cancelled some other plans and met her the next evening. The 25hrs that elapsed in between the dreaded, ""we need to talk"" and the actual talking were the most anxious hours I've spent in a long time. Couldn't focus, couldn't eat much, just sat staring at a book and then a TV screen blankly while eating dinner with my family, all the while thinking (read: obsessing) about what it could be. 

When we met, she told me that it's been bothering her for a while that I'd changed. She said I seemed to no longer be interested in hanging out with her, despite it being the highlight of my week. She said I phubbed her too much. For those not familiar, a phub is a phone-snub. It's when you're with someone and you're using your phone. The time she's referring to is when I had about 40-50 messages on my class group, and about 5-10 from one of my classmates about a group study the next day. I must have been on my phone for about 3mins each time, for a total of 5-6 times through the 4hrs we spent together. I always make sure that if I do look at a message, I continue talking to her while checking the message out, and I always say, ""Sorry, I've just got to check this message"". I do that when the text is more or less time-sensitive, and don't just pick my phone up for no reason. Either way, I apologised for phubbing, and for making her feel like she wasn't wanted there. Both of those things were not my intention, and I reassured her that I absolutely loved spending time with her. 

Then she mentioned that the whole friendship was now only jokes, teasing, and some empty conversation where it used to be so much more intelligent. I know it's been a lot more informal than it used to be, but I'm still talking to her about things with depth in it, and while we do tease each other a lot, it was what she said she missed about her ex-best-friend, that the teasing stopped. She always used to engage in the teasing as if it was something she wanted, and always had a witty retort, and even initiated it. Regardless, I apologised if it was too much, and told her I'd make a more conscious effort to include more intellectual conversations again. 

I asked her why she didn't mention all of this earlier, so we could just nip these little things in the bud instead of letting them fester in her mind to a point where she just felt weird thinking about this stuff, and she said, ""I shouldn't have to tell you these things. You should just keep yourself in check. I don't think I've ever been made to feel this way before"". 

When I let anyone get close to me, I get attached. I'm pretty low maintenance as a person goes, and all I ask is for someone to be honest with me and tell me their thoughts if there's something wrong, so we can work on it before it becomes an issue, and sort it out in a mature way. I want to know, purely because I hate being the source of someone's discomfort, or the reason why they're upset. She knows this about me, and we've had detailed conversations about how we would always tell each other everything, no matter how small or petty they may seem. 

I have (from day one of knowing her) been considerate, taken care of her, practically asking her every few minutes if she's ok, if she has enough to eat, if she wants me to drop her home early, what she wants, or feels, carrying a jacket in a bag in my car every time we meet just in case she feels cold, everything, and she tells me recently that she feels that I haven't been as considerate and caring. I apologised again if that's how things felt, because in my mind, all my thoughts are how I can help make her more comfy, how to smooth the transition for her to meet my friends, include her in all the plans I can, meeting early, because she hates late nights, etc. 

Met her after that conversation, and the stimulating talking points seemed to flow, I teased less, didn't look once at my phone, despite having 100+ texts related to my exams (now 5 days away), and spoke about more thought-provoking things. I thought that was an improvement. But no texts for days from her. Even when I initiate, she seems to just ignore most of them. I know she wants to be less glued to her phone, but Jesus, a simple reply isn't too much to ask for every now and again? One reply each day is really not asking a lot, even if it's hours after I send something. 

Today when I spoke to her on the phone, I asked when we could meet next to finish last time's conversation we had about animal instincts and how you can or can't blame a wild animal for hurting a human (left open last time). She said, ""No, let's not. You're different in person, and you're different over the phone. You're nicer on the phone, and in person you're a different person sometimes"". I asked her about the last time, and she said, ""Yes, last time too. It started great, but ended badly. It's best if we just don't meet for a while. Don't worry about it though, it's not a big deal"". I don't know how it ended badly. She drove the conversation last time, all my replies were after she spoke, they were thought out, sensitive, sparingly using humour where needed, subtly indicated multiple times that I cared about her well-being, and the evening seemed to end absolutely normally and nicely. She said, ""we'll continue this next time"". She no longer initiates texts or calls. Even today, I had to. I don't think I've done this much chasing a friend in years. So I really have no clue what the fuck is going on. 

No one else in my life feels like I've changed. Most of my friends we hang with together think I'm over-protective and sweet for the way I look after her. I asked a friend of mine (who I have an understanding with to be brutally honest at all times) if I'd changed around her, or just in general, and he was totally baffled. He said if he was looking really closely, I'd changed in a way that I was more nurturing towards her than I am with most other people, but that's about it. This is a guy who doesn't ever mince words with me, and it's reciprocal. We've been brutally honest with each other for years, even when what we have to say hurts, so I know he's not just saying stuff to pacify me or stroke my ego. 

I just don't get it, reddit. I really don't. I used to think this was a great friendship with Erica, and that the lack of the relationship was going ok, but suddenly, it's awkward and weird, and I'm thinking a million times before I open my mouth now. She's still sweet and polite, but it's snapped back to very formal, and very weird now, where it's ok for a bit, but I'm conscious of the fact that she feels something is irrevocably wrong. I still wanna stay friends, and fix what's gone wrong, but I'm just so confused at how someone can think so much is wrong with something that really hasn't changed even the slightest bit. 

I'm pretty much speechless, as are the few people who know about the situation in confidence. If you have any advice, I'd appreciate it, if not, thank you for reading this long-ass vent session anyway!

146,"As the title suggests, I have a bad boss. He's not bad in the sense that he works me too hard or I can't satisfy him or he is unsupportive. He's bad in the sense that he's inexperienced, both within our field and with managing people. 

For context: We work in the pharma industry in the manufacturing department. However, we do no manufacture ourselves, we contract it out and manage that company. Our jobs require constant communication with our contract company and also constant communication with each other. My boss' background is a bachelors degree in sports management then he worked as an on-the-floor operator at a pharma manufacturing site for 3 years then worked in quality assurance for 4 years. My background is a bachelors in chemical engineering, 2 years experience manufacturing commodity chemicals then PhD in biomedical engineering, and now this job.

Some things my boss does:
1. Talk to our contractor without filling me in on the conversation. This is pretty constant and I've asked him to be better about it. Most recently he had a telecon with our project manager of our contractor while I was on-site at the contract office! When I found out about it, it was embarrassing. ""Oh :boss: just told us about this change. Can you give more detail?"" .. Actually I can't because I don't know anything about that! This is frustrating because traveling to the contractor is a huge trip (in Asia and we are based in US). I feel like why am I even here if that's what he's going to do? This behavior also undermines anything I do tell them. They always delay work until they get confirmation from my boss or his boss about my requests. 

2. He is constantly changing my role. I don't know what my really role is at this point. I was supposed to be the person handling any technical or operational change but he just told me that the ongoing projects that I have going, he's going to move over to a new guy. I get it bc the new guy needs to get involved but now I'm confused where I fall.

3. He is unprepared a lot and it often causes confusion and embarrassment (on my part). I just find it embarrassing when he demands an immediate telecon from our contractors and then isn't prepared for it. They drop what they're doing for us or for other customers and then we can't even have a productive conversation because he isn't prepared or caught up on the latest info. This happens in internal meetings too. He calls a meeting and then will be like ""I haven't had a chance to look at this in-depth yet but let's just talk about it..."". Or ""I didn't have time to make slides or anything"" 

4. He lacks technical understanding of our process and will often ""guarantee"" things to other groups or management but lacks any technical justification or understanding of what he's actually agreeing to 

5. He's scatterbrained to an extent. He doesn't provide deliverables. We have a lot going on, a small team and heavy workload, but he really does not provide any value-added deliverables. He often loses a broad view of our work and focuses down on the smallest detail and clings to it and turns it into the most important thing in the world until that one thing is so beat to death and he finds the next tiny detail to cling to. 

He does have redeeming qualities though. He's nice. He's supportive of me moving up. He asks me if he can do better at managing me (I've asked him to do better with communication a bunch of times but it's only marginally improved).  

I'm just not sure how to deal with this. I feel like my general frustration level with him is increasing daily to the point where his redeeming qualities are no longer able to balance it out. 

Any advice on how to handle this...if I should talk to him, if I should just suck it up...would be appreciated!! ",23May2018,3

151,"hi! throwaway acc because people know my usual reddit name. currently in 1st year of uni with an arts/science conjoint. i did it because the arts subjects really intrigue me (philosophy especially) but i'm also taking physics and computer science courses on the 'practical side'. i enjoy what i'm doing right now.

however, i'm just wondering whether it might actually reflect badly on me if i'm doing a conjoint and then apply for a job in tech based on the 'science' half of it? i'm taking less science courses than students doing a single major and i've wondered whether that'll make me seem less knowledgeable/experienced in the field. 

i'm just asking here because i've heard a lot of varying opinions... some people say only gpa matters (in which case i hope i'll be fine!), others say that since i'm only doing half my degree in science it'll reflect badly, and some others say that it's not a bad thing, it'll just make it look like i have a range of skills/interests. so it might be a bit of a silly question considering i'm mostly happy with my current situation, it's really just a 'just in case' advice post.",23May2018,1
152,"Hey r/advice!

I'm a Front Office Manager for a well known hotel chain. I've been in hospitality for the past three years, and have been in love with the industry since I started. It guarantees me well over forty hours a week (sometimes a pain, but the checks are worth it), pays decently, and allows me to work with people all day. 

I want to move up further and become an Assistant General Manager (AGM), and ideally, one day become a GM. 

I haven't done any college since I graduated high school in 2011, and with how many hours I work a week and the high stress of my job, I haven't been able to seriously consider a Bachelor's at this time. I have Crohn's Disease, which is enough to balance on it's own with work, so trying to spend the next few years working towards a diploma seems to be out of the question for the time being. 

I have found a few Hospitality Management Certificate courses online at reputable colleges (Cornell, MSU, etc.), and wanted to see what y'all thought of pursuing that route. My husband is active duty in the military and plans on doing his full twenty, and has no interest in using his GI Bill. He plans on letting me use it in the future, but that won't be for a few years at least. I was hoping to get some insight into whether it would be beneficial for me to go for a ~$3k certificate, rather than go for a diploma that I may not even be physically able to finish without being out a bit of money due to health issues that could complicate things. 

With my work experience, I am hoping that the two (certificate + experience) will allow me to move up in the hospitality industry, or at least help to secure a decent raise during my next evaluation. Is this something that I should seriously consider, or is it a waste of my time and money?",23May2018,9
154,"Let me explain further. My current job is cool. I’m new at it. I do great and there’s no complaints. Minus the low pay. However 2 of my coworkers and 1 of my supervisors keep trying to make me learn some of my coworker’s job duties. Meaning taking time away from the job I’m getting paid for. To help them with their assignments. With no raise. 

Supervisor tried to hoodwink me by saying “this is a great opportunity, you can try to apply for their job after months of training, half a year or more later if there’s an opening, until then you help do their work.” I waited for him to mention any monetary benefit for me since I’d basically be doing 1.5 jobs for the same pay until said maybe promotion. I’m already underpaid. 

I said no thanks. Supervisor backed off but now he’s acting like I did something wrong. And the 2 coworkers this “opportunity” would’ve benefited are giving me sour looks and talking behind my back. They’re whispering about how I’m too comfortable with my current job. While complaining about their own jobs. Still trying to pass off their work. 

Yes. I am comfortable. I like my job as it is. Not looking to “move up”. I finally found a job I don’t dread. I don’t want be like them constantly complaining. 

Am I in trouble for something I never hinted at wanting? Why am I being bothered with this “opportunity”? Who’s wrong? Me or them? Do I just ignore them and keep swimming? Should I find a new job with a better environment?

Idk there is this one guy that I have met while online dating. He begged me for a week to hang out with him. Then of course once we meet (like I suspected he would) I get friend zoned by him. We have hung out a few times since then but I think he just uses me for hand and blow jobs (even though he swears up and down he doesn't). 


It's kind of funny, when we are hanging out I'm not really comfortable around him and I don't think he's very attractive. However he was the first guy that kissed me and gave me physical affection that I have wanted for so long. Idk he will always have a special place in my heart because he was my first for a lot of things (kiss, handholding, first guy to give me a hug without me asking for one, first guy I gave a handjob and blowjob to) stuff like that. Idk he is always online on the dating website he talked to me on and it just breaks my heart knowing he's probably talking to hot girls on there and ignoring me. 


Idk. I'm happy I met him but at the same time I wish he never would have messaged me in the first place or I would have not replied in the first place (it's funny I wasn't going to reply to him but I did anyway). I just feel really depressed 24/7 because of him and have cried over him so so so many times. He is on my mind constantly. I sound creepy but he's all I think about.

My campus is close enough to my parents’ house that I can commute to school everyday, and about six months ago I quit my high school job and started working at a high-end restaurant in the city (about a five minute walk from school). On paper, this works out great because instead of paying rent or worrying about food, I just have to put up with a somewhat unreliable public transportation schedule and making time for about an hour-long trip in the morningS and after work. The problem is, my parents are very old fashioned and I feel like I’m trapped in a limbo between independence and high school student. It feels like it’s time for me to move on. 

My boyfriend and I just applied for an apartment in the city, ready to move in later this summer. We’ve talked about it for months and the idea excites me, but suddenly I’m overly nervous.

My new job is base pay of minimum wage. I was on my fourth day of training today.

I took it but gave it back as we were headed out saying ""I don't want anything to do with this"" because if I'm caught then I would lose my new job, and potentially lose my internship too because my boss knows my other boss personally.

169,"I’m (21F) currently in between my sophomore and junior year at a local college, taking a break partly because I’m paying out of pocket (I’m doing very well so far!) partly because I have absolutely zero direction. If I was on a linear path, like my classmates, I would be coming out of junior year. 

I graduated high school with the intention of being an English major, which I switched into a Humanities major freshman year, then later added a Spanish minor. I chose these essentially because I didn’t know what else to do, and I’m very interested in things like art, history, culture etc, but I never had a clear career path in mind. 

Lately I’ve been thinking I want to radically change the direction I’m headed in. I want to be an OBGYN, and deliver babies! My biggest issue is I’m intimidated. I struggle with mental illness, and during one awful semester, my previous 4.0 gpa dropped horribly while I wrestled with two jobs and suicidal thoughts. I don’t think my grades would allow for such high hopes like med school at this point, and I’m afraid I’ve mangled any chance I had for a professional future that allows for me to make a difference, be passionate, and allow my future family to live comfortably. 

Additionally, my parents never finished college. Mom got pregnant with yours truly, and never went back. Dad took care of Mom by going to trade school, and is now an electrician. They’ve spent years telling me how much they regret not finishing, and how important it is I get a good degree. They don’t know about my grades. 

I have no idea how to overcome the crippling shame and anxiety I have over the semester I messed up, as well as the fear I’m just not smart or good enough to start pre-med. I also feel I’m too old to basically begin the degree process all over again.

Now a month ago we made out. It ws a one time only thing, since then we haven‘t me once outside of university(even though we used to spend lots of time together). She said that the situation became too weird, but we agreed that we both want each other back as friends. So it became normal for a while again. 

The current situation is that she‘s seeing somebody else, which is fine since I only want her as a friend, so there‘s no jealousy taking over on my part. But she will only agree to meet up with me if it‘s the last thing she could possibly do in her life and she will only text me, if she feels bad/sad and needs somebody who listens to her. Things weren‘t like this before our little incident.

I have no problems with helping other people, I love that. But it feels so one sided. It really bothers me that she avoids / treats me like that, even though I only want to be friends and a good friend to her. However, currently I‘m the best friend possible for her, while she is doing absolutely nothing.

Should I start ignoring her? I know it sounds arrogant but lots of my friends said that she didn‘t deservd me and I‘m starting to believe that too.",23May2018,8

Might anyone know Why? I'm a 15 year old high school sophomore year and I really don't get it. I mean I should be happy my life is going good but there's always some voice in the back of my head that always comes to me. A voice I ignore that yet comes back at my low moments. A voice that always tells me how to feel and what's the issue. Stupidly, i listen to them as if they're right. It's getting to the point where it's affecting my relationship with others and it's rather annoying for both them and I. Any input would be nice and I'm currently not on any medications.

Her brother sent me a message through her phone to tell me as she told him we were supposed to hang out today. She seems to be barely conscious but he says that she's safe now and the situation seems to be stable. He'll be staying with her the whole day and I might come and visit this afternoon if her condition allows it. Is there anything I can do to support both of them ? I've already asked him if they needed anything, and I plan on offering to go get him something to eat for lunch if he hasn't yet. I might try and bring something to distract her in case she wakes up and gets bored, but I'm not sure what (considering she often is too weak to read after bad attacks). ",23May2018,1
174,"So me and my boyfriend have been living together for about a year. We live in one of the top ten worst cities in America and have more crime per capita than Chicago. Any who, this past Saturday our condo neighbors house was broke into. They stole baby goods, jewelry, and I’m assuming drugs because they kept saying all the “stuff” was missing. (It’s a really young couple who are kinda wannabe bangers and sell pot) so me being scared and paranoid, I gathered up a couple baskets of clothes and go to my parents house. I asked my boyfriend to come with, he said he didn’t feel scared and wouldn’t feel comfortable at my parents, but he understood my decision to go stay there. Money is tight so that’s why we live in said condo. My parents are now more worried than ever about me and my bf and want us to move into their finished basement until we can find something in a little safer area. My boyfriends pride will be the death of him and he doesn’t want to leave our condo he thinks that the break in only happened because they deal and it won’t happen to us. I might be a stage four clinger but I can’t really sleep without him and this is a strain on our relationship. Also our lock is broken on the door and the slum lord hasn’t fixed it in months. Can’t really beg or nag at said slum lord because gang ties to owners and they will just intimidate us or tell us to leave. I feel sad. I feel stuck. I don’t want to live in fear. I don’t want to live without my bf I got really use to living together and we’re a good little team. And my parents will just worry about me even more than they already do. 
TLDR: move out of hood condo and leave my bf there alone/ or move back in with parents and be sad but safe(r) ",23May2018,1

177,"I am a Year 12 student from Australia and I have recently dropped out of high school as the subjects I was doing at school would not have gotten me into University, which is my end goal. I have enrolled in a course at TAFE (in Australia, TAFE institutions provide a wide range of predominantly vocational courses). My problem is, while I used to be good at math prior to Grade 10 before I started hanging out with the wrong people and let my grades slip and I dropped down to a less advanced math class. This course, however, will throw me in the deep end with Year-12 level Pure Mathematics, and although I know I have it in me, I am afraid I will be too behind as I did not study advanced math in grade 11. My question is, how can I prepare for this course before it starts? Are there any online resources relatively inexpensive which I could use leading up to my course? I am relying on getting a good ranking from this course so that I can possibly become a pilot in the Air Force one day. That may be shooting a bit far for a high school drop out, but I think if I can ace this course it is possible. Thanks",23May2018,1
178,"I graduated with a degree in finance about a year ago. I absolutely hated it. I had an internship in corporate finance and I felt like I was going insane. I was losing sight of who I was. I was having terror attacks every night because I felt like I had two personalities inside me. I was forced into the major by my mom who is incredibly manipulative and controlling(story for another time). After I graduated my depression continued to get worse and I contemplated killing myself everyday. I decided to bail on finance because what I truly love is music. Ever since I bailed all my mental health issues have pretty much disappeared. I finally feel like I can live a life I choose. I’m finally happy for the first time in my life. Even with other problems about my family it doesn’t bother me cause every day I do what I love. This is my dilemma though. Music is not a very lucrative field. It’s been about a year now and although I am happier than I’ve ever been, I don’t know how much longer I can sustain this lifestyle. I’ve locked myself up for a year and taught myself everything I could about music production because that’s what I love doing. I’m closing in on professional quality but it gets harder teaching yourself without many resources. I don’t know how long it will be before I see results or ever do. I’m currently in a city that is horrible for music. I’m able to make some money giving piano lessons but it would never be enough to move out. I don’t know whether I need to leave and go to a city with more resources or continue to use the internet like I have. I want to be great and I know this is the one thing I truly love but its essentially a make or break scenario. Should I take the huge risk and potentially miss out on a secure life?

181,"I'm a senior and I'm graduating(barely), part of me wants to go to college &amp; become an accountant. And the other part of me wants to wait a year(and see how things go). I'm not a lazy dude, rn I'm looking for a job, and once I get a job I want to move in with roommates(my family is big rn due to my mom having lots of children &amp; I feel like I'm an annoyance since there's barely enough room plus the fact that I just turned 18). This just puts even more stress on me, plus the fact that I barely get along with my mom.

The thing is that the city where I'm from, jobs that I have experience in are nonexistant(the arts) and would only be available in big cities such as NYC, or LA, even if I wanted to intern it would be impossible. If I went to college I'd be going to a community college where they offer accounting classes(but I'd be broke asf for the next 4-5 years.)

Plus the fact that my friends are finishing a semester of college already puts pressure on me and I feel like a failure.

I was thinking of getting a general labor job since they're plentiful and doing that for a year just to see how things go. After the year is up I will decide whether I feel like I've progressed.

Idk, I'm just not a very patient guy, hate being broke &amp; I suck at being in the present/in the moment. 4 years of high school felt like an eternity and thinking about another 4-5 years of college feels like hell in my mind especially how we have to take general ed classes and possibly studying something that I'm not interested in at all due to my circumstances.",23May2018,2

187,"I’m currently feeling pretty down and lost and don’t know whether it’s due to career issues or deeper life issues.

Some background about my current career situation. 

I currently work as a corporate finance manager in the renewable sector in my country (I’m a 34 year old male, and not from the USA). The job is quite well paid (I’m making USD 15k+ a month) and the team are generally nice. The type of finance we do is assessing investment opportunities and conducting various analyses on them before presenting them to the board for their decision.

My academic background is not really finance-related. My undergrad was in computer engineering and though I hold an MBA, it was mostly marketing-focused rather than finance-heavy. 

Prior to getting this job, I completed a master’s in interaction design from a reputable university in the US. It was a total passion move where I quit my previous job in telecommunications marketing and crossed the Atlantic to “follow my dreams.” I’ve always considered design as my passion and thought I should make a career out of it as I’ve been doing it at night and on weekends for the last 10 or so years.

After coming back from the US, however, I spent a year in total depression. Unemployed, kinda broke, and with hardly any opportunity to practice design. I went into a black hole of existentialism because I didn’t know what to do anymore. There was also a sense of disillusionment about following one’s “dreams” and how hard it is to tolerate uncertainty. 

While applying to different places during that year, my CV reached my current boss who called me and expressed his admiration for my “multi disciplinary” skill set and he said that he wanted to meet me.

I met him in an informal setting where he continued to tell me that he’s looking for someone like me to join his corporate finance team. I made a point of telling him that I don’t really have a background in corporate finance. He assured me that it’s alright with him and that it’s all learnable. He also made a point of telling me that my skill set in interaction design/data visualization is needed for many of the activities that they conduct.

I think I should mention that he’s a great person who is kind and enthusiastic. I was in a very dark place back then and to find someone who genuinely expressed admiration and interest in me while I was knee deep in self doubt meant the world to me.

I had a couple of other offers at that point, mostly in IT and telecom, but I chose to follow my heart and go with this position. 

It’s been about a year and a half now and I feel pretty lost in the job. I struggle with feeling incompetent on a daily basis. I’m pretty quiet in most meetings because I’m terrified of saying the wrong, stupid thing. Meetings in which I don’t contribute much seem to be a major trigger for feelings of deep depression.

Speaking of that, I should mention that I’ve been on anti depressants for years now, for both depression and anxiety. On top of that, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD (the inattentive type) and I’m now on meds for that too. This recent diagnosis shed some light on some of the difficulties I’ve been having at work, so meds definitely help.

At work, I see people who come from different backgrounds excelling in their jobs that are in a different background. Meanwhile I feel powerless. Sometimes I feel like it’s my mindset where I approached the entire situation with a sense of hopelessness from the very beginning, maybe because I was coming from a dark place.

Sometimes I feel like it’s in my hands, I can maybe pursue a CFA (though the recent knowledge that I have ADHD makes me fearful of the idea) or try harder. Some other times I feel like you either have it or you don’t, and maybe I don’t. It feels like I’m starting from scratch all over again, and I’m somehow too old for that.

A few months back I decided to save as much money as possible to allow me to hopefully leave my job sometime in the future. The problem is, I don’t even know what I will do after that. I feel like I’ve lost enthusiasm for almost everything: design, corporate life, even free time things that used to bring me so much joy. I hardly have a social life. This makes me feel like maybe this is a deeper issue than just a career issue because some part of me knows that this is a job that a lot of people would feel very lucky to have. But for some reason, I can’t fully feel that. It’s hard for me to find the energy to fight for it.

193,"My wife is a victim of child neglect, and as a result she has quite a few mental and physical health issues. She has extreme social anxiety, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and depression. Because she didn't really have much of a childhood, her sense of self is almost non existent. She has no hobbies or passions and never did other than hanging out with me and her family. She can't make friends because she doesn't want to, she hates everyone she interacts with (not outwardly). 

I've had some deep concerns recently due to a dark turn in our conversations. She feels broken, and like a failure. She tells me that life doesn't seem like it's worth living. From her perspective, she's just a useless waste of space that causes problems for me and everyone she knows. She hates her job, which is supposed to be temporary while she goes to school to be a teacher. Her one lifeline aside from me was teaching. She has a soft spot for kids and loves to help them. Unfortunately, her anxiety has gotten so bad that she can't go to class anymore. On her last week in the semester I had to beg her to go take her final ( she makes straight As) . She came home sobbing and barely able to breathe and it tore me apart. She has to take a break.

This is just a summary, the details would take an essay to describe all of her problems.

We have tried to get help for her a few times.  The doctors we have been able to see just try to give her anti depressants. She even took Zoloft for a couple months but it turned her into a zombie
 (14+ hours of sleep a day) and then she had to stop that because her heart rate kept jumping into the 200+ range at rest and we went to the ER.

The councilers just make her anxiety worse and she complains that they don't really care and or are incompetent. 

Anyone with good ratings has a 6 month wait list, and last month we were even scheduled to see an endocrinologist for her PCOS which is associated with her depression and anxiety, but I got laid off and lost health insurance 2 weeks before the appointment and we had to cancel. 

We have been together for almost 10 years, and I love her so much. I want to help her, to fix her, to make her happy, and see the smile I fell in love with. I don't know what else to do.

I dropped out of highschool not too long ago due to medical issues and the school’s unwillingness to work with me/help me when I was ill. Now I’m much better and currently work a part time job, but I live in the NorthEast and it’s really expensive to live up here, so I was planning on moving in with my dad (who lives pretty rural) while I take a class to help me get my GED and also wanted to work full time. 

The GED course I can get financial aid to cover almost all the costs, and my dad (god bless) said he’d give me his old car because he’s been wanting a new one anyways. An apartment I can get down there is about $300-$500, and if I’m working 40 hour weeks minimum wage ($7.25) I think I could manage. 

My dad, as much as he helps me, is overbearing and I wouldn’t want to live with him as I’m trying to get my footing as a more independent “adult”, plus my stepmom is very aggravating and unsupportive. My mother is out of the question, I’m not staying with her for unexplainable reasons.

As much as I try to encourage myself I still have a lot of anxiety. Has anyone had any negative experience moving out young? Any unknown costs I should save for?

I have enough money in my bank to pay for the entirety of my part of the lease (plus utilities, security deposit, and living expenses) for an entire year.

198,"I have been with my girlfriend for 3 years, lived together for a year and have never lied to her about anything before and this is what is making me feel so guilty. 

I went on a stag-do (2 weeks ago) with a group of good, long standing friends and ended up visiting a strip club whilst there; I did tell my girlfriend that we would most likely end up going to a strip club and she said she was fine about it. I have never been to one before and was curious to see what they were like. We all paid into a pot and got the stag a dance on stage where they tied him up/whipped him and basically performed a humiliating and funny act. Afterwards, 2/3 of my friends (also with girlfriends) paid to go and have a private dance. I decided to join in and paid one of the girls for a one song dance (mostly due to curiosity). There is no touching allowed and I just sat there while she slowly started stripping down and dancing; it was all quite awkward to be honest and to be fair I didn’t get anything from it. Coming to the end of the song she took off her pants and spread wide and that is when I realised I had overstepped my moral line towards my girlfriend. She asked if I wanted another, I said no then went back down and we left soon after. 

The next day my friends and I were discussing that there should be no mention to SO’s of the lap dances. I rang her that day and had a nice chat and let her know that we had visited a strip club, when she asked “did you have a lap dance”, to which I replied “no”. It was all well and good and we carried on the stag do with another night visiting a couple of clubs.

Fast forward to the next day. I arrived home and she was asking about the trip to which she then asked again if I had a lap dance, again I said “no”, she said “swear it”. I promised her I had not. This was so hard to do; I never lie to her but I also promised my friends that I wouldn’t tell about the lap dances we had received.

I feel cornered and would love to get it off my chest, but at the same time she is friends with their girlfriends and I know it will all surface and do not want to be a ‘snake’ toward my friends.

199,"Hey everyone. I’m a little lost here so hoping I can get some insightful advice. I just bought a house in Washington (a cannabis friendly state) and one of the things I enjoy doing is smoking a joint in my front or back yard when the kids are in bed after a long day. 

Now the houses are at the end of the block and pretty close together, so I’m sympathetic to where my Niebhor is coming from.

It was brought up to me by my neighbors rentee, that the smell of cannabis lofts into his 8yr old daughters room at night. I told him that I would try and blow the smoke
The other way, and move it to mainly the backyard since the child’s room is in the front of the house. 

I thought that was the end of it.

I just received a letter from the rentee posted on my front door at around midnight saying 

“For the second time, please stop smoking weed on your porch and blowing it into my daughters room. Is that not common respect?

If you don’t think that is an issue, then feel free to go into your sons room at night and smoke as much as you want. 

Why do I have to put this on your door?”

I don’t want to cause waves and have a Niebhorly fued, but how would you approach this? I’ve tried to be accommodating about this and smoke on the other side of the house but it seems like that’s not good enough. I only smoke after 10pm also if that makes any difference.

Am I wrong for smoking on my own property?  My initial reaction is to just confront the guy and tell him to close his window. What would you do? Smoking inside is not an option.

202,"So basically my mom no longer thinks I’m pretty since I’ve lost weight and had no problem voicing it. So I’m 5’6 3/4 so basically 5’7. A year ago I weighed 165lbs, unhealthy and overweight. Over that summer from dieting I lost 5lbs so not a lot. In the fall I played a sport and got down to 153-156 range. My mom noted this is when she thought I looked best. Keep in mind I’ve been building muscle and losing fat. Winter I play another sport and throughout the season with a stricter diet I weighed 149-151. Towards the end of the season I tore ligaments in my right knee and did a lot of eating, abandoning diet, and my weight dropped to 145-147. Then came the next semester at school, I took weights and training and started running at home to prepare for fitness training this summer. Our school has fitness training for fall sports. So I dropped to 135, then laid off cardio some and really got into the weights and now 140. Which I believe I look really healthy. I feel really healthy. I have broad shoulders and hips, my wrists are also pretty thick. But my mom says she thinks I’m unhealthy and doesn’t like the way I look. And on top of that, when I was overweight I got A LOT of attention from guys. But since I started dropping it, none. I’ve had one crappy interaction where I dated a guy but later found out it was to get close to my friend. So how am I even supposed to learn to love myself when my mom hates the way I look and so do guys. I want to love my reflection but I can’t.

205,"This is gonna be long so here it goes.

My (24F) girlfriend and I (23M) had sex about a week or so back and I needed some help on a subject. During sex, I wore a condom the entire time. For half of the time, we were in one position until she orgasmed and then we changed positions until I finished. I made sure that the condom was still on properly before continuing. Right as I was nearing, I felt myself orgasming, so just around the time of the first wave of it, immediately I pulled out with the condom still on. I went and checked the condom and it held up perfectly. However, before I went and checked, there was white liquid on the entrance of her vagina and on the base of my penis and scrotum  where the condom stopped. I read somewhere that a lady's ejaculate is similar to a guys during certain time during their cycle (please correct me if I'm wrong and forgive if I am). Her period was due a few days ago and during that time it was due, she got sick with a nasty cold and has been stressed about school. I don't know if that would delay it but I bought her a pregnancy test in case anything. We decided if something were to happen, we would terminate the pregnancy. My question is, if things turn down that route, how can I be as helpful and supportive of her as possible? I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world and want to do everything I can in this world for her to help her and make her happy. I know how that procedure can be very hard on people and I want to be as helpful as possible and go about this in the best way I can. Thank you so much.",23May2018,3
206,"So, throwaway, in case my GF sees this: Hi honey!!!!


I am going to pretend that I live in Switzerland, I don’t but it’s the easiest. I study translation and next year I will study a Master in Business, I am the president of a youth LGBTQI-group in the capital of our country.


Each LGBTQI movement is either associated with the French-speaking organisation, the German speaking or the Bilingual one from the capital.


We are part of the bilingual one, and after a call from help to have more women in the Board of my Capitals Offical Gay Mouvement, I applied. I thought I was just going to be a member that listens and sometimes give input but because I am young and speak all the languages of my country I was asked to be co-president, I was also the only woman that was able to be elected. So I accepted.


It’s been 2 months and it’s not fun. As a translator I gave myself up to translate things. I translate documents but often they send them last minute. They text me: Could you translate this page in 2 hours,? While I am driving, and they start to get pissed when am not sending it straight away, or they send a document in French in the morning. And it has to be translated by the evening, instead of sending to earlier.


They don’t listen to what I say, or seem to doubt it. The other co-president does no speak German well and still doubts my translations sometimes or we are stuck for 2,5 hours on a sentence he would like to see translated.

Today I have to organize a meeting on my own with an official team member, since the other co-president i taking care of his ill father. I took 10 mails and 4 adjustments to send the agenda and have it approved and when I send it, the team member felt the need to clarify why we chose to put something earlier on the agenda than something else.


The other members also love to talk, on average I get 20 mails a day. About things like: ´A gay man attacked a straight man, police took him to the police station, this is homophobia’. While I think it is not, they still want to argue, write open letters (that often need translation)...


For the meeting of today they wanted to invite 6 people who had all separately criticized us. I said we would invite 2 and meet the other 4 on a different time, since we have a thight schedule and we need to respect it. But then they say ‘No, cause x and y are members of the mouvement’ we should see them first etc etc.

Another example is that a member of the board attacked other members verbally and I said we should have a talk with her yet they chose to leave it like that.


On top of that, I was attacked last weekend by someone. I deleted social media since that person harassed me before, when I mentioned his to the other co-president he barely showed any compassion.


Tonight I will go to that meeting, it’s about politics and  have never been to one yet I should know everything. I feel so incredibly dumb all the time. My presence is not wanted, they don’t take me seriously, I hate it. I am not payed for all this it’s voluntary.

Help me out, what should I do?

207,"Hallo,

I've been thinking about proposing to my girlfriend of nearly 2 years for a while but I'm not sure if this is the right time. I could really use some advice. 

The situation is as follows:
I'm a 23 year old student and I need 3 more years until I graduate(long story). My girlfriend turns 26 this summer. We're living together in a student house (only 4 people, renting it ourself). We've got one floor to ourself. She graduated a while ago and is currently working.  She really wants to get a house and start a family. Which I do as well but it's impossible while I'm still studying. Last night she confessed that she finds it hard sometimes because she feels like we're at different stages in our lives, she is ready to settle and she feels like I'm not ready for it and she's pushing me into a direction that I'm not ready to go. This couldn't be less true. 

I haven't proposed yet because I always thought you needed to have a degree, solid job, a house etc before taking that step. But I know I love her and want to be able to call her more than my girlfriend. 

I also feel that a proposal will show that my love for her is serious and that I do want to commit and settle. Will I be making a mistake if I propose now? Or will this push her away? I'm really confused at the moment. I hope some outside input will help. ",23May2018,1

Stupid story below about school below:

You know how in a semi\-normal world your parents are supposed to help you get to college and have a better life? Mine didn't want to do that. My dad died early \(thanks, you piece of shit\) and my mom is crazy and didn't want me to leave the house. I ended up leaving  with a guy who finally took interest and told me I was a stupid shit for 10 years. I went to a couple colleges \(ECPI, Westwood **which took all my money and ended up faulting and gave none of it back\)** and finally ended up a community college at the state we were in \(for Gaming animation and art\-\-which I was passionate about at the time and was my dream\) until we moved back to my home state where none of the credits transferred and basically I found out I had to start over.  So I'm sitting here with a couple credits, 2 ENG, 1 Math and about 2 electives that will transfer only out of 10 classes I took.

Stupid story about jobs below:

I did customer service a lot. Those are the only skills I have and no desire to go back in. I currently make $40k as data entry, which should be a lot but I got stuck with a $400 heavy car payment \(thanks, ex\) and recently I got real stupid and bought a new motorcycle \(thanks self\-\-but I kinda don't regret this one\) and a $300 student loan payment for nothing now. $40k is nothing \(especially if you browse r/personalfinance\)  I am skint most of the time. I am on that edge of can't get ahead and don't want to go below. I realize I shouldn't have gotten the bike, yea, but it was either that or commit suicide. Seriously. Therapy didn't do shit for me.

Stupid story about why my brain is broken:

I tried to commit suicide 3 times, first I slit my wrists, then I took sleeping pills, and then I tried to overdose on Paxil and Prozac. The last one messed me up pretty good, and I feel like it's made it difficult for me to concentrate. Couple that with my sleep apnea and I'm a walking zombie most days. Unfortunately at this point I want to die so badly, but my stupid spirituality keeps me from doing so. I don't want to repeat this life again, and it get worse the next time.

Conclusion about stupidity and **question**:

These days I am studying web development at Khan Academy. After trying damn near all of them, I found out that my learning style is videos, testing and hands on. Khan gives me that. I would like to eventually get an associates at least, but I calculated it out and with my full time job \+ part time job it's going to take me 2.5 years to finish my associates. I can't wait that long, the clock is ticking. But if I don't have a degree, nobody is going to want to hire me for anything. I know people say you can get a job as a jr web dev with no degree but *I don't trust my life*. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've messed up so badly there is no way out but to give everything up, file bankruptcy, let them take everything away from me and just live on welfare because that's the only thing my piece of shit self is capable of handling.

**Question**: So how do I fix this? How do I finally go from piece of shit idiot with no chance of doing anything right to halfway decent human that makes enough to support herself \(I'm looking to get to $50\-60k a year and be satisfied\) in a short time? 

**TLDR: I'm broke, have no college degree and yet $60k in student loans, getting old, hate myself. Want to get to web dev/full stack dev but don't feel like I can do it. Tired, want to quit life.**",23May2018,0

219,"Hello,

I am just looking for some advice of where I can turn to in order to help some of the insecurity issues I have.

At the end of college, in my last semester, I got out of a two a year relationship in which the woman trashed me to my face and our friends. Told me she wasn't happy for 6 months in our relationship and ended it with me and immediately started dating somebody else. I found out after that she had been cheating on my in the final weeks of our relationship. She made me out to be a bad person even though I was financially taking care of her. As you can imagine, this absolutely crushed me and I was very upset and it took me awhile to get over it. 

That brings me to my last relationship which just ended in a fireball with her hating me. We dated for a about 6 months and then broke up and started hanging out again for about two more months and stuff went south really quick. I would say we were pretty much dating during these two months as we were talking all day, hanging out at night and sleeping over all the time and going to dinner together, going to baseball games etc... What really bothered me about the relationship though was it seemed like she was hiding me away from the world. She didn't want to post pictures of us together on facebook or instagram \- because she wouldn't get as many likes with me in them as she would by herself. She didn't introduce me to her friends, only her family. All this is while guys were messaging her telling her she's beautiful, asking if she's single, wanting to hang out. I said it didn't bother me as long as she didn't hide it from me. I don't mean let me look through her phone, but just say oh this guys only wants this, he isn't a friend or anything. What irked me the most was if somebody was hitting on her she wouldn't turn them down, she would just play games with them and wouldn't let them know that she was in a relationship. I let her know about my past and I mentioned that it bothered me that she didn't want to post photos of me or tell people that she was in a relationship, saying that it was a little disrespectful to me and our relationship that they are making advances on her while she wouldn't say anything to make them stop and she said I was making a big deal about nothing.  Now keep in mind, she has guy friends that she let me know about, who they were, where they lived. And I had no problem if they wanted to hang out. They were in the picture before me, I get it. I let her go on dinner dates with them and wasn't obsessive and keeping tabs on her the whole night. I just said, have fun, I'll see you later tonight :\) Come to the two weeks before the official end of the relationship, I noticed the same two guys are blowing up her phone while we are together and I noticed that she is on the phone while we are hanging out more often than not \- which is highly unusual. One of these guys has straight up texted her, 'I want to fuck you' in the beginning of our relationship. I ask her who they were and she just brushed it off saying that they are just texting her but she doesn't respond. A could of days later, we are at an event, where we need a mobile ticket to scan in, and she pulls up her phone asking for help and she hides her phone from view very obviously, and when asked about it she said 'that guy you don't like texted me again.' My mind is, why is he still texting you if you don't respond and why are you hiding your phone, and why is the conversation history pulled up when we have been hanging out for the past two hours. I question her about it more and she blows it off saying its nothing. The last night I ever saw her I was over at her place and I go to bed early because I was exhausted, but while I was in the other room getting ready for bed I noticed that she is texting somebody and constantly looking at the phone waiting for it to light up. During the middle of the night, I did a huge no \- no, and looked through her phone and she caught me doing so. I admit, looking through phone was a wrong thing to do, I should have ended the relationship right then and there because I didn't trust her. But my mind was going through asking if I am wasting my time, and I need proof before breaking up. Regardless of what was on the phone, it was the same two guys, she gets really pissed and says I have major trust issues and need to get over them and we break up and never talking again.

This brings me to the advice portion of this post. I do admit I have a hard time trusting somebody after being cheated on and having my name drug through the mud to my previous friends. Both these girls were people I wanted to end up marrying at the time because I want to be committed and raise a family. Is there anything I could do, resources to look at, or mental exercises I can do, so that going into my next relationship to be more relaxed when it comes to the relationship? I want to be able to trust my girlfriend again with all the trust I had before my college relationship. I don't want to be jealous boyfriend in the future and I want to be able to know that I won't make it a hindrance on myself for the future. Regardless of how I acted was right or wrong, I am just looking for advice to be better for myself and my next future partner.",23May2018,124

221,"Hey y’all. Never posted here before but I’ve lurked.

I have a 30 lb Lab and Whippet mix I adopted back in January. I love her to death. She’s a little wild and still learning manners, but she’s a good girl otherwise who loves people and other dogs.

This week I went on vacation. I was gone Thursday-Tuesday. I left her at the boarding facility my parents have used in the past. I got her a medium run, brought her bed, her regular food, her favorite toys, blanket, treats, and food/water bowl. I also bought her a new toy for the stay (a tuffy toy. She usually tears them up into pieces within 30 minutes of getting them, but she likes chewing so I got her that one just in case. Her other toys are just ratty but she loves them. This one she immediately took a liking to when I bought it, but I didn’t let her have it so she could get a fresh chew in the boarding facility). I also paid for them to clip her nails while she was there.


Whenever I picked her up Tuesday morning, she was not herself. She didn’t act excited to see me at all. I picked her up at 930 A.M. I asked her if they fed her yet and they said no.

We were staying at my parents house and driving back to mine that night, and they have a huge yard. When we got home, I let her out in the yard to run free, but checked her first. They didn’t clip her nails like they said they would. That was my first red flag. I called them and they said sorry and they would put a free nail trim in. I booked it for Monday.

 She immediately went potty outside, but wouldn’t eat her breakfast. She acted like she didn’t want to come up to me or anything, but I would come up to her and she would let me love on her. She was eating a LOT of grass, which is usually a sign that her tummy hurts. That’s how she acted all day. Then at dinner time, she ate maybe 1/8th of her food and wouldn’t eat anymore, and proceeded to eat grass again. That’s all. She’s hardly drinking either.

I thought maybe she just needed to acclimate to bring back home again. We drove back to my house, I gave her the new toy, but I also realized that the toy looked brand new. She took it, and like clockwork, she had ripped the stuffing out within 20 minutes, but kept chewing on the cloth afterwards. 

Now, this morning, she ate two bites of her breakfast but refused to eat anything else. She drank a little water, and went back to acting like she doesn’t want to come to me. She tried eating more grass this morning after breakfast. 

I don’t know what to do. Do I take her to my regular vet and get her checked out? Is this normal? My fear is that they just locked my dog up for five days straight, or they hurt her somehow. I’m so angry about this, and I’ve never dealt with something like this before.",23May2018,7

To add insult to injury, I also already have 1 repo on my credit from co-signing for a friends car before. (Also a really stupid mistake)

So, now here I am with this 2013 car that I owe $14000 to pay off (KBB value of the car is around $9000ish), I’m around $1200 behind on payments and I know that I need to find a way out and get a cheap beater that I can actually afford even if I have to make some kind of payments on it. I’m totally stumped as to how I can get out of this and avoid a second repo (my poor credit is at that point where I don’t even know how much lower it can possibly get), especially since I owe more than any sane person would buy the car for. 

I’ve dug through all the “standard” options online, having someone take over my payments, having someone buy it, but again I owe more than it’s worth so I know it’d be damn near impossible to find someone to go for that. 

Has anyone here been in this position and found a way to get out, and better yet, get out and get yourself something else much cheaper to drive in the process?

Common sense is telling me this cat needs a vet, but I don't want to go behind my neighbour's back (especially in what must be a stressful time). I'd also have to get a rescue charity involved as I can't afford the costs myself.

Argh, I don't know what to do!",23May2018,12

243,"I have a photography business as a side hustle. I keep switching between WordPress and Squarespace because each has things I like and don't like. This is hurting my SEO, and getting expensive in both time and money.

Here are the factors as I see them:

**Cost**: While you can get a WordPress site much cheaper than a Squarespace site, the WordPress site will look . . . well, cheap. To get a WordPress installation on par with (or better than) Squarespace, you're going to spend more on hosting, more on a theme, and on premium plugins.  So much so that I figure for me, WordPress would cost roughly twice as much per year.

**Support**: Let's face it, things break or you get results you didn't expect. That's when you need support. Squarespace support has been beyond excellent in my experience. Emailed support requests usually get answered within minutes. With WordPress, there is no central ""support desk."" Each host, theme, and plugin will have its own support, and you have to do more of the legwork than with Squarespace.

I've had good experience with support from WordPress developers, but because they are located around the world, the level of English ability and time difference before getting a response varies widely.

**Flexibility**. WordPress is definitely more flexible than Squarespace, no question there. However, this flexibility comes with a price. Every time you install a new theme or plugin or update WordPress or a theme or plugin, there could be a conflict that could take down your entire site. This has happened to me twice, which is what has spurred this question after I thought I had finally decided on WordPress.

Granted, there's not much I can do in WordPress that I can't do in Squarespace, but because WP is open, you can make it do almost anything.

**Ease of Use**. Squarespace, to me, is easier to use simply because it's a closed system and everything is designed to work with everything else. WordPress, being open, leaves open the possiblity of conflicts, as mentioned above. When you get a conflict, you have to spend time or money trying to fix it instead of working in the business. I can get a Squarespace site up and running in a few hours to a few days, where my most recent WordPress site took almost two months. 

**Search Engine Optimization** (SEO). WordPress has a very small lead in this (imo). You can do almost everything in SS that you can do in WP, it's just a little more difficult and isn't as centrally located as it can be with a WP plugin. Being a photographer, the thing that irritates me is Squarespace lags behind in image SEO. I know this is getting into the weeds, but In most designs, you can't set an image caption separately from its alt text.

So each has things I like and things I don't. I just can't decide between the two of them.",23May2018,1
244,"I have a friend is overall nice and talkative when she's around the right people. I can tell she's someone who has no intentions of trying to manipulate or get certain things from people. She lightens the mood.

But I feel like she has flaws that make things difficult. I feel like she's the type of person who won't congratulate you, and definitely the person who won't tell you happy birthday, because she didn't for me even after I essentially told her. She rarely asks how my day's going though I ask her every single time we text (I say rarely because she had done in before). I feel like there's more but my mind draws a blank.

It's hard for me to determine whether she's a good friend or a toxic friend just because it's more of the fact that she doesn't do these things but she doesn't do toxic things either. She doesn't criticize people by their clothing, or smell, or gets angry.

245,"So my roommate and I are, well were pretty chill. We have similar interests and hobbies. We're both attending college. But after she got a boyfriend he's been at our place maybe half or a third of the week. The thing is he doesn't stay over, that's reserved for weekend and they sleep on the couch in the living room (we share a bedroom so she knows to not let him in when I'm there) but the thing is the walls are pretty thin so i can hear them making out. We also share a bathroom and he makes me so uncomfortable when he comes into the room and even just having his presence in the apartment that I've been starting to have panic attacks and sleep difficulties.  Even when he's not there. It's not like he's there all the time, it's just that the times that I come home to my roommate and my boyfriend making out on the couch makes me really uncomfortable.  Id like to talk to her at least once before giving up and finding a new place. All I really want is a space to come home to and rest without having to feel anxious all the time.  The living room (where they constantly cuddle and make out) and the kitchen are connected so I don't really go outside to get the stuff I need unless I really need it. I've been trying to stay out later to avoid them but it just seems to be giving them more freedom to do stuff in an ""apartment they have to themselves.""

253,"I’m a first year undergraduate student. I have about 3-4 weeks left of this quarter and then I’m going on summer break. In the past two weeks or so my bottom right wisdom tooth has been bothering me an incredible amount. Every time I eat, food gets stuck there and it hurts. Every time I brush my teeth, the bristles touch the area and it hurts. It’s not a super sharp pain, but it’s pain nonetheless. Last night when I brushed my teeth the area was also bleeding. If I put my finger back there I can feel the bump of my tooth coming in. What I want to know is do I have enough time to wait for summer before acting? I do not want my other teeth to be ruined by this wisdom tooth moving out, but I’m not very motivated to act for two reasons:

1.  Because I don’t want to miss school (home is about two and a half hours away), I would have to get the job done here. I’m confident that I will be saving money if I do it at home because of my insurance. I don’t want to be left with a big bill that could’ve been avoided by waiting.

2. It’s the end of the year and finals are coming up soon. I’m a pre med student taking tough classes that I need to succeed in. I don’t want the process of taking my wisdom teeth out in the last few weeks distract me from my studies. The pain is tolerable right now.

260,"A little backstory: When I got pregnant with my daughter 4 and half years ago my boyfriend and I had only been together for a couple of years. It was not a planned pregnancy (I had an IUD) we weren't even living together at the time. We decided to try and make it work and it sort of did for a while. About a year ago we had our second child. I am a SAHM and he works. 
He has always been a slob but now that my work load has doubled by adding another kid I guess I notice it more. It's not just the fact he doesn't help with the housework it's that he creates more work for me. He comes home from work, takes his dirty work clothes off and dumps them in the middle of the living room floor, leaves garbage all over the place, leaves the kitchen a mess etc. He doesn't do things like mow the lawn or take out the garbage. He is very handy but I am still the one who fixes everything. He also doesn't help with the kids at all. I can count on 1 hand how many diapers he has changed. If i ask him to hold the baby so i can make dinner or do the dishes he makes a big stink. He's never helped with bathtime. He always magically has plans right at 7pm so I am forced to do the bedtime routine alone. 
His mentality is he is the one making the money so I should take care of everything else but I am getting burnt out. 
He also has zero personal hygiene. He doesn't brush his teeth and he showers mayyyyybe every 2-3 weeks. He wonders why I don't want to kiss him let alone have sex. 
I thought maybe he was depressed so I finally convinced him to go talk to a doctor who prescribed him prozac. He went on it for a couple weeks and then stopped taking it.
We are currently going to couples counseling but it seems to be making things worse, not better. I'm thinking about splitting up with him, but I am scared he will disappear from the kid's lives. He has told me before he would probably go off the deepend if I leave him and I believe him.
Its not love making me stay, its the kids and that's all. I know its not healthy for them to see a relationship like this though. Any advice appreciated.",23May2018,3

She throws things, kicks the bedroom walls and even damaged our other roommate's Famicom once when she flipped a table.

Then every night she keeps us both awake by coming to us and screaming about how everything in her life sucks and is unfair.

She threw a weight at our other roommate's head when she asked her to stop doing this because it sets off anxiety attacks in her when she decides to throw her fits.

So I took the car in to have a mechanic take a look, letting them know that I’m making the move and he called me saying that my wheel bearings are concerning him and recommends that I replace them before making the move. My dilemma is that the fix is $1500. I’m planning on selling the car a few months after I move anyway and I imagine the best I’ll be able to get from it is $800 - $1000. 

My mother will be driving my Uhaul and I will be driving the car so I’m not worried about additional weight on the car. It’s also going to be mainly highway,  so easy cruising with little turning and breaking. I don’t hear any weird sounds or scrapping noises when I drive and none of the dash lights are on so my question is should I accept the loss and get the fix or could the mechanic be pulling my leg somewhat?

I haven’t got anything I’m passionate about yet so I didn’t want to rush into university and end up regretting the course I picked. I feel like the education system in the UK doesn’t give you any support unless you’re going to uni so I left college without any idea of what to do next.

However, the bosses don’t know what’s going on in my head and just see the exterior, and they’ve lost faith that I can do my job- understandably I suppose.

289,"Love, for me, is simply a chemical reaction in the brain which has a certain shell time. After having ran its course, I can no longer be with someone. The relationship becomes uncomfortable, and I feel trapped. My most recent realtionship actually made me develop mental illness because I forced myself to stay with my partner despite the fact that I no longer loved him. This went on for 2 years. The stress and agony I felt during these two years made me suicidal but I didn't want to break up because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. All my relationships followed the same pattern. I would fall in love for someone, feel lovey-dovey for a few months then suddenly, when the honeymoon was over, I would go through agonizing pain and suffering. I know that some people like the companionship that a marriage/LTR offers but I just can't settle for an unfulfilling relationship where I have no feelings left for the other person. I know that other people can appreciate the fact that, at least, they aren't lonely, and they have someone who can be a parent and a sex partner, but I just can't feel the same way. Once the love is gone, it's over. I tried, oh god, believe me, I tried so hard to feel something for my partners when the honeymoon phase was over but I just couldn't. I would force myself to fall back in love, I would write lists with their qualities and things I like about these people, I would try to spend quality time with them...but it never worked. There's literally just two phases for me: 1) honeymoon phase ; 2) indifference, then after a few months - pain, suffering and the feeling of being stuck in a loveless relationship.

290,"This might be quite a confusing read but try to bear with me please. In my late teens and early 20's I was involved with what some might call the 'Alt Right' (though I think I was more Alt-Lite).

Although I didn't hate people for their skin color, I hated cringe. I hated drugs because I find drug culture cringey (still don't like drug culture actually), I hated feminism (particularly male feminists) because I found it and them cringey. I hated Antifa because it was cringey (even doxxed a few of them, which I now feel bad about). I am not religious but I found Atheism cringey and was repelled by it.

What drove me into hate was a disdain for a nihilistic emasculated culture full of soy-boys (people who are materialistic and define themselves by what they consume).

I am currently a postgraduate at college. Although I didn't go to any Alt-Right protests and I don't have a criminal record. I have done and said some things I am very ashamed of. I think about it every-day and I would like to improve.

There wasn't a big wake-up moment for me. Just a slow realisation that I had done inhumane (though legal) things and that I did not like the person I was becoming. I realised I was defining myself by things I was against instead of things I was for.

I would like to speak out against the Alt-Right to stop others going down a life of hate. Yet I am worried that by doing so I would not find redemption but further hurt and angst.

294,"I always liked the idea of a boyfriend. I never actually really wanted one or was prepared for one. I was never one of those boy\-crazy girls and never even saw guys really that way until I was fourteen. I am nineteen now. Almost 4 months ago, I broke up with the only boyfriend I ever had, after a 3 year relationship over the high school period \(We  went to the same school and goes in the same class\). I was never really sure of the relationship, at least not steadily. Breaking up was the best thing ever. We both deserve more and turned out to be different than each thought of the other. At the same time, I do not regret it even if I can feel hurt thinking back on the less nice things. 

Now, I feel great but at times still sad, mad and alone. I seemed to be depressed for months but recently seemed to get out of it but it's been hard to comprehend my feelings. They have never been my thing \(I've got ASD if you think that's relevant\). Today, it's been one of those days I just felt like I missed a boyfriend and was super mad of all the more ugly things in my past relationship. The weird thing was though, on a day trip with my class, I seemed to have, perhaps, a crush on this classmate I usually find super annoying? We hung out a couple days ago with another classmate and I hung out with him after the trip. He recently went from really annoying to like a cool little brother annoying. I was very much surprised and disturbed that I seemed so infatuated with him \( I followed him all the time\) just wanting to be close to him for no apparent reason, just feeling like hugging him \( which I learned to appreciate in my last relationship, before, I didn't feel like hugging anyone, not even my mom\) and kissing him \(which is rare and disturbs me every time\). 

He also clearly doesn't like me more than a friend. It's clear that this is a dead end that most likely none of us want to pursue. Most likely, I just feel alone and still not accustomed to being single. How do I stop these disturbing and intrusive thoughts? I hope this post/rant will get them out of my head, but it could also just make it bigger than it really is. Do anyone have any comment?

310,"Hello beautiful world,

I’m looking for some advice on a current family situation. This is a very long post, so I do apologize in advance. 

Quick back story, for some years my Dad raised me by himself. I’m an only child from both my parents (I have half siblings) and when I was 7 my mom died, leaving just me and him. He remarried 5 years later and we have been a happy family since. During those years, he has always been the positive, upbeat kind of man. He always was cool as a cucumber and never had too many anger issues (we all have our bad days). Now fast forward several years to the present. I’m grown and out living with FH, so my Dad and I like to meet for lunch to spend time with each other.

The past couple years every time we see each other he has been incredibly nasty, rude, short tempered, abusive and has had such a negative view with everyone. The past year has been much worse in comparison to the year before, however it’s been pretty bad.

I honestly don’t know what has changed. He’s been retired for several months, but this started when he was working so I was hoping he would lighten up once he retired. I recognize all individuals have stress, but I had hoped that his behavior was due to work and the stress it brings along with it.

Just a few examples... today at lunch we were talking about my cat and how cute she is. I was telling him that my cat kept waking me up last night biting me and wanting to play. Eventually she gave up, but he made the comment that I would want to slap her. My heart sank, I would never want to hit her. She’s my family and should be treated with love and respect. I told him he was wrong and he goes “oh yes you will, I bet that some day you’ll wanna just slap her”. Again, my heart sank. I pushed that aside and talked about something else. Every topic we talked about he was just so controlling and angry and aggressive. Talked about moving to Florida because he wants to take his wife away from her son because she enables him to not get his license (which is not true in the least. She is actually doing the opposite and helping him get all the right paper work to get his license!).  When I defended him saying how good my stepbrother is doing my Dad just rolled his eyes at me in disbelief...

Beautiful world... I am doing my best to be positive. I am blessed with a loving fiancé where we share same ideals, respect, and a positive outlook to the world. 

I know I can never make someone feel or look at things a certain way. But what advice do you have? Do I just put up with his horrible comments and let him be? Do I try and talk with him that I’m concerned for his health and safety and just simply want to make sure he’s okay?",23May2018,1

317,"So to add background information, I came to a different high school my junior year. I’m a quiet kid so I decided to join the football team to get to know people. I wasn’t great or anything, but the captains on the team were very welcoming of me. 

I hung out with them a lot because we were on the same team. One of those was a guy who I will call Z. This guy was one the most popular kids in the grade and I thought it was pretty nice that he was friends with a kid like me who wasn’t really popular/social at all. 

As time went on, I learned about his backstory. He doesn’t like to tell exactly what’s going on in his life, but I get bits and pieces . So basically Z’s father died in a car crash when he was younger. His mother couldn’t afford to take care of them, and Z and his younger brother were taken away. Z liked to find his way into trouble a lot, but still focused on staying up with his grades. Now fast forward ahead to today. 

We were at our final graduation rehearsal and Z wasn’t there. I saw him the night before having a good time at the Baccalaureate Mass. The principal tells everyone flat out that Z’s mom died today. The room was dead. There was a silence for about a minute before two of Z’s best friends got up and just walked out. One was a class clown type of kid, but his face was filled with visible pain as he walked down the aisle. Most people knew Z had a hard life and adding the death of his mother a day before graduation was probably devastating to him. I looked and saw a few girls that he was close to, including his girlfriend, also missing from the crowd. They probably found out before the meeting and just didn’t come. It was a very silent rehearsal.

So what’s my question? This kid was nothing but nice to me and I want to help him out. But the problem is, I’m not sure what to do and how to do it. I am willing to put a lot of effort into something that will hopefully make somewhat of an impact on his life in a positive way because it probably sucks right now.

324,"To put some context:
One of my friends is a guy I've known for years since highscool, and we consider each other like brothers and preety much trust each other a lot.
My other friend is a girl i know from around 2-3 years more or less, we met in a party. After some time I started to feel some things for her, but apparently she wasn't interested, mainly because she said that she ""Was sure she wouldn't be in a relationship with no one ever"" and all of that. At first I still tried, but ended giving up and trying to keep her as a friend.
The problem is, I was not very good at letting go, so it took me more time that I want to admit, but my other friend supported me all the time.

And after a while, she now consideres me her best friend and a person she can trust(literal words), and we started to hang out the 3 of us.

Now, some time ago, around a month or so, my friend(who I will refer as A now for clarity purposes) told me one day that apparently our other friend likes A. I was mostly surprised, but A kept telling me that he didn't know, and that he didn't thought of her as nothing more than a friend. I didn't really gave it more importance.

So, today, A told me that he started dating her. Of course, this surprised me, because no one told me anything. A told me that after some time he started liking her but still telling me that he hoped that I ended with her.

The point is that Im not angry, at the contrary, Im happy for him because hes a great guy, and for her mainly for the same reasons, but I still feel something weird inside, and I don't know what to do with that, I can't even explain it right, so if someone could try to put it in perspective or help me understand it a little better, I would greatly appreciate it, so thanks in advance, and sorry for my bad english.",23May2018,1
326,"Due to personal issues, I always faked my way through life. I was outgoing and superficial with everyone. But in learning to be myself, I find that I’ve lost this cheerful facade.

333,"Hello all,
TL;DR I need help getting over my fears and anxieties regarding driving. I’m afraid of driving, and I’m afraid that I’ll never catch up to other people who have been driving for longer. And I’m also full of regret that I haven’t learned to drive already.
I'm 23 years old, live in America, and don't have a driver's license (I do have a permit or whatever). It's inconvenient, as I live in a city where public transit is practically nonexistent. Thus, I must rely on Uber/Lyft, my friends, and my parents driving me around.
So of course, I do want a license. I mean, even with a college degree, without a license, I feel like an immature kid. I feel dependent and not independent, and I feel helpless, and far behind other people my age. After all, in American culture, getting a license and a car seems almost like a rite of passage into adulthood.
I also recognize how much a license would change and improve my life. A car represents freedom and independence. I could go where I want, when I want. I could even go to other cities easily, to visit other people and places. New opportunities would be everywhere, and the world would suddenly open up into a whole new world. I think people who drive often truly take for granted just how much a car opens up the world. And with a license and a car, I wouldn’t have to rely on and burden others (which I feel guilty about). In fact, I could be the one to help my friends, and pay them back for so many years of help.
HOWEVER, there are some psychological obstacles that have kept from driving for so long. My fear of driving, and after that my paralyzing regret and my fear of being hopelessly behind.
The biggest one is my fear of driving.
I know I’m not perfect and make mistakes. But in driving, you can’t really afford to make mistakes sometimes. So of course, I’m afraid of making mistakes.
But… I’m worried that, because of my fear of making mistakes, I’ll be a nervous driver, and too cautious. And then I’ll have more problems because I’ll get stressed and anxious when people get mad I’m taking too long or going too slow.
And then I’ll go impulsively or go too fast and have an accident.
Like I can already see that happening. In fact, I already have experienced that in my few times driving. I honestly am not always the best in high-pressure situations.
Anyways, I know that driving is a skill that improves with practice. Some even say that you never stop improving (which also worries me, because in that case I’m way behind and eternally behind like everyone else my age). But even if my technical skills keep improving, I don’t know if my psychology would get better. I’m worried that that might just be my character, you know?
Anyways, before you say “just suck it up” I think my fear ISN’T just some irrational phobia. It’s an entirely rational fear I think. I don’t know how everyone else conveniently chooses to forget how deadly driving is, how little room for error there is. Something like one person every 15 or 20 seconds dies in a car accident. Maybe some of those deaths wouldn’t have happened if people had been more afraid and careful. But again, I’m worried I’ll be TOO careful…
My second obstacle…
I’m already full of regret that I haven’t gotten a license already. I could have gotten a license years and years ago. I’m already full of regret, but I’m also ironically afraid of all the additional regret I’ll feel once I DO have my license. Once I really can drive, once I have that freedom, I feel I’ll be even MORE full of regret that I didn’t get a license sooner, or even the day I turned 16. Once I know exactly what I’ve been missing, I’ll feel even more regret at lost years and lost opportunities. How many opportunities and people and friendships and memories did I miss by not having a car? I know the longer I wait the more regret I’ll feel in the end, but I’m not looking forward to the full realization of all that I’ve missed. I will never have those years back to do again…
My last obstacle…
I feel that I’m hopelessly behind. I’ve missed out on so much, I’m already way behind. And I’ll never have had all those experiences and memories that everyone with a car, all my friends and peers, have already experienced. They say that driving is a skill that you never stop improving in. Well, if that’s true, then I really never will catch up! I’m sure I’ll be an embarrassingly bad driver compared to everyone else my age. I’m insecure and sad about that. I can’t even imagine driving for more than a few hours. And I feel so behind and left out, so trapped. And I feel that everyone else knows about cars and gas and how to drive, and how to get a license and penetrate the bureaucracy, and I haven’t a damn clue about any of that. I feel like everyone else except me knows this secret language, and I’m a clueless child out in the cold. I feel like a pathetic baby, not a peer to people my age…
I have a lot of self-loathing from all of this… It makes me tempted to just never learn, strangely, because I would just feel so overwhelmed by playing years of catch-up.
Anyways, all these anxieties and fears have kept me from driving. But this summer I’m determined. I’m gonna do it. But even though I’ll “just suck it up”, I don’t know how to deal with my fear of driving. I also worry that even when I have a car and am driving, I’ll still have those other two anxieties I mentioned. I don’t know how to deal with those either.
If anyone can give me advice, I’d really appreciate it. Especially if anyone else has been in a similar situation.
Sorry for the long post, but I felt I really had to put all my thoughts out there.",23May2018,1
335,"Have an awesome job that I love.  I love almost everything about it so much and it is gainful employment.  Just started 2 months ago.  Things are going well and I'm learning a lot.  The only problem is- my immediate supervisor is kind of not so nice to me.  It's weird, because I've never run into this from a boss but I can tell my boas doesn't like me.  He holds a different tone and manner with me than others, like is super nice and jovial around others, but just is smug as hell around me and to me in front of others.  Will ignore me when delegating tasks to my coworker and I.  Like just talks past me to my other coworker like I'm not there, when giving instructions to us.  I'm insightful and know when I'm not being respected.

Also, I've slowly been noticing a racist undertone to conversations and topics, makes me really uncomfortable.  

Here's the hard part- I live in the middle of nowhere and decent jobs are really hard to find.  Benefits and pay are excellent.  

If I quit I'd have to be honest about why, and I know for a fact my boss would probably be fired, which I don't necessarily want.  

What should I do?  Should I just quit? Quit with explanation to higher ups and get my boss fired?  Directly approach boss with these concerns?

342,"I make good money right now \(really good\).

The new offer is *insanely* good.

I realize this is a first world problem that I'm lucky to have, but it's giving me a lot of stress.

Pros of the new job:

* More money \(like 30&amp;#37; more when you factor in less expensive insurance\)
* Supposedly less stress \(I'm indispensable at my current job, which means when anything goes wrong, I'm on call\). I'm bad about not doing anything less than a perfect job and often voluntarily work nights after the kids are in bed, etc.
* More family\-oriented \(I'm the only person at my current job with small children\)
* Bigger company \(current job is like 20 people, other company is like 400 people\)
* I'm being recruited by an old colleague, so I'd go in knowing at least my boss
* My sister is unemployed and my father is retired \(and moving in with my sister\), my mother\-in\-law is always one unforeseen expense away from not making rent every month, and so on...so the extra money could definitely come in handy. My father and mother\-in\-law are old enough that I need to start thinking about how to take care of them in a few years.

Pros of my current job:

* I enjoy the work \(a lot\). If I weren't getting paid, it's the kind of thing I'd do for fun.
* I like everyone I work with, and my team lead and ""actual"" boss are both very well\-respected in the industry; being in good with them means never worrying about a job in the future \(maybe? I dunno, maybe they'll retire after this\)
* I feel a personal loyalty to the company \(I helped create what it is today\) and a personal loyalty to my boss \(which I feel is somewhat reciprocated\)
* I'm indispensable, meaning that the only way I'm gonna lose my job is if the whole company goes kaput.
* I'm a big fish in a small pond. I get to do things pretty much my way and I'm trusted that my way will work \(and thus far, it mostly has, thankfully\)
* The money is certainly ""good enough""; I make enough to have a nice house and my wife can be a SAHM and our kids are in good schools and so on.
* The company is in a more niche environment, meaning we only have a few customers but the customers we have don't have many other options. I feel like, though I'm not sure, that I'd be able to ride out a recession or something pretty well here.

Cons of the new job:

* The work doesn't seem nearly as exciting
* It's a big enough offer that I'd feel like I'd have a target on my back: when things go south, they'd save a lot of money by letting me go \(though everyone at this company is highly paid, think San Francisco tech wages\)
* It's in a much more competitive market; there are plenty of other options and choosing a different one is cheap and easy
* I'm really good at what I do, but I would be a big fish in a big pond
* They seem to be hiring *a lot.* Like they had a full\-on brochure for people coming to interview, and talk about ""onboarding days"" and all that. It makes me think they're expanding too quickly.

Cons of my current job:

* We're profitable, but barely. There's not a lot of wiggle room, so I can't expect to get a huge raise or retention bonus or anything, though I can probably expect \*something\*.
* As I said above, I work a lot. I'm responsible for a huge amount of stuff, and there's no one else who can do it. It's gratifying, but it's a lot of stress.

351,"Hi. This is one of my first posts so bear with me.

Anyway, until today I worked for an Online English School. Flexible schedule, work whenever you want and you get paid per conducted lesson. No pressure, you can work as little as 1 lesson every three months, but of course, your salary will be ridiculous. You also have the option to cancel the lessons, too, but due to harsh rules you get punished quite a bit. 

Anyway, one of my family members passed away recently and I had to cancel 10 lessons. I've never done that before, I informed the company on time but they still decided to punish me. They keep asking me to provide a proof of death, a ""death certificate"" as they call it. They're still going to punish me for canceling these 10 lessons even if I had a good reason to do so.

My question here is, is it possible to sue this company for some ""privacy"" mumbo jumbo thing as they're asking for a ""death certificate"" as a proof?

352,"So quick background ... since I was young I have always hated my mother ... she is a non-stop complainer that seems to thrive on making other people miserable. When I was 16 my older sister died.  When I was 18 my mother was diagnosed with MS.  When I was 21 my father got cancer and died that year.  I then realized I was about to be left alone with this person I cannot stand, and will be the only family member left to deal with her health issues.  

So fast forward  to a year ago she took a fall in the house, and ended up in the hospital.   I came in from Seattle for 7 weeks to deal with her going from hospital to rehab, back to hospital, back to rehab, looking for assisted living, looking for full time caretakers, paying bills, taking over finances, cleaning the house etc.  All the while she is yelling, complaining and insulting every second of the day.  I should also add that she is completely blind and has been so for over a decade.

So now she is living with full-time caretakers and is making their lives miserable.  Every caretaker that lives with her within a month says it is pure hell and they never met a person this awful.  And I am the one that has to be in the middle of all this drama non-stop.  I have found some really wonderful caretakers but within 2 weeks it completely falls apart. 

So the thing I am looking for advice on ... I need to break free from this. But I can never see a clear path because she is incapable of doing anything.  Do you think I can just transfer all her finances back in her name, send her the information and then change my phone number.  I am now 53 and feel like an old man myself  ...

356,"So i will make this quick.

I have held my job at a company there for almost 10 years. Recently there have been a lot of changes to the company, title changes, system revamps, everything you name it.

I am no idiot, ive been there 10 years and do have friends in very high places in the company, recently the #3 in charge who is a good friend clued me in on a disturbing detail about my current position.

This employer is seemingly shafting people left and right and it came to my attention that moving forward anyone newly hired person with my title is being hired at 7k more than what I am making, I am barely making 1k more than new employees last year. 

He told me that anyone asking should be up'ed to the current salary but only if the school approves and its not really being made mentioned.

personally, I asked for the raise and will likely get it, sucks that new people now will make as much as I but the part that really sucks is I really want to tell others, the others who have familiies and really are considering leaving but dont have the nerve to say anything.

Any advice on what I should do? Keep my mouth shut? I am afraid if I speak out that it could jepordize me",23May2018,1

Recently she's been irritable,angry,crying a lot, taking everything to heart, getting worried about everything. 

The only reason I don't ditch is because I'm hoping shell switch back to her happy self. This is like a switch that happens everyday. It's so frustrating. One second she wants nothing to do with me, the next she's all over me, the next she's in between. It's all over the place. I don't want to leave her cause she's awesome, but she's also the most frustrating person ever. 

I dont know what to do. I can't reason with her. Serious conversations don't work they just start fights. I try to stay away from that and just be happy. It so difficult to enjoy being together when she's always fighting with me, having some weird ass mood swing, judging me, or getting jealous.

363,"So here's the background of my current situation: Husband's parents got two puppies last winter (husky german shepard mix) due to empty nest. One male and one female. They also owned another older dog who is nice and trained (though not 100%) by my husband and his siblings when they were younger. My in laws no longer want to have the pups since they grew. Neither were trained and just stayed in the back yard.


Husband and I take up an offer from in laws to live in their basement apartment to help us save money for a house. To help ease his parents stress, he decides to take a dog (the male) even though I told him I am not in the mood to train teenage dogs and all I want to focus on is nesting for our baby and saving money. Just to add, the dog was my fav when he was a puppy, so I think that's why my husband took him. Also I had a feeling that while we would try to train our dog, we would be stuck training the other dogs as well since his parents weren't training them. And that's basically what happened.


Situation: Husband and I move into in laws basement apartment. The entrance is in the back yard with the dogs. They jump, push, whine, have a lot of energy, and try to run away when the fence is open. We had to lock the pups on the garage in order to move in without the dogs getting in the way.

We move in and start the training but its not going so well on my end. Our dog is big. I've only ever owned small lap dogs growing up and told my husband that if we ever did get a dog, the biggest I would want is a medium. That clearly didn't happen. I'm trying with this dog and there's small progress but its hard because not only are we training our dog, we are also stuck training and giving attention to the other dogs. He's also a teenage shepsky so that bring in a lot issues. Its hard, especially since my in laws are not really helping out. My MIL works all day and only gives her dogs attention when feeding them. FIL doesn't train them at all. Its infuriating. 


Its a struggle for me. I'm so tired. I don't want to train dogs. My husband adores our dogs but he works all day and I'm a SAHW. I can't leave without getting bombarded by dogs. Our dog doesn't listen to me 100% of the time. Today he tried to bite me because I tried to force him outside after he ate breakfast and he wanted to stay inside. He's ran away on me twice before when I tried leaving and entering my place. The other dogs have ran away too but husband was there to get them. 


I just can't. And everytime I complain about this to my SO, he gets sad. He tries to help a bit and throws some solutions that could work if I weren't pregnant, or having to train other dogs other than my own. I'm really starting to resent the dogs, my living situation, and I'm starting to grow a little resentful of my husband. I get stressed in the mornings when my husband works because of the added responsibilities I have to give to these damn dogs. This morning I had really bad nausea but I forced myself up to try to feed my dog, while wrestling with the other dog to prevent her from coming inside my apartment. I also feel like I can't invite anyone over to visit because of the dogs. I'll stop my dog from jumping and pushing, but why do I have to also stop my in laws dogs? I love our dog but I'm done. I don't know what to do. How can I train one teenage dog if there other dogs get in the way? Or the fact that my in laws are little to no help? Or trying to train a teenage shepsky and all their behavioural issues? And how on earth am I suppose to raise a newborn while also training a dog(s)??? That's my biggest headache.
There's so much more issues with this that I didn't include, but I really need some help.

So my current situation is that in the past couples years of being in high school I've had times where I get extremely stress and emotional. To the point where I've considered suicide at least 5 times (once got extremely close to doing it but started feeling better after being with my close friends that day). I know that normally I should go to my parents to talk about it but my parents are heavily religious to the point where they would most likely try to pray away the ""depression"". All I really want to know is if I am depressed and how I should manage it. I want to know from a professional since I dont want to be the type to just search it up on Google and see if it matches me. Normally I would have done it myself but I don't have any money, I'm not allowed to get a job since it would hinder school, and i can't ask my parents either.

365,"For the past two years or so, I've been in a bit of a rut. I'm only 19 years old and, one the one hand, I have a lot to be happy about. I study at a really good university, have a good family, in good health and I get to experience things that others do not.

And yet, there is still a 'rut' I cannot get myself out of. Around June 2016 I finished school and planned for university. I was nervous about university but not enitely scared. I went to university and in all truth it was pretty crap. I struggled to fit in, hated everthing and was miserable. At the same time, I lost contact (to this day I think I never had any contact) with many of my friends and just hated it. I was close to suicide and generally in a terrible place. I dug myself out through hard work and sheer effort, and I still study now at the same place and a lot has changed, but nothing feels different.

I have a load of friends but the truth is none of them feel like what a friend should be. I should note that during my bad period, my bestfriend practically told me she wanted nothing to do with me and it made me realise that I was alone in more ways than I knew. I do a lot now to enjoy myself and I have a lot of hobbies. I also never get bored and I always have something to do. I have had many cool jobs and I have some already planned and a lot of summer plans, but all by myself.

I just cannot shake the feeling that there is something wrong. I still feel like I haven't got any close friends and I have genuinely socialised as much as I could this year. I thought at one stage it could be a companionship thing, but I found myself rejecting two people as I realised that it was not. My days are spent working/revising and when I am free, I just read or watch sports or something. I do go out a lot also, but often alone and I even invited my 'bestfriends' to a day out and all of them pretty much said no. I also noticed that one of my friends pretty much uses me as a clown. He did something really nasty to someone yet he did it via me (used my phone to send something) and it made me realise that I am like a guinea pig. The other two are really nice, but they seem completely reluctant to go anywhere with me or do anything with me if they are alone.

I don't pity myself but I do feel like there is nothing wrong with me. I'm much better than I was and I live life to the fullest, but I don't get to enjoy it with anyone. I don't even know how I feel much.",23May2018,1
366,"I need some advice...I’ve been working at my company for about 2.5 Years now and so far the work has been decent, the pay is pretty good, and I like the people overall. 

I work in the mortgage industry which is only relevant because my job is really stressful, there are many deadlines to meet and everything has to be done like, yesterday. But so far I’ve been OK with the stress because I really like my teammates and feel loyal to them because they taught me everything I know. 

Business has slowed down for my loan officer and so I’ve been forced to take on another loan officer to boost my workload. I agreed, on the condition that she wouldn’t give me very many loans and that my main priority would be my team. Also, I was told that this may be a permanent thing or it may not be, but that we could reassess the workload later. 

I just got connected with this new person this Monday and I have already been given 2 nightmare files which are something I’ve never done and are notorious in the industry for being the most complicated and time consuming. Plus they go on for months and months and I was NOT under the impression that I would be working with this person for that long. Also, I had been warned by multiple coworkers that this loan officer does not know her stuff and that she can be a lot to handle. I have already experienced this from the past 3 days. 

I am going to meet with my manager tomorrow about this. I would be OK with me keeping 1 of the nightmare files and her giving the 2nd one to someone else. I guess this is where I need advice: what if my manager refuses to pawn off one of the loans? I’m in a place financially where it would be OK to quit because I am living at home rent-free. However, I do feel loyal to my teammates and I don’t have a lot of money saved up. What should I do if it gets to the point in the conversation where it’s My way or the highway?

I need your help!

I’m a medical doctor in a long term relationship with another doctor. This year I applied for a specialty that recruits annually and distributes trainees throughout the country according to interview performance.  I ranked well enough to basically choose my job and picked a reasonably nice area of the country based on my SO’s preference. I had no particular reason to apply there apart from that. I (along with most of my friends and family) live in London and this new area is about 2 hours away. 

Ever since making the choice I’ve had massive anxiety about it. We do have some friends out there but I would be moving away from my family and a large chunk of our social network. 

This anxiety has made me rethink everything and leaves me with 2 options: 

(1) Move out there and see if I like it. However, if I don’t, I will have no option but to complete training out there (as you can’t reapply once you start training). 

(2) Resign my training position and reapply to stay in London. Now this would leave me in the lurch this year and I’d have to roll the application dice again... but I did well enough last year that I think I could get a position again. But it’s always a gamble! 

SO doesn’t mind much either way.

375,"A guy at work tried to kill me today using Thallium. He had put it on the drivers door handle of my car while he was out having a smoke. Luckily he was spotted by another co-worker who he had earlier told about the thallium(he hadn't taken him serious) and also the cleaning lady (he had told her what he was planning  just moments before.).

This had all come about because I had played a practical joke on him months ago (october), after he had smashed some of our warehouse radios. I found an old disused c.c.t.v. camera and attached it to an upright support near his work area. He went on until April thinking this was a legit camera, then the truth came out. He wasn't pleased to say the least and so I took a bit of verbal abuse from him (I didn't report it since I had brought it on myself from acting the bollucks).

Fast Forward to last week. I had been of sick for the first two days of the week, and when I came in on Wednesday was warned by a co-worker that that this guy was on the warpath. It turns out that his pallet truck had stopped working (would not release) and he blamed me. Again I got verbal abuse, only this time I had done nothing to deserve it. I reported it to my supervisor, who reported it to the GM. 

Statements were taken from both of us as part of the investigation. I turned out he was now claiming I had it in for a few of my co-workers and had been bad mouthing them(not true), also he had said I was interfering with their work logs(also not true). I denied it all and this was accepted by the GM. I told them outright that I was prepared to offer an apology for the camera and would accept an apology from the other guy. We were told there would be a further meeting on the matter on Tuesday this week. However this needed to be postponed until today. The other guy heard this and went ballistic, not because of the delay but because he had believed our HR manager from Dublin would be down to fire me. Later yesterday evening he showed my co-worker a little bottle marked thallium (I was told there was what looked like bits of metal in it). The other co-worker thought it was a load of bull so said nothing.

Today, while I was completing my mornings work I was told by the supervisor to come find him and the GM when I was going on lunch break. When I did eventually go to find them I spotted them both outside standing around my car taking pictures and wearing gloves. It was then I was told what had happened. The cleaning lady had rang her own boss in tears to tell him, and my co-worker had went straight to the supervisor when he saw how serious things were getting.

What I need to advice on is what to do next. He has been suspended and escorted out, but will me going to the Garda(irish police) bring more shit down on me. I have been living in fear for the last week, and have heard he was looking to find my address. Things are only worse now, and he 100% will lose his job. Will going to the gards only put me in further danger? Or is it my only option.

376,"First of all, I live in Canada. I don't know if this makes a huge difference, but I know a lot of people on reddit are from America so there may be things that American universities have or do that Canadian universities don't.  

So I want to do computer science in university and I'm stuck on deciding which one I should go to.   

Tuition costs: Both are around the same price Commute: I'm not living on campus due to financial reasons, but they both take around the same time to get to.

One of them is a smaller commuter university and I can go into the computer science program right away. But I'm worried about the lack of campus life because the school can be pretty dead at times. The program is pretty good and you can get pretty good co\-op opportunities as well. I've also never done any programming I guess? so I'm worried that I will be stuck and I can't transfer out. Also, there's a lot of guys in the program, and I'm a girl so I'm worried about feeling awkward or left out or I don't know, but I think that's just true for the whole program in general in Canada.   

The other one is a larger university and more people live on residence, so it has that more stereotypical university type feeling? However, the big problem is that I would have to take science pre\-requisite courses and then apply to get into the program. These days computer science is really competitive so I would need around 80&amp;#37; to get into it and also there are waitlist issues. I feel like the campus is more ""alive"" but then since I'm not living in a dorm, I will probably miss out on a lot of social things.

Additionally, I don't know if I want to do computer science? It just seemed really interesting for me? and I don't know if I'm the best at chemistry or physics which is what I need to take in the larger university. I think I'm just scared of failure and I feel like everything is a race so I need to achieve certain things at a certain age.   

Does prestige even matter for computer science? I know it might be easier for larger schools to get co\-op opportunities, but I heard that if you're good at coding then you're fine? I don't know if that's true or not. 

Does anyone have any advice? PS I'm not going to Waterloo which is basically the top school for compsci in Canada so does it even matter which one I choose?",23May2018,1

I've been with her for 4 years now, and I'm 20 y/o now.

They tried talking to each other but it really didn't work out, it even got much worse, and ever since the fight, I haven't been talking so much to him (maybe once every month). 
My birthday is in 2 weeks and she doesn't want him there, they both hate each other and she really wants me to stand up to him. On the other hand, my bestfriend hasn't complained to me, he still likes me and doesn't think I have something against him but he knows something is wrong, we don't really talk anymore. Whenever I try talking about it she tells me I should be on her side and not his, because he's the one that hurt her and cries all the water from her body out of her eyes.

381,"Hello! My name is Nicolas and I live in Colombia. I was born and raised in an upper-middle class household. I have always been what is traditionally considered as privileged as I have good life conditions in a country in which people still starve to death, this is the reason why many people think that I should be happy, but since I was born my dad a doctor has always been physically and verbally abusive towards my brother, mother, and myself. This has deeply weakened my mental sanity. All through my childhood my dad called me names because I was thin and just before I became a teen I got fat and he started insulting me because of this, causing a very big self-image problem in which sometimes I feel guilty for eating. Also my dad has beaten me up using belts, books, and other household elements or just kicked me, slapped me, punched me. The fact that my dad also beat my brother because of his low grades made me develop into an academic. Always seeking knowledge and getting high grades. This did not stop my dad as he continued hitting me for getting into troubles or because of my personality. I became a person who seems to be confident and arrogant because of what I knew, but deep inside I knew that the only place in which I could shelter myself from just how crappy my life was was in my intelligence, this caused me to surround myself from people like myself that are just not messed up. My mom finally just couldn't stand my dad's abuse and left. She hoped that we would come with her but we said no. She has always been loving, a bit strict, and a great mother overall so this hurt a lot. 2 months after she left she started telling me how my dad cheated on her when I was a week old, that she sued him because he grabbed her arm and thrashed her, that he did not want my brother, and other messed up things. She told me that she continued to live with my dad because she wanted us to have a dad. This all cemented my deep hate for my dad, but then i realized a way out. I knew and know that my dad will never accept the fact that I am gay because he has always been very restrictive of that and he even beat me up because I wasn't completely masculine as a kid that is why I am not going to tell him and I decided that once i graduate high school I will move to North America and never look back. I know that it seems just stupid to move because my mom is still here, but all of these years of abuse have made me a very self-preserving and cunning person. So I can think coldly and I know that this is the right way out. I have talked with my dad about me moving to Canada once i graduate and he seems on board with it. But sometimes I wonder if he really wants to. My mom wants me to stay but I can't. I am a very resistant person but I just can't go on. I don't want to live in a country like Colombia. I need advice on what I could do. I have worked so hard by learning even more english and getting qualifications in it. I will do anything, I am determined to get out of here and I will. The only way that I could beat my constant depression after my mom left and I realized that i was pretty much alone was by understanding that I can get away from here.

I know that. but ever since finding out I didn't like barbies when I was little, he now sends me jewelry every year for my birthday. and it's really frustrating because I purposefully only asked for about $26 worth of stuff, (which he did get me and which I'm really grateful for) because I didn't want to ask for *too* much. but if I knew he was going to spend an extra hundred dollars on a necklace I'm never going to wear I would have asked for wacom!

should I just suck it up and tell him I like it or be honest with him? is there at least a way I can ask him not to spend so much money on me, politely?",23May2018,0

384,"I just started working for a large credit card processing company as an independent contractor. Within the first day of them telling us to poke around their software to get familiar with it I found access to a database of tens of thousands of clients personal information. This is including their social security numbers home addresses business addresses bank accounts including routing and account numbers as well as tax ID and even more information.

They spent multiple days preaching about how all of their clients information is kept safe behind multiple locked doors and areas but yet I was able to get all of this info non redacted without any trouble at all. Keep in mind I am just an independent contractor and signed practically nothing regarding client information or anything.

I'm unsure with how to move forward with this to get some sort of financial reward In this massive security flaw. I don't know if I should speak to a lawyer, or contact the Social Security Administration, or contact the owner of the company that I'm working for, or contact some of the business owners directly.

I also know that there is a black market for this information but I am a man of ethics i would not consider going that route. However many of the things they told me during the interview process have seem to be less than accurate so I am by no means loyal to this company.

And there you have it. I'm open to what everyone's opinion is on this situation.

385,"So, a few months ago (March), I broke up with my boyfriend of ten months because I couldn't handle his negavitity and him being drunk and/or not communicating with me. He has since spent the last two months trying to win me back, and he was finally blocked for the second time, last Friday. 

From the end of March into the beginning of April, I was speaking to someone in California. I thought of him as a friend (I'm midwest), and I let things go a little further than that, in respect to sexual interactions (over the phone). I still regret doing that, considering he flew up here to hang out, and I guess I didn't feel the same way I did talking to him on the phone. It was different to meet him in person, than on the phone. I tried to stress that while he was around and it just didn't happen I guess. That fiasco ended up with my now ""supposed"" boyfriend telling him off, me going through a plethora of cyber bullying (which still really hasn't quit), and me losing the last group of friends I had. (I know it seems stupid for me to have gotten so attached to a group of friends online, but after losing my now ex boyfriend, I needed support you know?) 

Anyways, then comes into the story of my now sort of boyfriend. I say sort of because he's still listed as single on facebook, and he won't put us on Facebook either. We've had several arguments since then. The first one was about me asking if we could be Facebook official, because I saw his phone and some random chick had messaged him saying ""Hi daddy 😘"". The second because I asked him to upload files from my laptop to my Google drive so I could get them for school (I was already there, and had forgotten my flashdrive at home). He had opened Google chrome and my Facebook opened (My web browser is set to open the last tabs that were open when I closed it), and he saw that my ex had been talking to me that morning (he had previously mentioned he wasn't comfortable with my ex talking to me, however I'd sent him a video the night prior because he'd sent it to me months before, bad move, I know), and he flipped his shit. That's how my ex got blocked the second time. Now yesterday, a friend of mine from the east coast (her and I have been talking excessively, as she's going through a hard time, and I've been stressed to the max), was having a moment because of family issues. He got pissed off because he only has two days off a week, and I work one of them, and because I was trying to console her, he flipped out, saying that I never spend any time with him, and I'm always talking to her when I'm not talking to him. I tried to explain that I don't have many friends, and that she's going through a rough patch, but that didn't mean anything, so I put my tablet down, muted my phone, and continued watching a movie with him (I am not a movie person, they're generally boring). About an hour later he asked me what was wrong, and I told him not to worry about it. He pressed and I snapped saying that I'm sorry but he already made his stance, so I don't know what he expected me to say, and to just forget it. She left me a message later on, and I told him I was running to the gas station for cigarettes, and called her on the way to check in with her. I checked in, and called her this morning, and she's more or less okay now, but she told me that she's caught feelings for me, not just friendship feelings. I tried to message my boyfriend this afternoon (as part of his complaint was that I never talked to him at work), and when I asked what was up he said he was at work. And so I asked what he was doing, and he said working. So I said okay then, just trying to make conversation, and he said, well I'm at work. So I guess he doesn't want me to talk to him? I'm very confused to what to do. I've explained to my friend that I value her friendship too much to be in a relationship with her (not to mention she kinda lives 9 hours away from me, and as much as I care about her, I don't want to see our friendship ruined by a relationship), and she gets that. I've tried to talk to my boyfriend and I just get brushed off, saying I'm too full of drama among other things... I just don't know what to do. I've given him a place to stay after he lost the house him and his ex were renting, I drove him around for damn near two weeks while he car was in repo, and I've paid all of the bills for the last month and a half save $45 I got for the cable bill. I can barely afford my apartment by myself, much less with a second person living there. My mom wants me to move back home and save up and stuff, and I want to. But I don't know how to tell my ""boyfriend"" to fuck off. 

To put all of this into perspective, I go to school full time (accelerated Medical Assistant program), I work full time (40 hours a week), my dad recently had a stroke, and I totalled my car through all of this. I'm very stressed, I have a cat and two chinchillas to pay for, on top of a car payment and all of my other bills. I literally have no idea what to do, short of bashing my head into a wall, which isn't going to help at all.

If you have questions, ask. If you'd rather pm me, go for it. I'm just at a loss, and I don't want to lose anyone, or anything else. ",23May2018,1
386,"So my boyfriend (let's call him G) and I broke up a few months ago but decided to stay friends with benefits.

Long story short, I went to a festival and kissed his cousin. 

Noted:shouldn't have kissed G's cousin but we we're broken up so did it really matter who I kissed? 

Anyways, G was supposed to be moving out of state (hence the reason we broke up and why I originally was NOT going to tell him about the kiss). Plans changed, G decided to stay. He then tells me that he wants to work towards getting back together. At this point I know I have to tell him and let him decide if he still wants to work on things. 

I tell him. He blows up and tells me he needs space, but we could still be friends. 

Ok I understand. 

30 minutes later he calls me and says we should see other people 

Ok I get it

Next morning, I wake up to a NOVEL about how he couldn't sleep with the thought of me trying to ""sleep with his cousin"" (his words not mine because NEVER had I exclaimed that I had any interest in actually sleeping with his cousin). 

Anyways, G then proceeds to tell me he no longer wants me to be a part of his life at all and that the only communication we would have is to arrange when I could grab some of my things from his apartment. 

I didn't respond because I was baffled! How could he go from saying we could still be friends to wanting the minimum amount of contact possible with me all within maybe a 12 hour time span?

Fast forward to this morning at 11:

I get a text from G apologizing for ""being an asshole"" (his words) and that he still wanted to be friends including that he had also been thinking a lot about me this last week. 

Now here is my problem:

I don't know if I trust him enough to allow him back into my life....him and I have both made mistakes but he has been so willing to just pick up his life and leave without me. I know he is just asking for friends but this still applies since I don't want to have him back in my life again just for him to do the same thing.

387,"24 M, I feel like such a loser and a failure. The past 8 years all ive done is half ass my way through life and quit anytime anything got tough. I've done nothing but work shitty jobs and lose my life getting high and playing video games. I quit 3 or 4 different school programs because they got hard after a while and I didn't have any drive to go through with them, i quit 4 different jobs because theyre all around customers, and im like 75% introverted and have severe Generalized anxiety, which made completely miserable. I'm good at faking being sociable but on the inside I'm always in fight or flight mode and just want then to shut the fuck up and leave me alone... So now my resume is chock full of customer service experiences, but I never want to work customer service for the rest of my fucking life. 

So ya here i am, all i do is smoke weed and play games because it's the best way to ignore the world around me and make myself forget how much of a fucking useless waste of space i am.

I don't care about anything except my girlfriend. However, I dont love myself so it's pretty hard to be at my best around her, and I don't want her to see me as a scared little child who can't get his own life together to face the world.

I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm stuck im a rut and I don't even want to help myself out of it. Every day im just reminded of my wasted potential but i never get the courage to do something about it. i need help. I'm scared and I really need help...",23May2018,4
388,"Hi,

like I said i have the feeling that everything is going wrong and I am losing many things I achieved until now. 

My first issue is my current situation in college. I always loved science and especially physics. In school I never had to learn that much compared to other students but always have been one of the best students. The only subject I really learned for and spend leisure time was actually physics. Sometimes I stayed all night long watching videos or reading articles about serveral topics. After school I got the opportunity to attend a college with a really high reputation. Since I began studying there I kind of lost all interest in topics I admired before. To be honest I have to force myself spending time for learning and this should not be point behind studying in my opinion. I am quiet sure that I have the potential to be an outstanding student but I cannot show this. This really makes me sad to be at most average and knowing that it is my own fault. 

Furthermore I assume that I am not going to pass later exams if I still have no motivation to learn for my exams. If this really happens I would have no idea what to do instead because that's all I am capable of or at least where I am above average

My second issue is my  lonliness. In school I had many friends and enjoyed spending time with them. After graduating I lost interest in keeping contact with most of my former friends or they stopped to keep in touch with me. Actually no one really remained. Sometimes I hang out with a few of my friends that I met in school \(and therefore know for years\) but I kind of feel unconfortable spending time with them and I actually really do not know why. The thing is I also have troubles in making new friends in college which is why I often feel lonely.  There is no one I could ask for some advice and I do not want to bother family members. One of my former best friends lost his interest in our friendship after he found a girlfriend and made new friends. I always liked him most  but hated to see how he was changed by his new friends. This all happened long time ago like one or two years but it kind of frustrates me until today that he reaplaced me that way.

When I look in the mirror I am often disgusted about myself because of all this stupid hattred inside me. I feel like a misanthrope who is not able to make friends and losing people he liked.

Sometimes I wonder if walking away from everything, leaving this stupid life, my ""friends"", family and college behind would be the best I could do right now. I cannot find any motivation for these things I am currently doing because I really don't know what I generally want to achieve in life. 

To be honest I cannot explain my emotions because most time I am not sad about my situation but also not happy. I am just disappointed that I am losing control of my life and messing things up.

Maybe someone was in a similar sitaution and can give me some advice.

389,"This might be quite a confusing read but try to bear with me please. In my late teens and early 20's \(currently 25\) I was involved with what some might call the 'Alt Right' \(though I think I was more Alt\-Lite\).

Although I didn't hate people for their skin color, I hated cringe. I hated drugs because I find drug culture cringey \(still don't like drug culture actually\), I hated feminism \(particularly male feminists\) because I found it and them cringey. I hated Antifa because it was cringey \(even doxxed a few of them, which I now feel bad about\). I am not religious but I found Atheism cringey and was repelled by it.

What drove me into hate was a disdain for a nihilistic emasculated culture full of soy\-boys \(people who are materialistic and define themselves by what they consume\).

I am currently a postgraduate at college. Although I didn't go to any Alt\-Right protests and I don't have a criminal record. I have done and said some things I am very ashamed of. I think about it every\-day and I would like to improve.

There wasn't a big wake\-up moment for me. Just a slow realisation that I had done inhumane \(though legal\) things and that I did not like the person I was becoming. I realised I was defining myself by things I was against instead of things I was for.

391,"Okay, I am losing my mind. I am so depressed and it feels like the end is near. I have also messed up my life in incalculable ways yet I'm still chained to  my desk, while I am forced to solve these dilemmas without much wiggle room.

For one,  I am detransitioning back to male. I no longer want to be a woman but changed my name six months ago while I was convinced that's what I wanted. I need to change my name back if I ever want to find another job and I desperately need a new one because I am about to be fired, even though the process of changing your name in Los Angeles takes several months due to the volumes of people in need of legal services here. So I basically have to hold on to this job that I held while I began my transition about 18 months ago and now I'm detransitioning in the same job. Also, my one year lease is up in two months and I do not wish to renew it. I cannot live in a motel room surrounded by homeless encampments and traffic noise any longer. The constant sound of honking, sirens, and crazy people fighting over drugs if is enough reason for me to be miserable. I live in an expensive city and I will have to rent a room for someone lest I want to end up in a similar situation. I have zero social skills and no one will let me rent from them.

Having to deal with these problems would be so much easier if I didn't have to work. To be honest, I haven't done much working at work for a long time. I am constantly trembling from anxiety knowing the gravity of my problems, and because I do not like my job at all, I find it impossible to focus.

394,"I have posted this already on r/cats but I don’t think text posts are really a preferred means of sharing on there. I’ll try here with hopes of some  more input. 

Hi there, guys! My SO and I have a senior cat (11) who has been with us nearly 3 years. She is small, sweet, social with us, gets along with our 3 guinea pigs swimmingly, but like most cats is very set in her ways and routine. She has adapted to moves and guests and travel very well in the past. 

Enter Phineas (still trying names out), the 9lb 8 year old chihuahua-terrier mix. We got him two nights ago. He’s very quiet, timid, and is still gaining his confidence in the household. When we brought him in, Dinah (cat) was in the living room, and she stayed out and smelled us and him a little. They were about a foot apart and no incident occurred. 

We have them separated right now. Dinah is in the bedroom with all her things, in the evening we let her out so she has the whole back of the apartment but block off the hallway so she can’t see the dog (there was hissing and a bark the first night when he slipped through the door and she saw him) and pup is in the living room/kitchen. We swap blankets and toys so each animal can get familiar by scent. We also have taken turns sleeping with each animal so Dinah can have some normalcy and the dog can bond with us both. So far, the cat ended a brief hunger strike and eats/drinks just fine. We took this as a good sign. 

The first day there was hissing when the cat felt cornered. This was my error as their first intro was smooth and I got cocky letting the dog near her a second time. 

Tonight we plan to get a baby gate so she can see him but has a way to escape. We plan to have him on a leash during these more free moments for her and give him treats and keep him calm and have him appear to ignore her so she has a chance to confidently leer at him lol. We know the transition can take a couple months. We are willing to take that on. However- does anybody have experience with this? Are there things you wish you had done differently or known before beginning the process? Any little bit helps as we are embarking on this. 

Thank you!

Edit: I wish to emphasize that the goal is to make Dinah as comfortable as possible and have her thrive as she did before this change. We don’t take this lightly, and respect her position in this entirely. For them to coexist and harmonize is of course the end goal, but the priority is to have her feel as safe and confident as possible as we work towards this goal. ",23May2018,3

Can't work, doesn't count as a person for all goverment-intensive purposes, but he's been living here for over a year with me.

  I've been scraping by month-to-month, paying the rent in an apartment I used to share with my Mom before she passed away two years ago. Ever since then I've been trying to play catch-up on life, getting a crash course in adult-hood, seeing as I had no job, no prospects, and no effort to do anything before life thrusted me into this situation.

I have no immediate family to reach out for help, and everywhere I try to call either gives me the run around for days before declining, or simply says no out right, I've yet to even get an application for an apartment or a viewing scheduled. 

  It's really nearing the eleventh hour as I have until next friday to find somewhere to live. I feel like I'm failing my husband, myself, and as silly as it sounds, my two small dogs. I don't know what to do, I've been winging it and scraping by as is.",23May2018,3
401,"I guess I'll make this as simple as possible. My ex and I split up after 5 years of being together. We were engaged. When I say we were soulmates and completely compatible that is an understatement. But I was on antidepressents and I wasn't taking them correctly and besides that I was an awful boyfriend towards the latter half of our relationship. So we broke up for over a year communicating hear and there sometimes positively sometimes negatively. She slept with other people tried to build relationships with other people and I did the same. But yet here we are now both completely in love with each other and back together for the time being. I guess I'm scared that she will leave me again because she was the one that made the ultimate decision when we were together, which I completely understand because I was the aggressor at that point.

I guess what I'm really wondering is can we still make this work at this point. I really don't want the same thing happening that happened last time but that's the risk I and I guess she is willing to make. Plus I have matured as a person and I realize that she is the best thing that could have ever possibly happened in my life and I'm already doing everything I possibly can to prove that to her. 

Do you guys think that we will inevitably end up hurting each other again or do you think if we both put enough effort in that we can make this work? We called each other soulmates for the entire time we were dating and now it just kinda feels a little weird because we both know that we fucked up in the past. Mostly me. I'm willing to take the extra step and do everything humanly possible to prove that to her now that she has given me the chance. 

I guess what I'm really asking is an input on what you guys think about us trying this all over again? I promise you we were wholeheartedly in love and we still are. One look in her eyes tells me that is true. But is it possible after we have been seperated for so long? I love her so much and I hold her above any other female out there but I'm afraid that I will end up disappointing her and she will leave me again.

My answer was: ""Well, I wouldn't say my last jobs didn't work out, but they were for supporting me in getting through college. Now that I've graduated, I'm prepared to *yada yada yada.*""

Our interview continued after that, and just today, I received my rejection notice which stated: ""We cannot offer you this position because we don't believe you'd be committed to the position long term. Thank you."" I should add that I've been at all of my jobs, current and past, for multiple years, so I don't know where so much doubt about my ability to commit came from.

I really am not sure how I'd answer a question like this differently. I mean, I almost feel like I wasn't qualified for the job because I *wanted* the job. It's confusing, but I definitely want to improve.

Thanks in advance! ",23May2018,1
408,"I’m studying Drama in high school and I’m finishing the last of my coursework. One thing that I’m missing from it is some information on how I used the technique “emotional memory” in the most recent play. Emotional memory means showing an emotion onstage based of past experience in an actor’s life. That doesn’t sound too bad, until I remembered what experiences I used in my play. 

My character starts off caring and selfless, but she also hides her true personality with her smiles and kind of acts somewhat “false”. I based this off my experience of hiding my true self behind a shy and timid persona that I’ve been doing for about three years, which caused some tension at my school in the past. I have little self esteem when it comes to myself so that was the best way to cover up. 

Another part is where my character lashes out at her now ex friend for something she did. She acts really angry and also really insane. I don’t get angry often, so I based this off the meltdowns I used to have as a kid  (I’m on the autistic spectrum) which looked demonic.

I don’t know if I would feel comfortable mentioning all this in my coursework, but I can’t lie about it because there’s a chance that I’ll be asked about it on the spot (and I’m a rubbish liar). I can’t tell anyone either not even my teacher as this was what caused me to not do as well in this class (I did nail this particular part of the class though). What can I do about this?",23May2018,2
410,"I need help choosing which school I should go to. I do french immersion, and I might wanna do the full french program 

I have three options. One school is 30 mins away, which might be a problem for me cause I can’t ever get up on time and get ready, but the school is amazing. It’s big and the teachers are good, the people there are nice, the school doesn’t have a bad history with students, etc. This school has the french program.

But that school has over 3000 people and I want to stand out at my school and possibly get student of excellence. With 3000 people, that’s likely not going to happen.

The second school is right across from my street. They don’t have the full french program. Kids are really stupid there and no one tries, so it’s easy to stand out. I can easily get to that school in 30 seconds/ a minute but the teachers there suck. The teachers are horrible, my brother goes there and he told me.

The last option is an average high school. They offer the full french program, there’s over 1000 kids, it’s an okay size, and it might not be as easy to stand out as it would be in the school I just talked about. It’s okay, but it’s not the best. This school is around 15 minutes away. 

I know this is long, but I need advice. 
The first school is super big, lots of kids, really nice, but has some bad things about it. 
Second school I mentioned is a bad school but easy to stand out
Third school is okay, kind of average 

If you could choose one of these schools, which one would you go to?",23May2018,1
411,"So I'm 16 years old, the prime time of my teenage years. My parents and I have never gotten along (they are my aunt and uncle due to.. some complications), even when I was a small kid. 

Almost every time I speak to them, I get in a bad mood because the stuff they say is truthful so obviously I hate it. Disclaimer: I am terrified of my parents and have wanted to get out of this house for several years. Not due to abuse, none of that, just out of sheer hatred and anger for myself for making my parents feel so stressed.

Just today, I was talking at dinner with them, and I asked if a friend could pick me up for me to go to school early tomorrow. This friend I used to date, and they weren't very fond of them or our relationship. But basically, their parents drive me and them everywhere whenever we go out because I'm scared to ask my parents to drive, and my friend is scared of my parents too - the only encounters with my parents my friend has had have been my parents barking at us to stop cuddling or whatever at my place. So them and I would be pretty uncomfortable in a car with one of my parents for even a second, let alone 15 minutes or so. Anyway, their parents love me dearly, and I seriously trust them more than my own parents. They always do the driving, which allows my parents to get upset with me because I never ask for them to drive, blah blah blah. 
My parents said this evening that I have to stop guilt tripping my friend and their parents into doing things for me. Now, I don't know what a guilt trip really is, but I do sometimes give sob stories because I can be a fake piece of sh*t sometimes. What I do know is that my friend's mother does not work at the moment, so she has some time on her hands. Her father's work hours are flexible, as he is mostly self-employed. They *always* offer to drive my friend and I places, and are super nice about it too. I have told my parents over and over that my friend's parents *really, really, really* don't mind driving (they obviously must mind but are nice about it - we don't really go out that often either), but they refuse to understand. They are insanely furious with me that I keep asking her parents to drive (I don't, my friend asks which is acceptable because they are their parents) and I always guilt trip them into doing things. Honestly, I have no idea how to get out of this.

I also find it super hard to communicate in general, which prohibits my communication with my parents - they hardly know anything about my life and frankly I'd like to keep it that way. They want to help me but I just find it so annoying, honestly, call me an a**hole. My parents do not trust me one bit, nor do I trust them. They seem to think I don't give any sh*ts about anyone but myself, and that I manipulate others constantly, that I'm a sociopath, that I need to go to a psych ward, etc. **None** of my friends like my parents, but that just may be because of my perception of them. I understand that my perception of my parents is obviously warped by my hatred for the rules and stuff. Anyway, I have at least two more years in this hellhole and I need *some* way to try to make the next two years tolerable and at least a little bit happier.

The only times I am happy are when I'm not in school or not in my house, but the boundaries and rules that my parents hold on me are seriously starting to piss me off because I can hardly get out of the goddamn house. If you have any advice or different situations I could try, thank you. If not, thank you too.",23May2018,1

415,"I’m fairly new to this subreddit, but I’ve been recently seeking advice in regards to something I’ve experienced recently. Firstly, in order to provide some context, I feel I must begin by saying that, although I consider myself an overall confident person that has an extroverted and outgoing personality around those kept close, since starting college and going through a long term relationship breakup, I’ve been struggling with social insecurities towards people I don’t know very well and the idea they might have of me, and it’s starting to affect my everyday life.
So, let’s get to the point. Last weekend there was a big party from my university and I attended it with my friends. After a few drinks too many, I guess I built up the nerve to approach one of my classmates I’ve never really talked to and we briefly hooked up, even though I rarely ever do that and have truly little to no recollection of what the exchange between us was about. Despite not having any previous feelings or attraction for her, I must admit she’s absolutely beautiful and intimidatingly smart, so, naturally, this week I was very nervous and preoccupied with a potential awkwardness emerging between the two of us (despite how fast it all went by, somehow all my friends new about it right away), and something happened to worsen my social paranoia: another classmate of mine shared a meme on the class’ message group about cleasing yourself from the sins you commited on the weekend, which is funny, because most of my classmates were at the party and also drank too much and went a little crazy. A couple other people then jokingly responded with “amen” and, a little while later, a guy that constantly hangs out with the girl I mentioned (I assume he’s her best friend) started laughing and said *they* (not specifying who) had been confessing to each other, to which she, who is very quiet and almost never texts the group, also responded with the aforementioned joke. This made it seem, in my opinion, that she regretted what happened. Do you think it necessarily implies a negative conotation? Were they talking about me? As I don’t remember what actually went through and have felt insecure with the image I project, I started to fear I’ve maybe been rude and caused a bad impression or, maybe, she doesn’t have a good idea about me. Going forward, how should I approach her? I feel I should be courteous and apologize in case I did in fact mistreat her at the party and also avoid any growing tension (I’ve always had this policy to not get involved with girls in my class, but have, lately, been feeling a little alone), but how can I find out what that was all about? Or am I just taking this too far?

I’m sorry for the lenght of this post (I usually overthink everything) and any grammar errors I might have commited (english is not my first language). Any opinion/help is highly appreciated!

**tl;dr**: I hooked up with a girl from my class I don’t really know and was too drunk to remember what happened. Later, a conversation between her and her best friend on the class’ Whatsapp group made it seem like she possibly regretted it. Am I overthinking this? If not, how should I approach her going forward?

417,"For my bachelors degree in med school I need to follow one Minor in my 3rd year. This would be next year and I just received the outcome of the lottery. I didnt get into either of ny two prefered minors and am stuck with one I am not looking forward to. The only way to get onto an other minor is a, develop a packet on my own, find someone who would say it is doable and propose that to the exame commision of healthcare. Or b find someone who changed their mind about their first choice.


Option b is not going to happen, because even if i find someone who would want to change, they would propable change with a friend.


Option A seems though as well, I followed multiple extra courses for which the medical department was never really helpful. Out of these extra courses i would already have enough study points to be seen as a minor, but they denied that request since, following courses doesn’t make a minor packet. The chances of me being able to create a minor which I would be acceptable seems to be quit small. Even if i’d manage to do that than it will still be really dificult to find a proffesor that would be willing to say that I will make it.

418,"Long story short. I keep cash in my dresser for emergencies. Well my 14 year old son and his childhood friend found $800 I had stashed. What did they do? They went to Walmart and bought $800 worth of steam cards. At $20 each. I would never lay a hand on him. His mother and I are going through a messy divorce. This was bill money. I can't even begin to understand how management at said Walmart allowed this to happen. What 14 year old comes in with $800 and buys steams cards. I attempted to take them back. They said no. I have the receipt. I have the cards. What I will not have is running water and electric this month as I am already behind.

Yes it was stupid of me to keep cash around. I am having problems with the bank as I am overdrawn as a single father with full custody. So I've destroyed my credit trying to keep the lights on. What in God's name do I do 40 $20 Steam cards? I am terrified that this will affect our household living and his junkie mother use that as a reason to get anymore custody. Any advice s appreciated. TIA.


Yes I have the receipt, yes I have the cards. I can provide any proof anyone desires. This isn't about that really. It's about the child. How do I proceed?

423,"Backstory: I was never a social kid. I was always shy, reserved, and I hardly spoke at all to any of my “friends”. Hell, I never even went to other people’s houses or to birthday parties. I had severe separation anxiety to my mom, and didn’t want to go anywhere without her. 

Now, I’m 15. That anxiety is nearly gone but I still can’t talk to people. Online I have time to think of what to say, but in person, i don’t. It’s not that I’m afraid to, or that I have an anxiety disorder, I just... can’t. I cant come up with anything to say. I’ll try to think of something but nothing ever comes to mind, and then the other person becomes bored. I have literally nothing to contribute to any conversation, unless someone asks me questions (no one ever does). I don’t know how to speak to people in just a casual conversation way, like talking about celebrities, other people, what I did over the weekend, etc. I also don’t know how to just joke around. My humour is really strange, and even when I’m laughing I still can’t think of anything to say. I just end up being like: “uhh. yeah..”

My literal inability to communicate has led me to not wanting to hang out with friends because I don’t want to have that extremely awkward silence. I’ve been struggling with this for so long and I just want to have conversations with people like everyone else does. I always listen in to try and improve my knowledge on how the hell to talk but it never helps. 

Note: I could talk more to this one girl last year, but then she said (as a joke) “oh my god, not everything is about you” and from that moment i just.. i don’t know what happened. It’s like that time where i was really good at badminton and then one day i absolutely sucked at it for no reason.

Note 2: I have EDS and so brain fog is a huge thing. I’ve also been suffering from depression (mild and severe, now it’s mild) for half my life. More than I can explain has happened to me and I’ve never had anyone to talk about it to, so it’s all just bundled up inside of me (please do not suggest a therapist, it’s too complicated to explain why). And the past years I tried to tell friends small things and they seem uninterested, so honestly I just gave up. I guess that one joke my friend made really hit home or something. Also, my sister has OCD, and so from age 9 i was programmed to carefully form my words so that I don’t trigger her. I do that with everyone now and don’t ever mention things that trigger my sister (paranormal, violence, etc).

424,"Hey everyone. I’m having a really hard time right now and I’d love to have some outside opinions to help me make a decision about my job. Sorry if formatting is weird, I’m on mobile.

I [17f] recently started my first part-time job at a coffee/restaurant chain. I was hired about two weeks ago and have worked 3 shifts as of today. I’m generally a very introverted person but I felt like I would be able to handle customer service, plus the pay is pretty decent for around my area ($10/hour). My best friend, C, works there too and was a main factor as to why I applied.

This afternoon I was approached my one of my new friends (H) who works at a local ice cream shop. They had been training a woman who decided the job wasn’t for her, and she quit unexpectedly. H asked me if I’d be interested in taking her position, and I got really excited! That place has a really awesome atmosphere and I’d be working with her most nights. However the pay is decently less ($7.50/hr).

I was planning on turning H down and sticking with my current job, but my shift today was utter chaos and now I’m not so sure. They put me on drive thru (with no prior experience on using a cash register!!) and I was completely overwhelmed. I had to physically remove myself from the situation and go out back for 10 minutes because I couldn’t stop shaking. I also had some pretty rude customers, and I messed up an order. They put way too many responsibilities on me- it was only my 2nd time on the floor!

Now I’m extremely stressed and I honestly don’t want to go back. I’d feel awful quitting so early on, especially since C is so excited to have me working with her, but that shift sent me into a full scale panic attack. I’m talking hyperventilating and crying so heavy that I couldn’t even see the road on my drive home. Plus, my coworkers are all SO nice, and I think I’d definitely be able to become good friends with them. 

I always try to see things through to the end, but the job opportunity from H isn’t going to last forever. I don’t know guys. Any advice would be super appreciated. 

TLDR: Current job makes more money and has great people but stresses me out. I only started working there 2 weeks ago. Todays shift was a nightmare, but leaving the company means I’d have to leave my best friend. Other friend says they have an open spot for me at her job, and I’d have guaranteed admission. Job pays less but is more flexible. I only have a few days to make a decision. ",23May2018,1
425,"I’m sure this kind of thing pops up all the time, but I have to ask for my situation.

So I’m 19 years old just coming back home for summer after my first year of college. My parents are both teachers and have had a strict parenting style which I have abided by religiously until I was about 16 or 17 and started to realize my parents had far different requests than mine. I understand that there is nothing wrong with that, but I can’t lie it was frustrating and it forced me to not be able to have the same relationship with my friends because I was constantly left out of things. 

Now that I am back, the rules have not changed and they are even more strict. I am now supposed to be home at 9pm on weekdays and can only take my car to and from my job, even though I payed for the car, the gas, and insist on paying for the insurance but they won’t let me. I am also required to give them all my paychecks from work in order to save up for college, which is what I would use the money for anyway honestly.

I feel that as a 19 year old kid with a good job (computer technician) I should have some more freedom than a 9pm curfew. If I am acting entitled and am delusional please feel free to let me know, I’m aware that’s a possibility. 

After asking my parents why the 9pm curfew they said it was because it is selfish of me to be out and about while they are home worried about me. I have made it a point to always let them know where I am who I’m with and what I’m doing for the past month I’ve been back, but nothing changes.

I want to live my life and I am sick of feeling like I am being left out. Again if I’m acting entitled, let me have it in the comments, maybe that’s what I need and I’m just delusional.

426,"When I was a kid I wanted to be an entrepreneur.

When I got to Uni, I remembered that I wanted to be an actor as well. I initially wanted to be an aspiring film actor in movies and TV shows and was planning towards a drama degree. The drama degree, in my opinion, wasn't going to help me get actual experience in improving my acting so I chose business.

I have no legitimate experience in acting. The pressure from my parents and the obsession with stable income lead me to choose a management degree.

I'm about to be a Junior in college this upcoming fall. I am continuing to complete a standard business management bachelor degree. At this point, I'm not enjoying finishing my business courses, even in the summers, just to end up working for someone else. I feel like that's what I'm set up to do by society, and not want I wanted to do- which is to be an entrepreneur.

The same argument can be made for me wanting to be an aspiring actor. End up acting as supporting roles, and never the main lead. I need help. I'm scared that I didn't make the right decision, but also the right one?

Should I just finish this management degree since I'm already halfway done and tough it out? Or should I pursue my dream of becoming a film and TV actor by:

A) Drop out of college, and finding acting gigs around me. Fear: Unable to find work, now out of college &amp; unemployed.

B) Continue on management degree &amp; wait until after done to pursue an acting career. Fear: End up being an employee &amp; not the boss, -too old to be an actor, and didn't achieve my goal in life.

C) Hustle &amp; do both despite having no experience in acting. Fear: Stress &amp; anxiety. If I choose C, I guess the next step would be is how?

429,"My brother (19M) has been in high school for 6 years now. Our family has been hoping this would be the year he graduates, but lately he hasn't been going to school. This is something he always does, saying he didn't feel like it or his alarm didn't go off, until he reaches his limit of 10 absences before being kicked out. This past week he stayed home every day. I asked if he even had the intention of going back to school and he said no. He's needed his grade 12 English credit for three years. He got the same teacher each year and each year he got kicked from his class for being absent. This year a kind counselor offered to give him some take home education thing that would normally cost $200, but he offered to do it for free. Even with this incredible opportunity, my brother still didn't do the work and he won't be getting his English credit this year. He was close to getting his 28th/30 and 29th/30 credit this semester but, like I said, he's stopped going to school and should be getting kicked from those classes soon. 

He's impossible to communicate with and when I ask him about what his plans are, if he even plans to finish school or if he wants to drop out and do something else, he just says he doesn't know. He just stays in his room all day or plays video games and watches videos on his computer. It's really his only interest and hobby. I'm no expert of course, but I'm pretty sure he's got an addiction. I asked if he'd ever stop playing video games because it's seriously hindering the rest of his life, and he said if he did stop he might as well stop living because it's all he cares about. 
I believe our parents are enabling this behaviour. Every time he wants a new game console or a computer, he promises to our parents that he'll start doing better in school. When he gets what he wants, nothing changes. It probably gets worse with new things to distract him or obsess over. He's a big guy with anger issues and he pretty much bullies our parents any time they try to discipline him. He doesn't get punished for his bad behaviour and they're allowing him to live rent free forever. I'm only a year older than him but they hold me responsible for his actions and I'm sick of it. If he doesn't go to school, it's because I didn't tell him to, or I didn't wake him up. If he doesn't eat his fruits and vegetables, it's because I didn't cut any up for him. If it isn't my mom, I always have to cook his meals and be his third parent. If my mom even says ""forget about me cooking for you from now on,"" all my brother has to say is ""I'm hungry,"" and she'll come asking ""what do you want to eat"" 

I have zero control over what my brother does so I'm not sure how I can help him. Talking doesn't leave any impact. I feel like my mom needs to do something, but she's more of his caretaker than a mother. I think we need to find a way to make a change in him but I'm not sure what we can do. I thought about taking away his video games, but it's not my property. If my parents paid for them, can they take them? I'm not sure if that would even help, or if he'd just find other ways to avoid life.

I also believe he could have anxiety and depression, but when I tried to confront our parents about what could be anxiety and depression in myself my dad laughed and my mom told me I'm looking for attention so I'm not sure what we can do about treating him psychologically.

I also considered what options he could have if he never graduates. I feel like all employers are looking for at least a high school diploma, but other than that there's literally nothing my brother could put on a resume. No driver's license, no skills/talents, no extra curricular activities, no volunteer hours, something as basic as ""hard working"" and ""punctual"" would be complete lies. My dad is a welder and my brother planned to take an apprenticeship with him, but my dad always said my brother at least needed his high school diploma.

Sorry for this huge ramble, I'm just trying to provide as much insight as I can. I just want to take the stress off our mom, and even though I believe he isn't my responsibility, his well being puts stress on me too.",23May2018,2
