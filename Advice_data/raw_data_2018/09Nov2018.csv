0,"This is going to be really long, but this is something I've never really expressed so I apologize for the length.

I'm in ninth grade. I recently moved provinces and schools. I really miss the city I used to live in, because for the last year I was there, I went to a school that for the first time, I actually loved. I had two amazing friends that were always there for me. So leaving all of that was very hard. But I managed to not cry when hugging them goodbye because part of me was excited. And that's because the province I was moving to was where my childhood best friend had moved to 5 years earlier. We were planning to go to the school she was attending and I was so excited. I haven't had the best history with schools (bullies, fights, etc.) And as much as I'd like to say I don't take what people say to heart, that's just not true. As I progressed through schools, my confidence slowly drained away more and more. People were racist, mean, bitchy, and foul. I was very bubbly, and care-free before I attended these schools. And I'm really kind, so I usually take any shit that people give me, then let it out in the safety of my home. But losing my confidence makes going out in public hard. My shoulders tense up, and my back starts killing me after walking around for only a couple of minutes. I don't go out in public even if I have to or want to, because of how painful it, and if I do, it's not fun at all. Being tense also makes me awkward, so talking to people is dreadful. I feel very anxious about saying the wrong thing (which I do in most cases.) I developed anxiety, and was getting therapy. I found it too difficult to open up, and that was giving me more stress than keeping it all in - so we stopped the therapy after a month.

When we moved, I couldn't go to my best friend's school because my parents couldn't afford it. I developed depression shortly after. I feel lame for getting my hopes up all the time, even though in the end it never works out. It got to the point where I couldn't get out of bed, so after summer I didn't go to school for a whole month. Once I got out of that funk, I started fresh at a new private school (not the one I was looking forward to.) I'm very shy, and awkward so making friends is very hard. I told myself not to worry because even if I couldn't make friends, I could FaceTime my friends from my old school anytime, and I can visit my best friend whenever as well. But I moved away four months ago, and after about three months, my two old friends completely forgot about me. Stopped tagging me in photos, ignored my texts in our old group chat. My anxiety grew, but I still had my best friend. But the more and more I visited her, the more I realised we really didn't click anymore. She comes from a rich family, and her mom really doesn't like me, so I feel like that unfortunately got to her. Now whenever we hang out, it consists of her bringing me down, and me trying to bring her up. So, I don't know about that. Now I'm really trying to branch out at my school because I have no hope otherwise. But It's so fucking hard. I don't know how to be friends with most of the popular kids, because they're too intense for me. The girls gossip, and bitch about their problems, while the guys say disgusting things about girls, and make rape jokes. So I don't know where to go from here. Why don't I click with anyone? I feel like I've been waiting for them to mature, but this is highschool...If they haven't matured by now, when will they?

Words cannot describe how lonely I feel. I want friends more than anything, but I don't want to bring down my IQ to get them. What do I do? Every time I walk to school in the morning, the closer I get, the faster my heart starts racing. By the time I reach my locker I can't breathe. How much longer can I go on like this before I die? This isn't healthy, and I know that but I can't change it. ",09Nov2018,1
1,"Hello, all. I have a distant cousin who I assume has mental illness. Or she’s just completely stupid. We love her to death. Her mother had issues as well, but we never received a diagnosis. To make the story short, I am 20. She’s the niece of my great grandmother who is now 83. My cousin who we will call Alice, took care of her father (great grandmothers brother) and basically treated him horrible until he died. (I’m talking put garlic in his eyes because she thought it would help his vision). My great grandmother continues to enable Alice by giving her money and letting her do senseless things. Like sell her completely paid for house that her father left her, only to move into an apartment. Now 3 years on and she has cats in the apartment that she won’t clean up after, bugs everywhere, unbearable smell. Oh and she never bathes. Of course, the landlord has tried to work with her on the cats but to no avail. She won’t clean up after them, so now she’s having to move. (She’s now saying her neighbor raped her, and the landlord is breaking into her apartment and that’s the reason she’s moving. Which is obviously a lie). After the rape accusation I immediately told her go to the hospital for a rape kit test. Never did. “Raped” again and same story. Now her rent is up and she has moved into a shed on a piece of property she purchased for 10k. The property was let go by my family because the taxes were more than it was worth. I’m mentioning all of this just so you can get an idea of where her mind is at. 
Now, there is an really old outhouse (I’m talking 70+ years) that she has decided to move into WITH her cats. Yes an outhouse, the small ones. She has tarps set up around it. No light, no electricity and no heat. We tried to reason with her on this but obviously it didn’t work. So my question is what do we do now? We are in Georgia, USA if that helps at all. Of course I don’t want her to stay in the outhouse and be miserable but she doesn’t see it any other way. She has to be with her cats. Any advice helps ",09Nov2018,1
2,"So
There‘s this girl I‘ve been in love with, but we couldn’t be together because of her family.. a few months later she contacts me with a new number, we talk for a while, but I stopped talking to her. Then a few months later I’ve talked to her again and we talked a lot and met. But I just told her how I felt about the contact termination, her family, etc and stopped the contact. But today I‘ve seen her acc on some social media and saw some things changed also she answered a lot of questions about her ex, I got really jealous now and just wrote her „new life huh?“ and yeah it kinda pisses me off to wait until tomorrow for an answer and also because I wasn’t even interested in her anymore for almost a year...  irrational and dumb af..

3,"I was in a rush trying to find an outfit for this event I have to attend tomorrow. I went to F21 bought nothing, H&amp;M bought some stuff then I went to Charlotte Russe.  There, a worker helped me find a dress. So I went to go try on the dress but it was too big on me. I left it in the fitting room and walked out but as soon as I walked out I saw a bunch of security guys in front of the fitting rooms so I went back into my fitting room to get the dress and put it on the “I don’t want this hanger”. As I did that one of the workers asked me “are you girls going to pay for your clothes?” I replied “ well I don’t want this”. I didn’t know why she said “girls” I was there alone. 

So as I was walking out a group of high school girls went first so I was behind them. A security guard followed me, stopped all of us, and said that we all needed to leave the mall for the day. I asked him why me. He said an incident happened in Charlotte Russe involving us. I told him i didn’t know these girls and that he can search my bag but he didn’t care. He said we have to leave. 

I believe it’s pretty noticeable that I’m not with them. Sure I’m pretty short, I’m young, and I am wearing a backpack but I’m wearing my scrubs, I have a stethoscope around my neck. Those girls were dressed like a stereotypical high schooler. I wasn’t communicating with them at all. I was minding my own business. 

I was so embarrassed. I don’t even want to go back to that mall because I was targeted. They all thought I stole something. 

What should I do? Would you go back? ",09Nov2018,1

5,"Last night when I was at work my schizophrenic neighbour had an episode and smashed my front window. He has been arrested and I’ve spoken to the police who told me to contact my real estate. 

I’ve since contacted them and they said that it won’t get fixed today as it needs to be fitted. I feel it’s unsafe to leave it as my neighbourhood isn’t the greatest and I work night shifts and live by myself. 

I have told my landlord how important it is that it’s fixed today and she said she understands how urgent it is bu she needs to ‘follow protocol’. 

Is there anything that can be done? My neighbour offered to fit it himself and get reimbursed, would this be a possibility? Or can I contact a glass fitter myself and they can somehow get payment via my real estate?

10,"Hey Reddit, I need some life advice, and I don't really know who to ask so I thought this would be a good place to start. For some background info which might help out, I'm 18, in the first-year university, pretty fit, average intelligence, have a girlfriend, family who I'm not super close with besides my dad, not super popular, that's about it I'm not extraordinary in many ways.  
 I just started my first year of university and I feel super lost. I feel like the major I want to go into isn't going to get me anywhere, I live in Canada where you don't declare a major until your second year (no idea if that's how it works everywhere else but just in case it doesn't), and I want major in English and hopefully law school even though I won't have the marks to get into it. On top of that, I feel like as useless as it is, I'm also not proud of what I'm doing, I wanted to go into science so badly. I loved chemistry and biology in high school and grade 11 but I was so bad at it despite how hard I worked and studied it just never clicked in with me and I had to abandon that to have a hope of getting the grades I needed for university.   
My relationship isn't where it once was (even though its not bad, I trust my girlfriend and there's no complaints, its just not where it used to be where we always had fun and laughed constantly) and we seem to constantly have petty arguments, not even in an angry way we just disagree over small stupid things that shouldn't affect the way two people who like each other should and it puts a tonne of stress on the two of us which I'm scared will lead to us splitting up.   
I haven't made as many friends at university as I hoped and I often feel super lonely and cooped up in my rooms or at the gym on Friday or Saturday nights and watch snap stories of other people seemingly having the times of their lives. I want to go out and have fun but I just can't seem to do that without being so drunk I pass out, or so high I don't know where I am.   
I haven't talked to anyone in my family in a meaningful way for months except for my father, who I know wants me to be happy but I can't bring myself to tell him how sad I feel on a day to day basis. I'm not saying nor do I think I'm depressed or have something wrong with me, but I just feel like my life is slowly creeping downhill and I don't know how to stop that or turn it around in a positive way.  
So tell me, am I overreacting? Is this just some form of anxiety that I'm getting from growing up and being on my own for the first time, or do you think I've genuinely fucked up somewhere by not trying harder at what iI actually wanted to go into? Have any of you had a relationship that was flawless for months and all of the sudden you feel like your partner has lost feelings for you and it's just slowly spiraling down? I want to see if I can somehow get the credits in my spare time and reapply to a science undergrad degree at some point, but is it too late now?",09Nov2018,1
11,"I’m a 20 year old college student who’s pretty healthy. I’m in good shape, play sports, lift all the time. When I was young I had a heart murmur, it ended up being nothing, but I recently had to go back for a check up and my blood pressure was a little high (as it’s been basically my entire life). I think it’s because I get nervous when I need to be at the doctors (so a few years back my doctor had me constantly check it at home and it was fine for the most part), but my heart doctor wants me to do it again to make sure it’s okay. I checked it before dinner and it was good, and then after dinner it was high again. I don’t know why, but as im getting older things like a heart attack and stuff seems so real to me and worrisome.

12,"I (26F) graduated over the summer with my Bachelor’s in Biology and Chemistry. My original goal was to apply to medical school, but due to a family emergency last year I’ve taken a large step back from that. 

For now, I’d like to get into teaching science. I’m not sure how the best way to do this is. I did pretty well in school, have research experience, volunteer experience etc. but most everything was geared toward med school stuff... even my letters of recommendations.

Should I take the GRE and apply for a master’s in education? Or should I apply for a second bachelor’s in education? I assume they would take about the same length of time since my pre-reqs are done.

My greatest reservation about pursuing a master’s is that I worry I won’t get in since my undergrad was heavily focused in an entirely different direction. If I do apply for the master’s program, do I need to ask my professors if they would rewrite my letters or can I use the ones they wrote for medical school (I don’t know what the letters say, since you send them blind. However, I imagine they likely indicate my intentions were for a different graduate program). 

Also, I moved states due to my family emergency and now I have weird nerves about applying to my new state school over my old school. That’s not really relevant here, I’m just oversharing. ",09Nov2018,1
13,"I'm a 25 Y/O male who works a shitty minimum wage job in the healthcare industry.  I've failed out of community college like 5 times now, and my academic record is absolutely awful.  I have like 18 credits out of like 100 attempted.  I hate my job, I hate my life, and I hate myself.  I can't keep up with this anymore.  I am barely making enough money to survive with nothing left over.

My only friend is my roommate.  I have other friends, but they live in my hometown on the other side of the country.  I've never had a girlfriend.  I'm a virgin.  Never even been on a date.  I'm so lonely it physically hurts.  I am in constant pain and despair from the depression.  I am seeing a therapist and taking prozac, but it's doing absolutely nothing.  I assume it's because I don't have a chemical imbalance that makes me depressed, but rather that being depressed is a perfectly reasonable response to my shitty, boring, empty life.

Anyway, I see no way out of this.  I have no money.  I'm never going to graduate from college at the rate I'm going.

I don't think any program would accept me though with my grades.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do, or why I'm even bothering.  I don't enjoy life to begin with, so it's difficult to justify working towards anything.  I always end up quitting things and giving up when they get too hard.  It's like why force myself to go to schools I hate to work jobs I hate just to stay alive and be miserable until I die?

14,"It’s not quite been a year, but almost. My dad has a lot of problems, he drinks a lot which makes them worse and refuses to get help for his drinking or just in general. Last December, I was home alone with him and he had a breakdown and started breaking things and getting really angry, threw everything in the living room from mugs to paperwork, to cushions, all out in the rain. He got in this state because he tripped over something and got really mad that the house wasn’t ‘clean’. In the midst of doing this, a bag full of the stuff he was throwing split and everything went onto the floor and he shouted and stormed out. A few minutes later he came back into the room and started telling me to look after my sister, (who was 8 months pregnant) and to look after my family. I’m the youngest child of three. I asked questions and he broke down saying he was leaving the house tonight and was going to end his life. I asked why and he said because I thought he was a horrible person and because in previous arguments I had called him some names. The arguments we had were about him stalking a seriously ill woman, whilst he is also still married to my mum. He also said he has done some ‘very bad things’ and if we found out, we would hate him. I told him I don’t think bad of him, that we all love him and need/want him around, his first grandson would be born in less than a month and that we can help him, but he wouldn’t listen. I text my family discreetly to tell them to come home asap with the general idea of what was happening. My family came home and I went to the bathroom and then I heard the front door close. I ran downstairs and my family said when they started talking to him he just got up and left. I ran outside to see where he was but couldn’t see him, I was still crying my eyes out, telling my family we need to look for him, I called an ambulance and my mum and brother-in-law went out to find him whilst my sister kept me in the house. My brother-in-law found him, and my mum got him back into the house, my mum wouldn’t talk to me and when she eventually did she was really mad that I had called an ambulance. She didn’t really understand what had happened and didn’t ask. My mum told me to leave them alone and I went upstairs. Since then, no one in my family mentions that night, me and my mum still haven’t spoken about it, I told my partner and over time a few close friends but everyone tries to avoid it, or just talks about their own problems. He still keeps saying things to me, about how he’s going to do it, or how he’s done some really bad things, or how when I move out to go to university he’s going to start drinking more (he already drinks a lot) and make himself really ill. I’m really struggling to cope with it and every time I try to talk about it I just get ignored. He doesn’t say anything to anyone else in the family as apparently I’m the ‘only one he can talk to’. The stuff he says though, I don’t want to hear, but I can’t say that because he might actually attempt to do something. I don’t know what to do. Sorry it’s such a long read.

16,"A little back story: my mom and dad moved to Canada when i was three and went through a nasty divorce when i was five. She remarried my stepfather a couple of years later, and at the time he was a good man. 

 Now, her has not worked for over 3 years, trying to ""build"" his company. Unfortunately, over the course of these years he has literally nothing to show for it; no income, no strong business model, no contact with possible financial backers, absolutely nothing. We are struggling financially now, especially with me about to go to university and my sister just starting her education. Every month, our expenses far outshoot my mom's  (only earner for the family now) wages. She needs to ask her family in China for money often, which destroys her, since she came to Canada for more money, not less. Just this year, I found out that he was stealing my and my sister's money (we kept everything as cash) to a total of more than $400, which forced us to move our money into a bank. Further, he broke my MacBook (a gift from my uncle, mom's brother) and refused to admit to it, even though it was undeniably his fault. 

He has recently been looking for a job, but he never really tried and would get frustrated whenever my mom would ask about his current situation.  He also has forced her to pay for their wedding this year, in the worst possible year financially. She limited the budget to 5,000 CDN but he keeps pushing her to spend more. I am a mere year away from university, she wants to pay for it but i don't want to burden her and am planning to take out an OSAP loan. We don't have enough money to cover our expenses anymore, and she has to ask for money every other month now. The money issues have done more damage, though. They have started arguing for every little thing now, and i think he's cheating on her again (he has been caught 4 years before, after marriage) because he sometimes leaves for a couple of hours in his best clothes, doesn't pick up the phone, and is very vague about what he did.

I don't want my sister to experience the pain of a divorce, especially since both my parents are over 40, not the way i did. I want my sister to have a full family, something i never had when i was young.

I moved to Los Angeles 7 months ago with my boyfriend of a year and a half. We are now 2 years together, and it has been rough adjusting - I haven't had anyone else but him here, his job is very demanding, and I have been struggling with anxiety that has pushed him away. We've had the ""maybe we should break up talk,"" but never do because we want to work on things. They HAVE gotten better, much better, but...

I work in a hectic field also. As many of you know, the midterm elections in the U.S. were a few days ago. I work on political campaigns - therefore, at this time of year, I am unemployed and it is STRESSFUL. I was too anxious yesterday when he got home, and he said he's thinking of breaking up again because he's ""sometimes unhappy"".

Ultimately, he says he wants to stay, because he loves me and things are better. But he also says that he feels like something bad is going to happen. So naturally, my anxiety is sky-high.

Thing is, I gotta start looking for my next job. I like LA a lot - but it is really really expensive, polluted, and crowded. I have spent a fortune out here getting settled with him, and I do not have that much interest in being here as a single woman - it's incredibly expensive, not that safe, and the job prospects are not stellar. BUT THEN I don't even know if I like my fucking job field!!!!!! I just am so unhappy with the craziness of politics, and the job prospects are very localized to D.C., and I don't want to move back East... but I am so scared, because I don't know if my relationship is ended.

I got evicted, had to buy a new place to live, got some roommates but the whole thing fucked me financially
Our dog is essentially an emotional support animal (not officially, shes just very important), but in order to keep her in the apartment she needed boarded training, so we did that, more money.
Now its the beginning of the month, we have to pay for car insurance, payments, and misc bills.
We got our rent in order in our new place, but the old person we lived with sprung that we had to pay him too since we moved out technically during the start of October. Thought it would be okay, so we did.
Now my next entire paycheck is going to getting my dog out of training and my half of bills. And his entire paycheck is already a negative in his account (I have 3 dollars currently, hes at -570) on top of his car payment/insurance and his half of bills.
Dog is 475
Misc bills are 350
Car payment is 570
+570 negative on his account
I have ramen for food, and we can walk to work.
But this stuff comes out on Monday, so we are pretty fucking in the hole rn

First, I was emailed that I had detention tomorrow, yet I don’t even know the reason for this. I had not been “written up”. What should I do? 

Second, my boyfriend(17) was recently written up for being inappropriate in advisory. The teacher wrote that he was touchy and was also making out with me, but this was completely untrue. There were several students around us and they clearly saw that we hadn’t done anything. The only thing my boyfriend did was wrap his arms around me for a moment before he was written up. What can I do about this?

I’m still a virgin but by no means am I not capable of landing at least an 8. (I work out everyday, and have been called very attractive by girls) We’re in the same group for this project we’re working on and I thought this was where I’d make my move but the only problem is that I feel like she’s really shy and sorta unapproachable. Why? Well she always got her headphones in on her phone,  doesn’t talk to anyone in the class, and never participated in this class and honestly all we do in the class is discuss politics. I want to initiate but don’t wanna look like a complete fool or even worse be completely shunned. I don’t know if I’m the one being awkward but honestly it’s always been like this to me with girls that it takes me a while to approach because I fear rejection or running out of things to say. Last year I had a good thing going with this one girl who was beautiful and was clearly into me according to many of my friends, but I failed to seal the deal. She went away for some college that’s 4 hours away from me but I think about her all the time like we should’ve been together. I only added this as some backstory about my dating experience and my dating life is absolute shit. I wanna change it so bad and feel like College will change it for me but my awkwardness is stopping me from approaching girls that I lock eyes with. Sometimes I just abandon the whole idea and just tell myself that a girl that I fall in love with will just come down the line as I live my life, all I’m really caring about hard right now is my career going into the police (here in NY you have to go to college for 3 years to become a cop) and physical excellence (Reaching the perfect body that I want) and I know many people share the same goals as me and still manage to get girls, but I’m just so fucking lonely sometimes when I’m in my room and just wish that I was with someone I love just hanging out. I think about girls all day, and sex but I’m not really into hookup culture. Sex sounds amazing, but what I really wish for is a relationship. Someone who I can be proud of dating, go on dates with, chill, and make love. I know I’m too young to stress over things like this but just sometimes thoughts come into my head that I might die alone if I don’t make the right moves now and stop being such a shy motherfucker.

33,"Greets folks, first time poster, long time lurker lol.

I have a friend that I met through a mutual close friend of ours.  Better than acquaintances but never became ""close"" friends because adult life (early 30s) has been very busy for both of us and he does a fair bit of travelling overseas.  Financially were both stable, but I would also say he has considerable more success in that department.

Throughout the years we always spoke of getting a band together, both of us having some inclination for music. I had played guitar in high school and he has played a vast number of instruments as his father was a classical musician.  We would go to his house where he had a small session room and kind of jam/goof around.  I spoke often about a desire to learn drums and keys.

During a longer stint overseas he met his wife and ended up selling off his instruments and house when they moved back to get a new place.  He slowly picked up instruments again and kind of dropped the idea of getting a drum set so we'd have a full set to jam again.

About a year ago he started messaging me frequently about getting the drums and teaching me, and I was all for it.  Then one day he tells me he's in the area where I work and if I can meet up with him to go the guitar center with him to help him decide on a set of drums and I oblige.  We spend several hours testing kits and talking with employees about deals and haggling.  We end up really liking an e-drum set (alesis crimson II, if curious) and he manages to haggle a great deal off the cost for the whole 9, double pedals, throne, amp, warranty, etc.  It is still close to 2 grand, though.

We get rung up and tells me to pull my car around.  I figure it's because I have a larger hatchback so we can fit everything.  Load up, and he tells me he's gonna head home to have dinner with his wife and if I'll be okay setting it up at my place.  I'm astonished, but I end up going with the flow and now have the drums set up at my place.

Since then, I've always told him if he ever wants the drums back or if he wants to come play he is always welcome.  It is HIS set after all.  He brings his guitar and we practice and jam when we can, but because adulting is hard we sometimes go a couple months without even a  word.

Now he is planning to move back overseas with his wife after she finishes school in a few months, and he would be quitting his job to start his own indie game development, so he will be cutting off phone to save money and concentrate on getting that off the ground.

I had a vague idea of these plans, but since he is cutting off his phone, he sent me a couple messages today, and I'm not sure how to respond :

""Hey man I'm turning my phone off in about a month to save money so I can focus on my business so I figured this would be a good time to ask about the drum set. Do you think you would want to keep it?

If you like playing and you think you will put it to good use then I'm cool with you keeping it, otherwise you can drop it off any time. Totally up to you

Even if you do drop it off we can still Jam for a few months but I'll be moving out of the city for good after that""

Truth is, I really love playing.  This is probably the most generous offer anyone has ever given me outside of my immediate family putting a roof over my head lol.  It doesn't seem like he is asking for anything in return, but I also feel like I should either give him some sort of reimbursement/gesture or give it back.  I am receiving a small bonus from my work in the form of a prepaid credit card which I was going to use on Christmas shopping, but it would probably only cover about a quarter of his cost in it, and it will also mean my spending for Christmas will need to be dialed back some.

Not really sure how to approach this.  I'd like to hear what you guys think, and I will try to stay active and answer questions.

tl;dr - a friend essentially bought an expensive(to me) drum set, and given me the choice to keep it or give it back.",09Nov2018,1
34,"Hi, using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I hope you won't judge me because what I'm about to write is pretty messed up. Also, this is pretty long so TLDR at bottom.

I'm in a happy relationship with someone I've known for a very long time, let's call him A. We used to date years ago, broke up, and recently got back together. The reason we broke up is because we were young, and since we always talked about marriage and I felt that we would end up together, I didn't want to regret not knowing anything else in the future. 

During the time that I was single, I dated several guys but nothing that I would consider a real relationship. The first guy that I started talking to after the breakup, we'll call him B. To give a little background, in my life I've never had trouble with ""love"" per se. All the boys I've ever had a crush on liked me back, and I had always been the one to move on so I've never been broken up with or anything. Now when I started talking to B, this was the first time I had been single in like 3 years. In addition to me being newly single, he was someone I was a little intimidated by, which is something I had never felt for a guy. I was always so nervous around him and I acted so differently from who I truly am, which I regret.

I like to take things slow, so when B asked me for a kiss the second time we hung out I said no. I was still thinking about A in the back of my mind and I didn't feel that I was ready. Yet, I still wanted to get to know him and had a weird crush on him. After that hangout we gradually stopped talking. Several months go by and my friends were still pushing me to talk to B - they said I rejected him so I have to make the move. That night, after not seeing each other or talking to each other for months, we ended up having sex. Afterwards I was still all up in my head thinking about how I didn't do my best. Eventually, we stopped talking after about a week, which sucked because I didn't want us to end up as a one night stand.

Although it took me a while to get over it then, I went on to date other guys and I fell back in love with A and forgot about B. However, now two years later, I have been thinking back to B for some reason. I think it's because I feel like that's the one guy that I wasn't able to ""get my way"" with and since it's not something I'm used to, I'm still stuck on it. I started having dreams about me and B and I felt terrible. The relationship with A is so great, and I absolutely have nothing to complain about. I truly do love him, but a part of me still fantasizes about meeting B and having closure. 

The most fucked up thing is, I don't even want a relationship out of B. I just want to have sex with him and do better. I'm pretty kinky and I love sex. Yet with B, I wasn't truly comfortable because he was the first guy I had sex with after a 3 year relationship and before him I only had sex with people I was in a relationship with, so it was a new territory for me. I feel like if I could be my true self, and have sex at my comfortable state, he would be interested in me and I would be happy about that lol. I guess it's fucked up but I want us to end knowing he was interested in me, and that it wasn't just me. 

We haven't talked for like two years, and we don't live in the same area anymore. So obviously the chances of us running into each other is very slim, but how can I get over this? It's not something that's constantly on my mind but it is something that I think about pretty frequently. 

TLDR; In a relationship with guy ""A"", but I keep thinking back to another guy ""B"", that ended in a one night stand. I was nervous with B and I didn't act like myself when we hung out or when we had sex. This is the first time things didn't go the way I wanted with a guy, so it's hard for me to let go.

About two weeks ago, I found out through ancestryDNA that my father is not my biological father. My mom cheated on my dad. Nobody knew. My biological dad “knew” I was his kid, but never had confirmation. He didn’t barge into my life because he didn’t think it was right. I do believe that my mom knew deep down though. I’m doing okay adjusting to this, the fact that my mom is the way she is really softened the blow. I will be going to therapy soon though. 

Before all this happened, we had plans (me, her, siblings, and cousins) to all go to Universal studios. Only my mom, her boyfriend, my dad, and sister know about the biological dad. I don’t think it’s the right time to tell everyone yet. I’m really contemplating on whether or not I should go to this event. I’m not one for hiding things and I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to act normal. I’m becoming emotionally distraught and I really need some outside opinions. I don’t want to bail on the rest of my family but I also don’t want to be around them because I feel like I’m lying. My brothers fiancé is gonna be there and we are really close, but I haven’t told her yet because I don’t think it’s fair for her to keep it from my brother.

64,"Hello Reddit so first a little about me. I am either very low on self confidence on extremely anxious or both. I feel like everything I do has no purpose, nobody cares. I like helping people but I feel like they never appreciate it. No one ever asks me how I’m doing (or actually cares) even though I ask them a do care. Everything I do I regret the instant I do it just like I probably will when I post this. I have no close friends, they are all like acquaintances and I do not think I’ll get far in life at all. I don’t have anything going for me. I’m not smart, or pretty, or artistic, or good at socializing, or good at anything pretty much.

After years of feeling like this I finally decided to try to do something about it and called my university’s mental health center but they told me I would have to wait months for me to be seen. That really discouraged me from doing anything since my insurance will soon run out and won’t be able to pay for a private therapist.

I really don’t want to be alive but I get too anxious when I think about killing myself because I care too much about what others might think of me or the people that I know. I can’t even keep a romantic relationship I think I’n just bot capable of love. I’ve numbed my emotions for so long that I don’t think I can love anymore. Just waking up everyday makes me anxious. Sorry if this was too long but I don’t know what to do. I need to get help but I don’t have the money for it and thinking about talking about how I feel to someone who knows who I am is a big no no for me.

67,"I'm a frequent visitor to r/letsnotmeet, so when my mom came home today with a note that was left on her car's windshield, i was a little freaked out.

my mom works in an indoor mall that's fairly large. as she came out of work today she saw a note under her windshield wiper and called my brother and read it to him. 

""Hello, I saw you driving today and I think you are so beautiful. I see that you work in the mall and so do I. I would love to get together with you. Here is my # text me [phone number] [name]""

The mall has a very large parking garage, spanning at least four buildings, so the fact the man was so easily able to locate and recognize my mom's car creeps me out. we contacted the police and the officer we spoke to suggested that he was more of an 'admirer' than a stalker as a stalker wouldn't leave their name or their phone number on a note, and that it was 'a shame that a man couldn't leave a note on a car in this climate.' 

i know mall security can help escort her out of the building but i'm just worried that she's in this weird predicament with a faceless 'admirer' who knows where she works and what car she drives. this could be just a weird incident that won't elevate itself but you can't be too careful and i'm nervous about it.

Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism?
can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls?
what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls

I'm a male in my mid 20s and haven't had a serious relationship since high school. At this point it seems routine that I get attached to a girl quickly (within a couple months) get very close to them where we can tell eachother very personal things, but never evolves beyond that. Now I would say I'm average to above average looking, like to dress well, can be funny, cute, romantic, and playfully mean once I'm comfortable with a person. It seems like I get my heart broken so often with girls (very objectively speaking) that are just normal. Currently I can't stop thinking about a girl I find amazing, I see all the wonderful qualities about her she doesn't realize like how much of hard worker, how delightful smart, and quietly beautiful she is. I announce my feelings to these girls and am always given cryptic replies, knowing they will say anything to just to keep me around. Deep down I know my feelings aren't reciprocated with my current interest, I may be the most positive thing in her life right now but I'm not meant to be hers. I don't know what to do to improve my situation whether it's my sex appeal, demeanor (I view myself rather confident and am told I have a very out going personality), or simply reducing my expectations which would be hard for me. It's very difficult for me to just wait for love when I have such intense emotions. Every time I'm hurt I try to learn a lesson where I went wrong and feel like I've grown a lot as a person through all my ""pain"".

So, I currently have a graphic CV which is applicable for the type of roles I am applying for (it matches my brand's colour scheme, has drawings that I've done that are relevant to make it look nice, displays my photoshop skills, etc.) which is 1 page long. I like to include a plain text version just in case they use any software that scans CVs - this is 1 and a half pages long. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to include a cover letter with appropriate branding. Within my field I want to ensure things look good and that I am demonstrating my design skills. With the branding, my cover letter is just over one page long. 

&amp;#x200B;

In total, I add all this into a singular PDF file and it contains 5 pages (although not all are full of text).

I'm concerned this is way to long but saw that a cover page should be around one page, check, and a resume should be of similar length, check, my only additional page is my graphic CV.

We have recently purchased our family home and when we first moved in I excitedly told my family and my partners family that I would love to host Christmas this year because we finally have the space and the nice deck and back yard etc.
I’ve been excited for a couple of months now because usually on Christmas Day we have to travel to two events (my partners and mine) and this year, because I’m inviting everyone, we can have a big joint party. 

Now for the advice - about two weeks ago my MIL revealed that *she* wants to do Christmas for their side “while she still can”. (Don’t worry she’s not dying just a little dramatic). Which throws a spanner in my plans because hosting my family and *also* having to travel across town to their Christmas is gonna be far to much. 

I have this anxiety pit in my stomach that I’m gonna get an angry phone call from my BIL soon because I’m still holding my ground about hosting Christmas. 

Another factor which is hard to explain is that my partners parents are much more well off than mine and give us money for Christmas, I’m worried if I don’t attend their Christmas or insist on hosting mine that it’ll come off as ungrateful (which I’m not, of course I’m grateful). I just really was looking forward to hosting at my new home this year.

89,"Hi, people of reddit! I need a bit of advice! I'm in a bit of a pickle! And kind of annoyed because I accidentally deleted my whole post and have to retype...so here we go! Created a throwaway because my family knows my reddit username.

Some background. I'm an above average high school freshman in an affluent school. I'm in a few honors classes, and have a good heart. I don't want to hurt anyone and I mean well. I'm a bit of an eccentric extrovert, but not in a rude or disruptive way. I am eager to learn, love to read and write, and if you tell me I'm annoying you or being loud, I'll stop. I've been told by adults that I'm a lot more mature than other kids my age. I got made fun of a lot in middle school. I go to a high school, public school, where we go to pick which school to go to. I picked the one where only 4-5 kids from my middle school went. I'm still making friends and trying to fit in, so it's a challenge, but I try to have a positive attitude. So here is my issue.

In the first week of the school year, early September, I get called to guidance. I never met my guidance counselor before so I figured she maybe wanted to meet new students or that I had a scheduling issue. Well, she tells me that someone reported a ""complaint and clash with my personality"". When I asked what that meant, she didn't give too many details except told me to be ""aware"". Well, that didn't help. As eccentric as I am, I often struggle with finding my voice and speaking up. So I didn't say anything, but thought, ""Dang, I haven't even been at school a full week yet and someone already has an issue with me?"" I was mindful, but still confused.

Middle of October, the guidance counselor comes to find me in the cafeteria during lunch and tells me to come with her. Once we get to the guidance office, I see another guidance counselor and this kid in a few of my honors classes, who I knew from middle school---Nick. It turned out, HE was the once who initially reported me! He claimed I was bothering him, annoying him, etc. I honestly had no clue what he was talking about, and again, was unable to find my voice. Until now, he seemed like a decent guy. Smart, relatively nice, but so smart, a little off socially (but nothing like Autism or anything like that). I was unable to find my voice and was told to give him space. I barely talk to him! Maybe the occasional ""hi"" on the bus in the morning or in the halls, and he's always been quite pleasant to me. He's in 2 of my honors classes, and we may talk or be grouped together for an assignment, but never did he once tell me to go away, leave him alone, or that I was bothering him. I left, feeling worried and upset, but blamed myself.

Flash forward to today. I get called out of science class to go to the vice principal's office. I assume it was about a few kids in my math class acting up and them needing a witness. NOPE. In the VP's office, there's the VP and both guidance counselors. Nick reported me AGAIN for ""bugging him""! Never once did he tell me to go away, that I was bothering him, etc, etc. He's always been pleasant. The VP asked me if I liked him as more than a friend. I told her the truth, that in 6th grade, I did for about 2 months. But I was 11 then. I'm 14, almost 15 now! She got mad, and said ""she doesn't want to be changing my classes and calling home"" and she knows I ""try to fit in"". I couldn't find my voice and tell her that I honestly am not bothering him---or at least he never said anything! They sent me back to class crying. I haven't cried in school since kindergarten and was never sent to the office before either. I go back to class and my science teacher sent me to the bathroom to calm down, and during passing period, she pulled me aside and asked what's wrong. I gave her a run down and she was surprised. She said I don't seem like the type to hurt anyone and if I need help or backup, she's there.

Honestly, what do I do? I'm afraid to tell my dad because he won't believe me. He knows I'm eccentric and tells me I put a lot of things upon myself :( but honestly, I can swear, I am NOT bothering this guy! I'm afraid Nick will get me in more trouble, and I feel like I messed up for not using my voice. I haven't gotten any concrete examples exactly of what I am doing to bother him. I'm so embarrassed and have been sad all day. I never got called to the office before!

And from an educational perspective, if any of you know, was this handled correctly? I somehow think not, but I don't know.

96,"This is going to be a long one. I'm sorry. I'm an 18 year old guy. I've been suicidal for the past year for multiple reasons (suicidal thoughts aren't what I'm asking for advice about) and ever since it started, I've been unsure of what to do with my life, career wise. I've had clinical major depressive disorder since I was in middle school, but it was a gradual increase in intensity until this year (just before graduating high school in June) in which I peaked at suicidal thoughts constantly. My therapists know and I don't have plans to commit, I just think about it a lot, and I think it's most likely linked to not knowing where to go or what to do. I never knew what I wanted to do as a career. I have many, many interests and hobbies that range from art to psychology to engineering and computer IT to videogames and sports. The only problem is that none of these sound like something I want to do or study for my future. Whenever I think of how I want my future, it's just static. Some days I want to be a successful engineer. Some days I want to design business plans or things of that nature (I've always liked orderly plans and structure). Sometimes I want to just be a stay-at-home dad when I have kids, which isn't going to be for a long time. But most of the I have absolutely no idea. Thinking about the future for the most part just feels like staring into an abyss. And it makes me want to break down and cry for hours.

97,"i am currently a photographer trying to gain traction and clientele in my small town. a friend of mine is trying to gain followers on his Instagram for photography. he and I have been going around town and taking photos with each other for the last few months. well, I’ve started to notice a pattern. he’ll describe a shot to me that he wants, I’ll capture various ones because the idea is always vague and have him go through and pick the one he likes, he’ll take it, and post it on Instagram without giving me any credit. a lot of the times, we’ll spend so much time on his “vision” that I don’t have time to be taking the photographs I want and need to hone my craft. Every time I’ve found the photo I’ve taken on his page, it’s at 200 likes and he’s gaining followers, I’ll message him, he’ll say “oh, I forgot” and add the credit but by that point, it’s lost in the algorithm and the prime viewing time for it is over. It’s the 3rd time this has happened. 

I like taking pictures with him. It’s fun. He’s my best friend! But I’m wondering if it’s worth it because I feel like he’s taking advantage of my work. His most popular shots are the ones that I’ve taken. ",09Nov2018,1

102,"I'm an anxious person and have been attracted to a colleague at work for about a year. I'm afraid of being vulnerable and  because of my extremely limited capacity to handle any variety of this situation I immediately put the brakes on after one encounter with her. I became aloof and sort of a bitch. Whenever I was in the same space as her my mind would freeze and I'd become very anxious including shortness of breath and a thumping rapid heartbeat, but I feel slightly more at ease now so I would like to start thinking about repairing this relationship. This is a recurring pattern for me - feel attraction, avoid, (displays as hot/cold), wait for signs of vulnerability, and then start to feel guilty. By the time the guilt rolls around whatever initial feelings I had have subsided slightly so that the panic attacks aren't so major and I have strengthened other core relationships in my life temporarily to ward off my insecurity.

I would like to apologize in a way that doesn't indicate I ever felt attracted to her or felt any unprofessional feelings towards her, but I'm a bit at a loss at what to say.

103,"SO, the title much sums it all up, but here's a little back story. I haven't been with anyone for pretty much 3+ years now (not even sex in this long to be honest) I'm 27 years old, and before my previous relationship I wasn't like a jock or anything like that but maybe would sleep with like 1 or 2 girls a year. In total I've been with 11 women over my years, but my last relationship was horrible.

   

We dated for over 2 years, and it ended with her going to jail for assaulting me so I've kinda been ""out of the game"" or so to speak. My new job is in the cannabis industry, so it's super chill to be honest ... and it's not the ""average"" work place environment (I figured this should probably be taken in to consideration). She is only 1.5 years younger than me, and she has been super nice too me ( Everyone honestly has been, but maybe I just am like looking for someone or something ... IDK, so I feel like maybe she was just a little more talkative then the others ). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea if she likes me, it obviously hasn't been long enough to tell - or I'm just old af. Today though at the end of our shift, she was showing me around and then we started talking about music. She mentioned as a joke, shes an independent woman - then said, ""it's not that i don't need no man or anything, I just usually hate people"". Then she went on to show me her instagram though, and I totally wasn't thinking and forgot to ask her for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just really looking for advice on how to go about this situation without fucking up my new job or making things awkward. Please Reddit, need your help.  


Much Love.

107,"Ok so before I dive into what has been happening I’m gonna give a lil back story. 

So my parents went through a brutal divorce where my father had a family no one knew about for 8 years. As you could imagine this has taken a tremendous toll on my mother and on top of it my father was abusive to her (and still is) and hardly pays child support because he has no care for my younger brother or I.  With addition to this the woman that my father cheated on my mother with constantly harasses and slanders my mother online. My mom is a very emotional person to begin with and as time has gone on she’s become more and more depressed and angry. I try to be there for her as much as possible but when I am she either yells at me or wants nothing to do with me. 

Ok so now the main problem I really need advice on. For the past week my brother has been getting into fights with my mom and she has been saying she is going to kill herself non stop for the past week. Tonight they got into another fight where she started yelling “you guys are gonna regret taking me for granted” and “you lil fucks are never gonna forgive yourselves”. I love my mother unconditionally and I know she knows that but I just don’t want anything to happen to her because this is getting out of hand and I’m really beginning to worry a lot about it. 

See I wanna get her help but if I do I’m worried my father will find out and try to strip my mom of custody. And if that were to happen then itd be the final nail in the coffin for my mother.  And he will surely find out since my brother has a tendency to let things slip out in front of my dad. Also if police get involved he will find out since he is a cop and he knows people in the department in my town. 

It’s a whole mess and I really can use some advice right now I didn’t know where else to go and vent and try to get some good advice on what to do in this situation please. ",09Nov2018,1

In the beginning I had this 'gut feeling' she was kinda creepy, but because I wanted my son to have as many friends as possible, I socialized with all the moms interested in talking to me so their kids would be friends with mine. But as time wore on that creepy feeling just won't go away. Recently the creepiness level went up because out of the blue, I haven't talked to her in a week, instead of a normal hi how are you she started blurting out weird stuff like ""you're so pretty and so beautiful""...I was so uncomfortable. And she'd call my phone and hang up...is it legitimate to block her based on a 'gut feeling', would it be rude since I see her mondays to thursdays?

I have liked this girl for years and its always have been one-sided and I have never thought that I would date this girl or even kiss this girl ever even in my dreams. Also important to note that she works at the same place I do and knows that I like her, but we both do not make it awkward in the slightest. Recently she has broken up with her boyfriend and usually when that happens she will come and talk to me about it, so basically I act as a cushion and I know that I am. However this time, she has been really flirty towards me and she even called us ""flirty friends"" because we flirt back and forth, meaning a lot of texting, snap chatting pics to each other, etc.. So this weekend that just passed she came over to hangout with me and a couple our friends, no big deal. At the end of the night I walked her out of my apartment complex and we had a small conversation in regards to how is she feeling about the breakup etc. She says that she is not emotionally ready to have a relationship at the moment but at the end of the conversation saying the last goodbyes, we kiss and both left happy.

However, a little later in the night she sends me a text that tells me she does not see me the way that I see her but she would still ""love to be flirty friends for now"". A couple days go by, we work together and act like we always do, kind to each other and acting funny. However she has... basically stopped talking to me outside of work. She will send an occasional snap but other then that when I say something, just the usual one worded responses. With my head and heart being split from being happy and sad, I just need others input/advice on the situation. Something that I haven't done, should be doing etc..

Anyways I can get erections fine when I'm by myself but the the first time I had sex I could only stay hard for a few minutes I took it as I wasn't attracted to the girl at all which I kinda wasn't.  Then fast forward to Monday night different woman defiantly found her attractive in every way but and I was semi hard but as soon as she touched it I went soft. Can it be since I was a virgin for so long that I'm only use to my own touch not that of another? Because whenever I touch myself there's feeling in it but whenever someone else does its like it's paralyzed has almost no feeling to it. I know it wasn't performance aniexty so what could possible be the reason? Am I subconsciously sabotaging this or what. My friend says take Viagra but I'm starting to think it's mental not physical and I couldn't afford Viagra even if I wanted to take it and I get normal erections alone so I doubt it's physical.

117,"Okay I just want to start off by saying that I don’t have a Dad in my life anymore for very good reasons, so there is no one else I can turn to. 

My youngest sibling: Emma (13F)
Other younger sibling: April (17F)
Me: (19F)

I put the ages beside the fake aliases because I feel like they affect the below scenarios.


Anyways my Mum shows extreme favouritism towards Emma, and it’s causing intense feelings of resentment and anger in me that I cannot seem to shake. I’m sorry if these things seem petty. They might be and I could just be delusional. I feel like this might be true because nobody in my life shares or validates my feelings and I get called dramatic a lot, so just keep that in mind. Anyway, I’m just going to list a bunch of examples that I can remember, and then you guys can advise me because I really need it.

- We are extremely poor and living off a savings account because Mum refuses to get into stable work. Despite this, my Mum will pull Emma out of school and they will go get sushi and buy clothes. I once asked Mum why she pulls her out of school for therapy even though it doesn’t start till after school, and she won’t reply. This happens once or twice a week.
- Emma goes on plane trips to Nelson by herself without us, while we have to stay home. Sometimes Mum will go on trips, drop Emma off at a friends and leave me and April at home for a few days. She and Emma make a lot of plans for trips without me or April.
- Emma gets car rides everywhere. Me and April only get lifts if it’s on the way to Emma’s destination. I once asked for a lift and Mum said no because she was “pointing the wrong way” and didn’t have the “emotional energy” to turn around. We never got lifts growing up, and had to walk everywhere and still do.
- Mum acts more like a friend towards Emma than a parent. She lets Emma walk all over her, and let’s her do what she wants. She spends a lot of time with Emma, but when I was growing up Mum only went into my room 4 times a year and sometimes they didn’t know I had come home until half a day was over. 
- I love Emma as a younger sibling, I share no bad feelings towards her like I use to growing up when I couldn’t understand the situation properly, but she doesn’t understand that. Whenever I try bring it up with her, she immediately gets angry, violent and will ignore me for days. Today Mum brought her a whole bar of chocolate, while me and Izzy had to share one, and I asked her if we could third the chocolate for all of us and she said No and walked away. I love her so much, but it makes it hard to tackle the problem if she shuts it down every time. I know it might be because she is young, so I can’t expect her to fully understand it.
- When I try to bring it up with Mum, she acts like I’m ungrateful. I am extremely grateful, and I try to emphasise that all the time, but it’s hard to be happy about something when the person next to you has so much more. Wow, I know that sounds bratty, but I wish things were equal. 

Basically I am tired of all the small petty things, that stroke and stir all the resentment and anger inside of me. They happen all the time, but they are small things so when I bring it up to people it just seems dumb. I don’t want to feel like this anymore because I am so, so tired of it. I have to fight every thought that says I’m unloved and useless, everyday, and every night when I fall asleep. I just want to be content with my family and my life. 

What can I do about this situation?",09Nov2018,1

I'm literally on my own in the middle.  

I don't relate to my sibling 10-15 years older than me or their spouses that are 15-20 years older than me. 

And I can't stand the babies or teens. 

But my family has always made a habit of treating me like  in the same age bracket at their children. Even though I'm far more successful than they were at my age.   They all had children. I did not.  They mock me like I have no idea what it's like to be a grown up. Even though I've lived independently and not off of our parents or a spouse for all of my adult life.

121,"I don’t know where to start or what this will end up being.

I am 27/m college grad, great job. 

But I am depressed, I am sad, down, broken, unwilling to continue... ready to die. 

I feel like everything usually goes wrong for me. Like I am set up to fail no matter how much work I do or preparation I put in. I feel like bad things always happen to me. Like no matter what I do, something always goes wrong.

I feel as if I will never amount to anything special and that I will live a lonely, unhappy and sad life. 

I was born with a neurological disease called Neurofibromatosis. This basically means I have tumors growing in my body and on the surface. Although my case is mild compared to some, I still have many spots and discolored blotches on my skin that look like birthmarks. I have them especially in my groin area. This has absolutely killed my confidence with women and keeps me from even trying to get with a girl or have a girlfriend. I am extremely embarrassed of what she will say or the rejection she will put up once she sees me unclothed so I do not even try. I am ashamed of my markings. This has left me very lonely and depressed. These spots are a tremendous burden to me. I am 27 and have never had a gf. Awesome. 

I got raped a bunch as a little kid. The man that did it was my older cousin. He tricked me, convinced me it was okay. Nothing happened to him. He’s free and living in another state. I reported it to my older sister at 8 or 9 y/o. She told my mom. My mom brought it up to my aunt. 

My aunt denied it. My cousin denied it. They said I made it all up. Everyone just moved on. Except for me. 

Nothing happened to him. I want to kill him. I feel as if he killed part of me. I also feel like it’s my fault, like I shouldn’t have listened to him. But I did. 

He’s a free (gay) man roaming Nevada doing his thing. 

I got bullied a lot as a kid. Neighborhood kids outcasted me, teased me. Singled me out. I didn’t do anything to be outcast, but I was picked on a lot and not welcomed in our neighborhood group. One of the neighborhood kids even broke into my house and stole my things. Everyone thought he was cool for doing it and he was praised. 

A few years later I started having seizures. The seizures started somewhere around 13. Doctors do not know why I have seizures. They just know I have them. I was put on Keppra to combat the seizures, a drug known to cause depression and suicidal thoughts at around the same age. I still have seizures. 

The bad thoughts are there, and may grow to action. I think about ending my life often. 

Doctors prescribed a drug that DID NOT fully stop my seizures. I had two just this past September. Hospitalized and patted on the back after each one. Still without a reason as to why it happened. They just said I work out too much.

Doctors are smart though, they know what’s up. They thought it’d be a good choice to give a kid a pill that would bum him out and not treat his condition. Awesome. 

I was also bullied and picked on in HS. People are dicks. Whatever. To say this doesn’t still bother me all these years later would be a lie. 

I went to junior college and had shitty grades. I eventually turned my grades around and became an honor roll student, thanks to my sister and her husband. When it was time to transfer schools, I got denied from my school of choice because the lady at the transfer center gave me the wrong paperwork and instructed me to fill it out a certain way. Awesome. 

I went to some ghetto ass school and was discriminated against by teachers and students but I handled my shit and graduated on the deans list. This actually was awesome, although I am kind of embarrassed to have graduated from the school I attended. People don’t even know what it is. 

After I graduated I went into law enforcement academy. A couple of months in and I started having severe hip pain. I could barely walk but my academy staff saw it as a weakness and gave me more duties and extra responsibilities because they wanted the weak out. 

The pain kept increasing. I reported my injury to my staff and they sent me to doctors who said to walk it off. I literally broke my hip the next day. I don’t know if it was broken before this and I just broke it even worse but it definitely felt like it. 

The doctors missed the break in X-rays and forced me to do physical therapy for two weeks while in severe pain or I “wouldn’t get better”. They literally asked me why I was complaining. The dumb doctor actually said, “Why are you complaining?”. After breaking my hip,  resigning from the academy, peeing in a bedpan, doing physical therapy and literally bathing out of a bucket for two weeks, “doctors” finally found the break and recommended surgery. Gee thanks. 

I had surgery but am still in pain. My leg is fucked up. It hurts me all day. I feel as if I have a roll of coins stitched into the inside of my skin and it is applying pressure all day. I don’t sleep well, especially on my side. I now have to change sleeping positions several times per night and rarely get quality rest. My arms and shoulders are now sore all the time, as I am sleeping on my stomach instead of my side. I’m in a lawsuit now and am looking at receiving 3k. Awesome 

I recently went to another doctor that the lawyers in my case made me go to. I literally wrote down “this injury ruined my life”... “I am still in pain”... “the entire process has left me depressed and suicidal”...”I want to kill myself” and literally NOTHING was said by the doctors. 

I now have a different job. It’s a good job. Pay/benefits. But the lifestyle is terrible. I am on call 24/7/365. I work a ton of hours (65+ a week). I spend a lot of time in a hotel room by myself. The loneliness sucks. I have been alone my whole life.

I cry a lot.

My home life is sad. I am still with mom and dad and I do love them dearly. My dad is my best friend and does a lot for me. My mom and I argue all the time. It gets bad, I am so over fighting with her, it is a humongous weight. I feel like every little thing I do at home is wrong and that I am a failure as a child. 

My dad and I get into it to. I feel as if I cannot please them or that I am always disappointing them or doing something wrong.  But I am trying so hard to be a good son and someone they can be proud to say “that is my boy”, “look at what my son is doing” but I do not think I am that person, I think I am dead weight. 

I think I am a hindrance. Someone people have to take care of. I feel like a  disappointment. I feel empty and dead and alone. 

I also feel like I am mean. I feel like I push people away and distance myself from people. 

I have been researching suicide methods a lot lately. I am seriously considering it but I do not want to hurt my parents. I know they do love me but I do feel like I am a disappointment to them. 

It will also crush my sister. I think it might hurt her more than anybody. My sister loves me very much and she will be very hurt. When I told her I was bummed out in the past, I saw in her eyes how much it hurt her. 

She has three beautiful children and a loving husband. All of whom I love very much but my will to live is non existent. I do not want to hurt them but I don’t want to live being hurt either. 

I only live not to hurt them. I don’t want my parents to have a son who killed himself. I don’t want my sister to tell her kids their uncle killed himself. 

I do not know what to do and cry myself to sleep nearly everyday. ",09Nov2018,1

125,"Wasnt sure how I should flare this really, but here goes.

I'm currently attending what was my #1 choice of school. It's a great school, good professors and a very active party scene. However, I want to transfer back to my home state for a ton of reasons, some of which I'd rather not tell my mom (single parent), and I'd love advice on how to bring her to my side on this one. The reasons are as follows:

1. Money. I'm paying for my schooling through loans. I wasnt a star student in high school so I dont have any scholarships, just loans. As it stands now, I'll be graduating (should I stay here) with a debt that's in the ballpark of 250k. Being an engineering student, the % of people who graduate within four years in my field is around 35-40%. I can guarantee that with my current grades I wont be in that bracket, meaning a whole years worth (or more) of tuition, sitting at a pretty 40-50k a year, housing dependent.

2. My grades. I know the rigor of classes doesnt change much from school to school, however given my previous academic performances, I'd essentially have to kill myself over the next four years to graduate on time, and I feel like my grades should reflect the tuition I'm paying for them.

3. This is the one I'd rather not tell my mom, but I will if it's necessary mostly because it's probably my primary reason. My brother grew up without a dad, cause ours left about 6 months after he was born. My mom has had several partners in that time, and even been married once, but all of them leave eventually. My brother has started looking up to me as if I were his father, and I feel like I'd be reinforcing the trend of father figures leaving if I stayed here. I love my brother to death, and since he's just now hitting the age where he's gonna have a lot of ""questions"", i dont think our mom would be the best resource, since she essentially left me to figure it out myself. Nothing against her, i know it's difficult.

4. The stress its putting on my mom. Again, shes a single parent with a pretty good job. Six figures, good benefits, yada yada humble brag humble brag. But she doesnt have the money saved to keep me here without loans, and I know it's probably taking a toll on her knowing my loans will be with me for a good chunk of my life. I dont want her to be worried about that.

Initially, before I committed here, she really was challenging my idea of going out of state, constantly saying how much cheaper it was to go at home, and maybe transfer after two years to a better, still in-state college. But since I've had limited discussion about me going back home, shes really pushed back and said I have to stay here now. How can I phrase it for her over this coming thanksgiving break so that she'll be more open to me coming back and going in state?",09Nov2018,1
127,"Hi, I have a friend I've known for a while. He's been depressed and I've been trying to help him through it. He always messages me on Whatsapp and tells me that he's a loser, etc etc. I always try to help him, tell him he's not, to be more assertive, and to get professional help for his mental situation. 

I've been trying to help him for literally months. It's come down to him messaging me whenever he feels even a bit down, him insulting himself or being resentful and me trying to comfort him and give him advice to the best of my ability with the specifics of the problem he has that day. 

The issue is that there's only so much I can take. This guy has made me his ""message him to feel good"" guy. I'm convinced he doesn't want to improve and he is collecting pity points from me at this point. I genuinely want him to succeed but if you tell someone to be more confident a million times and he messages you the next day telling you how he feels like a looser, it's starting to make me feel down too. 

This person is starting to negatively affect me. What should I do? I don't see him in person ever, we only talk in text. I've been considering telling him but I don't know what to say. I don't want him to feel too bad because he is depressed but still the same time he is starting to affect me negatively now and I'm strongly considering cutting him out of my life.

137,"Hello reddit, how are you all doing today? I was wondering if you all could provide me with some advice with a bit of a situation I'm going through. Thanks in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Almost two years ago, I had a major vision issue effect my everyday life, and depression hit me like a rock. I quit college, would cry every day, all day, and just wanted to die. Very slowly, things started to improve, but I started using some VERY unhealthy coping mechanisms to bring myself some sort of happiness in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started hanging out in online communities, all day, everyday. I made some very good friends there, but I knew it was an escape from life. After all, I was running away from college, and my future. I met a girl I liked, and despite understanding that I would never be interested in her IRL, I started a sexual relationship with her. We got very close, and bonded super quickly. Pretty soon, we were best friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our thing continued for months, but it was very on and off. I would hit on other people for sexual pleasure, and she would go to others for romance. Being sexual with others online became my new cocaine. I wanted more and more of it. Guys, girls, age difference, attraction, I no longer cared. As a year went by, and I avoided life more and more, I became more and more desperate for my online bonding fix. I was not in a healthy place.   


Eventually I got involved with some of the wrong people, and they became to spread some insane rumors about me. I suppose that when you're in charge of a community and you're running around in DM's sexually, that'll happen. Except, a few white knights showed up and made things seem like I was forcing myself onto people, when that definitely wasn't the case. Pretty quickly, my reputation went from someone everyone in the community loved for my programming skills, to some sort of predator. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was devastating. There was no damage control. The girl had hooked up with a new guy, and wanted to cut me out. It hurt like hell. I realized suddenly that I had a very strong emotional connection to her, and I couldn't let go. We began to argue. ALOT. Two months of it later, we agreed to cut things off, and I left. But I couldn't stay away. I would come back to see what had happened to my reputation, and would self harm as I read those comments. I loved these people like family, and they had made me out to be the worst kind of human being for their own gain.

&amp;#x200B;

My irl friends and a therapist dragged me out by force, and I have been working very hard to change the kind of person I am. I'm only 21 now, so I've got plenty of time to change my life, right? Well, it doesn't feel like that. I miss my online friends, I miss my validation, I miss the love they gave me. I got an amazing job, I work full time, and I work out for hours when I get home. I've lost over 20 pounds, and I love my body again. People at work love me for my sense of humor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Externally, you could say I've become a great guy. But inside, I can't let the past go. I regret ever joining that online community. I feel like such a shell of my former self. I regret leaning on my friends to vent about the events, despite them happily being there for me though some of the worst hurt I've ever been through. I miss her. I hate that I fell in love with her, but I can't help it. I've learned very important lessons from this whole ordeal, but I just can't let it go. I can't sleep some nights thinking about how I'm this monster they made me out as, despite a licensed therapist telling me I'm nothing of the sort after hearing my story in detail. I can't ever go back. There will never be any closure.

138,"I’m in Texas and following the news of ole Ted winning again, my husband and I are considering moving to Colorado. There are several reasons for our choice, one being that I have severe health issues and chronic pain, and would like to be able to get a medical marijuana card and medicate without fear of prosecution. It’s out of hand. I’m 25 and I have been on the cusp of renal failure twice from taking SO many medications as well as opiates which I now refuse to use.

The other is that I’ve lived in my home town my entire life, and aside from our family, we know nobody here. We don’t make friends because we live in the Bible Belt and we aren’t exactly the sort of people that go to church on sundays. 👀 So making friends is really difficult. You basically have to be a nurse to get a job at all, and essentially I’m living in redneck central.

We have several friends in Colorado and we’re going to be visiting soon to see if it’s a good match for us.

139,"Hello everyone, I'm kind of in shock right now. I recently found out (within the past month) that my mom had an abortion many many years ago to cover up an affair she had had. I'm firmly pro-choice and it's a revelation that while certainly shocking, I had no issue with (if anything, I'm more shocked about the affair part). My mom on the other hand is very religious and the abortion has apparently haunted her for years now. She recently enrolled in a ""class"" held by some religious pregnancy clinic or something where she said she was coming to terms with her past, and while pretty skeptical, I felt if it'd bring her peace in some way, I'd be okay with it. I've been away at college anyways, so it's not like I've had to constantly hear whatever Biblical passages and interpretations they'd use to guilt and shame her. 

That changed today when she texted me asking if this Saturday I'd come down and go with her to a sort of funeral/memorial service for 5 or so fetuses that had been aborted, including my ""little brother."" I really love my mom and want to support her however I can, but I'm just so uncomfortable with the whole situation. If I were to say no, how would I even go about saying that?

But the sleep/work ratio was off (I don't work particularly all that much/regularly) I didn't sleep *at all* actually cause of that shooting last night made me weirdly sad and I was just thinking a lot of interesting thoughts all night and day. Coffee and breakfast got me going.. anyways so instagram; I really don't have that many followers but I keep them all in mind when I post stuff, typically cheesy tongue in cheek movie reviews. Most of my friends are sort of liberal I would say whereas I am a little more conservative. Anyways I took a nice video of a big American flag on top of a skyscraper (possibly half mast) fluttering in the wind and it really struck me how beautiful it was. I was also working up high in a skyscraper condo, at equal height. 

Anyways I work a few more hours and go have a nice big dinner and one beer on my boss. I get home very exahausted and relax for a bit and watch the nice video I took, nice cinematography. And am inspired to write a little speech about America.. oh boy. Idk what I was going for but it was sort of supposed to be a heartwarming appeal-to-everyone thing. But tongue in cheek too. I really sat down and put my heart into it though. Ok here it is: 

&gt; America is a wonderful place; as a country we have been through so much. It hurts to see when people get so divided, because we are all in the same boat. Like literally we all came here on a boat unless you walked here from Asia when there was a land bridge 20,000 years ago. We have been through some dark times in our past but we always use these experiences to learn and to better ourselves. Even if it takes decades, love will always, always win. When we get all split up it hurts the American spirit and the Human spirit. We are gonna be okay though.   We just need to try a little tiny bit to be nice to one another and bingo that's it. Abraham Lincoln said in the Gettysburg Address that we need to make sure all the extremely dark, terrible stuff that has happened in our past was not in vain. All we have to do is be excellent to each other. I'm sort of paraphrasing but we're gonna be just fine I promise. We are all in this together 

Immediately my best friend texts a screenshot and says ""whoa getting political there.. you complain about so&amp;so shit when he gets too political"" Keep in mind my best friend here is a little conservative like me, and our so&amp;so is very far left. He sort of roasts me when I ask if he thought it was a conservative or liberal message if it's so political as he says. He tells me it sounds like I watch the news too much. I messaged a couple random people and said this is ok right and they said yes it's really sweet. But then I asked my mom to just skim it over and she said it sounded really weird and bizarre.  I ended up just deleting the whole thing. But I just feel sick. I hope I didn't offend anyone. It was a weirdly stream of consciousness thought experiment. Got a handful of likes.

I applied for a different role in this organisation which one of my bosses was on the interviewing panel for. Obviously I saw emails about the role including the questions that would be asked. I took notes from these in order to prepare and ace the interview. Here’s where I fucked up... shared these notes with a colleague also interviewing to help her out. SHE WROTE DOWN ALL THE QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS AND TOOK THOSE NOTES INTO THE INTERVIEW. Of course they saw she was reading word for word and asked for a copy of her notes. They then asked for a copy of mine and put two and two together.

I was pulled in and questioned and I admitted what I had done straight away. My boss who really likes me told me she would call me on the weekend but I might lose my job. She said I might just get a written warning but because the other ppl on the panel know what happened she can’t brush it under the rug. HR has to be involved.

I obviously know I did the wrong thing and honestly deserve to lose this job BUT do you think there is any chance at all that I might just get a written warning and be ok?

158,"I'm 20 years old, currently a junior (3rd year) engineering student in university. My parents refuse to get me car for college no matter how I try to persuade them. Normally that would make me a bit too old to be making a post like this, but I'm in a bit of a special situation that warrants some outsider advice...

&amp;#x200B;

Let me provide some background information. I'm Asian and my parents are hardcore Asian parents. I grew up in an Asian city with ridiculously convenience public transportation, so car ownership isn't necessary over there. I would say my parents are very strict, overprotective, and constantly anxious that my sister and I will run into trouble in life. Therefore, we weren't allowed to do much growing up, and were mostly encapsulated in the safe havens of home, and even at age 20 am still treated like a kid. Two years ago I went to Canada for college, and sister also moved there to study high school, so my parents bought a house and a car in Canada, though they only came to Canada once in a while, so both of these assets would remain unused for several months a year. So evidently, finances aren't the root cause of this issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my university is about a hundred kilometers away from home. That's roughly an hour away on the highway, but at least 2.5 hours on the bus if you're lucky. I go to uni in a small city (much smaller than the one I grew up in, anyway), where running errands and commuting in general is an absolute pain in the ass especially in the winter - the area I live in has woeful snow plowing services. Not to mention that my parents expect me to go home every once in a while (i.e. twice a month), which for me is a significant amount of time given that the commute times make a one-day trip impossible, and hauling a carry-on suitcase in the snow for a couple kilometers to walk home from the bus stop is also a nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to explain my circumstances and ask to use their car over here in college. The car they got was a brand new Audi that cost a fair bit of money (my dad wanted to get that car), so understandably they refused on the grounds that I didn't need a car like that and that they wouldn't tolerate it being parked on an uncovered driveway in a faraway city. But they also came up with a bunch of reasons why they thought a college student like me would never NEED a car. I'll list some of these reasons below:

1. having a car would mean I would spend all my time partying or womanizing and not on academics (which aren't great atm but because of other reasons)
2. insurance is pricey
3. I will surely get into an accident
4. My dad went to college in Canada and he would walk for half an hour in the snow every day *and he didn't have a car*

but I find these completely baseless and ridiculous. These are my rebuttals for the above arguments:

1. I'm an introvert, I've never been to a party, don't date, (pretty much don't even have friends), and because of years of parental pressure, have never even consumed a drop of alcohol. My day-to-day university life literally consists studying in the library and worrying about what to get on my next grocery run.
2. But so is everyone else's insurance. If I don't gain road experience, how can I expect my premiums to ever go down? My parents are literally the type to tell me to get driving lessons with an instructor for that, but I've had my license for two years now.
3. Fear of accidents isn't an excuse to never drive, just as fear of plane crashes isn't an excuse to never travel. In fact, my mom (who had a license for years but only started driving last year) would constantly criticize my driving skills, despite the fact that she sideswiped another car in my dad's new Audi while trying to park nose-in, which required a complete bumper replacement. Whenever I mention it she would blame it on the car (hood too long) or other people (honking horns behind her and causing her to panic).
4. I really don't know how to respond to this one, except that times are a' changin' and that they shouldn't disallow me from having car out of spite, I guess.

I am starting to feel that their insistence on having me go through college without a car is having a toll on my mental health. I feel like it's creating a lot of unnecessary stress from having to worry about taking the bus for half an hour just to go to the supermarket to wasting tons of time for the long commute from college to home. Furthermore, I just don't understand why my parents can't be 'normal' and understanding like the other people I know, including other international students, whose parents immediately and willingly went and leased a car for their use when they said they needed one. Sometime I even feel trapped here because in this small college town I've basically only been to my school campus and the street I live on, and it's my third year here. I always hear about people having the time of their lives in college, exploring and going places, and I can't do any of that.

I get that it's unreasonable to demand one's parents just hand out a car which could cost tens of thousands of dollars, but the issue to me here is that while my parents aren't stinking rich in the least, it is apparently well within their abilities to even get me a trusty used car, which I have no qualms with using at all. I think the issue here is that they don't trust me and don't understand me which seems to be the pervasive dynamic between them and I since I was a child. It hasn't helped that I get agitated when my efforts to convince them fail and often end in an argument, but years of not being taken seriously is really frustrating, y'know?

Long story short, I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong in my approach to get them to get me a car. On another note, I do recognize that the root problem here is not only to do with asking for a car, but how my parents view me and my relationship with them as a whole, and what I need to do to 'normalize' that dynamic between myself and them. I just don't get it - I would consider myself one of the most obedient sons a parent could ask for?!",09Nov2018,1

That being said, I'm a bit of a lightweight when it comes to drinking.  We had a few beers and that eventually escalated to whiskey.  We decided to get dances later on during the night.  When I woke up sober, my friends said they couldn't find me in the club and were worried.  I had gotten home without me remembering and had slept with one of the girls who was entertaining us that night.  Fast-forward to a few days ago, and I get a call from her asking if I want to hang out with her sometime.  It was a drunken mistake but I don't want to sound like a cunt.

168,"It's a long story so just a heads up but I want to give you context so maybe you could understand me and give better advice. It starts towards the end of my first semester of my Freshman year of college (around last November). I met this girl Q, at one of my concerts my group does on campus.  We hit it off and everything went well. She was a PhD candidate so she was a bit older but we worked past it and we had so many great times together. I even started learning some Chinese and pinyin so that whenever we got to stage where I would meet her parents, I could communicate with them a little bit. This summer we went on a trip to L.A together and just had an amazing time. All in all, I loved this girl and everything was great with out relationship. But for the fall semester, I was going to be studying abroad in South Korea (a decision I made before I met her).  I had told her about it before we started dating and we agreed that we would work through it and stay together. Eventually, this proved so much harder than we had initially thought. The time differences coupled with my frequent immature late nights out at bars and clubs eventually took a toll on our relationship so we took a break. And during that break, I met a girl K, and we hit it off. We slept together and continued seeing eachother here and there. Through a not-thought-out social media post, Q, had found out and, understandably was enraged. She said she was done with the break and me, didn't want to be in my life anymore. So we broke up with about a month and a half after I came to Korea. Immediately after, I was feeling okay and a little while later, started to date K. Now K and I are still dating and I'm really happy. She's been nothing but great to me and I don't have anything negative to say. But this morning, I just started thinking about Q and all of our memories and it hit me like a truck. It felt like everything came rushing back, all the emotions and feelings and memories, all of it. Admittedly, I sent her a text to check up on her, she hasn't' yet texted me back. I think I have still have feelings for Q. Is this normal? Is it me just being nostalgic or do I still love Q?

172,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a bit of a pickle.  I have two potentially promising job offers and I do not know which to pick.  The second job has asked that I give them a decision by end of business tomorrow.  I have a bachelors in mechanical engineering and I am 2 years into my career and I currently live in Wichita, Kansas.  I'm going to give as many relevant details as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

The first job is for a 6 month contract-to-hire near Oklahoma City where my family is living.  Contract-to-hire means that if I do a good job for the first 6 months I will have a full-time direct hire position, benefits, salary, etc.  The hiring manager stressed to me during interviews that there he didn't hire contractors unless he knew he had a spot for them long-term.   
For Job 1 I would be doing supply chain engineering type work for a military airplane sustainment project at a higher rate than I was making in Wichita.  I couldn't get a clear picture of what the job would exactly be but it sounded very dry.  It seems like I may be managing the renovation of aircraft from a high level for production, procurement, instalation, maintenance of updated aircraft electrical components.  My employer would sponsor me for a secret clearance and it might open doors down the line, it certainly wouldn't hurt.  I already got some advice on how valuable this clearance is and I feel I didn't get a consensus on askengineers.  I gave the recruiter for Job 1 permission to accept a job offer on my behalf many months ago, and the details were finally worked out between the government, the airframer, and the contractor this Monday.  I simply received a phone call telling me that I got the job and an e-mail with my start date.  I filled out all the on-boarding paperwork for the contractor maybe a month ago.  I felt a bit misled because I'd never actively accepted this offer, only passively.  I did 100% give them the right to accept job offers on my behalf.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my family and I have missed them while working as an engineer in Wichita but my relationship with my father and brother has always been a bit strained.  My dad spent most of our childhood working and angry.  My brother was a bully for over a decade to me.  I just spoke to my parents and they are fine with either job but would be absolutely ecstatic if I were to work in OKC.  They are getting older (late 50's) and I truly do not think it would be wise for me to sprout roots in another city and let my parents pass while I am thousands of miles away.  I think I should settle down in OKC.  I have no pictures of my family or recordings of their voice which worries me some days.  When I asked my parents a few days ago they told me to go with Job 2, but now they tell me to go with Job 1.  Either way I know they'd support me, and I think I and them are fairly easy to sway one way or the other.  My dad has his own way of talking, and says he doesn't want us to argue and would like to see me once or twice a month.  I'm not sure what to make of that.  My brother's advice was useless and just basically insulting me for not having found a position sooner, except he said he had heard stories of people at Job 1 working 60 hour weeks (for a software group, not mechanical).  He attends university nearby OKC.

&amp;#x200B;

The second job is for a 3 month contract only position for a ginormous Seattle, WA air-framer at a rate that is $15/hour higher than job 1. Cost of living calculators suggest that Job 1 actually pays better than Job 2, and the cost of living becomes especially significant if I want to buy a house.   I am a bit excited about this position because they have very large testing cells to test gigantic loads on air-frame assemblies.  Next door to where I'm would work they test the entire airplane.  One of my summer internships was working with engineers who were testing jet engines, and I have to say that the test work was the most exciting thing I've done in my career.  Though, I don't know if I can say I have ever truly loved or entirely enjoyed any job.  The hiring manager says he can make no guarantees beyond 3 months, but the recruiter says 90% of contracts are extended at least once for typically 4-6 months and that 40% of contracts result in a direct hire.  The hiring manager talked a bit about the need to transfer knowledge to early career engineers due to a lot of recent retirements in aerospace and that he is about to begin testing a new airplane which seems promising.  However, there is a real chance that I will end up without a job when the contract ends.  Three of my best friends and old roommates from college are living in Seattle and working as software engineers.  When I think back on my adult life I cannot remember a time I was happier than in college, hanging out with these friends a few times a week and every weekend.  We game on discord sometimes but the time difference is rough to deal with.  I don't know if it would be possible to recapture these days but I would enjoy it very much if it were.  I visited them in Seattle 2 years ago and had a blast, though one friend was a little sick of seeing me every weekend for the duration of my vacation.

In terms of where my head is right now... when I jot my thoughts down I get something like this:

Job 1:

Family, pay is better after adjusting for cost of living, security clearance

Boring work

Job 2:

Exciting work, best friends in Seattle

Riskier contract, higher cost of living

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to proceed about deciding between these two positions.  I am happy with you telling me which job I should choose and why, or how I can go about best choosing.  The recruiters are persuasive and after I talk with either of them I end up more confused.  I plan on calling the recruiter for Job 1 tomorrow to get as many specifics as I can about the work I'd be doing, my one-over-one hasn't responded to my e-mail with that question that I sent on Wednesday and I think I need the answer before making a final decision. There are a lot of factors to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

If I have to pick right this second I think I'd pick Job 1; Job 1 is already accepted on my behalf (I may permanently burn bridges with a big company and a recruiting firm if I rescind the offer as well), my family is right near Job 1, Job 2 has no guarantees beyond 3 months, and there is no guarantee I can recapture my old college days if I went to Seattle.  I'm not sure if I'm seeing things clearly or not.  Many thanks for your advice.

I am 42, overweight, alcoholic and my career which used to be going well is in a rut. Not to mention my marriage is a joke. I never imagined being in this state when I was a student at the university, full of idealistic hopes and dreams, with unyielding trust in my abilities to make my life the way I wanted. 

I did master’s in journalism at university and managed to score a top job by the time I was 25. I worked a lot, as it was my passion, I even imagined writing novels at one point. A few years later, I met my husband, had children and since my husband’s career took off, I followed him abroad for 10 years, moving from country to another, taking care of the kids basically alone. But it was a very happy time for me. 

We moved back three years ago, but of course, as I had such a long time away from work, I was not able to get a good assignment anymore. I basically write marketing texts and advertising day to day. Depressing. Two years ago, my husband confessed he had had an affair with a person I know, for a year. It ended, as far as I know, but our marriage did not survive. We fight, no longer have fun together, I can never trust him again. But as I am economically not able to independently take care of the kids, I have nowhere to go. I have no family of my own. I took to wine and food for comfort, which spiraled quickly out of control.

But I don’t know how to change things, or where to begin.

My wife and mother in law(who owns the house we are living in) has said I can stay till after Christmas,so thats something.

I want to stay civil with the mother of my child for the sake of our child,she seems to be okay for now,but I found out she is interested in another guy that she works with and because of that I just can't look her in the eye.

I never thought Id say this but Im a broke man. I don't even know what to say to my family and friends,I've told her that she will announce our seperation since she is the one that ended things.

I don't even know how Im meant to be at work. We are meant to always smile and pretend there isn't a care in the world,how am I meant to do that? I've lost the woman I love basicly to a guy thats younger than us(we are 23 and the guy is 20).

Im not a very emotional guy,Im not the best with relationships,Im not the best husband or father,I deal with anxiety and depression but I do what I can for the people I love,Im not all lovey dovey or whatever it is but I went into this marriage committed to my daughter and wife. And after 4 1/2 years being in a relationship and 7 WHOLE WEEKS of being married....its over,like that.

I know its over,Its done with,I can't trust her like I did before. I neee to start moving on, But it hurts. ",09Nov2018,1

180,"I recently found out my grandmother that i fell out of contact with, due to a mess of family reasons, is living alone in an abandoned building in Louisiana. I have phone contact with her, and I am going to drive to pick her up in one week. She will be momentarily staying with me untill I figure out what to do.

How can I help her? She is very old, she has nerve damage in one hand, and she has trouble walking. She has no one else to help her, and I myself cannot afford to care for her alone for long.

As she is in Louisiana, she works full time at Dollar General. Her only bills are her phone bill. She is going to try and receive a job transfer to Texas.

181,"I'm 25 and have a college degree in science, but can't find a job with it so I'm considering two alternatives.

I currently work in a warehouse. It's not awful but its not great either. I drive a machine and put boxes on shelves or take them off for 10 hours a day. However my main contention is with the people I work with. We're very different and don't have anything in common. So everybody is friends with everybody except me. Partially because I'm introverted but partially because I'm a minority in more ways than one, and don't fit in. So although I'm really good at the job and my supervisors love me, I don't enjoy it and don't see a future in it. My brother started working there a couple years ago and is now on making decent money with benefits as a supervisor. He really likes it but it's not where I really want to be. It's also in my hometown and I really want to get out.

  
So option two. Join the military. I'm not going to start a political debate about it, but simply put, I'm very much against the US military. I don't want to join but it also offers a lot of options. I could chose a new career path and get away from home. My other brother joined and its gone well for him and he encourages me to do the same. If I did join I would join the Air Force and be in a non-combat position like maintenance, but in my mind I would still be supporting a bad institution. Most join for the free college benefits, but I already have a degree so that's not something I'm concerned with. I'm also significantly older than most people that enlist - for better or worse. I've heard it's a lot of high-school-like drama and immaturity. Being treated like a child and micromanaged. And I'm a very independent, stubborn person and value my freedom to do what I want when I want - which has sometimes rubbed my supervisors at some jobs the wrong way, and others embrace it. So even if I had no moral dilemma joining, I don't have a great personality match for it either. And yes I've considered commissioning and no I don't want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is aware of the ASVAB, I scored a 99. I'm also an INTJ on the myers-briggs if that helps.

&amp;#x200B;

If I could start back over at 18, I would learn a trade - most likely carpentry,  but that seems out of reach at this point. I really don't want to go back to school for anything at this point and don't want to go into debt for anything either. Plus am I supposed to live at home for 2 years to do trade school? Not a chance. I just want to get a job and move out of my parents house already. I'm fine with woodworking as a hobby as long as I can have a decent job that pays the bills.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a very intellectual person but enjoy working with my hands. I want to do everything possible to avoid a cubicle, business casual, corporate bullshit type job. Although I'm capable of both - I'd rather fix the car than design it. I'm more than happy to save the deep thinking and intellectual curiosity for my private life.

I took the job because it has a guaranteed weekend day off, but my manager routinely references how comfortable the opening hours are and says I should give more.

I'm married and today my husband told me he's leaving me. When he told me I felt relief. What he doesnt know is that I have fallen in love with another man. This man (we will call him Bob) and I have known each other since we were 16 and were now 36. He has always had a crush on me and has been open about it. We tried to get together several years ago before I met my husband but it just didn't pan out to no fault of either of us. It just wasnt the right time. I realized then that I loved him. Fast forward to now. He and I are in the same pool league and play in tournaments together so I see him at least once a week if not more. I get excited every time I see him and cant take my eyes off him. I catch myself staring. I look at his pictures on Facebook all the time just so I can see his face. Every single time I see him he tells me how beautiful I am. A week ago I was playing in a tournament and he showed up at the end. We both hung out with everyone and drank a little too much. We ended up fooling around in the parking lot. We left the bar and got a hotel room where we had sex. It was the most amazing experience I have ever had. While we were having sex he looked into my eyes and told me he loves me and wants to be with me. Afterwards we cuddled for a bit then I went home. I waited 3 days before texting him. When I did text him I told him I wanted to do it again. He never replied. I texted him the next day and again he never replied. The day after that I sent him a message through Facebook messenger saying how much it hurt that he could sleep with me and then ignore me. It shows he saw it but he never replied. I saw him the next night and he acted no different than he always has. He even asked me to let him walk me to my car because of how late it was when we left. While at my car he brought up the night we had sex and said he wanted to do it again. I said I did too. But then the next day when I messaged him he saw the message but wouldn't reply. So today after my husband told me he was leaving me I called Bob and he actually answered the phone. I told him about my husband and he said we'd have to see where things go with us and that he would message me later. I was so happy. Then tonight I messaged him and flat out asked him yes or no am I wasting my time and energy on him. He replied yes. I have never felt so heartbroken. My heart literally hurts. I have cried and cried over this. I talked to a mutual friend who was at the bar the night we hooked up only because he knows about it. I asked him if Bob had said anything and he said yeah that basically I spooked him with all the texts. So I texted Bob one last time and said that I wouldn't have texted him so damn much if he would have just replied. That sleeping with someone and then ignoring them is mean. But that this is what it is and while I don't like it I'll try to accept it. Of course he said nothing. So now I'm sad. I thought he loved me. I though he wanted to be with me. I don't know why a guy would say those things and not mean it. I mean we were already having sex when he said them so it's not like he had to say it to get in my pants he was literally inside me when he said them. Why would he do this to me. Why would he hurt me so badly. What can I do if anything to try and fix this? And how in the heck am I supposed to see him at least once a week and ct like everything is still the way it was before we hooked up? I know I cant go back to being good friends because I want more than that. I want to be with him. I want to be with him and not have to hide it. But I am going to have to pretend like things are the same as they were before so no one suspects anything and I don't know how to do that. HELP!",09Nov2018,1

192,"I wish i wrote this sooner but... In 4 hours I’m scheduled to have an elective D&amp;C to abort a pregnancy my husband and I planned. 

A little back story: I’m 30 married and a mother to a 5 year old. Up until recently my husband and I always said one and done but recently we talked about how lonely that would be and now that he is in kindergarten, we could have another as we would only be paying for one in daycare at at time. 

When we initially found out, I was super excited and told pretty much my entire family. I told my coworkers  3 weeks ago. When I told my mom her response was “ I thought you said you only wanted one” and my grandmother cried but not because she was ecstatic but because she was sad about how bad the world is- she’s religious. 

So, my husband left on a trip for a long weekend to hang out with friends and during this time of me having to be the primary caretaker for our kid and at one point me crying because I was stressed, I had a revelation that I wasn’t ready for this baby. I started to remember how lonely i felt after I had my kid, how much regret I had for those first few years and how much I wanted independence from being a mom. I didn’t have many friends that have kids so it hard for me to not feel lonely even now. My identity for the last 5 years has been being a mom and I want to focus on what I have, grow, travel and provide great experiences for my kid and myself. But for whatever reason I forgot all about that stuff.  

More recently my husband began working part time and returned to finished his college education. Which he’s never had the chance to focus on between having a mom who never made education the focus and then having a child at 25. I’m happy that I can work full time and pay the bills while he focuses on getting good grades and finishing but he won’t be done for about 2.5 years. So I fear having another child will set him back. I’d also like to go back to get second bachelors in nursing which Ive slowed worked towards finishing the prerequisites for, all I have is a test and one more class to take before I can apply. So again a child will set things back on that. 

The other obvious concern is the financial end of it. We don’t have family who can help provide childcare so we rely on paying for daycare. When my son was in pre-K we were spending Around 860 a month and it has been a huge relief to not have the expense now. With infant daycare we are looking at a minimum of 1180 a month for full time daycare. I’m sure we can try to work out a schedule to get part time daycare but that is not guaranteed because there will be changes in my husbands schedule with school and work since he’ll have to pick up more hours to care for this child. I also cannot mentally handle being a stay at home mom. 

Also, We have a house that we have been wanting to do various work on and we will not be able to do much of it with the added expense. 

While we can definitely make things work I just don’t feel like it is a smart move. It’ll make us struggle for a while or require my husband and I to set our goals aside u til we are in our mid 30s. And I don’t think that what we should choose. I also feel that mental health wise I will not be able to handle it. 

The thing that is making me not want to get an abortion is that my son will be an only child and that makes me sad as I feel he will be so lonely. I know I can adopt or try again but that won’t be for another few years.  I think about my relationship with my siblings and I want that for him. I’m really struggling

203,"To explain you my situation:
I am 18 years old and graduated this spring in Germany. I have just started a dual study programm at a big company which basically means you go to college and work at the same time. This is something not so many people get a chance to participate in because the company pays for a private university and you get a monthly payment.
 In this case it's special because additionally to the university and normal work I absolve a normal dual work/school programme for the first 2 years which is typical for Germany. This means I have work 3 times a week, go to university two times a week and go to a school specialised for people working in a company one time a week which adds up to 6 days a week of work. This will continue for 2 years, after that it's 1 1/2 years of just work and university so I will graduate after 3 1/2 years. But after that I have to stay at the company for another 2 years which means I am ""free"" with 23 years of age.
I also life an 1 hour trip away from my workplace which means I have to drive two hours a day, 6 days a week. When you go to the gym and follow a particular diet and want to meet with friends this is a good recipe for a packed week and I haven't even written any tests so far. Because of this packed week I want to move away to safe at least these daily two hours of driving.

Now my problem:
After school I lost a lot of friends which I think is pretty typical and didn't bother me much because I expected it. I also lost contact with my two best friends because they got a girlfriend which also didn't bother me as much as I thought it would because I still kept a few good friend. Not best friends but good friends I see once or twice a week.
During my first vacation since I started in August one of the friends I get a long with the best started his first week in college which went as you would expect: A lot of partying and fun. Now he just has to be in university for maybe 3 days a week.
As I had this contrast to my daily life I had a little mental breakdown thinking about if I picked the right thing. Nearly all my friends are in college and have this lifestyle which sound like they are having the best time of their life's.
Since this I couldn't stop thinking about quitting because in the first 4 months quitting has no consequence, after that you have to pay back all the expenses which is about 270€ for every month you participated. This will also add lots of pressure to my daily life after the 4 months knowing that if I fail a few test I have to pay back huge sums of money. 
I also tried to comfort myself by saying ""you can relief these years after you graduated by going to university again or going to another country for a few years"" but to be honest I don't know if I would really do this after having a getting a guaranteed workplace which would mean I would have to give up a good job.

When moving out I have fears about beeing alone. I will live with 5 other guys but they are all older than me and I don't know if I will get a connection. The city I would have to move in is also not particularly great or big so life there is pretty boring and has no offers for young people. I get along and go partying with the people doing the same programme like me but these are just friendships you meet at work/class and get a long with but probably won't form a good friendship with.

I constantly think about quitting but feel really ungrateful because I got a chance many people want but don't get. Especially because the company offers a lot.
I also don't want to disappoint my father who is proud of me and also works at the same company. We have a pretty good relationship but I would feel uncomfortable talking about this with my father who helped my deciding to do.this programme.

But besides of that I feel like I throw the best years of my life in the dirt just to save 2 years especially because I graduated so young. This was one of my main concern before agreeing to this programme.
I will also lose more contact with my friends by moving out and don't know if I can handle loosing the last friends I have from my school. But staying at home is just to much time spent driving with my lifestyle. The distance is not to big which means I probably won't stay in my apartment the whole week but still, it's not optimal.
I also don't know how this whole situatiom will develope when I will take the first tests. Because of university and the ""company-school"" I will have to take a lot of tests. Like one test a week from next week on until the semester ends.

Hi, I’m an alcoholic. But despite numerous sessions with different therapists they’ve all said I’m not. I don’t fucking understand because I’m not lying to them.
 
Here’s my situation:
 
I’m married to the most wonderful woman anyone could wish for. 7 years now. I’m the luckiest person alive. I’ve been successful enough in my career even though I don’t earn big, but good enough. She’s got a great career too.  (FYI: Living in India, as a creative in the advertising field. Not an engineer, Doctor, banker, etc.)
Yet every evening, every chance I get, I just reach for the bottle and swig.
 
I drink when I’m away from scrutiny. So basically 5 days of work equal 5 days of drinking in the evening.
 
How the fuck do I get better? For her especially? This isn’t fair to her and I wanna fix myself. I know what the problem is, I don’t know Why the problem is. 

Apologies if I violated any rules. First time posting. Thank you. ",09Nov2018,1

I am working a very busy job, bad hours, up until the other day I was studying full time too, but I have been making adjustments, improving my terrible diet, getting g better sleep, drinking water, and trying to regulate time for things. 

Even so, I am exhausted. The idea of sitting up and trying to work on something tires me out ... Just the idea of it. Let alone doing it. I can't get anything done. As someone who wants to be a professional writer, this causes me something of an inconvenience. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for finding the energy or a lifestyle changed that may help? Thanks. ",09Nov2018,1
208,"So I moved to London about a year ago and it has been the most stressful year of my life! I moved here to be with the man I love, which has put pressure on the relationship, we moved in together away which was probably to fast and so we argue a fair bit. Nothing serious, but it still puts a downer on things. 
I commute an hour each way to work on the tube that's packed, polluted and smelly. It's so expensive here, I never have any money to just enjoy the city. And I'm from a small town in the country so am not used to big cities, I miss the quiet of the country. 
I was lucky that I found a job pretty quick, I started off as a temp and then got made permanent. I like my job, but I don't love it. And here is the issue. While I don't love my job and can't see me being here forever I still want to do well and succeed. My job can be demanding at times and there's a lot of time pressures which means I don't double check my work as I should, i just send it out, and so i make mistakes. Wrong names on emails, sending things to the wrong person, forgetting to add things, typos on documents. While none of these are big errors they all add up and I'm beating myself up so much about them. I know all I need to do is slow down, breath and just double check things. So why can't I do it? Am I just an idiot? Do I just not give a fuck? Am I self sabotaging? 
I have no idea and I need to fix this asap before I start making bigger mistakes and work start noticing! 
How do change this awful habit I have gotten myself into? How do I be a better person? I feel like if I can fix this and figure this out it will go a long way to being to stressed and other aspects of my life will benefit!

Basically I'm over it. I'm over the BS of digital marketing. I feel like I've been working in this for 10 years and now I've done everything I can in it (except for being say, a CMO and being responsible for a large team but I don't care to be a big-time manager, just somebody who's good at their job from a strategic and technical point of view. Leading a team won't fulfil me). I'm 32 and married with a supportive SO. I feel like, is this it? Is this what I'm going to do for the rest of my life? Figure out ways to bring traffic into a company to sell stuff?

It sounds crazy, but I wanna just completely change direction and start teaching english to Asian students in the city I'm living in, after gaining a TEFL certificate (I work in a big city with a large Chinese student population, which is awesome). Am I being irrational thinking about changing it up out of a corporate office and being more beneficial, as a person, to people? Getting to meet people, help them, watch them succeed....

I’ve been friends with this guy for about a year or so and we’ve gone out several times before. I would say we’re quite close and he said that he’s never talked so deeply with another person besides me before. I feel totally at ease with him when he’s in the mood to speak and he makes me feel so happy. 

At the start of our friendship, it felt totally natural to just hang out with him all the time. I admit I got a little obsessed and basically planned my entire schedule around his just so I could spend more time with him. 

Gradually I realized my feelings towards him weren’t totally platonic, but I didn’t curb it then because I wasn’t completely sure about his sexuality yet. I did know it was highly impossible for him to like me regardless though (haha). I still tried to be hopeful but he’s confirmed that he is entirely into men so now I’m just kind of stuck. 

Because I got so attached  I think he realized. He told me that I cared too much and he feels uncomfortable being around me and wants some space. I gave him the space and gradually we closed the distance but it never returned to where we were before. 

We are still friends, but I can feel the distance between us and it hurts so bad. I don’t know what to do. The feelings are duller but it’s still there.

217,"Background: I had a very bad tenant. I’ve always allowed pets, and I’m pretty sympathetic to the struggles of young people starting out in life — but these ones came just shy of eviction.

The only relevant part of this is that I was getting complaints over how they left their animals kenneled and screaming sometimes up to 16 hours a day. When they left, the area where they kept their dog was rotted through the subfloor and up the walls from old urine. It was horrific. I have the photos of the damage, but I never had to formally evict them and I never had to actually report anything about their animals, so I have no paper trail on how they lived here.

The wife told me when they left that since she’d never get another rental with a pit bull, she had her doctor sign a letter saying *the dog she neglected to the point of mold rotting the baseboards and halfway up the drywall* was her ESA, so other landlords would have to allow it.

Sorry for the long post.

I don't normally do these things but I'm kind of struggling at the moment, I moved out of home 9 months ago and left everything behind, a relationship, and a large group of friends. I am struggling to find new friends and someone to date. I guess I'm just feeling alone.
I work long hours as I'm a car salesman so it is hard trying to get out (60+ hours a week) so naturally I'm a pretty confident guy, but I'm still struggling with Social Anxiety. I occasionally go out to a local bar and I normally have a really good night but never make any friends from it (although I'm not expecting to make long term friends from a bar).

I have a decent income and have just purchased my own apartment but I have noone to share the excitement with and the Benefits.
I'm feeling pretty lost at the moment, I just can't seem to find a way to make good friends or a relationship.

I really want to find the right person to settle down with and all that stuff but I just can't seem to find anything, I have tried internet dating etc. I just don't know what else I can do, I am fed up of being alone.

I spend a lot of time with people at work so I know what your going to say, what about them, now I spend some time with them and it's nice to see each other outside of work but I want something more than work. I dedicate my life to work as I have nothing else and so I put all my effort into work now. 

I just want something outside of work, a couple of friends I can rely on and have a laugh with, a loving relationship and someone to be mine.

I have run out of options and ideas on how to help this, I have tried most things and I'm just getting to the 'sod it, just be alone forever' kind of attitude and I hate being like that but I have no way out and nothing to work with.

I'm 21YO and male, living in the city. I have decent amount of interests and I look at myself as a funny guy and someone that people can enjoy being around.

Some background first: I don't know why but the few weeks before her hospitalization my Grandma has refused to eat anything and so her kids had no other choice but to take her to a hospital to fed via tubes. Well. She's dead now. Something went wrong during the feeding procedure, at least that's as much as I know from a phone call with my mom. I honestly don't know how I feel about this. I know we are not supposed to talk ill of the dead, especially because it's been so recent but our relationship wasn't really the best. She's been super manipulative to my parents ever since I've known her i.e. guilt-tripping them into doing things like skipping work, having my father buy a house for her which she didn't end up using 'cause she just decided to live with us, insulting my mother even when she's within earshot etc. My parents had enough of her behaviour at some point and so she decided to live with another one of her children. That happened when I was already out of the house. Like with us, my Grandma and my uncle's family didn't really get along that well and that's when she stopped eating voluntarily. I just feel like maybe it was our fault or something and I just don't know what to make of it. She was still super healthy, nothing was wrong with her but I don't know why she just decided to do that and she's always caused friction between our families and I just feel so guilty for thinking that way. When she died, I felt lost. We've never been close. She's never talked to me aside from the occasional ""How are you?"" When I lived with her, it was almost like living with a stranger you see during dinner.

Other than that, I'm still a college student in the middle of the trimester. I've got so much work piled up and I just don't know if I can/should attend her funeral. I've got 2 presentations, 2 essays and a take home exam all within this week and some of them are group projects. I feel terrible for thinking this way, thinking that I should do my college work rather than attending my relative's funeral. But my family is planning to bring her body to her home town and it's two days worth of traveling. Not to mention, funerals in our place can take up to a week depending on who's planning it. I don't know if I should put off my work like that. It's almost the end of the trimester, about three weeks left until the final and after that I've got a 10 day long field study course. I don't know if I can handle that. I don't think I'll be able to pass my classes if I push my work away.

I just got out of a shit ""relationship"" with someone I'd known for 2 years. It only lasted a month (hence the quotation marks) and towards the end consisted of me constantly airing my insecurities out to someone who, from my perspective now, really didn't care. 

So what did i do next? ...i got into another relationship. This is a couple weeks after the break up, just last week. I felt healed enough, because Hey, it wasnt a relationship and it was short. 

Things were okay. It's an ldr and the person and i have been poking at the idea for a couple years. Things were okay for the first couple days, we were all sweet and making plans, but yesterday was just awful. 

We were both having a bad day. I tried to comfort her, told her to take time for herself if she needs it, etc. But i also tried to communicate that i wasn't ok either and she kind of just ignored it. We didn't really talk at all even though she was on all day 

I vented out my insecurities and questions such as when we'd go official, the question of exclusivity, etc. And i kinda had to remind her a couple times about it, to which she insisted she would when she felt better enough (and it was a stern insistence... which is more I've come to expect in relationships, but still) 

One of the times i reminded her, this morning, i told her that all the delays are making me feel unimportant and she sbappe, saying word for word ""oh well I'm sorry you feel that way, and it's not that way, but i dont feel good, how can i make others feel good if i can't make myself? Dont rush me it'll make me break down even more"" 

...now, to a point i cant even get upset at the response. I know the feeling of being rushed. But i definitely think her tone was pretty messed up and hurtful. And i worry that the reason she keeps delaying it is because shes gonna say something that'll hurt me. 

We talked today and she seems a little better, but i got another thing to add to my Paranoia Pile: she mentioned having dinner with friends, which, okay i normally wouldn't care. In fact I'd be glad, she's going through a lot too... But she sent pics and idk, she seemed really close to this guy and stuff, i don't really know what to think, yknow? Maybe I'm being ridiculous, after all just 3 days ago she was calling me ""her human"" and saying she wants me to be her partner after not having one for three years. But you never know, i was saying that i feel safe with her and all that and she said the same except more generalized, about intimacy and feelings. 

I just... don't know. There's red flags (or things i perceive as red flags) but at the same time it hasn't been long at all. Should i just give it time? There's always the chance things could go great when we visit, but really... It would be in summer, which is wicked far off, *anything* could happen before then.

English teachers saying I have really good ideas and could write a novel if I really cared and put the effort into it.

When I took communications in college my professor will say I have a really good speaking voice that could be presented better if I had a little more confidence in myself. Then, there’s my friends in High School who noticed I have a way to be persuasive sometimes completely manipulative.

Rather it be spending hours writing a 1 page essay because I’m so trapped in my head wondering what the reader will think, having trouble holding job interviews because I’m spending the entire time thinking about how to present myself that will make me stand out to that employer specifically.  

-For example : one place I applied to the employer was pretty much looking for people who had no lives as they wanted those who can work full time and come in when ever asked. Obviously, I didn’t know this before hand but I could kind of read off her that she was looking for someone who gave off that vibe (later found out I was right). Spent the interview thinking to myself how can I come off that I needed this job but didn’t degrade myself to seem desperate but also sounded knowledgeable despite never working before but not come off too cocky as though I’m too good to be an over night inventory worker. 

While I still have my high school friends though most moved away after graduation I have a hard time finding new ones as I don’t know what to say to anyone. I run so many things to say and personalities through my head it’s either too late and they left, I give up and consider trying another day, or I crumble and make up some have planned out conversation which leads to them not knowing what I’m talking about, a conversation that doesn’t go far as I didn’t really know where my end game was or being left on ‘read’ as it wasn’t interesting enough. 

I know I can be great.

I live in a three cat household. Two cats are both quite small, one probably skinnier than she should be. Neither are very food motivated and are grazers. The third is a stray cat that we found living under a building when he was ten weeks old. We were warned by our vet that he might binge eat due to his upbringing. He now weighs around 6kg (13lbs or 0.9 stone). We’re getting really concerned about his weight. He’s 11 months old and weighs double what our other cats weigh. 

At the moment we free feed dry food and provide two wet meals a day. This normally consists of kangaroo meat, beef or standard packet food. He no longer gets kitten food because he doesn’t need to grow anymore! He eats any of his siblings left over wet food and presumably lots of biscuits. We believe it’s the biscuits that are creating our sizeable problem. We’re hesitant to take away the biscuits or provide low calorie biscuits since the other cats are so small and we’re worried they may be underweight.

I’m currently a freshman in high school and I’ve struggled all my life. Social anxiety is the epitome of why I’ve been staying home for the past two days without reason, and my Aspergers only makes things way worse. Everything about public school just makes me want to disappear. Waking up so early, anxiety, never feeling comfortable and/or safe, etc. I believe I’m just slipping into depression as each day goes on. I can’t fall asleep at night and work is just ALWAYS on my mind, I haven’t known what it’s felt like to be at peace for so long. 

With all that being said, I thought of online school and all the possibilities I could have and how it would be better. I wouldnt constantly feel horrible and I could focus on myself and practice skills like painting/drawing, using Duolingo to learn a language, and for once I could meditate. I really feel like I could be the best I have ever been. 

But I remembered how happy I make my friends and how whenever I skip they miss me and they’re bored. Maybe its a lie but I can’t help but hesitate. 

And my parents just don’t understand the need to do online school. I’ve explained to them time and time again and have constantly brought it up but they literally don’t care.

My cat, who’s my best friend, will eventually be gone and that thought alone is enough to ruin any good day I’m having.
I go to church, I’m a Christian, and I’m told all of the time to “trust in the Lord” and “He will take care of you” and “you’re never truly alone if you have Jesus.” I just get tired of that narrative, because in reality we truly are relying on the kindness of humans to get us through life and to take care of us. I get tired of my family and church members telling me that stuff because while I am a born-again Christian, I feel like it is so unrealistic and irresponsible to just expect God to take care of everything.

261,"So I should start off by saying how I first met this guy. I go to college and, until last week, I lived about a mile away from school. I don't have a car so I either walk or bike everywhere I go. I used to just walk everywhere until this guy showed up. 

So on the way from my old apartment to school I crossed over a hill with some woods, then train tracks, behind a strip mall and then across an intersection. 

The first time I met this guy was behind the strip mall, which should have been a red flag but I guess not. It felt awkward to just walk next to him and not say anything, so I said hello. We start talking and he's going to a bus stop near campus. He said he needed a bus fare so I gave him some change I had. We talked more and I learned his name is David and he's from NJ and moved to my city ~5 years ago. When I asked why he moved he said he was ""getting into too much trouble there"". Another red flag I know... 

Well he walked with me to the bus stop for the on campus shuttles and just waited there. I originally thought he was going to get on the shuttle because you don't have to prove you're a student to ride them. But when the bus showed up he suddenly hugged me and left. I was kinda weirded out but didn't think much of it until later. 

The next time I saw him was when he was sleeping behind the strip mall early one morning. This is when I realized he was probably homeless or something. 

After that was when a major red flag popped up for me. I was walking home one day and saw some person sitting in the bushes up the railroad tracks a little ways. I was confused but thought maybe it was someone who lived in my neighborhood. A couple days after that he waved at me and said something I didn't understand because he was too far away. Then the next day, I heard my name and realized it was the same guy. At this point I'm really freaked out, because he's been basically living behind my house for a week or so. I told my roommate and she said I should call the police. I didn't want potentially be hurting a homeless man who just happened to be living in the area, so I just started riding my bike along a major road instead. 

Then he showed up again about a week after I started riding my bike. On my bike I ride near a city bus stop and as I ride by I see him sitting on the bench. I should note, every time I see him, he says ""Hey (my name)! "" in this really sing songy voice like a taunt almost. Its getting more and more creepy to me.

I saw him several other times at the bus stop while riding at different times of the day. Probably almost every other day if not every day.

I moved recently due to my lease being up and the new place I live is much further down the major road and closer to the entrance to campus. I hadn't seen him since I moved there and was glad. 

Last night I saw him again, but this time, on the other side of campus when I was getting off of work and onto the campus shuttle. I put my bike on the bus and get on then hear him call to me. I'm in my work uniform so now he knows where I work... He tries to talk some with me but I mostly stay on my phone.. 

I was really freaked out about this because I'm usually the last one to leave work and its really dark out there. It is by a busy road, but its surrounded by forest so its in this little pocket where someone wouldn't see anything. 

The big dilemma I'm having is that I don't know if its just coincidence that I keep seeing him or if he's just some homeless/ really poor guy who uses the campus shuttles to travel easily. But either way its starting to really freak me out and I don't know what to do about it... Sorry for the long post.",09Nov2018,1

Some disclaimers:

1. All the names have been changed. 
2. There are many problems within this group, one of which is why the fuck these girls keeps hanging out with him. But they are not close friends of mine, so let's not bother to comment on other situations other than the question, even if there's a loooot to talk about.
3. It hurts to think of a friend I've known for literally ten years in this way, just wanted to say this.

All right, I want to talk about this very carefully because these are very grave accusations. Let me give you some context.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been in a jumpy relationship with a girl, let's name her Maria, for many years: we were together for two and a half years, broke up for two, got back together for another two and we broke up again on January 1st 2017 (this relationship is worthy of its own post but anyways).   


I've known the friend in question since high-school, same as Maria, and let's call him David.   
The first time me and Maria broke up, David followed her in her new group of friends, we were all friends with each other, me, Maria, David and others, he ""simply"" choose to lean more on her side when we first broke up.  
Of course my male brain thought that David wanted to get intimate with Maria, but through those first two years when me and Maria were not together he acted simply as one of her friends.  


Some more context on David: to this day, he doesn't have any experience with girls, he's actually good looking but veeeeeery clumsy around girls. He must have had some kisses, maybe received a handjob but nothing else. My personal opinion is that he sees in Maria and other girls that he ends up as friend (even when he tries to have a relationship with them) his only contact with the female world, even if he never gets to do something with those girl, due to shyness or whatever. Again, this is my personal opinion.  


* All right, let's get to the first the first creepy incident that I know of.   
Me and Maria got back together since 2015 to January 1st 2017. In summer 2017 Maria, David and other friends of her made a trip to Asia. Even if broken up, me and Maria were still talking. When they got back she told me that one morning she felt something touching her in the crotch area, she woke up to David and he said ""I was just waking you up"". Since they have known each other for years, she convinced herself that she had just misinterpreted his action. The next day she wanted to be sure that David was doing something creepy, so she covered her legs with a towel. In the morning, again, David was standing beside her, she felt the towel moving and some touching on her pants. She jumped up asking ""What the fuck are you doing?"" and he literally ran away, closing himself in the bathroom.  
They never talked about the incident, she begged me to never mention it, but be sure, my blood is still boiling about this.  

* The second incident, that I just discovered yesterday evening. Years ago, before 2017, we used to have high-school parties at Maria's house. A girlfriend of ours, name Juliet, was invited many times. Juliet told me that one night, at one of this party, she found herself sleeping in the bed with David and another friend. Before continuing let me be clear, these parties were not sexual in any way, I know what you may think, but there were a lot of people sleeping at Maria's place and nothing ever happened, expect the usual couples kissing.   
Well, just yesterday Juliet recalled that in the night, David started touching her legs, moving up to her butt thinking she was sleeping. She moved, he stopped.

Now, me, Maria, Juliet were talking about David yesterday. The girls told me that he always has a touchy behavior with them, always asking for hugs and kisses on the cheek. Juliet also told me of an episode where he was touching her leg under a table at wich they were sitting, moving his hand up until she had to just scream STOP IT.

Ok, I'm open to answer questions, but you have the basics of what happened. At the moment, these actions felt very wrong, but not really concerning. Taken together, and adding all the weird behavior and the now constant talks about porn and stuff (in very out of place context) coming from David, to me they paint a very chilling scene.   
We are thinking about what to do, as a group, if we should try to talk to him or doing something else, but I am personally really lost.   


Thank you for your time.

And we've been very open, I feel that we can ask each other anything. However, we haven't met in real life yet, we just talk on Snapchat.

Anyway, last night, we asked eachother some half-sexual questions, (keep in mind she has a boyfriend). It started when she asked if I watch porn. Not too sexual, more things that 15 year old boys and girls would ask eachother, but only if they're close.

She was asking more sexual stuff than I was, I was afraid of it being weird at the start. That was all fine, and it was an interesting experience, and that we now know eachother more.


But tonight, she asked a question again. And she started strong. She asked ""would you have sex right now if someone wanted to?"" 

Now, I had promised her and myself that I would tell the truth with all questions, because this was a friendship that was *very* open.

I said something along the lines of ""honestly, I would. Provided I know the other person and actually like her."" 

Then she hit me with this.

""What if it was me?""


Now to me, that seemed pretty suggestive.
So I said something along the lines of ""well, I like you and we are good friends, so I wouldn't *refuse* it, y'know?""

She replied back, ""you like me?"". 

I told her that I didnt mean ""like"" like, not get at least 🙃, because we dont know eachother enough yet imo.

She then says, ""yeah and I have a bf""

I suddenly realise that I probably read the situation wrong if she's pulling out the ""I have a bf"" card. 

I says ofc and all that.

But she didn't even open that last snap. It's still not open and I think she went to bed.

What should I do?

276,"I’ve been sitting beside this really cute guy I’ve known for 3 years, we’ve never talked after class or met after school. It was always like a mainly classmates thing. 

Anyway I get these random impulses to like touch his hair or hand, and I chalked it up to just me being attracted to him and nothing more. I thought when you liked someone your heart beat really really fast for them and I haven’t felt anything akin to that. But whenever I see him I want to look my best and make sure I’m chewing gum for my breath. 

He’s dating someone else so I just need a stern talking to about not to pursue him. And he’s definitely the closest guy friend I’ve ever had. And the hottest. 

But yah back to my main question, how do you ‘really’ know when you like someone? If it’s not too much your own personal experiences with liking someone would really help!",09Nov2018,1

285,"Two  weeks ago I (40M) ,my wife (36F) and two kids (7F &amp; 5M) got  2 kittens who are now 12 weeks old.  The kids, who are terrified of dogs, were really keen to have pets and we figured that having pets might help with their fears of dogs also.  My wife and I have never had cats before but we went to see some kittens and got the kids a kitten each (they are brothers).   We thought two would be nice as we are all out at work for most of the day so they can play with each other.

 

In the 2 weeks we have had them the kids do sometimes stroke and play with the kittens and will even have them on their laps (on a pillow) sometimes too.

 

I just have a feeling deep down that none of us are really enjoying their company as much as we should be.  It makes me feel a bit sick inside (I feel like this now but when I get home and see the little things I will probably feel fine). 

 

I notice that the kids and wife seem very nervous when they are hanging around.  The kids are very worried about getting scratched and the wife is worried about getting scratched and having her clothes pulled. 

 

Although I have no sense of smell my wife complains about the smell of the cats and their poos and wees too. 

 

My son spends a lot of time up on the tables so he is not disturbed by them.  I feel like he doesn’t have the freedom that he used to.

 

The cats live downstairs which is an open plan space.  We find that they pester us while we are eating our tea which really puts the kids and wife off. 

 

On  Monday daytime I was feeling sad and sick inside and adamant that I wanted to find a new home for them.  I was certain that we should do this but when I got home and saw them I felt like I need to give them a chance and they should stay.  Now its Friday and ive been feeling fine about it all week until last night when my wife was not happy getting petered while she was having her tea and again not happy while one was trying to climb her legs.   Today I just don’t know what to do. 

 

The options I can see are :-

*Put up with all these things, hope we get used to them or it improves

*Find them a new home quickly before while they are still more desirable as kittens and before we get too attached. I think the kids may be a little upset but would also

 

Has anyone else had similar experiences upon getting kittens ?  Is it normal to feel like this ?

286,"Going out to eat with a friend tonight and it occurred to me that it might be a nice thing to pay for it all. He is still in college and gets paid close  to minimum wage at his part time job, while I have a professional job and decent salary. But I don't want him to think I'm looking down on him or something.

My other concern is that if I pay, he might think it is a date. He confessed recently that he ""used to"" have a crush on me but ignored it because I was married,  but I have recently become not married. Hence why he might interpret it as a date.

Should I abandon the idea even though it might be nice to avoid these complications?",09Nov2018,1
287,"Backstory: I’m in college right now and I would always see this girl in the dining hall. Every time I saw her I would think to myself that she was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. One day when I was out at class my friend saw her and basically tried to set me up on a date with her. After that we started to become friends and I realized how much in common I have with her. Every once and a while, we will do something to hang out like watch a movie or go get food. All these times that I have been with friends they always tell me how much she just looks at me when I’m sitting there or at movies how she moves closer to me when they aren’t in the room. But at the same time I get mixed signals kinda like she doesn’t like me as well.

The other day: So I was just hanging out in my room not doing anything in particular and asked if she wanted to come over and play some video games. She said sure and headed over. The first thing she kinda said to me when she got over was how all these other guys were trying to hang out with her and that they were really annoying, etc. But the way she said it was almost like she wanted me to get mad about it.

Later, while I we were playing games she kinda said she was bored so I offered that we could watch a movie or get food, but she didn’t want to do either one. Once my roommate left the room she kinda moved in closer to me until he came back. She then said she was bored and just wanted to go back to her room to play Skyrim or something.

At this point I just kept thinking how horrible this was going so when she got up to leave I didn’t really know what to do. She started lingering at the doorway of my room saying that she was gonna head back to her room. I said goodbye to her as she left and then she went back to her room.

1 hour later: My friend was walking back up to the room and said he saw her in the lounge of our building playing some game with 3 other guys I had never seen before. Now all I could think about was everything that went bad.

My friends all told me that she was waiting for me to take her back to her room that way once we got there she could invite me in so we would be alone and could talk without them being there... I feel like at this point I have already messed up so many times that she is just getting tired of waiting for me to make a move if she even likes me the same I do. I don’t know if I should just ask her out on a 1-on-1 date or if that door has closed...",09Nov2018,1

289," 

I'm currently studying music production at university. I am also running a part time job along side that. I have recently been finding myself skipping lectures at uni due to lack of interest in what i'm studying, and this has lead to me becoming less and less inspired to write and engage with music in my personal life, which I have loved doing before now. I have uni 3 days a week and then work 3 or 4 days for the rest of the week. I also have a girlfriend who I have been with for nearly 3 years and who I am very much in love with, but who lives a couple of hours away from me on the train.

Today I called in sick to work to spend time with her because I haven't called in sick so far at this job so I thought it'd be okay to do just once.

I am now considering a few things in my life.

Should I continue my degree for another year and a half despite seeming to enjoy it less and less each week?

Should I tell my manager at work about how overwhelmed with commitments I've been feeling lately, and tell her that this was really the reason I stayed off today when I return to work tomorrow.

I am currently considering dropping university and working full time at my job, which I thoroughly enjoy, and focusing on work experience as a means to progress my life further. But I am finding it difficult to convince myself that it would be the right thing to do.

I have been overwhelmed with guilt today for staying off of work, and I just don't know who to turn to for advice. My parents will just get pissed off at me for skipping work, and my mum told me previously that dropping out would be a waste of money, which I didn't find particularly helpful. My dad is not good with advice and will probably get angry at me.

290,"I (16M) started highschool about 4 months ago. One of the guys (let's call him Chad) who used to be in the same class as me in my previous school often visits my highschool to greet his girlfriend who also studies there. They often deliberately hug, nuzzle and perform other intimate actions in front of me, which makes me feel pathetic, as I have no friends, no hope of ever getting a girlfriend and horrific social anxiety.

Today I met two girls on the bus, who used to go to the same school as me and Chad. We reminisced about old times for a bit and talked about our current situations. One of them asked me if I'd seen any of the old classmates, to which I responded by telling them about how Chad occasionally visits his girlfriend at my highschool. They then told me that Chad had another girlfriend in the school they go to, who he also visits on occasion. They decided to tell this girl about Chad's cheating. I wasn't even aware that Chad was cheating on his girlfriend, as I'm a shut-in introvert with no social life, but I accidentally exposed Chad's endeavour to cheat on his girlfriend(s). I'm glad that he is being exposed and that he is receiving his well earned retribution, yet I'm afraid of the backlash I may receive from him for ruining his plan. 

Chad has always been very nice to me, and he always treated me in a friendly, respectful manner. He always says hello to me whenever I see him. I'm afraid he may hate me now.

One of the girls I talked to on the bus now gave one of Chad's girlfriends my contact info, so that they can message me, and interview me about what I witnessed. 

How do I deal with this? Even regular social interactions have always been a mystery to me, so I have no clue on what I should be doing. I will try my best to stand up against Chad if he confronts me, as he is guilty of making morally wrong decisions, but I don't know how I should do it.

292,"Long story short, I’m an instructional designer on a small team (we create the elearnings such as sexual harassment in the workplace, interactive trainings to teach the company platform,etc etc) and we recently lost our long term graphic designer, leaving us with only one and it has really screwed the entire team. 

Due to the ongoing hiring freeze and small budget we won’t be able to hire another GD until mid-next year, which is why I was approached by my boss to see if I would be willing to get trained to assist our remaining GD with the potential to become one down the line. 

I’m an extremely driven and creative person who accepted the challenge and think I can dive in and hopefully start the process of learning graphic design. I’m adept in photoshop and Lightroom but none of the other CC content. On the side of an Amateur  photographer so I have a creative eye and have always been artsy. 

Our current GD uses photoshop and illustrator only for the work on our team. So here’s my game place, 

1. To get up and running as quickly as possible with assisting her I need to become adept at illustrator. We have Lynda (training website) available to us and I have made a large list of all things illustrator and graphic design. 

My boss told me if I get this proposal approved my entire work load would be training. So 8 hours a day learning the skills to become a GD 

I have about 80hr of training material just in illustrator for step 1. I think if I can get my skills up to par I can at least help build out her designs. 

2. Take more Lynda courses on just graphic design principles. There were a couple that were basic and could start my understanding of design to a greater depth

3. When my GD has time shadow her. Learn how she works with the team and her best practices. 

4. Outside reading and mini projects. I have a list of mini projects that will sharpen my skills in vector graphics and iconography, the two big types of graphics we build on the team for projects. I also have a few books that everyone online recommends. 

My question to you all is well do you think it’s possible? The marketing department laughed in my boss’s face when he told them he wanted me to be trained to assist. They said unless I went to school I’d never be a GD. But I feel with enough time and practice I can be set. Might not be a graphic designer as my career but I can at least have it as a notch in my belt. 

My second question is, is there anything else you’d add to my game place to bolster my learning regiment? I think my main goal at first is to master illustrator then learn the principles since I won’t be on my own for a long long long time design things. 

Thank you all in advance! 

TL;DR boss wants me trained as a GD when I have no GD training. Any practical advice on mastering illustrator then learning design principles greatly appreciated!!",09Nov2018,1
293,"Two years ago I started attending therapy as I had been experiencing a lot of issues with anxiety as well as depression (what I thought was, I'm not too sure anymore). I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder by the first therapist I visited. After a few visits I didnt feel fully comfortable disclosing details of my self harm and other things I had experienced, so I decided to find a new therapist, and keep looking until I found one while also trying to push myself to be more open. 

The next therapist I went to I felt much better with, was able to open up to and discuss many sensitive issues I never had before. She taught me how to control my anxious thoughts and made me feel much better about myself and my anxiety slowly disappeared. So much so in fact that over the past year, I have only felt anxious once, when I had an irrational fear that my long term partner was going to leave me, but I used her techniques and was able to dispel the thought completely in my mind and not even have to share it with my SO.

This sounds peachy and I'm not complaining, but it has had such a dramatic change on who I am, and has made me feel more numb than anything, which I have absolutely no qualms with. I dont feel extreme emotions anymore, I can't remember the last time I felt a tinge of anger, annoyance, I never overreact, someone could be berating myself and my family to my face and i would not give a single fuck, as I really dont see the point in getting angry anymore, or any emotion really, any more. I realize this sounds so incredibly edgy, but it doesn't manifest itself in a ""I dont give a fuck about anybody!!!"" Sort of way, I still want to have relationships with people and go out of my way to be as kind to everybody as I possibly can, but it feels like it allows me to examine every situation I encounter rationally, without my emotions getting in the way of me making decisions.

I also realize this sounds cold and heartless almost, but I can artificially place emotions into my decisions and rational thoughts, I can still read people's emotions and I am far from an evil person; in fact making people happy and comfortable is one thing I enjoy, as I know how crippling anxiety and social pressures can be. I'm very perceptive and generally people have told me I am very easy to confide in and talk to, because they can tell I am trustworthy and as well I'm good at saying what people want to hear (having a suicidal best friend for 2 years straight, with countless hours long phone calls really helped me develop that skill)

I am also completely okay with whatever direction my life heads, I don't have any crazy aspirations but I would like to have enough money to support myself and have money to travel/do things I like. I dont have specific dreams to have children but I do love children, and if my SO in the future wants to have a family, I will gladly raise, nurture and give as much love to my children as any other dad. 

All this being said; I have quite the interest in psychoactive drugs, specifically of the dissociative and psychadelic class. I have experimented over the past year, since my anxiety has passed, with a small amount of drugs, namely DXM 3 times, LSA twice, I smoke weed probably once a week, sometimes more, as well as shrooms, bromo-dragonfly, and changa once, and MDMA twice. I have had nothing but positive experiences with all of the aforementioned drugs. I enjoy drugs because I truly believe they allow me to explore my psyche and think about things about myself I never have before.

I am also a pretty big drug nerd, and practice extreme harm reduction (of course i am still taking a risk by consuming them, I'm not naïve in that sense) and do a lot of research before consuming anything. That being said, I am completely open to trying any drug that piques my interest after I have done my research. That being said, I have no interest in opioids or benzodiazepines, as I dont feel anxious anymore and opioids seem relatively boring. 

I wrote way fucking more than expected. I dont even know if this is the right place to post this, but I have two questions really.

1. Where should I post this humongous wall of text to get an answer to question 2?

2. Why does my life feel too good to be true at the moment? Do I have my head in the clouds?

TL;DR: I dont feel extreme emotions, am perceptive of other people's emotions, approach everything rationally, am okay wherever my life goes, what gives? Do I need a reality check?",09Nov2018,1
294,"I got a new job with amazing benefits, salary, and some awesome perks, but I am frustrated with the human element of the job.  I joined an office where a lot of employees have been there for a while and have created a tight knit group. For the first week, they invited me out to lunch but no longer do so (I am now 5 months in). I ask them every day to include me when they are going to lunch so I can join them, and they will always call each other and just bypass me. In the rare event that I catch them at lunch and they ""allow"" me to sit at their table, they will get up and get something for themselves and the others but ignore me, and treat me like I am not even there (e.g there are four of us at the table yet only three cokes are brought back, the cokes are free and supplied by the office so it would cost them nothing to grab just one more for me). There is also a peer in that niche who I assume doesn't like me because it seems that they go out of their way to make my life miserable by micromanaging me and even tattles on me to the manager every time I make a ""mistake"". In one instance, the ""mistake"" I made was in taking a break, and they ran and told the manager that I must not have enough to do because I have enough time to take a break. Or I once had a lull in work, so I kept myself busy by taking care of a task that the office secretary normally takes care of. Since the secretary was swamped, the task was directly related to my job, and the secretary was grateful for the help, I decided to help out and complete the task. I was chastised by my peer ""as doing someone else's job"" and that surely, ""if they were swamped thus I must be swamped"" then I had no business ""helping out"". The peer went straight to the manager, who then chastised me again for a second time for my actions. I considered that my actions were not only an act of kindness but was also the professionally responsible action to do instead of ""stealing company time by sitting around doing nothing"". (BTW, this is being typed on my own lunch time as I was not invited yet again to go out to lunch).

The manager can be an overbearing self-proclaimed ""mama bear"" who treats me (F29) as a child. Even though I have been in this profession for a while, I am comfortable in the knowledge that yes, I am new to the firm and inexperienced with the way things are run, but no, I am not ignorant. The manager hounds me to an obsessive degree to ask questions and that I must ask at least 5 questions a day. When I make a mistake, she throws at me the ""Well, if you asked questions this wouldn't happen"" or ""That could have been one of your five questions"" even though these are mistake in which no amount of questions would prepare me for, as I would have to have foresight of the problem to ask the question, yet only know the mistake was a problem way after the fact. I feel like I can't go to her with my problems, because every time I do, she defends the offensive person and lays any and all blame for the bullying on me stating that ""they are just looking out for you"" or "" they are taking time out of their day to guide you and let me know you are struggling"". I am not struggling, the peer is too damn nosy, and because the manager ""knows"" the real personality of the peer, they couldn't possibly act that way, so I must be the one who is bringing these problems onto myself. 

I have no one to turn to when I feel like I am being bullied by my peer or belittled by my manager. 

I love the job, the salary and the benefits, but I hate feeling like I am emotionally backed into a corner. I don't want to quit or become a defensive peer who imposes self-alienation to avoid being emotionally marooned or mutanied. What do I do? How do I handle my passive-aggressive, peer? How can I be treated and respected as an adult by my manager?

295,"I’ve been working here since March 2018. I liked it a lot at first. Good hours (M-F 9AM - 5PM) no weekends. Small, close knit employees. Easy-ish job where I can sit (I have hip and joint issues, so sitting is a must) 

I’ve been having a hard time the last few months I’ve been here. My boss has increased the amount of racist comments, sexual comments, and predatory comments lately. I’ve told him on more than one occasion that it’s not okay, but he continues to do it. And then “pokes fun” at me when other co-workers are around. Saying things like, “I can’t say what I want to say, because I don’t want to offend certain people here.” Which is completely directed at me. He’s bragged about sexually harassing random women on the street. He continually tries to impress and flirts with the 18 + 19 year old interns here (He’s married and in his mid 40’s) this really rubs me the wrong way, but it is what it is.

My boss is unreliable, and leaves me to get yelled at by customers, while he says there is nothing he can do about it. He leaves early multiple times a week and leaves me with a big plate of work that I pull my hair out over. I stress out over my time off, because I have doctor’s appointments for my pregnancy (I’m considered somewhat high risk) My work does not have unpaid time off and we can only use sick/vacation days to miss work. My boss is salary, and makes excuses for why he can’t be at work constantly.

I’m four months pregnant. He still expects me to carry equipment and stress myself out every day. And I’m honestly concerned for my health and the health of my growing child. I had a hemorrhage in early pregnancy, and I had a 50% chance of miscarrying. Luckily I did not, but that left me being anxious over every single thing I do here at work. 

He has HR wrapped around his finger. I don’t know if HR would even do anything, and I don’t know if I have a solid case to bring them or not. Even if he was fired, that would leave me with even more work and I’m trying to keep my stress low.

I’ve been thinking about looking for a new job, but I’m four months pregnant and I just started showing. I fear I won’t get hired. And even if I do, I won’t be covered by FMLA at a new job by the time I have my baby, so there’s a chance I won’t have a job when it’s time to return to work. So I’m very wary about looking for some place different. 

But at the same time, I’m worried about my mental state being here. I’ve been increasingly depressed and anxious. So anxious I’ve had to call out a few times, because the thought of being here sends me into an anxiety attack. I cry every single day before work, at work, and after work, because I hate it here so much. 

I don’t know if my spouse and I would be able to afford me not working, so I don’t know if not working is an option anyways, although it would be ideal. 

I’m stuck. I don’t know what to do. And I feel like I can’t win in this situation. ",09Nov2018,1

What I need from you all is just a way to take my mind away from it. I haven't eaten in almost 24 hours and I can't sleep. I have a lot of anxiety I think. My hands are trembling. 

Honestly I would love to have a child. I just wish it was different. This chick was so great and sweet how she was honest about this guy. I really admire the way she handled it.  She is less nervous than me and I am really trying to be as sweet as possible back to her. But meanwhile I am losing my cool. I haven't cried in years and I just can't stop.

If I ever opened up about them, I would surely be ostracized or even bullied by my peers, but it's well-deserved for people like me. My therapist would probably get me sent to a mental hospital lmao.

When you do the things I've done, you keep animals away from me, children, and you cut off all contact. I used to have a heavy guilt about everything and it's mostly gone now, but I can't love myself fully because I feel like it's enabling the things. If someone did what I did, they're supposed to suffer a consequence or something. But I ""got away with it"" and all I'm left with is dumb emotions.

I did a lot of embarrassing stuff in my first year of highschool but the next year I moved to a new place, changed my appearance, and started over. I had a crush on a guy and he was the first crush I was ever friends with. I opened up to him about a couple of the things I've done, in sort of subtle ways, and he had a very disgusted reaction to it. I don't know why I did, but I did.

I’ve been living with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now and have been doing most of the household chores. He has cleaned the shower twice since we have been living together, both times weren’t exactly clean. I cook for a living and come home to cook dinner and do chores. I work around 40 hours a week, and he works as a mechanic 50 hours a week. This has been on going battle to try to split chores. He does his own laundry (not including shared towels and such from both of us) and occasionally cuts the grass. I know I’m more of a neat freak and want things cleaned thoroughly but whenever I ask him to do something he says he can’t do it right so he doesn’t do it all. I know there is always 3 sides to a story, but when you go to clean the shower and there are still mold spots and hair in it I’m sorry but that’s still not clean. I’ve told him that he can still at least vacuum or dust, things you pretty much can’t do wrong. And he still doesn’t do any of it. On the weekends it’s his time, Saturday’s include doing stuff for other people or working out in the garage, and Sunday’s include doing absolutely nothing with a side of his laundry. I don’t know how to approach this any differently.. I’ve talked, I’ve nagged, I’ve yelled and I’ve gone silent. My usual work week includes doing our healthy food prep since I’ve been trying to make us healthier and lose some weight, so that means I grocery shop a few times a week, cook dinner every day or prep for a few days, cleaning the bathroom, cleaning the kitchen, dishes, shared laundry, vacuuming, picking up, you name it..

312,"Hello everyone. So, my crush and I are sort of in a complicated situation, he says he likes me but due to problems that happened in the past, he doesn't want to have a relationship with me and he tries to avoid romantic contact. We have already kissed and I have already confessed to him, but he has told me that he prefers to wait in order to sort things out.

Not only is he my crush, he is also my friend, so for the last couple of weeks we have maintained that friendship. However, it hurts me that I need to hide my emotions around him even tho he already knows what they are. He frequently compares me to his brother, which gives me this idea that perhaps he might not be interested in the least despite him kissing me and saying that he likes me.

So, because I don't know if my waiting will actually result in a relationship, I have a decided to have a serious chat with him in a couple of hours in order to sort everything out, whether I should do my best to move on, or actually wait for him. However, I have a sensation that it won't end up positively and that I am just going to get my heart broken. All of my experiences with romance always end up with the person either not corresponding or not loving me as much as I love them so I don't feel any more optimistic about this situation.

So about an hour ago, the dude claimed to have ingested some sort of poison. Sent badly pictured images and stuff about how it tasted bad but it’s ok because he’s not feeling bad anymore. It was sent to a small discord server with 6 members, with only me actually knowing the person irl.  There, was a chance he could be faking, but I took it seriously and called for help. I obtained the dudes moms phone number by calling his little brother. He kept asking why I needed his moms phone but I told him it was important and that I couldn’t answer. 
My brother called some sort of help line? It wasn’t the police, but i’m pretty sure they work with the police. He was calling while I was trying to get the dudes moms phone number. My brother gave the phone later to talk to the operator to give some details. I gave the mom’s phone number and my own, and explained the situation. 

My mom then called the mother to talk to her a few minutes later (which could have interrupted the help line’s phone) and when she picked up there was a guy talking in the phone in the background, which we assume was the operator. 
When this happened, the dudes little brother called back and so I left mom alone, and he asked me again why I needed his moms phone number. I told him I was coming to his house soon and that I still couldn’t really tell him. He then revealed that he was home alone with his little brother and sister, and apparently the dude who was attempting to overdose was at a mall.This gave me the impression that he might be faking, but nonetheless I hung up and told mom that there’s no point to visiting because he wasn’t at home.

Later calls revealed that the dude wasn’t with his mom despite being in the mall, the mom said he was with a friend outside or smth. The help line called me back and told he he contacted the mother and thanked me for calling. That’s the story so far.

To get to the point:

Roommate works a 9-5 and then goes out with friends or with their s/o, and doesn't come home until they have to get ready for work the next day. They have a working breed dog that needs mental and physical stimulation and the dog does not get any. The only exercise the dog gets is in the backyard with the other dogs. The dog digs holes under fences, has chewed on the walls, and ripped holes in the furniture. Roommate doesn't take the dog out and we hate taking the dog out because it barks at everything and everyone, pulls on leash and has no manners.  Roommate also does not pick up after the dog in the backyard unless they are told to. We are adults and I shouldn't have to remind them of stuff like that. If they don't come home for the day, they ask our other roommate to feed the dog, but our other roommate is to the point where they don't want to. Roommate also leaves the dog in their room for extended periods of time and obviously relies on us to take the dog out to the bathroom. The dog has had infections and open wounds and roommate refused to take the dog to the vet even after both of us had suggested it.

The other night I had a dream about a guy I’m friends with. We’ll call him Gary. I told my dream to my boyfriend and at first he thought it was funny.

“How would you feel if I told you I had a dream about a girl and all of a sudden I started talking about her then brought up the fact that I had plans with her?”

“I wouldn’t flip out over it. If you had a dream about her and told me then it’s fine. The girl would still be on your mind because you had a dream about her and I told you I had plans with him and my brother beforehand.”

323,"So, I'm about to graduate college with a degree in Computer Science and I just feel lost and unmotivated. I've got an ok job lined up, which I'm grateful for, but I don't really feel the motivation or excitement to jumpstart my career. Don't get me wrong- I do enjoy computer science and working with software- but I feel like working to get up the corporate ladder isn't something that really appeals to me. I also have considered attempting to start a company, but that doesn't seem appealing to me either because it seems like it would require a high tolerance for stress, which I just don't have. 

I think the issue lies in the fact that I don't know what fulfills me as a person. People ask me ""if you could be/do anything, what would it be?"" and I just have no answer for it. I used to want things like starting a company, making enough money to indulge in certain luxuries, traveling the world, etc. but now even thinking of those things doesn't get me excited. A good way to sum up the paradox going on in my head: the only way to produce something fulfilling is to work hard at it, but what's the point in working so hard and stressing yourself out for something in a life that's temporary, because eventually none of it will matter?

I find it hard to discuss this with family/friends because sometimes it gets morbid and sours the mood, and the only counseling I can afford is the free service at my university, which hasn't been super efficient or helpful (not their fault- they're understaffed and overloaded with students). It doesn't make it easier to see peers in my program excited and proud to work for amazing software companies like Google or Facebook, or getting into graduate programs, where I've been unable to achieve the same thanks to my lack of motivation and the whole weird paradox I mentioned I've got going on. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, but I definitely need some guidance, and it feels like the internet is the only resource I have at the moment.

325,"My older brother and his wife have a 2-year-old son, who is generally a happy kid, and I love him to bits.  My brother works M-F office job and his wife is a SAHM.  This is their 1st kid so obviously there are some 1st time parent hurdles to overcome.  There are just certain things with my nephew that I've observed through these 2+ years that concern me, but since I'm not a parent (yet, I'm due next year) I don't really feel like I understand how to raise a kid, or should have any advice or say in how they raise their son.  

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone either let me know what can be done to help or how to bring this up to my brother respectfully?  Or better yet, put my fears to rest and tell me I'm overreacting to normal 2-year-old behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

* My nephew has very little to no social interactions with other kids.  My brother and his wife share 1 car, so when my brother's at work, his wife and son are more or less stuck at home.  They spend all day together.  I don't know if she takes the time to go to the park with him or anything that would involve other children.  Judging by his constant need to be with mommy... I don't think so.  I remember one instance of him interacting with another kid in a bookstore.  He was playing with a train set.  A little girl came up and was playing with another train using the same tracks.  He almost immediately got up and walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

* My nephew has serious attachment issues when it comes to mommy.  If mommy goes into the other room and closes the door, immediate crying.  If mommy gets up from the dinner table to get a glass of water, immediate crying.  If mommy is not within eyesight, I swear the kid's world falls apart.  This is one thing that I think might be normal for a 2-year old?  Especially one who has a SAHM.  I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

* Most 2-year-olds I know are into Paw Patrol or Peppa Pig or Sesame Street... Something with characters who talk and teach and relate.  My nephew likes clocks.  And ceiling fans.  Whenever he comes over to my house, he wants to go into my office and stare at the ceiling fan.  When we are having dinner, he gets impatient, tries to get out of his chair, and tells us he wants to ""see fan!""  When he sees a clock, he gets super excited and points at it and yells ""COCK!"" (he can't quite pronounce it yet, and it's cute, but still...)  When we eat out at restaurants, they don't bring a small toy for him.  They pull out their phone and have **A YOUTUBE PLAYLIST OF CEILING FANS**.

&amp;#x200B;

* When we go out to eat, again, they don't bring a small toy or something for him to play with or have an activity to keep him busy until the food arrives.  The plates, cups, and utensils on the table are his toys.  They'll put a small piece of food on the plate for him to push around with a fork.  They'll put an ice cube in an empty cup for him to rattle around.  They'll give him chopsticks for him to bang on the table like drums.  Luckily, this as subsided a bit now that they have their YOUTUBE PLAYLIST OF CEILING FANS to keep him occupied.  But even so, I honestly think he sees utensils and dinnerware as toys, and that really worries me.

&amp;#x200B;

* For my nephew's 1st birthday, my husband and I got him some outdoor toys - kid-sized basketball hoop with balls and a slide.  For the holidays that year, we got him a push-tricycle (he wouldn't have to pedal, but it can grow with him, they can add pedals on, and when he's old enough they can convert it into an actual tricycle).  When his 2nd birthday rolled around, I saw that he had A LOT of toys piled up at the house, and he really wasn't playing with most of them since they weren't clocks or ceiling fan-related.  I decided to ask my brother if he and his wife needed anything for nephew.  He couldn't think of anything.  I asked if there were any essentials they were missing or they wish they could have.  He couldn't think of anything.  So, judging from my experience with him at restaurants playing with utensils, asked him if he had any utensils or plates or dishes for nephew.  His response: ""Mom and dad have plenty of forks and plates and stuff.  It's not a big cake, and there's only going to be like 8 people around for his birthday.""  I had to clarify that I didn't mean for the cake for that one day, I meant for nephew to learn how to feed himself.  He seemed surprised and said ""Oh... yeah, that's good.  Get that.""  I don't think I've facepalmed harder than I did that day.

&amp;#x200B;

* I decided to get him kid-friendly utensils, bowls, plates, and spoutless sippy cups (to learn how to drink out of a normal cup).  I also got a booster seat because nephew's high chair broke and my brother is too cheap to get a new one (I had an argument with him about this, he doesn't want to spend money on something that will either break soon or nephew will grow out of soon.  I told him that he can get a used high chair or booster seat for $20 off Facebook or Craigslist, how the hell are you THAT cheap?).  It's been 5 months since they received these gifts, and mommy still feeds him every meal.  No kid utensils at the dinner table, home or out at restaurants.  Forks, spoons, chopsticks are toys, as always.

332,"I am a college senior who will be graduating in May with a MS in mathematics and minors in CS and statistics. I am nervous as hell about finding a job upon graduation because my labor has been getting less valuable with the education I have received. 

Before I graduated from HS, I had a job that paid minimum wage. Now, here I am 5 years later and I am making less than minimum wage (I am currently making about $4 below minimum wage). I have applied to higher paying jobs with no success. If the trend continues, I will be looking at making $6-8 less than minimum wage upon graduation, which is obviously going to be difficult to live on. 

I just feel like I am in a hopeless situation. I went to college hoping to increase the value of my labor, but as a fraction of minimum wage, my wages have had an inverse relationship with my educational attainment. I am worried about where my wage curve will ultimately converge. Any advice?",09Nov2018,1

337,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

 

I work with this beautiful blonde girl and we've been toying with the idea of dating. About 2 months ago we got drunk at a company party and ended up going back to my house and hooking up. We had some pillow talk and she ended up confessing how she's always wanted to be with me ever since she started working here. She told me she wished I would start dating people again and that I shouldn't be afraid to date (I had a bad breakup from a 5 year relationship and havent dated since). I told her that I just didn't want a relationship, that I liked her, but that I just wasn't able to commit to it.

Fast forward a week. We're talking/texting every day, so I ask her out for pizza, she says yes. Date night comes and something comes up on her end and she has to cancel last minute. This was my first red flag. I immediately took this to mean that I got ditched and which got me pissed because this was exactly the shit that I was trying to avoid by not dating. 

Fast forward a month. By now she's come over to my apartment twice since and we've hooked up both times, but have yet to go on a date. At this point I'm getting attached to the girl and have honest feelings for her, but I don't want to scare her with this since she ditched our first date (felt like I may have jumped the gun too soon).

Fast forward a week. Nothing has changed between us, no advancement in the relationship and no loss of ground in the relationship. We're talking A LOT, like any spare time we have we're talking. Suddenly on the Friday of that week she stops replying to my texts, which is strange. She doesn't return the text ever again. That Monday we see each other at work and she acts like nothings happened so I too act like nothing happened. She is however talking to me over Skype (our work's messaging app), but completely unresponsive outside of work.

Fast forward 2 weeks to now. She's still flirting with me **at work**, still talking to me **at work**, and just acting very comfortable around me in general, but we still hardly text. My main question is, what the do I do here? Is this her way of telling me that she's not feeling it and want's to keep it work related instead? I want to ask her these questions but I don't want to ruin any sort of work relationship we have since we're required to be involved with each other daily.

Sorry for the short novel.",09Nov2018,1
339,"I’m not only awful at the content within my major, i genuinely hate doing it when something goes wrong. I was a computer science major, I just switched to computer information systems a few days ago, but I’m still in my introductory coding class. I can’t figure out the simplest fucking thing, it would take me hours to complete most assignments if I didn’t give up when I usually do. I am terrible at it, and something always goes wrong that I can’t solve, which makes me hate it.

I keep thinking that I’ll hate computer information systems as well, because I can’t fucking stand this.

340,"So I’m getting my yearly evaluation at my job soon and I wanted to negotiate my raise.. I know what it’s going to be as this company has a base percent increase for everyone in the workplace.

The predetermined base raise is, what I feel, extremely low for what I do and my qualifications. I have a college education and hold two certifications, one of which this company had paid for, and the other is one that I had gotten right out of college and pertains to my field. The company doesn’t recognize my first certification as a factor in pay as it doesn’t specifically pertain to the exact field of their expertise, it was basically favorable but not required for the job. This is my first job in this field so I have 1 year of experience. There is only one person above me that only has a few more months of experience than I do. They can’t keep employees long term because they don’t pay them enough. I work in an administrative medical setting but I am required to work weekends and holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas (basically UNHEARD of in my field). 

Here is a snapshot of what I have done and contributed in the last year: 

- Co-trained new employees
- assist with accuracy and compliance
- came up with a large document that acts as a work companion to clarify situations and avoid confusion (worked on this on the clock and on my own time)
- putting in requests for learning and reference materials
- met with my supervisor (which has little background on what our department does, but that’s not their fault as the company doesn’t want to hire or promote anyone with a strong background) to educate them further on our departments duties
- reviewed my audit with said supervisor and self audited my work for them to compare, with me pointing out that this audit company has no idea what they are doing has helped them decide to not continue with said auditors
- attended meetings via phone when I was not working
- never had a problem to work overtime or assist other coworkers on the weekend
- fixing and trying to better newer employees work by providing education on common mistakes
- got my second certification

I’m sure there’s plenty of other things that I am missing at this point in time but these are the main ones.

I had done some research on people in my field that have the same amount of experience and with just one certification, and I’m getting paid $2 less an hour than what I should be. 

I want to make valid points and leave a solid impression that what I’m doing is above and beyond my duties (which they are as I have a copy of my work description). I’m not afraid to ask for more I am just not sure how to uphold a solid claim as this company isn’t afraid to say no. I want to stay with this company long term as I believe they hold good values and the people I work with are very nice, but at the end of the day I don’t want to short myself out on it. I don’t want to keep doing all of the extra things in addition to my basic duties without feeling appreciated or appropriately compensated for it..

any thoughts, suggestions, even counter-arguments that can help me prepare are very much appreciated!!",09Nov2018,1

343,"As the title says, I (18F) have a friend who is ""dating"" a 28 year old child. For the sake of the story i'll refer to my friend as H. 

H and I have been friends for a longggg time. Since we were in preschool but as time went on we began to grow apart. Now as seniors in high school we are once again semi close friends and will hang out sometimes with our friend group . In all of the years I've known her she has always had a seemingly low self esteem as she would throw herself at almost any guy who gave her attention regardless of who they were. 

 At the beginning of the school year she began to talk about this guy she met at work who was 25. My friends and I really didn't pay much attention to it because we thought that a 25 year old surely won't want to date or even hook up with a 17 year old. As time passed on we all started to forget about it until she says that they are ""dating"". At this point all of us were confused and questioned her extensively. It turns out the guy is actually 28 years old and initially she told him she was 20. He now knows she is 17, yet still continues to have a relationship with her. She has created a web of lies in order to maintain her relationship with him and has even gone as far as to leave her IPad at friends houses in order to trick her mom into thinking shes sleeping there when in reality she's at his house. My friends and I all were concerned about this, especially since where I live that is VERY illegal for a 17 and 28 year old to be sleeping together. We decided to let it be though since to us there really wasn't anything we could do about it. 

Now a couple days ago, my friends and I were hanging out with H. She begins to talk about her man and is just rambling about how she wants to marry him, and now not even go to college so she can be with him... She then begins to tell about how does sometimes show anger issues towards her. For example she accidentally hit him in the face and he reacted by pushing her to the ground and locking himself in his room. Upon hearing that my friends and I immediately started to tell her how wrong and fucked up that is and the situation is. This guy clearly has something wrong with him to continue to date a child. 

We are really concerned for H and want something to be done, but at the same time we don't know if it is our place or HOW we could do something. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Friend (17) is in a relationship with a 28 year old. This is very illegal where we live and the 28 year old clearly has issues. Myself and my other friends are concerned for H and are not sure how to proceed with the situation or what to do about it, if we even should do something. ",09Nov2018,1

She doesn't see it and seems really happy. She is already talking about moving in with him. But it is driving all of us crazy.

346,"I feel like I'm losing my freaking mind. I'm super stressed out and I feel like I'm just constantly being blamed for everything. 

Today, one of my coworkers just walked out after talking to my boss. Evidently, she told him that I do 5x more work than he does and I am covering his ass a lot of the time, probably trying to shame him into getting his shit together or something. 

So, he stormed in and started slamming stuff around and basically called me a two faced bitch and turned in his badge and left. He was on his cell phone talking about how he's done with people talking about him behind his back and lying about him as a person. 

So, that's a thing that happened today. I also get blamed for basically everything that goes wrong ask home. Someone's cat did something wrong? Must be my cat. There's just a lot of that. 

On top of the fact that I feel like no one other than me actually does anything unless I keep telling them to. That's kind of a work and home thing. 

And now I feel like I'm this giant bitch and it is actually my fault this person quit. 

I also feel like work expects me to just fix everything and keep it all together when we have one fewer person, someone else leaving and someone else coming in that doesn't want to be here. 

I don't know how to do what the company expects of me without pissing off other people, because they apparently just keep getting told I'm covering their ass even though I never say anything about it, I just help them and move on.

358,"This is really random but I am asking for advice because it is really stressing me out. 

I live in a country setting right out stide the city limits.  I have a neighbor who rented part of his property to someone for storage/horse grazing.  This person has a shipping container on the lot (I swear all this is important to the story). The piece of property the shipping container is on is  directly across from my carport and front door. 

The person who was renting the property decided to move on and sold the shipping container. 

This is where the problem lies.  The people he sold this too are not the most savory looking characters.  They decided to move this themselves but it seems they have NO idea what they are doing although they DO have a very large truck to do it with.  They have been coming over ever few days to work on it for the last two weeks.  At first they were showing up with the owner of the shipping container who I know and am comfortable with.  One night when it was late he asked to plug into my electricity to have some lights which I said okay too. Mind you I thought this was going to be DONE that night. 

So to save a lot of back story I will skip to Monday. I come home by myself (female mid 30's) at about 9 at night.  There are about 5 dudes just chilling, the owner no where to be seen. I notice they are plugged into my electricity and I can barely get in my driveway let alone my car port because of the huge truck. To make matters worst I get to my door and look over and on the other side of the truck only like 8 feet from where I am standing is another car I didn't notice because of the truck with another dude in it, just sitting there GRINNING at me.

I go inside. Call my boyfriend and ask him to hurry home because I am uncomfortable. 

Last night, I am getting ready for a rehearsal about 5 and notice there are people over there working again.... actually they were just standing around which is what they seem to be doing 99% of the see them.  I thought I saw the owner who I know and went over to see how much longer this was going to take and to let them know they were in my boyfriends way and he was due home soon.

Unfortunately the guy I know was not there after all and I find myself talking to 5 random guys that are all rough looking while they VERY obnoxiously check me out. I ask them if they are getting anywhere etc... and they just, don't say much.

No sorry for blocking your driveway, no can we use your power, no acknowledgement of them being there at annoying hours etc... they just kinda said ""we are working on it"" while making me feel like a piece of meat in lions den. 

I come home, alone, at 9 again and they are STILL there and they have plugged into my power again. My boyfriend came home shortly after and went to tell them we would appreciate them not being there so late etc.. they just kinda said they work and they can't be there earlier etc... he said they were polite to him and he doesn't think they seem too bad. We also weren't sure if the guy who owns the thing told them it was okay to plug in to our power park in our parking etc...  Any way . They were there till 11pm. 

I called the guy who owns the thing this morning. He doesn't speak great English and basically said he didn't know they were there so late. Didn't tell them they could use my power etc... but gave ME their phone number and wants me to tell them not park there, use my power, be there late etc.... 

I do not feel comfortable doing that. I want to believe my boyfriends judgement and I do read a lot of true crime so maybe I am paranoid but I just don't like these people and don't feel safe. Especially because it seems like they are getting to know my schedule by just being there so often.

I only have to work with him 3 days a week, but every day it is the same thing. He whines and complains about every little thing. 

Ex: ""Oh I don't want to do this project."" ""Oh I hate working on this type of thing"" ""Ugh our support system is just a call center they don't know anything anymore"" ""I know more than all of these dumb people at corporate""

In his defense, our corporate system IS terrible, our program developers ARE really bad, and we are always having problems with the computer program we have to use. I have tried telling him we need to keep it a more positive environment and that complaining doesn't help our cause. He stopped whining for maybe 2 days then it is right back to the same old complaints. 

Normally I would just suck it up and use headphones to drown it out. However, the problem arises where he turns away business because it is something he doesn't want to do. This morning I heard him actively try to talk a customer out of using our business. This is affecting my stores profit, thus affecting my bonus money.

I've talked to the owner about him already. The owner feels bad for him because he doesn't really have anything else going on. He won't fire him because he has been ""loyal"" to the company for 4 years. I say ""loyal"" because I do not agree that he has actually been loyal. The inventory is always wrong, the work orders are always messed up, the store never gets cleaned, and the cash drawer never gets counted - no matter how many times I try to push the issue.  He has already been written up multiple times for multiple issues, but the sad reality is that write-ups don't mean anything here.

I could hear crying and thought it was rough sex at first, then i realised it was a lot of crying and a lot of hitting noises. (Between my room and theirs are some small panel window so I can hear nearly everything).

So I went to the front desk and they said it was fine, so I went back to my room.

Things went quiet then I could hear the guy hitting something and the woman crying.

I went to the front desk again and told the receptionist (Young lad as its festival time i'm guessing all senior staff are off) that i'm pretty sure its not okay they tried to say its fine at which point I said fuck this and left the hotel. 

Went outside and I could hear her crying from their and a couple of other tourists could hear it as well.

At this point after me leaving the hotel staff went to knock on the door (I could see from outside). 

I went for a walk as I have no idea what to do in this situation.

When i returned things were silent I didn't know if they'd left or just calmed down. 

I have just heard them return to the room.

I found  a number on a Nepalese woman's help site [https://www.womenepal.org/contact/](https://www.womenepal.org/contact/) but don't have enough credit to call. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly I don't know the situation.

Secondly I am in a foreign country with different culture.

Thirdly I don't want to cause myself issues, I have no idea who is in their or what is going on.

But on a selfish level I cant listen to what I could hear.

I also do not want to stand by and listen to domestic violence if i can do something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on what I should have/can do in this situation?

365,"This is an odd one, but your advice is appreciated. 
I own a small bakery business that provides samples of product throughout the day to encourage people to try new items etc. All the unusual reasons someone might want a free piece of a baked good. 
In my province, the law indicates that you must protect people from cross contamination by using either single serving tools (ie. tongs or small plastic cups) to keep samples away from gross stranger germs. One might argue that not only is this a good law but also a good practise because people are gross. 
My staff are well trained to ensure that there are always appropriate tools available. The box that holds the samples also had a GIANT ‘please use the tongs’ sign on it. But still people grab the samples with the barehands and typically manage to touch other samples along their journey. In this case, my staff will politely say ‘could I ask you to please use the tongs next time’ or something of the sort. You would thing people would handle that soft feedback well but you would be wrong. I am continually shocked with the response of some customers ranging from straight up rude comments to asking to speak to the owner. 
So here is my question, can you think of a better way to inform people about (obviously) using the tools at hand? 
Note: the answer can’t be ‘say nothing’ as it is the law and we could get fined or worse for not reacting 
At the end of the day, without my customers there isn’t much point of having a business - but that extends to a good customer service experience as well as not picking up someone else’s gross finger dirt.

366,"Don’t take it personal that I’m going to try and redact some specifics surrounding this but here it goes... 

My roommate is also a member of the same fraternity as me, and this Friday is formal, but I already made plans for the weekend, and the plans involve me driving home. 

The “plan” that I’m referring to could be said that it’s more of a “season” that happens only once a year, for two weeks, and it starts tomorrow. My roommate knows this, so he’s essentially disavowing my reason for skipping formal, and is trying to convince me to attend anyways.

Like I said, formal is today, and we have a strict conduct regarding formal, for one, you can’t get too drunk. The formal itself is only 45 minutes, but there’s an after party where the real drinking begins. I could tell y’all right now, that if I go to formal, then I’m going to be peer pressured into drinking. Then, I’m going to be peer pressured into the after party, and peer pressured into drinking some more, and I’d be stuck having to fake enjoyment because I decided to get a ride, and the driver doesn’t want to leave. Then, I would have to figure out a way to get up at like 3am, where I could still be drunk, assuming I don’t decide to sleep in. 

The bottom line is, my “plan” that I’m going to be participating in, I could only participate for this weekend only because of the college semester winding down, and term projects are starting to be due. 

I like my roommate, but it’s legitimately getting annoying that he can’t seem to let it go regarding my decision, and I can’t find a way to tell him politely that my mind is already made up, and that he needs to just drop it with formal. Basically, no matter how I word this, it makes me come off like a prick. 

The best I can think is this: 
“Hey man, I get you’re pumped for formal, but I’m pumped for this plan that I’ve had for months now, could you please respect my decision, since my mind is already been made up? Thanks, man.” 

For whatever reason though, I get the hunch that saying “could you please” makes me come off as demanding, and ultimately bitchy.

I want to make changes actively in getting it legalized, as well as changing our bullshit employment requirements that probe us for our piss and hair and test us for things we may consume while not even on the clock, I am 100% positive that smoking off the clock has ZERO impact on your ability to do your job, and testing for marijuana is completely pointless and unfair to millions of people who want to or need to smoke for medication yet can’t because of a job.

The only reason I'd go out is to flirt (we're not counting concerts, or shit like that, just plain clubs, with shitty music and lots of drunk people). But only now I want to start doing it, from tonight on.

The problem is I just have one friend to go out with, my best friend from my old town. But it's like I lost the chance to go out with people from my class at university, because this is the 2nd year, and I definitely remember the first one, everyone was alone, and people actually told me to go out, but I said no, for the reasons I said before.

So now I don't know what to do. To go with my best friend, it'd be kind of weird, just 2 people that don't drink or smoke, and neither of us is used to go out.

I think people go out in big groups, at least 4 people in it, and that's how you can flirt and that.

What do you guys think? Should I somehow try to get into one of the groups, or just go out with my best friend try not to be shy and flirt and meet people?

370,"Looking for some serious advice. Me and my partner have loved eachother since the second we met. She told me about her past and it was not the best but I love her in spite of that. We moved in together 1 month into our relationship, which is probably too quick for most people but felt right to us. All we have done the past year and half we've been together is spend every waking moment together, we even joined college together to push eachother to do well. We've been on vacations together and even have 2 dogs and our own home. Her family would constantly say how I have changed her, she used to be this rebellious teenager who didn't give a sh** about anyone until she met me. Now she's this responsible 20 year old with a life and a family if you could count me and our dogs as a family. The past few months have been stressful and rocky but we managed to work through it. We're a lesbian couple and she was having doubts about her sexuality 2 weeks ago thinking she was possibly bi? For about 2 months she's been on my back about getting another job as I had actually dropped out of college due to depression and anxiety. We both have our fair share of mental instability with her also having anxiety and being treated for bipolar, although she stopped taking her medication for her mental health a few months back - roughly when the arguments began. I finally got a job last week but it was night shift, the first night I was leaving for work she was crying because this would be our first night apart since we got together but I told her it will be fine, just to go to her bed - the sooner she goes to sleep the sooner she will see me again. I got a call from her at 6:30 am and I was still at work. She was crying hysterically saying she had cheated on me with a guy in our bed... This tore me apart - without thinking, when I got home I packed some of my stuff and took one of the dogs as she wouldn't let me take both and left after a really big argument of course. I wandered the streets from 10am to 9pm still going on no sleep as I had nowhere to go. She texted me saying I could stay in the house as she was going out clubbing (lol) anyway. When I got back she wouldn't let me in so I decided to call the police as the house is under my name too and I have the right to go in. When she realised the police were being called she opened the door so I hung up but when this happened she attacked me then walked away to finish doing her make up. Eventually the police actually turned up because the call had already been made and she got taken to her mum's and I was left in the house to watch the dogs. I finally got some sleep and when I woke up I had multiple missed calls from her and texts apologizing every way possible, we video called for hours and it was like starting from the beginning again. I love her with all my heart and can't imagine losing her. She said we can work through this and will prove to me this will never happen again offering to give me her passwords to all her social media and even going as far as logging into her Fitbit to make sure she's sleeping when I'm at work - but I'm not like that, I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt. We've been trying to make it work for about 4 days now but throughout those 4 days I keep breaking down and having mood swings, I can be fine with her 1 second then not be able to look at her the next but I know I love her and want to give her that chance. I need an outsider's opinion on this and anything would be appreciated. I should also say that I know who the guy is she slept with and does not have the best record when it comes to women, he has forced his way into women's houses not questioning anything and taken advantage when they're mentally vulnerable.

It just keeps getting worse and worse. I basically can’t really feel anything. No happiness or any other positive emotion. I can feel scared but most of the time I feel empty. 

I don’t remember when this happened - but it was sometime after my mum found out about my self harm (I lived with my mum for a few years. Now I live with my dad). I basically told her that I thought I had depression. I can remember her exact words. “You don’t know what it’s like to have depression. You don’t have it.”

My grandparents work in merchandising and ad change. What they do is basically drive around the state, going from store to store, and put things up like those funky machines you might see that play advertisements, or stickers on products that need them. It's hard to explain, but it's an easy job. The thing is, I hate working with my grandpa. When I was younger they would drag me out with them.

383,"So I made this internet friend about two years ago, let's call him Jake. Over time, the two of us became decently close, we talked a fair amount- he had a lot going on and made it clear many times that he liked having me to confide in. I was always careful in how much personal info I shared, but Jake was very open to the point where I even have access to his social security number and home address (he's lucky I'm not a catfish) and at some point, admitted to being in love with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't feel the same, we moved on as friends, but one thing I didn't notice at the time but that feels clear now was that he was weirdly clingy. He'd say things like ""I miss my avid\_memer"" if I went offline for a day, he'd talk about wanting to date other girls but at the end of the day, he'd choose me over any of them, that I was the only person he could connect with, he had a total r/niceguys attitude where he'd constantly bring up how he was so nice and just because he wasn't as attractive as other dudes (who he saw as assholes) he didn't get the girls ever and was so lonely all the time and his parents sucked and so on. At the time, he was also suicidal, and realizing after some messages he wouldn't bother trying to reach out to anybody but me, I encouraged his attitude, a mistake I didn't realize I was making. At the time, I thought I was just being a good friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, senior year hit me, and this year has been pretty rough on me for a lot of personal reasons. It's changed me a lot. So I left Jake a message telling him that things were difficult, I couldn't be there for him like usual, and I'd be cutting him and every other internet friend off to deal and I didn't know when I'd be back. I made it clear that it wasn't his fault, that I was going through something I had to deal with myself. And ever since I've distanced myself, the distance has made it clear that some of his attitudes are toxic and borderline concerning. I'd like to note that I have previously encouraged him many, many times to seek help IRL with his on-campus counselor or anyone else local to him, but he refuses to budge on it, and I realize I can't/couldn't help him through everything, but I thought it was better that I try than leave him to his own devices considering how he wouldn't get help from anyone but me and he wasn't doing great.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we talk through a social media that doesn't use read receipts or have activity statuses, so from time to time, I still check in (it's been a month or so since I left) and he keeps messaging me stupid Instagram screenshot quotes about how much he misses his best friend and is heartbroken and about how he needs my advice and how a lot is going on and how he won't give up on me. When I check in, I just read whatever he's sent (and there are a lot of deleted messages), do what I came for (there's some IRL people I'm connected with and need to talk to through it), and leave. That's it. But he won't give up, and despite realizing after leaving how toxic Jake is, I feel guilt tripped. I don't want to go back to being friends with him, I don't want what we had where he complains and complains and I soothe him. But watching him just keep messaging me about how he misses me and stuff, I don't know what I should do. Hence, the choice in the title post. Either I 

1) continue being the bitch. don't talk to him like I said I would, and hope he gives up on me and finds the help he needs. basically ghost him forever, but I will have to deal with seeing his messages if/when I ever choose to reconnect with my non-toxic internet friends, because there are some I really miss who helped me through some hard stuff.

2) be an asshole. I message Jake and tell him exactly how I feel about him and his toxicity and clinginess now and that when I say I don't want us to talk, I mean that I don't want us to talk. this is a very risky option as one of his complaints was that nobody could deal with him and kept leaving him and I was the only one who stayed, and I fear making him lose all hope directly from me could drive him to make a bad choice.

3) be the asshole in a different way. I block him and if I can, delete our chat. I leave every group I was in that he was in. also kinda risky for the same reasons in #2

4) anything else the people of reddit can come up with to help me through. I can't just ignore the messages because I use the social media we use to communicate with people IRL occasionally and notification bubbles bug me a lot.

I have a 6 year old son who one day very soon is going to realize that a lot if not all of his classmates have families and all he has is me. I cannot shield him from that hurt. I spend every waking moment trying to plan for a brighter future for us. Everything I do, I do for him. Every penny I make is his. Every spare moment I have is his. All I want is to give him the absolute most I can and being a single mom is very very hard. 

I was married and pregnant at 18. I am still legally married to the father of my child. One day we were living together and raising our son together and the next day I decided I would not live another day being afraid of being hit. In the beginning i encouraged him to have a relationship with our son but it’s like from the moment I left him, me and our son are dead to him and his family. I filed for child support, but I haven’t received any in 3 years. 

We had a court date last week. It was actually the 2nd court date we’d had this year because the first one he didn’t bother to show up to but decided to go to the court house two days after the hearing to reschedule because he didn’t want a warrant to be issued. The month between the first hearing and the second is the most I have heard from him in the 5 years we have been separated. He was calling and texting me every day trying to tell me what I needed to say to the judge. Trying to tell me I needed to convince the judge to waive all his back dated child support because that was what was best for all of us. 

The day of court he showed up extremely late. I took my sister with me for support and because, in case you’ve never been to child support court, it’s a lot like the dmv in that there’s not a whole lot to do but sit there and wait. So anyway, this mfer walks in spots me and my sister and gives us the biggest shit eating grin and my stomach just sank. I cannot explain the feeling of utter regret and doom I felt. It was like I was a victim all over again and I wanted to be anywhere but there. I wished I had never filed for child support. I considered walking out and having our case closed. 

He signed in and went outside the dmv-like airing area and began texting me asking to talk. I advised that we had already talked. 

Guys I asked them to lower his child support. Because it doesn’t help me if he doesn’t pay it. And they wanted to raise the amount he was due each month so that he would have the back support paid in two years. So I had them lower it. I didn’t have to go before the judge. Because of our violent history my contact information is not included on the paperwork and I am not required to be in the same room as him. But by golly when I left with my copy of the signed paperwork guess who was waiting for me outside. 

I didn’t stop to talk. I did not falter I found my sister and left. But guess who’s mad that I didn’t get the back support waived?

I start getting these awful headaches to, not crippling pain but it is pretty irritating at the front of my head (forehead area feels tight) I fail to be able to pay attention in fluid power and keep getting called dumb in class. I get home and try to focus on my programming stuff and the headaches come back (they seem to only come when I'm trying to do something complex) it makes me want to give up, I also have been studying 2 diffrent languages Russian and Japanese via books and duolingo. I cant seem to keep information in my brain like I used to... Is my brain just fried (I used to use alot of drugs but I stopped) or am I just dumb so it hurts my head? I really want to learn all this stuff, maybe I'm just trying to learn so much things at once that its hard? Are the headaches from stress? They just recently started but have been on and off for the past 3 weeks. I'm really worried that maybe I'm just so stupid and brain dead from drugs that I cant learn which I hope isnt the case. What should I do? Do I need to see a doctor? The headaches dont hurt THAT bad but... They are a little irritating. ",09Nov2018,1

My concern is she's obviously got daddy issues. She wanted me to choke her and pull her hair. Hair pulling, no big. Choking, not so much. After that she texted me saying she was waiting for ""results"" but wouldn't tell me what she meant. We didn't use protection so I'm assuming she was hoping to get preggo so I would have to pay child support. She is super white trash and lives in a disgusting house with her family. No job, etc. Anyways, I texted her saying I'd be at the dog park (where we first met) and she immediately replied ""dtf? We can at yours or my place while the dogs play"". I of course said yes but then got thinking: why would she jump to that as her first reply. I asked her if she consented to having sex again (to cover my own ass) and she said ""omg rly"" as if to blow it off and then proceeded to ask me to get ahold of her when I'm off work.  I don't want my trust issues to cause me lost opportunities.",09Nov2018,1
394,"This happened 10 minutes ago.

When we all lived together in my family, we had a dog. When my parents divorced we got to keep her, but when me and my sister moved out (I went to a different country)  my father agreed to keep the dog, as she would keep him company. Now the dog is older (13) and, even if she is small, she is noisy, cries often and barks when anyone enters our home. She also pees in the kitchen frequently. 

Now all of this was an annoyance but it was bearable, but a couple have moved below us and they have complained quite a few times. 

I came for dinner at my father's house and when my dog started barking he kicked him against the wall pretty hard. I pushed him pretty hard and long story short I don't think I'm talking to that man in a long time. 

I don't know what to do as I can't take care of her: my appartment has a really strong ""no pets"" policy and I am home maybe 1 hour per day, aside from when I sleep. I feel really betrayed as he agreed to keep her and now is hurting her.

She’s always laughing at my dumb jokes and there have been many times where we’d stay up till the late hours lying down close to each other watching movies. In those times, I’ve found her reaching for my hand and start caressing it. Yet, even with all this, I’m not really sure where her headspace is at. She has a relatively new relationship that she's been doing long distance with since the start of college (we are both freshman). I obviously really like her, and I’d ideally would like to date her.

I can pinpoint the causes to either feeling emotionally overwhelmed or being overwhelmed by the environment (bright lights, high pitch noises etc).  The problem to this is my response. 

My first type of response seems to be more extreme and more often happens when I am overwhelmed by the environment. I feel very overwhelmed by my senses and everything feels very close to me. I get very distressed and upset when people try to touch me.  I’ll cover my ears and eyes. 

In regards to my second response I feel very distant. My head becomes hazy and my vision starts to swim. I find it difficult to communicate and often become unresponsive. I will also become excessively tired afterwards (and rarely before).

Anyways, backstory.  I’ve had a crush on this guy for two or three years since we’ve known each other.  He claims he’s into me and wants to be with me but every time it boiled down to us meeting he would ghost me.  No text message replies, no calls, he would just stop communicating and turn off his phone.  

I’ve asked him previously what the issue was, and he says it’s always been his anxiety and being shy.  Cool, fine, whatever.  I moved on, figures it wasn’t worth going back and forth. 

Fast forward to now, this year. He messages me out the blue, very serious this time and admitted his wrongs. We’ve been talking more frequent and he’s been doing a lot better. I forgave him, still having feelings for him. 

All week long I’ve told him I want to surprise him for his birthday and do something special.  Here we are the day of, and he’s acting weird.  Not completely ghosting me, but close enough.  Hardly any replies, no good morning text, everything out of whack.  

My plans were to buy him a present, get him a cake and surprise him, but my question is. Should I? Or should I not? I’ve wasted money on him previously and he’s never apologized, never offered to pay me back or anything. I really don’t want him ghosting me and doing the same thing more than twice.

401,"Okay, job number 1: Good location, somewhere I like to commute to and like the area. Very populated, active area in the city.
The job consists of minimum wage + commission. The job is a phone company, very active - he showed me they got 40 sales this week and other stores in the suburbs get only 30 a month. Told me I'd be alone a lot, so  a lot of free time and privacy come into play. I think he'll also work around a normal scheduled, no thirds. (Which I've only worked and hated because it takes your life away.) So in conclusion, which the high amount of sales he said I'd be making about 14-15 an hour, full time job.

The next job is CVS, I don't like the area, the police (opinion) are very ticket happy and this poses a major risk on my daily commute. It's a farther drive in an area I'm not comfortable with. Now, they're offering me 20 to 25 hours for 11 an hour. But, it'd be on days I'd like off, and at a poor shift which I'd feel would interact within my daily doings.

Which would you take? Do you believe the first option is worth it with the good commission? Slight possibility I may not even get the CVS job, but as far as the phone company goes I do start tomorrow for paid training. 

Also for CVS it would take probably another week or two before I started working, plus I have to drive almost an hour one way for a conference to begin working. 

But I'm more or less concerned mostly about pay, I have about $425 in bills each month and I'm just curious about what you guys would do. I'm leaning on the phone company because I think I'd climb quickly because the store is new, and promotion seems quickly possible.

For a little background on myself: I’m in eighth grade at a pretty standard middle school in a nice suburban town. My oldest sister has had drug addiction issues for my whole life. 

Onto my problem: Saturday afternoon, my parents picked up my oldest sister from some god-forsaken place where they found her extremely ill. She could barely walk. After much (unnecessary) deliberation, my parents decided to take her to the hospital. They took her to the ER where they waited all night to get her in. When they finally took her in, she was sent to the CCU. 

The bottom line about the whole hospital ordeal is that she has a lot of internal issues which stem mainly from an issue with her one of her heart valves. Today she had open heart surgery, which thankfully went very well. The only thing left to worry about is weening her off of the breathing machine, (I keep forgetting what it’s called) as her lungs are extremely damaged. Definitely because of her past drug abuse. 


I told a few of my closest friends about it, because I needed people to talk to. I also explained a very small amount of what was happening to a few people in the school musical that I trusted. Due to my absence from school for the last three days, people have started to ask and now the word has gotten to the entire school that my oldest sister may die. My family didn’t want this at all, and I’m worried my mom will find out that my entire school knows our situation. What should I do? ",09Nov2018,1

406,"Sorry this is kinda long and I'm writing this on mobile

I'm a 19 year old girl in college. Last year I was in this big friend group for the first semester, but I don't really talk with them now. When I was friends with them, I signed an apartment lease with a couple of them for this year. It was pretty dumb of me to sign a lease with some friends I hadn't known for very long, but I thought that if I didn't sign then, all the apartments would fill up and I wouldn't have anywhere to live. Before this I had only ever lived with my family and in the school dorm so I had never signed a lease and had no idea how it worked. 

So now I have a room in this apartment that I don't use but my parents pay for, with people I don't talk to or feel comfortable around. I really just live with my boyfriend in his apartment, but I've been keeping some of my things in my room in my apartment. I've been very careful about keeping the door locked.

Earlier this semester, maintenance came in to fix the screen on my window and left the door open and some of the guys in the group who live in the apartment downstairs came over, got drunk, and stole my scarf and the sheets off my bed. I got it back and they apologized.

This week I came over to check on my room and found all of the things I had left on my bed on the floor like someone just pushed it all off. Someone else's blankets were on my bed and there was a stick of men's deodorant on my dresser. It looked like someone was sleeping there. Also the night stand from my room was in the living room and they were storing a huge wood sheet (for a pong table I think?) in my room. 

I definitely had the door locked and it was locked when I went in, so I don't know how they got in. I texted them about it but none of them answered. I have since removed all my things from the room but I'm worried about them causing damage to the room or messing up the furniture (furniture is provided by the apartment) because then I'd be on the hook for paying for it. I want to get out of the lease but I don't think I can. I don't know what to do, but I'm pretty upset about it 

Tldr; I don't stay in my apartment and my exfriends/roommates are going in my room, taking things out, using it as storage, and letting someone sleep there. ",09Nov2018,1

409,"I don't mean this in an edgy, or purposely exaggerated way. Loving someone in a romantic or just platonic way, or even just having an emotional bond with them, makes me genuinely uncomfortable, anxious and often very very miserable.

I feel like I'm missing out, or flat out doing it wrong. Feeling attached to someone in any shape and form should feel... good, but all I get from it is bad feelings.

Here's how it is:

When I get attached to someone, I try to pursue that feeling of joy and happiness they offer me, by trying to spend as much time with them as possible. But I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells. I read into every word they say, I feel empty and miserable when I'm not around them, and I always assume the worst. I feel as if every interaction with them is a race in which I need to score as many points as possible.
That's pretty much the main idea. I've come to a point in life right now, where I wake up in the morning only to be around that person for a while, and that's pretty much the goal of all my days. And when I'm not around them, I'm genuinely feeling deeply depressed.

I guess I'm asking for advice or your input. Why? Love and simple platonic attachments should feel good. Why do they make me deeply depressed?",09Nov2018,1

413,"I've been with the same company, in the same store, in the same position for 4 years. I'm a cashier at a large, very successful, regional grocery chain. Despite many people's opinions about such jobs being menial and monotonous, I enjoy what I do. I like interacting with people and I'm very good at my job. 

I've made several requests over the years to a number of different managers about moving from my current position to the customer service desk. My managers have continued to promote one person after another, most of whom haven't been there as long as I have. I have an excellent rapport with my customers and coworkers. I am asked daily why I'm still ""just a cashier"" and I could never answer the question because I have never understood why, until now.

We recently had a new Assistant Customer Service Manager transfer to our store (which is very common, this company bounces managers around all the time), and it was pretty clear very early on that she's not a pleasant woman. Multiple associates heard her tell people that she was going to ""be the biggest bitch this store has ever seen."" She's a real peach. She has cut the hours of reliable employees and hired a dozen new people who aren't being properly trained. She's rude to associates and customers alike and she is widely disliked by a disproportionate number of people.  

A few months ago it rained and I brought my new super cool upside down umbrella to work and accidentally left it there at the end of my shift. When I went back for it, it was gone. About a week later, I looked for it again, asked a couple of people if they had seen it and then resigned myself to the fact that I lost it somewhere else. Later that day, this new manager, I'll call her Karen, came in and happened to be carrying an umbrella identical to the one I lost. I was dumbfounded. Theft or dishonesty of any kind is supposedly not tolerated among employees of our company. I asked my ""team leader"" what I should do and she suggested I ask Karen if she found the umbrella in question in the store's lost and found. So I did. I did just that. I asked her if she happened to find it and that I lost an identical one. She claimed to have purchased hers from Bed Bath and Beyond. She used an unnerving amount of detail ranging from saying her husband wouldn't let her buy one because they were too expensive to telling me she got a 40% off coupon in the mail. I can tell when I'm being lied to. I was baffled. But since I had no proof, I let it go. Since then, it has rained dozens of times and I haven't seen her use ""her"" umbrella again. Not once. 

I have continued to talk to my managers about going to CS and I've been told over and over that I'll start training next week. It's always next week. 

Last night I was talking to a coworker with whom I was told I would be ""co-training."" He proceeded to tell me that he will begin training next week. He also said that he asked Karen why I wasn't also training. She told him that as long as she's at that store, I will never move to CS because I accused her of stealing my umbrella. 

I'm at a point where I simply don't know what to do. The managers at my store all stick together and I don't think I have a fighting chance of defending myself against Karen's claim. This situation is completely hindering my chances of ever being promoted.  What am I supposed to do? 

TLDR: My manager stole my property, lied about it, and now I'm not able to be promoted because she claims I accused her of stealing.

I am in the process of starting a medical practice. He’s asked if he can help with anything and so I gave him a couple of things he could help with. He then tells me that he wants to discuss his role in the company. Part of me is frustrated that he can’t just help me for free because we are in this together and he loves me, but I can also see his viewpoint that we are not yet married and if something were to happen to me or to the relationship, he would have nothing to show for his time and effort that he could be using to otherwise grow his own career. He has said in the past he feels unequal in our relationship bc I earn more and also that I act as though my needs are more important than his. He had originally asked for a 25% equity stake in the company and explained that if he helped, he would want to help for no more than a year. I feel like that’s ridiculous considering the amount of work I’m probably going to need help with, if any. It was then his idea that we create a parent company that we are both 50% owners of and place our individual companies under that: my medical practice and his investing and home flipping companies.

417,"My husband and I have been together since we were 17/18 and have known each other since we were 12/13. We went through undergrad and grad school together and now have begun careers as teachers in Canada. He has been emotionally abusive in the past and struggled with maturing/taking on some adult responsibilities. Over the past year, and with the risk of divorce hanging in the balance, he has grown up a lot due to his own personal work and some therapy we have gotten together and individually. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned, we recently began careers as teachers. If anyone as any experience with this job, you will know it is incredibly demanding emotionally, physically etc. and requires a tremendous amount of time and energy both inside and outside of the school and before and after work. The net result is that new teachers often have ZERO work-life balance. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I haven't been having regular sex as a result of this transition and change. I would say it's been about a month and a half since we were last intimate. We are both trying to get a handle on our work life so that we can be more available to each other, but this is especially important for me as I have always been an avid worker. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is... my husband is constantly (I mean once a day up to multiple times a day) talking about how if we keep going on this path, our relationship will crumble and one of us will likely seek out intimacy outside of the marriage. I know for a fact that he is not cheating right now and will not in the near future, but the fact that he is constantly saying this is quite frankly driving me insane and certainly NOT allowing us to build the emotional intimacy that I do need to be able to be intimate with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned the other day that new teachers usually struggle for several years before finding their groove and being more stable, and he lost it. Derailed the conversation (which was actually about a teacher friend of ours) and basically said that he cannot last several years like this and that this is insane. It's been TWO MONTHS since this change happened, and I am absolutely blown away by his lack of patience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should note that he has never been forceful sexually, nor has sex ever been an all-consuming aspect of our relationship. We have gone through some very tough times over the past few years though, mainly because of his rigidity and overall stubbornness. I have to say that I am absolutely and totally exhausted, and I frequently fantasize about being either alone or with someone else. I should note that my frustration and exhaustion is likely contributing to my lack of energy to/desire to have sex with him, however I don't think that's entirely unreasonable given the circumstance.

\- Generally holds a stiff posture and is almost never relaxed or comfortable with himself or in his body

Literally ignores me when everybody around us can hear I said something and got no response. He's obviously scared of speaking loudly, but he doesn't realize that by keeping quiet and looking pissed and breathing heavily, he's making himself look like a weirdo.

\- when he sits down, he lifts his shoulders up and holds them like that so he doesn't look as fat.

\- very quiet and not overly liked by friends

\- anger issues sometimes

\- emotionally unstable imo

These are just a few things I pick up on and a lot of people close to me do as well. He acts strange out in public and in private he gets angry and ticked off about small things. He has bad tempermant, is generally bitter, and some would even say always mad if they watched him. Honestly, I think he is emotionally and mentally unhealthy. He doesn't go out of his way to maintain good health. He isn't very active-- when we playing basketball he just sits there on his phone and ignores me when I ask him to play, but he'll still come out. His friends are basically my friends but a smaller circle for him, and he's not as much liked. I hate to be saying all these things because I want the best for him. It's just no matter how much the people around him try to be positive or don't do anthing at all, he is naturally bitter and resentful. For example, when there were no empty seats on the bus one day. I asked if he could move over, and he didn't move at all. He sat right in the middle of the long seat, so I was half on, half off the seat, sort of hanging off. He kept pushing me away the entire time, and everybody around us noticed he was purposefully keeping the seat to hismelf. He started breathing heavilty like usual and made himself look like an idiot.

You probably picked up on this, but he's annoyingly quirky. By quirky I mean he does strange little things out of spite. I'll go as far as to call him toxic sometimes. He's very lazy, generally irresponsble, and in my opinion, weak moral state. Now obviously, he is pretty normal *most* of the time in public, but there are concerning and disrespectful moments out in public and almost always in private.

The ironic part about all this is that, despite being rude, arrogant, bitter, strange, and frankly toxic, he goes out of his way to tell me about how I look weird or do stupid things and look like an idiot. I generally try to keep a positive view, while still trying to tell him about the way he is. Most would think someone like this was bullied growing up, but that's not the case.

I've seriously debated to myself whether or not he's on the autism spectrum. Whenever I try to tell him anything about the way he might be, he starts yelling and saying ""ok but do you know what you are like?"" and nothing gets done. Some days he'll just see me and I'll say something or ask a question and he'll go ""lol moron"". I don't care about little things like this, because I've learned to block out negativity. But for him, it's his go to. He starts the day with negative energy and gives off toxiciy. And I can see it on his face and body. He's not very fit, he doesn't have great posture, and doesn't take extra care of his body. He looks older than his age and people have said he looks cold and bitter.

I feel so fucking bad for him every [da](https://day.it/)y. It's like he doesn't even see the point of me trying to help him out. Today was terrible. After one of those bus incidents he was just being himself and I told him ""i want to talk about the way you acted on the bus"" and he just starts saying things like ""me? what about the way you acted?"" and goes on and on. And he loves to get physical and violent for no good reason. I don't.

Idk anymore. I don't . Thoughts? I know this doesnt really fit under ""confession"" but im sort of new to reddit.

Please help me help him out .Thanks",09Nov2018,1
420,"My best friend is in an on again off again relationship with this cocky, unpleasant, arrogant, emotionally abusive and manipulative guy. The “on again” only happens when he feels like being with my friend. It’s been off since January but he’s back claiming he’s better and all the same story. This has been going on for 6 years. 

The last time he broke up with my friend was at my moms funeral (over the phone). And he was devastated and unable to be there for me who was already devastated. My friend was depressed for months and completely disconnected from life. 

The major problem is my friend rents a room from me. I don’t want this guy around. He’s a dick to me and my family and my friend doesn’t see it.

Gave it a shot the  following year, and got rejected again. 

Fastforward to freshmen year of highschool I had been texting her and just talking to her occasionally in class and, when I least expected it, she came up to me and told me she liked me. I told her I liked her but wasn’t sure if I wanted to be in a relationship and after that encounter, I asked her out, and she didn’t want to go out so things got awkward from there so we decided to go back to beings ‘friends’.

He spent money he didn’t have and didn’t care. I stayed with him and guided him through it. Starting two years ago, he worked as a truck driver until he bought his own truck. Things have gone downhill from there with crazy maintenance costs and poor money practices. Now, he said he’s forced to go to Afghanistan as a contractor to pay all his debt. I’m livid because I thought he was finally settling down. We worked for years to overcome PTSD and all sorts of issues, and now he wants to run back because it’s familiar to him. I’m angry and upset, because he ignored my advice all this time and I know it’s not best for him. All he sees is money and the easy way out. Should I be angry? More understanding? I’m at a loss.

Some insight is this, growing up I've always found my mom to be quite toxic but had usually chalked it up to her just being unaware. I grew up the youngest of 5 children and the only boy, it started with her constantly challenging my gender saying things like ""be a boy"" which never sat right with me and as a 23 year old I now have large opinions on male mental health. But again I chalked this up to her just being misguided.

In the last year I took a job in the same town she works in, and so I live in that town 4 days a week, after my roommate moved away I just moved into her place. I've been living with her for maybe 4 months and I can easily say it's been hell. She constantly complains about my cat and tells me to sell it, I explained to her that the cat was recommended by my therapist (whom I no longer see, but that I liked very much) and explained to her that while I work in town that is my only friend and that I rely on it severely for my mental health, she told me she didn't care and that it stresses her out, I'm now a couple weeks from moving and still everyday she complains about the cat despite knowing once I move she won't have to deal with it. She loudly talks about me and my cat when my sisters visit. I find the whole environment extremely toxic and although I don't think I have it in me to tell her that a part of me would love to just not hug her goodbye, would this give her the message? Would it just hurt her? Im not looking to ruin the relationship I just want her to understand that if she treats me this way she won't have me around ",09Nov2018,1
426,"This is really weird but here goes:

I’ve had the same physics teacher from 7th grade and I’m in 12th grade now. We exchanged messengers around a year ago, when I finally created a profile on Facebook, and I only began showing activity around a month ago. I share a couple of math-physics-stem related memes and jokes a day so my friends can see them

Around the time I started this, my teacher (I’ll refer to him as mr T) began texting me unprompted in response to the posts. Usually a “HAHA” or a thumbs up, nothing much. We’d only texted for homework related stuff, or if I told him in class I saw something cool on YT and he’d tell me to send it to him, so the chat is really comprised of Question, answer, rinse, repeat, youtube link, etc.

3 weeks ago, I got a message at 11PM from mr T, reacting to a post. That message turned into 5 messages, 10, and I honestly got annoyed and muted him for a while (the day I found out muting was the happiest I’ve been), and didn’t really check the chat for a few days. He was suddenly very cold to me in class, whenever I didn’t raise my hand he’d ridicule me, and he said out loud “it appears that mr throwaway has commitment issues”. WTF?????

I started checking the chat again, and it was as if nothing happened. Things went back to normal, only I kept sharing posts and he kept texting me at 11-12PM. Now, a week ago, I wake up on Saturday to a text at 3:11AM, “are you sleeping?” I obviously was, and fearing that he’d like shoot me or something if I didn’t reply, I made the mistake of texting him back “yeah”. Now, for the past 7 days, he’s been texting me non stop about anything. He’s sending me pictures of his grading piles, with grades clearly visible, complains about how bored he is, sends me random thumbs ups, and he’s started a Draw Somethingv game. I haven’t played back but I fear that if I don’t, he’ll maybe lower my grade.

 Our mom left us when we were 5 and we were left with our dad, he was a drunk and was pretty abusive, he used to sexually abuse us both and take pictures. He usually made us masterbate each other while he took pictures, sometimes he would get my brother to insert things into my anus, it was incredibly traumatic. We were taken to live with our aunt and we were always very close, we were always best friends growing up. Whenever I was sad or started to relive the abuse he would climb into bed with me and hug me, I always felt really close to him. 
Lately I have had troubles with an abusive boyfriend , he was into really freaky bondage and I played along, he would make me vomit on the floor and eat it back up like a dog, he would choke me until I went blue, when I wouldn’t comply he would beat me until I did. This isn’t the first boyfriends that I have had that has been abusive but never like this.

The first weird text came a few days later. A girl texted me looking for ""John."" I explained that she reached the wrong number and she apologized. Around a week later, I got another, similar text. This guy even sent a screenshot, where John had given him MY number as his point of contact (don't know why he has to text his number if they're clearly already texting). But I confirmed it was the wrong number and he moved on.

I don't mind redirecting the wrong numbers. At first, I was worried that resetting my phone resulted in both of us having my number, but I think it's more reasonable to assume that John just misremembered his number. 

But the problem is that it seems, whoever John is, he's looking for a job. He keeps signing up for these job text alerts. And he can't distinguish between legitimate job sources and spam.

As a preface, I am paid less than half of what is the median for people in my position as only a scheduler. Now that I’ve taken on two other roles I’m even lower than where I should be, maybe around 40% of the median salary.

In the last year, I went from scheduler to supervisor to now being the sole scheduler, supervisor, and accountant for my department and we bring in anywhere from $2-300,000 a month. My goal is to move vertically within the rest of our wing of the whole company, into my dream career. It’s close to being there, likely within 6 months, but for now I am biding my time in my current role as it is FUN and CHALLENGING.

That being said, beyond the fact that it’s humiliating that I’m so underpaid, I can not afford to keep living like this anymore. I have always been great at budgeting and saving but the last several months have brought on unexpected health expense, living expenses, and schooling expenses and I’ve managed to overdraw my bank account three months in a row paying rent and insurance.

We use to do live streams together, and because of the circumstances of my last year of Highschool, they were pretty much all of my friends. I had to move to a different country that year, and because of the language of the place that I moved to, I stayed home a lot. With good ol' GTA V.

Firstly, I’d like to clarify that I am from the Czech Republic and English is not my native language.

Yesterday I was approached by a classmate, she said that she wanted to show me an interesting video. I was expecting a meme or a cat video, so I just sat down next to him/her (don’t want to give anything away), waited for the video to load up and there it was… I see a group of drunk young men (close to adulthood I’d say) pulling jeans off an unconscious body (at this point I was still excepting a meme and I didn’t know she was 14). When they finally managed to do it, they were just laughing. Then a guy comes down to her and starts putting a glass bottle inside of her. This continued for a few seconds. After that, they started running around with the camera (probably a mobile anyway) showing the reactions of some people that were there. The video ends here.

I didn’t react for a few seconds. When I had finally gathered myself, I started to recognize the emotions I was feeling. Disgust, anger, hatred… all those things and more. I looked at my classmate and I said that this was F-ed up. I asked if it was reported. He/she didn’t know. He/she kept talking about the context of the video and her name (it happened at someone’s house, she was drunk AND 14 YEARS OLD). I walked away thinking about what I should do. Initially, the moral responsibility was obvious, tell the police. I was determined that right after my last lesson I’d go to the nearest police station and report this. Then I started thinking about how this would affect my social life. Since I’d have to report the classmate that showed me the video, he/she would get into problems involving the police and I didn’t want that. And what do I know maybe the girl doesn’t want to deal with this? On the other hand, I want to prevent those boys from doing this ever again. So, I thought of an escape plan. My mother works as a social worker (child services) she would know (or could find out) if something like this happened. I told her the name of the girl and… nope… nothing, literally nobody reported this.

Today I am still struggling. I don’t know what to do. Should I convince the classmate to go to the police with me? Should I write an anonymous letter that excludes her (makes it harder for the police to get the video)? Should I write an anonymous letter that includes her (some of my other classmates know about my intentions and could spread this as a “betrayal of trust” or something so that would make my already poor social life even worse)?

Not once has he ever made me cum or gone down on me. Says it’s not his thing. He fingered me for a little one time but that was it as far as him trying to pleasure me. 

We always get in arguments (over texting) since I’m always bringing up how much I do for him and wanting him to like me more and treat me better. He says he treats me fine and doesn’t see why I’m acting crazy, etc etc. 

We just got over our biggest “fight” a couple weeks ago. Made up and had unbelievable sex. Probably the best yet. Said we don’t want each other to be fucking other ppl. 

I reached out after since when we made up we talked for awhile about everything we’ve been through and both got a better understanding of why we had that argument. Anyways I put in the effort to contact him after and he responded, we talked like normal, we both agreed we wanna see each other again soon.

Haven’t heard from him and it’s been longer then usual, just can tell something is off. Therefore, I’ve been over thinking way too much. I came to the conclusion that I just want to tell him when he contacts me next, that I can no longer be his FB.

Initially, the moral responsibility was obvious, tell the police. I was determined that right after my last lesson I’d go to the nearest police station and report this. Then I started thinking about how this would affect my social life. Since I’d have to report the classmate that showed me the video, he/she would get into problems involving the police and I didn’t want that. And what do I know maybe the girl doesn’t want to deal with this? On the other hand, I want to prevent those boys from doing this ever again. So, I thought of an escape plan. My mother works as a social worker (child services) she would know (or could find out) if something like this happened. I told her the name of the girl and… nope… nothing, literally nobody reported this.

Today I am still struggling. I don’t know what to do. Should I convince the classmate to go to the police with me? Should I write an anonymous letter that excludes her (makes it harder for the police to get the video)? Should I write an anonymous letter that includes her (some of my other classmates know about my intentions and could spread this as a “betrayal of trust” or something so that would make my already poor social life even worse)? So, here I am asking for help.

In my ceramics class we were supposed to glaze our boxes. Our teacher had put our fired boxes on a rack so we had to find the ones that belonged to us. I found one that I thought that was mine because it was completely void of any decoration unlike the others and there was no name on it like mine. I just finished my glaze and was about to put it in the back room so that my teacher could fire it. Meanwhile the sophomore, who I don't know at all, told me that that box was his and I politely gave it back to him and apologized. After 2 days, the box turned out to look pretty bad because of my glazing and I learned that it was that sophomore's second box. I then apologized to him again for that and he just shrugged it off. Then, we started our next project which was to make a clay animal. I was planning making a koi fish because I am Asian but when I was about to be finished I overheard that sophomore saying that I was a b**** for copying him for doing a fish, even though it is a common animal, to his friends. How do I get on neutral terms with him?

Hey all. My day was going great. It’s getting cold finally. I saw my co worker on the way to work and again on campus so that was cool. A lady at hobby lobby showed me a coupon which saved me a couple dollars on my purchase. I was making good progress on my art project then they started talking in the group chat for work. 

Idk why but he randomly said this. He’s told me he’s homophobic before just randomly. He asked me before if I were to end it how would I end it. 

I just came out my shell in the summer so I’ve been pretty funny and usually make everyone laugh. 
But one thing I never do is joke about suicide in any regards. 

Fun fact. I quit the only sport I played simply because someone said I’d look like someone who would kill themselves. And everyone laughed. I had respected my coach so I told him why I quit my senior year because I felt like it was right. Which then turned into them getting detention and other stuff and I never went to another high school basketball game again. Still love the sport probably more now. 

Anyway Idk how to go about this. I can text my other manager who I’m basically her favorite and try to go to the one person above him. But what if nothing comes from it. Idk it just hits home even though no one I know has committed suicide  I just never make jokes about it. I’m ok btw 

I just don’t find it funny and I think there should be repercussions joking about suicide but maybe I’m wrong. Maybe I’m over reacting.

Two weeks are up, Kris tells Joe that she’s found a new apartment. Unfortunately her new roommate is super allergic to cats.

TLDR: I was made uncomfortable by a lab technician and question if his behavior was normal.

Earlier I had to get some x-ray imaging done on my neck and back. After an hour wait I am called into the back of the office to start the process where I meet my lab technician ""Tech"". It was a busy day at the office and the changing rooms were occupied, so Tech tells me to head on directly to the imaging room to speed up the process (normally you change into those one-piece scrubs that open in the back). We have some small talk (the man incessantly tells me about his life while I stand there) and he begins to x-ray my neck - no problems. When it comes time for me to lay down and have my back imaged, Tech tells me to drop my pants to my knees and lay on the table. I'm fine with my body, so whatever, I go along with it. However, he stops talking to me and I can see his eyes wandering as I'm laying on the table in my underwear. I ask him why I have my pants down and he points to my zipper saying it will obstruct the x-ray of my spine, which I understand will probably happen. After I question Tech his demeanor changes and I am uncomfortable and getting angry at this point. Tech tells me to roll on my side, facing away from him, and he touches my hip and the side of my bum with his index finger. I pull up my pants a bit and he does not object, nor does he make eye contact with me for the rest of the imaging. After this I am ready to turn on Tech, but the process is done and I go on my way.

I am a relatively fit young guy with some martial arts training, so I was not worried about Tech physically. However, there were some children in the waiting room and the thought of Tech doing this to people who could not defend themselves is unacceptable to me. So my question is - was this normal lab technician behavior or was something fishy? Am I being paranoid? I don't think it would hurt to make a call about Tech's behavior, he could be making patients uncomfortable regularly, but I do not know what to do. If this is normal lab technician behavior I do not want to ruin Tech's career.",09Nov2018,1

Another issue is that the manager hired one of her nieces to work here and she’s incredibly lazy. She comes in and sits down(we’re not supposed to sit) and plays on her phone her entire shift. She also refuses to follow the dress code and wears her hair down and wear flip flops and shorts.

473,"Hey everyone. Let me just start off by saying how much I really appreciate this subreddit and the people in it. I'm looking for some advice on my current financial situation. I will start with what happened. 

I started using drugs heavily near the end of last year. I was making around $4.5k - $5k a month and able to support myself and my habit. On the side I started an online store that didnt cost much. Around May I quit my job and pulled out about $32k in personal loans with plans to focus mainly on my business(also had personal reasons to quit that I will not go into). Ended up wasting 3  to 4 months staying home or going out and being high. Fast forward to recently, I got a desk job getting paid $20/hour, I'm sober, and also starting a part time graveyard shift in 2 weeks
paying $15/hour. My online store just started making some sales but after ad costs its pretty much breaking even give or take a loss day or a gain day. That's not including the monthly platform fee and the yearly domain fee which averages to $100 a month.

I did the calculations and I've realized that even with this, I'm not making enough to pay all my bills. Here's a breakdown of my bills:
Utilities: $100. 
Internet:$40. 
Online store:$100. 
Car payments:$404. 
Medical loan:$200. 
Apartment rent:$1300. 
Monthly car gas:$200. 
Personal and business loans:$820. 
Credit card minimum payments:$150. 
Health insurance:$200. 
Phone bill:$80. 

This brings my monthly expenses(not including food) to $3594. After taxes, I do not make enough to pay everything. I'm 27 years old. Last month I paid rent with credit card so I wouldn't be late on any other payments. My car lease is up in February and I have another car but it's old and is going to break down soon. My apartment lease is up in February as well but I dont have any family that can help me with housing. I only have one friend that will let me rent a room near my parents house for $500. My parents live in a 55+ community and I've already tried living there and been reported by neighbors and kicked out. My dad is a pastor of a church with like 200 members and can not really help me out. He already has been helping me by paying my car insurance but not sure how long that will last. Credit score is 760 but dont think I can handle another loan. Done with that... My part time job is only seasonal so I probably won't have that income anymore and will go more in debt in January and February before my leases are up. I feel like I'm drowning in debt and suffocating.

I understand that everything I've done has put me in this situation and I completely take all the blame. I'm not looking for someone to give me a hug and tell me I didnt do anything wrong. I have not given up but there has been a lot going on personally and now on top of my personal problems I have these financial problems. I'm just out here looking to find the best of advice from experienced reddit friends that were in similar situations. Any positive advice is good.

474,"Basically, I was suffering from a cough for about 6 months.  It took 6 different doctors at multiple hospitals to diagnose it as cough-variant asthma.  I basically changed my primary care physician multiple times, because of the inability to figure out the cough.  The first several doctors just thought it was a cold and kept telling me to use nasal sprays, sinus rinses, etc. even though I was constantly hacking to the point that I couldn't breathe.  Another doctor prescribed me ventolin (an emergency inhaler) to take everyday every 4 hours.  I was not aware that this was an emergency inhaler that was supposed to be used sparingly.  I finally found a primary care physician which thought it was cough-variant asthma and basically got rid of the cough immediately.  

Before I got the correct diagnosis, I saw an ENT which put me on steroids for about 2 months.  I rapidly gained about 20 pounds within that time frame, became very sluggish and fatigued, completely lost my sex drive, have had horrible self-esteem, and I have not been able to lose the weight, no matter how hard I have tried.  Recently, I decided to ask my new doctor if I should get lab tests done because I have been feeling awful.  I got bloodwork done, it comes back that I am pre-diabetic and also have an adrenal insufficiency, likely Cushing syndrome.  I regularly get bloodwork, and have never had any of these issues before.  I have not been taking the steroids anymore (stopped about 4 months ago).  I had hoped that whatever symptoms they were causing would go back to normal by now.  But I knew I might not get off that easy.  I am supposed to teach my next class right now, and I am honestly feeling overwhelmed by all of this.  I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor on what to do next, but I am nervous as hell.  Any advice on how to treat these issues?  Is it possible that pre-diabetes could have been caused by the steroids or the sudden weight gain?  I have always tried to maintain a healthy lifestyle and it came as a shock, honestly.",09Nov2018,1

Last week I was in a coffee shop and the guy next to me offered me a newspaper which I declined, then changed my mind and accepted. Then he started talking to me. I felt like it was an intrusion because I was reading, but, to be polite I chatted back. I'm pretty outgoing and I tend to be interested in most people so I suppose I appeared pretty engaged. Turns out the dude was a retired teacher. Thing is, he was asking me questions at a rate of ten a minute. I actually made a joke about it. I was uncomfortable because, before I knew it I had answered questions about where I live, my family, what I do etc. I should mention that where we live is rural and it's not uncommon for people to be friendly and a bit nosey. 

Anyway, later that night I get a message on Facebook. That freaked me out, that he had looked me up. I mean, we talked for about five to seven minutes, no more. And it wasn't in anyway a deep or meaningful conversation. His account was open since 2012 but he had zero friends, which seems weird. His message was innocent enough, just 'I really enjoyed our conversation'. I didn't reply but I didn't block either. Tonight he messaged me again asking how he can sponsor me in this charity thing I'm doing.

Here's my question. Am I overreacting to be freaked out? I just find it so intrusive, like he has entered my space without being invited. I was creeped out going to sleep the other night. I have had bad experiences with men in the past so maybe that's it. But I don't know whether I'm being unduly suspicious, maybe the dude is just trying to make a new friend and I'm totally overreacting. Mine is a fear reaction, for sure.

Is romance and this predicament something I can talk to my school counsellor about or should I keep that away from him? Please help, I don't want her to hate me like she does right now.",09Nov2018,1
479,"The message reads: I'm literally living in my own filth and can't go anywhere because of my abusive boyfriend. So that's how I have been. Better delete this before he gets upset.

I did a Google/Facebook search. The best I can do is the location which is where I used to live a year ago without paying money to see who it currently is. 

I'd hate to ignore this and someone be in trouble...",09Nov2018,1
481,"I've never seen my dad this broken up. I don't know the best and clearest way to record it, but I'm going to call my gramps at the hospital tomorrow and see how much he can talk. He's in pain and tired, so I might not be able to get everything I would want, but I still want to try. 

What are some good things to ask him over the phone, and is there a good way to get him to talk about significant memories without flat-out telling him why?

The only question I have now is what is your favorite childhood memory, both in general and with my dad in it. ",09Nov2018,1
482,"I usually see her mondays to Thursdays when dropping off our kids to school because they're in the same kindergarten class. I'm a mom in my late 20s and she's an older lady in her 30s...at first she seemed friendly but she's been creeping me out recently. For example I haven't talked to her in a week, but instead of a normal hi how have you been she starts blurting out weird stuff like ""you're so pretty and so beautiful""...i was very uncomfortable. And she'd call my phone and hang up. She doesn't seem normal like the other moms? Thinking of blocking her on my phone, but can people tell if you block them, and in person should I just not make eye contact and pretend to read a book or something? I'm shy and don't like confrontations, but at the same time I don't want to put up with people that kinda disturb me",09Nov2018,1
483,"So backstory: my friend had been my friend since 2nd grade and we have a lot in common. She is now mad at me for ""trying to hard to be rude""?
I'm a rude person and I am a bitch but she's saying this isn't who i really am. I hate myself when I'm at home so at school I try to be a better person but I can't really break out of habits and this makes it seem like I'm trying. I feel like no one will accept me the way I am at home. I'm sorry this doesn't really make sense. I'm a bad person in my opinion. She's now gossiping about me and every time  I try to talk to her she's to busy. I finally got to talk yo her and we would continue talking after class but her other friend who she just met when school started tagged along and my friend wouldn't let me to talk because I ""needed to learn she has other friends"" i know it seems like I try to talk to her a lot but this is over the span of weeks. I try maybe twice a week. We were talking about something with her friend and she tells me ""I wasn't talking to you"" but we were all taking together (it was about the wind) I'm sorry I know this is put together very badly and I can't think straight. I want to just get over this as easily as she did but I can't for some reason! 

Sorry for grammar and spelling mistakes and if u have questions just ask...",09Nov2018,1

486,"Just finished 6th form and did well enough to apply to pretty much any uni I want, which is a good thing, kinda.

I decided to do a gap year and things are going quite well. I feel like now that I finished school the world has just opened up to me. I'm meeting new and exciting people, seeing different places of the world and just having a good time in general, you know? But my mum is making me feel like I'm ""bumming around"" and wasting my life. Like, how am I wasting my life? It's just began so why are you making me feel like I should ditch the best years of my life and throw myself to this capitalistic rat race we all live?

How should I deal with her? I am going to apply to Uni and hopefully go next year, not because of her, but because I want to. But this constant pair of eyes on my back judging me for living my life is really brining me down and making me second guess myself.

The question is, I ask you guys is how do I cope?",09Nov2018,1
487,"So I'm a very talkative, very extrovert-y person. I feel the constant need to talk to friends, and I usually act on that. I've never had a ""best"" friend, or any really close friends at that. Everytime I talk to someone it feels like I'm annoying them, but they don't say anything to avoid hurting my feelings. And I've really been getting those vibes recently. I have depression, and it hurts being lonely from being by myself, but it hurts more when my ""friends"" aren't all that friend-y. Do I cut them out of my life? That's what I thought the answer was, but I find it so hard. I constantly tab over to Discord, or check my phone for messages, etc. And I can't NOT talk to people, but as I said, when I try and feel like I'm annoying them, it hurts more than not talking to people at all. How do I go about it?",09Nov2018,1
490,"I met a friend of mine in college years ago. We hit it off and hung out for a good 7-9 years. 3 years ago was the last time we hung out. She had been distant and short with me since out last meet up and finally answer a text of mine when I confronted her about why she had been short with me. Basically she wanted time alone, said I had too many anxieties, and felt I was using her to vent to (which was absurd- we were very close and I always invited her out). At the point I said okay, if you need your space I understand and I also took her off my FB to alleviate any further bad feelings she had about our relationship.   


3 months ago I text her to see how she was. I said I understood if she did not want to answer nor did she have to feel obligated to. I wished her well. Never heard back and I questioned if she even received the text (maybe she changed her number)? Then, today I was told I should try to call and maybe she will want to talk. Nothing. She did not pick up. That is what I assumed. I guess my question is, has this ever happened to anyone else? I am not kidding, it is the absolute strangest thing. I KNOW I did not do anything wrong- I was always there when she needed someone to talk to, always called to see how she was doing, we went out 2 or 3 times a week sometimes to get lunch/dinner or hang. It was something totally out of the blue. My fiance thinks she got some bad advice from one of her trusted friends about me and went with it.  I am no longer interested in contacting her... at all. I am just confused.",09Nov2018,1
492,"I had this insecure friend who constantly made me feel like I had to dress and act a certain way to be around her. She’s a woman who wore nothing but men’s t-shirts from target and jeans everyday but shamed me for wearing crop tops, showing my cleavage and spaghetti straps. I’m a confident aspiring model so once she volunteered to be my photographer, she would shut down all my ideas and wouldn’t take any of my pictures unless they were done her way instead of getting and posting the pictures I wanted on social media. She later got mad and stopped talking to me because I was invited to hang out with another friend at an event she wasn’t invited to. Then she really disliked me for hanging out with people she had beef with but are still technically my friends since we always got along and never had any issues with each other. 

Would I be wrong for breaking ties with her? Are these the signs of a controlling friendship?",09Nov2018,1
493,"So, I've liked this girl since last year and I'm not sure what to do. On the one hand she has said that she doesn't want to date me, though this wasn't a 'rejection' as I hadn't asked her out and it was a response in an unrelated conversation we were having. On the other hand, she invited me to go see a movie with her which is very out of character for her as she tends to keep people distant, and during the movie she allowed me to get relatively close, which again is very out of character for her as she would get mad at anyone else who even bumped into her or had brief skin contact. It feels like I'm getting mixed messages.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I continue to have internal conflict on the matter, feeling like I have a chance sometimes, and that I don't have a chance others. There are also the times when I feel as if I'm pulling at straws to prove either that she does or doesn't like me, alternating between thinking that I'm taking thing out of context or that I'm somehow 100% right.

495,"I moved into an apartment complex about a month ago and my new downstairs neighbors moved in 2 weeks ago. I’ve lived in apartments before, I know the issues that come with them but when it becomes excessive and ruining my quality of life I like to come to trusty old reddit. 

So these people moved in, and they have been fighting non stop since day one. I figured it was stress because moving is hard but it’s her screaming and throwing shit while he just tries to calm her down. Every. Night. The police have been called on them (by someone downstairs and across from them that’s how loud it is) and nothing has come of that. I’ve stomped around 2am before and the girl came up and started threatening me at my door to come out and “face her” and threw out that I’m being racist because I’m white. 

But the issue that I’m having is the excessive weed smoking. I have a toddler, if I didn’t have a kid, this wouldn’t bother me. I don’t smoke because of personal reactions to it, not a fan, but I’m all for legalization. My husband doesn’t smoke because of his job. And obviously my 3 year old isn’t lighting up blunts whenever she gets a chance. Now I wouldn’t complain if we smelled it on occasion, like weekends or late nights but it’s all. The. Time. All the time. And I’m a stay at home mom so I’m constantly smelling skunk and it’s making me nauseous all day every day. I didn’t say anything but my kid started to notice and talk about how it “stinky” in some areas of the house. All day. It doesn’t smell outside so I know they’re not opening windows to at least air out what they’re smoking but it’s really affecting my happiness here. 

What can I do about this if anything? I don’t want to get the police involved. ",09Nov2018,1
